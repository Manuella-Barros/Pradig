The winner takes on Spain in the final on Sunday. AP\n\nEngland manager Gareth Southgate has led his country to a third semi-final in four major tournaments. Ahead of the last-four showdown against the Netherlands at Euro 2024, there has been mounting criticism of the Three Lions' boring football.\n\nShould England end a 58-year wait to win a major trophy on Sunday, supporters may not take umbrage with the team's style, or lack thereof, but the inability of such an array of attacking stars to excite has been stunning.\n\nEngland produced just five shots on target in 240 minutes of action against Switzerland and Slovakia in the prior two rounds, needing penalties and extra-time respectively.\n\nFormer England striker Alan Shearer called the team \"rotten\", while French Euro 2000 winner Emmanuel Petit labelled England \"boring\".\n\nTold his team was \"not easy on the eye\" by a reporter, Southgate produced an assortment of reasons.\n\n\"I'm sorry for that, but our intention is always to play well with the ball - in football you have an opponent that's trying to stop you,\" he said after the win over Switzerland.\n\n\"These are not normal football matches, these are national events with huge pressure, with really young men in the middle of it.\n\n\"Our team has been under enormous pressure from the start. They are doing so well.\"\n\nSouthgate pointed to the opponents using defensive formations and blamed the grass in Germany for hampering his players.\n\nAfter reaching the 2018 World Cup semi-finals and being beaten in the Euro 2020 final on penalties by Italy, England began this tournament as one of the favourites.\n\nSouthgate noted even Spain, who by contrast have dazzled this summer in Germany, modified their style to be more direct as they beat Germany in the quarter-finals.\n\nGoals flow for Dutch\n\nEngland now face a Dutch team whose five games have produced nearly double the number of goals as England's, despite playing 60 minutes less.\n\nIn Cody Gakpo and Wout Weghorst, Ronald Koeman's side have variety to create havoc, leading to hope of a more entertaining, higher-calibre clash.\n\nNetherlands' planned pre-match press conference was cancelled on Tuesday after the Dutch had their travel plans disrupted.\n\nThe team were due to travel to Dortmund from their base in Wolfsburg by train but were unable to do so due to a blockage on the line.\n\nInstead, the Dutch were forced to fly but were unable to fulfil their media duties.\n\n\"Due to disruption of the Netherlands' planned team travel to Dortmund, their arrival has been significantly delayed and therefore no press conference will take place,\" said a statement from the Dutch football association.\n\nSouthgate said he did not think the disruption would have any impact on the outcome of the semi-final.\n\n\"We don't play until 9pm (1900GMT) tomorrow. I'm sure they will still get dinner when they arrive,\" said Southgate at his own pre-match press conference.\n\n\"They've got plenty of time. I don't see it having any impact on the game.\"\n\nEngland's Harry Kane has endured an underwhelming tournament, far from the goal machine he proved in his first season at Bayern Munich.\n\nKane clearly is nowhere close to his physical peak and now must tussle with Liverpool defender Virgil van Dijk.\n\nThe Dutchman has not been at his best either but like his team, has improved in the knockouts.\n\nWith Southgate reluctant to take off his stars, keeping Kane marshalled could go a long way to stopping the somewhat limited threat England have thus far been capable of offering.\n\nDutch left vs England right\n\nGakpo is the joint-top scorer at the Euros with three goals and has been the Netherlands' key attacking threat.\n\nMost of their dangerous moves rely on his involvement at some point, but in England right-back Kyle Walker he faces a tough defender to get the better of.\n\nThe Manchester City man can match Gakpo for pace and Southgate will instruct Bukayo Saka to be diligent in his tracking back to help minimise the threat from the left flank.\n\nAt the other end, Saka faces off with a familiar foe in City's Nathan Ake, who has fared well against him at club level, but still names the England winger as one of his toughest opponents.\n\nSouthgate vs Koeman\n\nThe managers' substitutions may well play a vital role in the outcome of the game, as was evidenced in their quarter-final wins.\n\nSouthgate brought on Luke Shaw, Cole Palmer and others and England rapidly levelled against Switzerland with just 10 minutes to go.\n\nThree of Southgate's substitutes - Ivan Toney, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Palmer - also converted their penalties in England's 5-3 shoot-out win.\n\nKoeman, meanwhile, threw on Wout Weghorst with his team 1-0 down at half-time against Turkey and secured a 2-1 win.\n\nThe six-foot-six Burnley target man put the proverbial cat among the pigeons and is raring to do so again against England, where his club career hit a bump in the road.\n\nEuropean Championship record\n\nNetherlands have won the Euros only once - back in 1988 when Koeman was part of the Dutch playing XI.\n\nEngland's last major trophy came in 1966 in the form of the FIFA World Cup. They've not won a European Championship in their history. In 2021 they reached the final but were beaten by Italy on penalties.\n\nNetherlands vs England will kickoff at 9pm local time (1900 GMT) on 10 July (Wednesday). In India it will start at 12:30am IST on 11 July (Thursday).\n\nNetherlands vs England venue\n\nNetherlands vs England will be played at the BVB Stadion in Dortmund, Germany.\n\nHow to watch Netherlands vs England?\n\nNetherlands vs England in Euro 2024 will be broadcast live on Sony Sports Network and live streamed on SonyLiv app.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news",

The winner plays Spain or France in Sunday's final. Kickoff is at 9 p.m. local time (1900 GMT). Here's what to know about the match.\n\nMatch facts\n\n-- Both teams conceded the opening goal in their quarterfinals before coming back to win, with England beating Switzerland in a penalty shootout after a 1-1 draw and the Netherlands winning 2-1 against Turkey.\n\n-- After a win on penalties in his 100th game in charge of England, coach Gareth Southgate defending his often-cautious tactics as the kind of \"streetwise\" style successful teams use. The backlash from England fans, including some who threw plastic cups at him after a group-stage game, is \"quite difficult\" to deal with, he added.\n\n-- The Netherlands will be by far the highest-ranked team England has faced after group games with Serbia, Denmark and Slovenia, followed by knockout games with Slovakia and Switzerland.\n\n-- The referee for the game is Felix Zwayer, who once had ties to a match-fixing scandal in Germany. England midfielder Jude Bellingham was fined 40,000 euros ($43,400) in 2021 while playing for Borussia Dortmund for criticizing Zwayer.\n\n-- The Dutch endured some travel disruption on the way to Dortmund on Tuesday when their scheduled train journey from Wolfsburg was canceled because of what the team said was a \"blockage\" on the line. The squad had to fly instead, meaning the Netherlands' news conference with Ronald Koeman and defender Nathan Ak\u00e9 was called off.\n\nTeam news\n\n-- England has relied on the right-footed Kieran Trippier at left wing back, but his tendency to cut inside has meant England has made little use of the left wing all tournament. Left-footed Luke Shaw came off the bench against Switzerland for his first minutes since February after injury. Shaw says he's fit to start against the Netherlands if Southgate picks him, and the coach said Tuesday he had a tough decision to make.\n\n-- Southgate has to choose whether to stick with Ezri Konsa in the center of defense after he replaced the then-suspended Marc Gu\u00e9hi against Switzerland. Gu\u00e9hi is eligible again.\n\n-- There's scrutiny of Harry Kane's fitness after the England captain went off with cramp in extra time against Switzerland. Ivan Toney came off the bench and scored one of England's five successful penalties in the shootout.\n\n-- Netherlands coach Ronald Koeman could keep his lineup unchanged for the third game in a row, with Memphis Depay starting alongside Cody Gakpo and Steven Bergwijn up front.\n\nBy the numbers\n\n-- England has played a full hour more than the Netherlands in the last 10 days, after beating Slovakia in extra time and then Switzerland on penalties. The Dutch wrapped up their wins over Romania and Turkey without needing extra time.\n\n-- The Netherlands scored the opening goal in only one of its five games so far at Euro 2024, against Romania in the last 16. England last scored the opening goal against Denmark in the group stage.\n\n-- The Netherlands hasn't reached a European Championship final since it won the tournament in 1988 and was last a semifinalist in 2004.\n\n-- England's first shot on target against Switzerland was Bukayo Saka's goal to level the score in the 80th minute. One round earlier, Bellingham's spectacular overhead kick was England's first shot on target. That came in the fifth minute of second-half added time.\n\n-- Gakpo is the top-scoring player left at Euro 2024 with three goals. What was initially thought to be a fourth against Turkey was instead ruled to be an own-goal.

The winner plays Spain in Sunday's final. Kickoff is at noon PT. Here's what to know about the match.\n\n-- Both teams conceded the opening goal in their quarterfinals before coming back to win, with England beating Switzerland in a penalty shootout after a 1-1 draw and the Netherlands winning 2-1 against Turkey.\n\n-- After a win on penalties in his 100th game in charge of England, coach Gareth Southgate defending his often-cautious tactics as the kind of \"streetwise\" style successful teams use. The backlash from England fans, including some who threw plastic cups at him after a group-stage game, is \"quite difficult\" to deal with, he added.\n\n-- The Netherlands will be by far the highest-ranked team England has faced after group games with Serbia, Denmark and Slovenia, followed by knockout games with Slovakia and Switzerland.\n\n-- The referee for the game is Felix Zwayer, who once had ties to a match-fixing scandal in Germany. England midfielder Jude Bellingham was fined 40,000 euros ($43,400) in 2021 while playing for Borussia Dortmund for criticizing Zwayer.\n\n-- The Dutch endured some travel disruption on the way to Dortmund on Tuesday when their scheduled train journey from Wolfsburg was canceled because of what the team said was a \"blockage\" on the line. The squad had to fly instead, meaning the Netherlands' news conference with Ronald Koeman and defender Nathan Ak\u00e9 was called off.\n\n-- England has relied on the right-footed Kieran Trippier at left wing back, but his tendency to cut inside has meant England has made little use of the left wing all tournament. Left-footed Luke Shaw came off the bench against Switzerland for his first minutes since February after injury. Shaw says he's fit to start against the Netherlands if Southgate picks him, and the coach said Tuesday he had a tough decision to make.\n\n-- Southgate has to choose whether to stick with Ezri Konsa in the center of defense after he replaced the then-suspended Marc Gu\u00e9hi against Switzerland. Gu\u00e9hi is eligible again.\n\n-- There's scrutiny of Harry Kane's fitness after the England captain went off with cramp in extra time against Switzerland. Ivan Toney came off the bench and scored one of England's five successful penalties in the shootout.\n\n-- Netherlands coach Ronald Koeman could keep his lineup unchanged for the third game in a row, with Memphis Depay starting alongside Cody Gakpo and Steven Bergwijn up front.\n\n-- England has played a full hour more than the Netherlands in the last 10 days, after beating Slovakia in extra time and then Switzerland on penalties. The Dutch wrapped up their wins over Romania and Turkey without needing extra time.\n\n-- The Netherlands scored the opening goal in only one of its five games so far at Euro 2024, against Romania in the last 16. England last scored the opening goal against Denmark in the group stage.\n\n-- The Netherlands hasn't reached a European Championship final since it won the tournament in 1988 and was last a semifinalist in 2004.\n\n-- England's first shot on target against Switzerland was Bukayo Saka's goal to level the score in the 80th minute. One round earlier, Bellingham's spectacular overhead kick was England's first shot on target. That came in the fifth minute of second-half added time.\n\n-- Gakpo and Spain's Dani Olmo are the top-scoring players left at Euro 2024 with three goals. What was initially thought to be a fourth for Gakpo against Turkey was instead ruled to be an own-goal. Kane and Bellingham are England's top scorers with two.\n\n\"I don't really understand the criticism.

I've got a lot to thank him for because he showed a lot of faith and trust in picking me when he didn't have to.\" -- England defender Luke Shaw on manager Gareth Southgate.\n\n\"You're now into that moment of the tournament where it's what's possible, what's achievable rather than what might go wrong.

The winner plays Spain or France in Sunday's final. Kickoff is at 9 p.m. local time (1900 GMT). Here's what to know about the match.\n\nMatch facts\n\n-- Both teams conceded the opening goal in their quarterfinals before coming back to win, with England beating Switzerland in a penalty shootout after a 1-1 draw and the Netherlands winning 2-1 against Turkey.\n\n-- After a win on penalties in his 100th game in charge of England, manager Gareth Southgate defending his often-cautious tactics as the kind of \"streetwise\" style successful teams use. The backlash from England fans, including some who threw plastic cups at him after a group-stage game, is \"quite difficult\" to deal with, he added.\n\n-- The Netherlands will be by far the highest-ranked team England has faced after group games with Serbia, Denmark and Slovenia, followed by knockout games with Slovakia and Switzerland.\n\n-- The referee for the game is Felix Zwayer, who once had ties to a match-fixing scandal in Germany. England midfielder Jude Bellingham was fined 40,000 euros ($43,400) in 2021 while playing for Borussia Dortmund for criticizing Zwayer.\n\nTeam news\n\n-- England has relied on the right-footed Kieran Trippier at left wing back, but his tendency to cut inside has meant England has made little use of the left wing all tournament. Left-footed Luke Shaw came off the bench against Switzerland for his first minutes since February after injury. Shaw says he's fit to start against the Netherlands if Southgate picks him.\n\n-- Southgate has to choose whether to stick with Ezri Konsa in the center of defense after he replaced the then-suspended Marc Gu\u00e9hi against Switzerland. Gu\u00e9hi is eligible again.\n\n-- There's scrutiny of Harry Kane's fitness after the England captain went off with cramp in extra time against Switzerland. Ivan Toney came off the bench and scored one of England's five successful penalties in the shootout.\n\n-- Netherlands coach Ronald Koeman could keep his lineup unchanged for the third game in a row, with Memphis Depay starting alongside Cody Gakpo and Steven Bergwijn up front.\n\nBy the numbers\n\n-- England has played a full hour more than the Netherlands in the last 10 days, after beating Slovakia in extra time and then Switzerland on penalties. The Dutch wrapped up their wins over Romania and Turkey without needing extra time.\n\n-- The Netherlands scored the opening goal in only one of its five games so far at Euro 2024, against Romania in the last 16. England last scored the opening goal against Denmark in the group stage.\n\n-- The Netherlands hasn't reached a European Championship final since it won the tournament in 1988 and was last a semifinalist in 2004.\n\n-- England's first shot on target against Switzerland was Bukayo Saka's goal to level the score in the 80th minute. One round earlier, Bellingham's spectacular overhead kick was England's first shot on target. That came in the fifth minute of second-half added time.\n\n-- Dutch forward Gakpo is the top-scoring player left at Euro 2024 with three goals. What was initially thought to be a fourth against Turkey was instead ruled to be an own-goal. Kane and Bellingham are England's top scorers with two.\n\nWhat they're saying\n\n\"I don't really understand the criticism. What he's done for the country, for us as players as well, he really took us to the next level ... I've got a lot to thank him for because he showed a lot of faith and trust in picking me when he didn't have to.\" -- England defender Luke Shaw on manager Gareth Southgate.\n\n\"Hopefully it's us that will have the ball more than England.

The winner plays Spain or France in Sunday's final.\n\nKick-off is at 9 pm local time 1900 GMT, 12.30 am (Thursday). Here's what to know about the match.\n\nBoth teams conceded the opening goal in their quarterfinals before coming back to win, with England beating Switzerland in a penalty shootout after a 1-1 draw and the Netherlands winning 2-1 against Turkey.\n\nAfter a win on penalties in his 100th game in charge of England, manager Gareth Southgate defended his often-cautious tactics as the kind of 'streetwise' style successful teams use. The backlash from England fans, including some who threw plastic cups at him after a group-stage game, is 'quite difficult' to deal with, he added.\n\nThe Netherlands will be by far the highest-ranked team England has faced after group games with Serbia, Denmark and Slovenia, followed by knockout games with Slovakia and Switzerland.\n\nThe referee for the game is Felix Zwayer, who once had ties to a match-fixing scandal in Germany. England midfielder Jude Bellingham was fined 40,000 euros (USD 43,400) in 2021 while playing for Borussia Dortmund for criticizing Zwayer.\n\nTeam news\n\nEngland has relied on the right-footed Kieran Trippier at left wing-back, but his tendency to cut inside has meant England has made little use of the left-wing all tournament. Left-footed Luke Shaw came off the bench against Switzerland for his first minutes since February after injury. Shaw says he's fit to start against the Netherlands if Southgate picks him.\n\nSouthgate has to choose whether to stick with Ezri Konsa in the centre of defence after he replaced the then-suspended Marc Gu\u00e9hi against Switzerland. Gu\u00e9hi is eligible again.\n\nThere's scrutiny of Harry Kane's fitness after the England captain went off with a cramp in extra time against Switzerland. Ivan Toney came off the bench and scored one of England's five successful penalties in the shootout.\n\nNetherlands coach Ronald Koeman could keep his lineup unchanged for the third game in a row, with Memphis Depay starting alongside Cody Gakpo and Steven Bergwijn up front.\n\nBy the numbers\n\nEngland has played a full hour more than the Netherlands in the last 10 days, after beating Slovakia in extra time and then Switzerland on penalties. The Dutch wrapped up their wins over Romania and Turkey without needing extra time.\n\nThe Netherlands scored the opening goal in only one of its five games so far at Euro 2024, against Romania in the pre-quarterfinals. England last scored the opening goal against Denmark in the group stage.\n\nAlso Read: Euro 2024: Battle for glory! Four European powerhouses vie for final berth\n\nThe Netherlands hasn't reached a European Championship final since it won the tournament in 1988 and was last a semi-finalist in 2004.\n\nEngland's first shot on target against Switzerland was Bukayo Saka's goal to level the score in the 80th minute. A round earlier, Bellingham's spectacular overhead kick was England's first shot on target. That came in the fifth minute of second-half added time.\n\nDutch forward Gakpo is the top-scoring player left at Euro 2024 with three goals. What was initially thought to be a fourth against Turkey was instead ruled to be an own goal. Kane and Bellingham are England's top scorers with two.\n\nWhat they're saying\n\n\"I don't really understand the criticism. What he's done for the country, for us as players as well, he really took us to the next level ... I've got a lot to thank him for because he showed a lot of faith and trust in picking me when he didn't have to.\" - England defender Luke Shaw on manager Gareth Southgate.", "source": {"uri":

The winner plays Spain or France in Sunday's final. Kickoff is at 9 p.m. local time (1900 GMT). Here's what to know about the match.\n\nMatch facts\n\n-- Both teams conceded the opening goal in their quarterfinals before coming back to win, with England beating Switzerland in a penalty shootout after a 1-1 draw and the Netherlands winning 2-1 against Turkiye.\n\n-- After a win on penalties in his 100th game in charge of England, manager Gareth Southgate defending his often-cautious tactics as the kind of \"streetwise\" style successful teams use. The backlash from England fans, including some who threw plastic cups at him after a group-stage game, is \"quite difficult\" to deal with, he added.\n\n-- The Netherlands will be by far the highest-ranked team England has faced after group games with Serbia, Denmark and Slovenia, followed by knockout games with Slovakia and Switzerland.\n\n-- The referee for the game is Felix Zwayer, who once had ties to a match-fixing scandal in Germany. England midfielder Jude Bellingham was fined 40,000 euros ($43,400) in 2021 while playing for Borussia Dortmund for criticizing Zwayer.\n\nTeam news\n\n-- England has relied on the right-footed Kieran Trippier at left wing back, but his tendency to cut inside has meant England has made little use of the left wing all tournament. Left-footed Luke Shaw came off the bench against Switzerland for his first minutes since February after injury. Shaw says he's fit to start against the Netherlands if Southgate picks him.\n\n-- Southgate has to choose whether to stick with Ezri Konsa in the center of defense after he replaced the then-suspended Marc Gu\u00e9hi against Switzerland. Gu\u00e9hi is eligible again.\n\n-- There's scrutiny of Harry Kane's fitness after the England captain went off with cramp in extra time against Switzerland. Ivan Toney came off the bench and scored one of England's five successful penalties in the shootout.\n\n-- Netherlands coach Ronald Koeman could keep his lineup unchanged for the third game in a row, with Memphis Depay starting alongside Cody Gakpo and Steven Bergwijn up front.\n\nBy the numbers\n\n-- England has played a full hour more than the Netherlands in the last 10 days, after beating Slovakia in extra time and then Switzerland on penalties. The Dutch wrapped up their wins over Romania and Turkiye without needing extra time.\n\n-- The Netherlands scored the opening goal in only one of its five games so far at Euro 2024, against Romania in the last 16. England last scored the opening goal against Denmark in the group stage.\n\n-- The Netherlands hasn't reached a European Championship final since it won the tournament in 1988 and was last a semifinalist in 2004.\n\n-- England's first shot on target against Switzerland was Bukayo Saka's goal to level the score in the 80th minute. One round earlier, Bellingham's spectacular overhead kick was England's first shot on target. That came in the fifth minute of second-half added time.\n\n-- Dutch forward Gakpo is the top-scoring player left at Euro 2024 with three goals. What was initially thought to be a fourth against Turkiye was instead ruled to be an own-goal. Kane and Bellingham are England's top scorers with two.\n\nWhat they're saying\n\n\"I don't really understand the criticism. What he's done for the country, for us as players as well, he really took us to the next level ... I've got a lot to thank him for because he showed a lot of faith and trust in picking me when he didn't have to.\" -- England defender Luke Shaw on manager Gareth Southgate.\n\n\"Hopefully it's us that will have the ball more than England. So it's more England that's running. I expect a high intensity game.\" -- Netherlands defender Micky van de Ven.", "source": {"uri": "arab.news", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arab News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

(Reuters) England manager Gareth Southgate believes his side have been freed up by edging closer to a first ever major final on foreign soil at Euro 2024 after struggling to deal with the weight of expectation earlier in the tournament.\n\nThe Three Lions arrived in Germany as one of the favourites thanks to a richly-talented squad and an upturn in their fortunes under Southgate. England are into a third semi-final in four tournaments, where they will face the Netherlands in Dortmund today.\n\nBut they have never reached a final outside of England or won the European Championship before.\n\nSouthgate's men have been heavily criticised for their performances at Euro 2024, where they have won only one of their five games in 90 minutes.\n\nBut he said his players showed signs of what they are capable of in a quarter-final win over Switzerland on penalties after needing a late Bukayo Saka equaliser to send the game to extra time.\n\n\"One of our strengths over the last eight years has been less fear, less inhibition but at the beginning the expectation weighed heavily,\" said Southgate at his pre-match press conference on Tuesday.\n\n\"We couldn't quite get ourselves in the right place and in the end what was impressive was the players ground results out.\n\n\"Now we are into that moment in the tournament where it is what is possible? What is achievable? Rather than, what could go wrong?\n\n\"That is different for a player. This is now the chance to make history, first time to make a final not held in England. We are trying to break new ground and that is difficult, but the players have responded brilliantly.\"\n\nEngland's only previous European Championship final was three years ago when they missed out agonisingly on penalties to Italy at Wembley.\n\nHarry Kane has been captain for almost the entirety of the Southgate era in charge and believes his side can lean on that experience against a Dutch side in their first Euros semi-final since 2004.\n\n\"We've got a lot of players who have experienced big games at international and club level,\" said Bayern Munich striker Kane.\n\n\"You use that experience over the course of your career to prepare the best way possible to control nerves and excitement tomorrow night will be not different.\n\n\"We had a goal, a target of what we think it is achievable and step-by-step we've been getting closer to that target.\n\n\"We've got ourselves in a great spot and we've got a big game to reach back-to-back finals in the European Championships which would be an amazing achievement.\"\n\nSouthgate has all of his 26-man squad available with Luke Shaw pushing for his first start of the tournament. The Manchester United left-back made his first appearance for club or country since February as a substitute against the Swiss.\n\nMarc Guehi looks set to return from suspension in place of Ezri Konsa, but Southgate looks set to stick with the 3-4-2-1 formation he used in the quarter-final.\n\nNetherlands hit by travel chaos ahead of semi\n\nThe Netherlands' planned pre-match press conference ahead of today's Euro 2024 semi-final against England was cancelled on Tuesday after the Dutch had their travel plans disrupted.\n\nRonald Koeman's men were due to travel to Dortmund from their base in Wolfsburg by train but were unable to do so due to a blockage on the line. Instead, the Dutch were forced to fly but were unable to fulfil their media duties due to their late arrival.\n\n\"Due to disruption of the Netherlands' planned team travel to Dortmund, their arrival has been significantly delayed and therefore no press conference will take place,\" said a statement from the Dutch football association.\n\nEngland boss Gareth Southgate said he did not think the disruption would have any impact on the outcome of the semi-final.\n\n\"We don't play until 9pm (1900GMT) tomorrow. I'm sure they will still get dinner when they arrive,\" said Southgate at his own pre-match press conference.\n\n\"They've got plenty of time. I don't see it having any impact on the game.\"\n\nFrom Koeman's free-kick to Euro 96: Five Netherlands v England clashes\n\nThe Netherlands and England meet in the last four of Euro 2024 today with both teams eyeing a place in this weekend's final in Berlin. There was a time when the two nations met regularly on the international stage, but the match in Dortmund will be just the second competitive game between the sides this century. AFP Sport looks back at their most notable past encounters:\n\nVan Basten hat-trick: The 1988 European Championship remains the only major international tournament that the Netherlands have won, and will always be remembered for Marco van Basten's stunning goal in the final against the Soviet Union. It also remains a low point for England, the only time in which they have gone to a major tournament and lost every game. Both sides lost their opening match before they clashed in Duesseldorf in the group phase, and the Dutch came out on top thanks to a Van Basten hat-trick. England had chances, with Gary Lineker and Glenn Hoddle both hitting the post. Van Basten's opener for the Netherlands was cancelled out by a Bryan Robson equaliser just after half-time, but two goals in five second-half minutes allowed Van Basten to complete his hat-trick and sealed a 3-1 Dutch win.\n\nDraw at Italia 90: The nations were again drawn in the same group at the 1990 World Cup in Italy, and many of the players involved in 1988 again featured in this meeting in Cagliari, among them current Dutch boss Ronald Koeman. The sides had each drawn their opening match, with England being held by Ireland and the Netherlands by Egypt. This time England kept Van Basten quiet in a 0-0 draw, and it was England who would top the group on the way to reaching the semi-finals. The Dutch, meanwhile, were beaten by West Germany in the last 16.\n\nEngland miss out on USA 94: England have failed to qualify for just one World Cup since the 1970s, and it was the Netherlands who denied them a place at USA 94. Graham Taylor's England had a poor campaign, taking just one point from two games against Norway, who topped the group. They squandered a two-goal lead at home to the Dutch at Wembley, but when they went to Rotterdam for the return fixture - their penultimate game in the group - England still had qualification in their own hands as they were above the Dutch. With Paul Gascoigne suspended, England fell behind to a free-kick just after the hour mark by Koeman - who the visitors felt should have been sent off earlier on - before Dennis Bergkamp sealed a 2-0 Dutch win. England beat San Marino in their final game but a Dutch win in Poland ensured they qualified instead. It was a disastrous campaign for Taylor, captured in a warts-and-all TV documentary. Taylor later resigned, while the Dutch reached the World Cup quarter-finals.\n\nShearer, Sheringham double act: The nations met again in the group stage at Euro 96. Both teams had taken four points from their first two matches before clashing at Wembley, where Alan Shearer opened the scoring with a penalty and added another goal early in the second half, in between a brace by Teddy Sheringham. Patrick Kluivert's late goal for the Dutch made the final score 4-1 as England - who had current boss Gareth Southgate in defence - won the group and the Netherlands squeezed through in second place ahead of Scotland. The Dutch lost on penalties to France in the last eight, while England were beaten in a shoot-out in the semi-finals by Germany, with Southgate missing the crucial kick.\n\nDutch win Nations League semi: The only competitive meeting of the teams since Euro 96 came in the semi-finals of the inaugural UEFA Nations League in 2019. Southgate was already England's manager and Koeman was in his first spell as Dutch coach as the teams clashed in Guimaraes, Portugal. Marcus Rashford put England ahead from a penalty but Matthijs de Ligt levelled, taking the game to extra time.\n\nKyle Walker's own goal gave the Dutch the lead and Quincy Promes sealed a 3-1 victory for the Netherlands, who would lose the final to hosts Portugal.", "source": {"uri": "gulf-times.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gulf-Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The winner plays Spain or France in Sunday's final.\n\nKick-off is at 9 pm local time (1900 GMT, 12.30 am [Thursday]). Here's what to know about the match.\n\nAlso Read | Is Urvashi Rautela Dating Anyone? Actress Has THIS To Declare Amidst Her Linkup Rumours With Cricketer Rishabh Pant and Footballer Karim Benzema (LatestLY Exclusive).\n\nAlso Read | Will Kylian Mbappe Play Tonight in Spain vs France UEFA Euro 2024 Semifinal Match? Here's the Possibility of French Star Featuring in Starting XI.\n\nMatch facts\n\n-- Both teams conceded the opening goal in their quarterfinals before coming back to win, with England beating Switzerland in a penalty shootout after a 1-1 draw and the Netherlands winning 2-1 against Turkey.\n\n-- After a win on penalties in his 100th game in charge of England, manager Gareth Southgate defended his often-cautious tactics as the kind of \"streetwise\" style successful teams use. The backlash from England fans, including some who threw plastic cups at him after a group-stage game, is \"quite difficult\" to deal with, he added.\n\n-- The Netherlands will be by far the highest-ranked team England has faced after group games with Serbia, Denmark and Slovenia, followed by knockout games with Slovakia and Switzerland.\n\n-- The referee for the game is Felix Zwayer, who once had ties to a match-fixing scandal in Germany. England midfielder Jude Bellingham was fined 40,000 euros (USD 43,400) in 2021 while playing for Borussia Dortmund for criticizing Zwayer.\n\nTeam news\n\n-- England has relied on the right-footed Kieran Trippier at left wing-back, but his tendency to cut inside has meant England has made little use of the left-wing all tournament. Left-footed Luke Shaw came off the bench against Switzerland for his first minutes since February after injury. Shaw says he's fit to start against the Netherlands if Southgate picks him.\n\n-- Southgate has to choose whether to stick with Ezri Konsa in the centre of defence after he replaced the then-suspended Marc Gu\u00e9hi against Switzerland. Gu\u00e9hi is eligible again.\n\n-- There's scrutiny of Harry Kane's fitness after the England captain went off with a cramp in extra time against Switzerland. Ivan Toney came off the bench and scored one of England's five successful penalties in the shootout.\n\n-- Netherlands coach Ronald Koeman could keep his lineup unchanged for the third game in a row, with Memphis Depay starting alongside Cody Gakpo and Steven Bergwijn up front.\n\nBy the numbers\n\n-- England has played a full hour more than the Netherlands in the last 10 days, after beating Slovakia in extra time and then Switzerland on penalties. The Dutch wrapped up their wins over Romania and Turkey without needing extra time.\n\n-- The Netherlands scored the opening goal in only one of its five games so far at Euro 2024, against Romania in the pre-quarterfinals. England last scored the opening goal against Denmark in the group stage.\n\n-- The Netherlands hasn't reached a European Championship final since it won the tournament in 1988 and was last a semi-finalist in 2004.\n\n-- England's first shot on target against Switzerland was Bukayo Saka's goal to level the score in the 80th minute. A round earlier, Bellingham's spectacular overhead kick was England's first shot on target. That came in the fifth minute of second-half added time.\n\n-- Dutch forward Gakpo is the top-scoring player left at Euro 2024 with three goals. What was initially thought to be a fourth against Turkey was instead ruled to be an own goal. Kane and Bellingham are England's top scorers with two.\n\nWhat they're saying\n\n\"I don't really understand the criticism. What he's done for the country, for us as players as well, he really took us to the next level ... I've got a lot to thank him for because he showed a lot of faith and trust in picking me when he didn't have to.\" -- England defender Luke Shaw on manager Gareth Southgate.\n\n\"Hopefully, it's us that will have the ball more than England. So it's more England that's running. I expect a high-intensity game.\" -- Netherlands defender Micky van de Ven.

The Netherlands emerged victorious 3-1 after extra time in their Nations League clash in 2019. Given their history, it wouldn't be surprising if this highly-anticipated encounter went the distance again; five of their last eight meetings have ended in a draw after 90 minutes.\n\nThe Netherlands secured their first EURO semi-final appearance since 2004 by defeating T\u00fcrkiye. England, meanwhile, have reached this stage for the second consecutive tournament.\n\nHere's a preview and prediction for the Euro 2024 semi-final between the Netherlands and England, set to take place on Thursday in Dortmund.\n\nRead More: Portugal's New Penalty Hero: Decoding Diogo Costa's Record-Breaking Saves\n\nEngland have stumbled through Euro 2024, but they've still managed to reach another semi-final.\n\nFor the third time at a major tournament under Gareth Southgate, the Three Lions have made it to the last four. Since the start of the 2018 World Cup, the only competition in which they failed to reach this stage was the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.\n\nNow, standing in their way of a consecutive Euros final are the Netherlands.\n\nRonald Koeman's side was unconvincing in the group stage but have found their form in the knockout rounds. Unlike their opponents in Dortmund on Wednesday, the Netherlands have hit their stride in the knockouts.\n\nEngland needed extra time and a stunning goal from Jude Bellingham to overcome Slovakia, then relied on perfect penalty kicks and a crucial save from Jordan Pickford to defeat Switzerland. In contrast, the Netherlands defeated Romania 3-0 and Turkey 2-1 within 90 minutes.\n\nEngland have gone to extra time in both of their knockout matches so far. Only Portugal at Euro 2016, and Spain and Italy at Euro 2020, have ever gone to extra time three times in a single edition of the finals.\n\nWhile Southgate has faced criticism for England's performances in Germany, his major tournament record is impressive.\n\nFrom 1996 to 2018, England went 22 years without reaching a semi-final. Since then, they've made it to the final four three times, including their World Cup run in Russia six years ago.\n\nAfter 65 years without reaching a men's final, England is now on the verge of back-to-back appearances in a major tournament's biggest event. Only five teams have reached consecutive Euro finals: USSR (1960/1964), Germany (1972/1976, 1976/1980, 1992/1996), and Spain (2008/2012).\n\nThis marks England's fourth appearance in the semi-finals of the European Championship. They were eliminated in the first two in 1968 (vs Yugoslavia) and 1996 (vs Germany). At Euro 2020, they reached the final after defeating Denmark 2-1 but lost on penalties to Italy at Wembley.\n\nBukayo Saka redeemed his 2021 penalty miss with a composed effort in the shootout against Switzerland and forced extra time with a superb strike. He is likely to start on the right again despite recent discussions about moving him to the left, especially with Luke Shaw returning from the bench in the quarter-finals.\n\nFor the Netherlands, this will be their sixth Euros semi-final. They have lost their last four, with their only victory in 1988 when they went on to win the tournament. Marco van Basten scored one of the most famous goals in Euros history in that final in Munich.\n\nThis is the Netherlands' first Euros semi-final since 2004 when they lost 2-1 to host nation Portugal. Back then, there were only 16 teams in the competition, making the path to the semi-finals shorter than it is now.\n\nThis marks the fourth encounter between England and the Netherlands at a major tournament. The Oranje triumphed 3-1 at Euro 88, thanks to a Van Basten hat-trick, followed by a goalless draw at the 1990 World Cup, and a 4-1 England victory at Euro 96.\n\nAmong all the nations England have faced 20+ times in their history, only against Brazil (15%) do they have a lower win rate than against the Netherlands (27% - W6 D9 L7).\n\nIn fact, England have won just one of their last nine meetings with the Netherlands in all competitions (D4 L4), with their sole victory being a 1-0 friendly match in Amsterdam in March 2018.\n\nThe Netherlands have one spot in their attack up for grabs as they prepare to face England in the Euro 2024 semi-finals.\n\nWout Weghorst is making a strong case to lead the line after another impressive performance off the bench in the Dutch victory over Turkey.\n\nSteven Bergwijn has struggled in his recent starts on the right flank, making way for Jeremie Frimpong and Donyell Malen, who has had a mixed Euros highlighted by two late goals against Romania in the last-16.\n\nRonald Koeman has used Weghorst, who is still under contract with Burnley, as a super-sub in Germany. However, there are increasing calls for him to start, especially with a place in the final at stake.\n\nStarting Weghorst would allow Memphis Depay to play in a free role behind the striker and move Xavi Simons to the right wing, while Cody Gakpo looks to continue his strong form on the left.\n\nJoey Veerman began the tournament in the Netherlands' starting XI but has since been replaced by AC Milan's Tijjani Reijnders and PSV Eindhoven's Jerdy Schouten.\n\nThe Dutch have a settled defense with Virgil van Dijk and Stefan de Vrij preferred over Matthijs de Ligt and Micky van de Ven. The Tottenham defender has been used as a substitute left-back for Nathan Ake in all four of his appearances at the Euros.\n\nDenzel Dumfries will provide pace and power from the right-back position, and Brighton's Bart Verbruggen is set to continue in goal.\n\nGareth Southgate faces a crucial decision on whether Luke Shaw is ready to start England's semi-final against the Netherlands as their Euro 2024 campaign nears its climax.\n\nSouthgate's team has reached their third semi-final in the last four tournaments and is just one win away from becoming the first England men's team to reach a major final overseas.\n\nShaw made his long-awaited return from a hamstring injury as a substitute during the dramatic quarter-final victory over Switzerland. He played nearly 45 minutes without issues after the match extended to penalties.\n\nThe Manchester United star is the only specialist left-back in Southgate's squad. The Three Lions boss must decide whether Shaw is ready for his first start in five months against the Dutch in Dortmund or if Kieran Trippier will continue as his deputy.\n\nShaw has expressed his readiness to start, but the final decision is yet to be made.\n\nAdditionally, Crystal Palace center-back Marc Guehi is available again after suspension and is likely to replace Ezri Konsa, though Konsa performed well against the Swiss and also has chances to start.\n\nSouthgate's other significant decision is whether to use a back three or back four. England switched to a wing-back system against Switzerland, producing arguably their best performance of the tournament. However, since the Dutch play with a back four, Southgate might consider matching Ronald Koeman's side.\n\nEngland clearly possess more talent and experience in these games. Southgate highlighted this after the win over Switzerland, and it should play a significant role here.\n\nWhile England's defense has been stellar, they struggle to finish off opponents and appear vulnerable to counter-attacks when they take risks.\n\nHowever, the Dutch have their own issues. Their defense can be slow and ponderous, they've lacked midfield control, and they lack a killer touch in attack. Nonetheless, they can be dangerous with crosses, quick interchanges, and long-range shots.\n\nThis is expected to be a tight game that could go the distance, but England's knowhow and quality might pull them through.\n\nPrediction: England to win on penalties.\n\nUEFA Euro 2024 matches will be broadcast live on Sony Sports channels: Sony Sports Ten 2, Sony Sports Ten 2 HD, Sony Sports Ten 3, Sony Sports Ten 3 HD, Sony Sports Ten 4, Sony Sports Ten 4 HD, Sony Sports Ten 5, and Sony Sports Ten 5 HD in India.

That is different for a player, an athlete,\" said Southgate, speaking about the mentality the team would need to get by the Dutch.\n\nEngland have played one hour more than their Dutch counterparts, and defender Micky van de Ven is hoping the latter can take advantage of that.\n\n\"Hopefully, it's us that will have the ball more than England.

The Dutch wrapped up their wins over Romania and Turkey without needing extra time.\n\n- The Netherlands scored the opening goal in only one of its five games so far at Euro 2024, against Romania in the last 16. England last scored the opening goal against Denmark in the group stage.\n\n- The Netherlands hasn't reached a European Championship final since it won the tournament in 1988 and was last a semifinalist in 2004.\n\n- England's first shot on target against Switzerland was Bukayo Saka's goal to level the score in the 80th minute. One round earlier, Bellingham's spectacular overhead kick was England's first shot on target. That came in the fifth minute of second-half added time.\n\n- Gakpo is the top-scoring player left at Euro 2024 with three goals.

England aims for back-to-back European Championship finals when it meets the Netherlands in Dortmund in the second semifinal of Euro 2024. The winner will play Spain in Sunday's final. Kickoff is at 9 p.m. local time or 2 a.m. on Friday Jakarta time.\n\nBoth teams conceded the opening goal in their quarterfinals before coming back to win. England defeated Switzerland in a penalty shootout after a 1-1 draw, while the Netherlands won 2-1 against Turkey.\n\nAfter a win on penalties in his 100th game in charge of England, coach Gareth Southgate defended his often-cautious tactics as the kind of \"streetwise\" style successful teams use. The backlash from England fans, including some who threw plastic cups at him after a group-stage game, is \"quite difficult\" to deal with, he added.\n\n\"I don't really understand the criticism. What he's done for the country, for us as players as well, he really took us to the next level ... I've got a lot to thank him for because he showed a lot of faith and trust in picking me when he didn't have to,\" England defender Luke Shaw said about manager Gareth Southgate\n\nThe Netherlands will be by far the highest-ranked team England has faced after group games with Serbia, Denmark, and Slovenia, followed by knockout games with Slovakia and Switzerland.\n\nThe referee for the game is Felix Zwayer, who once had ties to a match-fixing scandal in Germany. England midfielder Jude Bellingham was fined 40,000 euros ($43,400) in 2021 while playing for Borussia Dortmund for criticizing Zwayer.\n\nEngland has relied on the right-footed Kieran Trippier at left wing-back, but his tendency to cut inside has meant England has made little use of the left wing all tournament. Left-footed Luke Shaw came off the bench against Switzerland for his first minutes since February after injury. Shaw says he's fit to start against the Netherlands if Southgate picks him, and the coach said Tuesday he had a tough decision to make.\n\nSouthgate has to choose whether to stick with Ezri Konsa in the center of defense after he replaced the then-suspended Marc Gu\u00e9hi against Switzerland. Gu\u00e9hi is eligible again. There's scrutiny of Harry Kane's fitness after the England captain went off with a cramp in extra time against Switzerland. Ivan Toney came off the bench and scored one of England's five successful penalties in the shootout.\n\nNetherlands coach Ronald Koeman could keep his lineup unchanged for the third game in a row, with Memphis Depay starting alongside Cody Gakpo and Steven Bergwijn up front.\n\n\"Hopefully it's us that will have the ball more than England. So it's more England that's running. I expect a high-intensity game,\" Netherlands defender Micky van de Ven said.\n\nThe Netherlands hasn't reached a European Championship final since it won the tournament in 1988 and was last a semifinalist in 2004.\n\nGakpo and Spain's Dani Olmo are the top-scoring players left at Euro 2024 with three goals. What was initially thought to be a fourth for Gakpo against Turkey was instead ruled to be an own-goal. Kane and Bellingham are England's top scorers with two.

The quarter-final win saw England advance to the semi-finals, with Netherlands the chosen opposition after their 2-1 win over Turkey.\n\nIt was still far from the best England performance we've ever seen, but there were lots of positives to take from the quarter-final win, including the return of Luke Shaw who is in contention to start in Dortmund tonight. If Gareth Southgate's side win, they will take on Spain in the Euro 2024 final after they beat France 2-1 in the other semi-final clash.\n\nSo how could England fare against the Dutch later today? Let's take a look...\n\nREAD MORE: Euro 2024 news as England star speaks out after Liverpool ace told he should be 'disappointed'\n\nREAD MORE: England handed Euro 2024 ban as Gary Lineker warns players about Netherlands penalty tactic\n\nWe simulated Netherlands vs England to get a score prediction\n\nTo complete this simulation, we used the EA FC 24 Euro 2024 game mode and updated the squads with the latest injuries and suspensions.\n\nWe predict that the Netherlands could set up in a 4-2-3-1 formation, with their line-up as follows: Verbruggen; Dumfries, De Vrij, Van Dijk, Ake; Reijnders, Schouten; Bergwijn, Simons, Gakpo; Depay.\n\nWe predict that England could line up in a 3-4-2-1 formation, with their starting XI as follows: Pickford; Walker, Stones, Konsa; Saka, Mainoo, Rice, Shaw; Bellingham, Foden; Kane.\n\nIt was a shaky start by England in Dortmund, with the Netherlands seeing more of the ball and creating more chances in the opening stages of the game. A long-range strike from Memphis Depay stung the gloves of Jordan Pickford early on, and the Dutch should've been one goal ahead when Virgil van Dijk rattled the post with a header from a corner.\n\nSouthgate's side failed to register a shot on target in the first half, and the Netherlands came close once again before the break when Cody Gakpo powered a shot towards goal from the right, Netherlands vs England simulated to see if the Three Lions can reach Euro 2024 final forcing Pickford into a tremendous reaction save. After riding their luck for the opening hour or so, Southgate looked to his bench for inspiration.\n\nCole Palmer, Kieran Trippier, and Trent Alexander-Arnold were all introduced, and a moment of class from the latter saw England take the lead against the run of play.\n\nCollecting the ball on the right, Alexander-Arnold played a one-two with Declan Rice to burst down the wing and ease past his marker. The Liverpool defender picked out Jude Bellingham's run into the box with a pin-point driven cross, and the midfielder fired into the roof of the net with a first-time finish to send the Three Lions into a 1-0 lead.\n\nA goal down, the Netherlands started to throw more bodies forward in the final 15 minutes as they searched for an equaliser, leaving more space for England to attack. Southgate's side missed a wonderful chance to double their lead when they hit their opponents on the break, but despite the four-on-two situation, a poor cross from Palmer evaded Harry Kane at the far post as the opportunity was wasted.\n\nThe final few minutes of the game saw England put all 11 players behind the ball, and the Three Lions managed to hold on to book their spot in the Euro 2024 final on Sunday.\n\nEA FC 24 predicted final score: Netherlands 0-1 England\n\nWhat do you think the score will be between England and Netherlands?

If they beat the Dutch, they have another chance to end a 58-year trophy drought, and to win their very first European championship.\n\nThe Netherlands already lifted a Euro cup in 1988 but then failed to win more trophies. The closest they got was in the 2010 World Cup final against Spain, which they lost.\n\nThere were only three previous clashes in major tournaments, with one draw and one victory each. The last one dates back to Euro 96. England were the hosts and routed the Netherlands 4-1 in the group stage.\n\nNetherlands' only victory was at Euro 88 - hosted by Germany - with a 3-1 win that set the Dutch on course for reaching the final and lifting the trophy.\n\nTaking into account all games - friendlies and Nations League included - England have a far worse record, as they managed to beat the Netherlands only once in the nine previous face-offs, in a 2018 friendly.\n\nEngland is the most expensive squad of the tournament, according to Transfermrkt, totalling \u20ac1.52bn euro in players' worth. The Netherlands ranks 6th at \u20ac854m, though the estimation also includes Frankie De Jong who's been injured for the whole tournament.\n\nAccording to the OptaAnalys algorithm, England stand a 51.51% chance of progressing through to the final.\n\nAs per ninety minutes' result, Google foresees a 36% victory chance for England over the Netherlands' 30%, with a 34% possibility of a draw.\n\nThe odds reflect the margin between the teams. England are slightly ahead - generally at 17/10 - while the Netherlands' odds are generally 21/10 for a victory in the ninety minutes.\n\nDespite England looking like having an edge, the game could turn out unpredictable as Southgate's team hasn't yet faced a FIFA Top 10 team in the whole tournament.\n\nFurthermore, they struggled against almost all their opponents at Euro 2024, particularly in the knockout phase, with serious troubles at shooting on target.\n\nEngland limped through to the semis after four consecutive draws in the 90 minutes.\n\nIn the round of 16, they narrowly avoided elimination with Slovakia with a late 95th-minute equaliser and then resorted to a penalty shootout to beat Switzerland in the quarter-finals. Earlier on in the group stage, their manager Gareth Southgate was thrown empty beer cups after a draw with Slovenia.\n\nEngland's Harry Kane said the \"expectation weighed quite heavily\" on the team at the beginning of the tournament.\n\n\"And of course, the external noise was louder than it's ever been so I felt we couldn't quite get ourselves in the right place. In the end, what was impressive was that the players ground it out, they ground results out and found ways to win.\"\n\nThere's scrutiny of Harry Kane's fitness after the England captain went off with cramps in extra time against Switzerland. Ivan Toney came off the bench and scored one of England's five successful penalties in the shootout.\n\nThe Netherlands got off to a clunky start with a third place in the group behind Austria and France but then lifted themselves up with two convincing victories against Romania and Turkey in the knockouts, the latter achieved with a stunning six-minute comeback.\n\nDutch manager Ronald Koeman shrugged criticism off: \"We often hear things via the media, but we don't necessarily hear what the country thinks. It could be more positive and more respectful when talking about the coach or about players. I think it's a worldwide problem.\"\n\nKoeman brings back painful memories to the opponent. In 1993, the then-Dutch player scored a goal against England which excluded them from the 1994 World Cup.\n\nThe Dutch are pinning their hopes on Liverpool's Codi Gapko. The 25-year-old forward is the joint Euro 2024 top scorer with three goals, one of which netted in the previous game against Turkey.\n\nRonald Koeman could keep his lineup unchanged for the third game in a row, with Memphis Depay and Steven Bergwijn up front starting alongside Gakpo.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Dutch endured some travel disruption on the way to Dortmund when their scheduled train journey from Wolfsburg was cancelled because of what the team said was a \"blockage\" on the line. The squad had to fly instead.", "source": {"uri": "euronews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Euronews English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type":

Can they maintain their good form or will England's pragmatic play stop them?\n\nGet stuck into my England vs. Netherlands predictions and Euro 2024 picks for July 10.\n\nEngland vs Netherlands picks, predictions, and betting tips\n\nThe Netherlands finished third in their group but that doesn't do the quality of their performances enough credit. They were unlucky to draw 0-0 with France with a controversial goal ruled out and they also looked impressive while losing 3-2 to Austria. Since then they've beaten Romania and Turkey to reach this stage, but will they be able to go one step further and reach the final?\n\nBefore Dutch fans book their transport to Berlin, their team needs to get past England. Gareth Southgate's team won Group C in unspectacular style with one win, two draws, and just two goals scored. They've taken that poor form into the knockout rounds with a miraculous Jude Bellingham goal in extra time helping them reach the quarterfinals before beating Switzerland on penalties.\n\nAs bad as England have been to watch, there's a feeling that this could be their year. They were the favorites to win the tournament before a ball was kicked and they're finding a way to win even if that involves their stars having to bail them out and a healthy dose of luck. These are the margins that can help teams win tournaments, which is why I'm betting England to qualify from this game at -133.\n\nEngland's first half against the Swiss was their best of the tournament so far and they demonstrated a level of control that we hadn't seen until this point. We also saw Luke Shaw come off the bench for his first appearance in Germany following an injury. Despite playing as the left central defender, rather than the left-wing back, he instantly added a balance and gave the team the left foot that they need.\n\nGareth Southgate took too long to make subs, again, but when he did the team instantly looked more dynamic. When this team is playing well they are genuinely scary and their ability to keep going in the face of adversity is impressive. Even more so is their ability from the penalty spot, with the team turning English stereotypes on their head as they dispatched Switzerland with one of the best five penalties seen over the last decade. No team will want to go to a shootout against this England team.\n\nThe Dutch are a good, not great, team and England's quality should come through and secure them a spot in Berlin. That might be in regular time, extra time, or penalties, and however it happens I'll be covered with England to qualify at -133.\n\nEngland vs Netherlands same-game parlay (SGP)\n\nIn addition to my best bet I'm going to add two further legs, starting with Both Teams to Score.\n\nWe've seen England give up a goal in both knockout games so far with both Slovakia and Switzerland scoring past them. The defense is improving but it still doesn't look impenetrable, and the Dutch will hope to take advantage of that with the pace and guile of Xavi Simons and Cody Gakpo.\n\nI'll also back England to have Over 11.5 shots. Through five games they've averaged 11.6 shots per game. However, this is the first team that they'll play who are going to take the game to England, with their five opponents so far happy to sit back.\n\nEngland are set up in a way to make sure that they can damage teams who throw too many players forward and will punish them. We should see a far more open game than any England have played so far, which means we'll get 12 or more shots from the Three Lions.", "source": {"uri": "covers.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Covers.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Romania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Romania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Austria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Shaw", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luke Shaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavi_Simons", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xavi Simons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cody_Gakpo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cody Gakpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_kick_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty kick (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovakia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://img.covers.com/cms/covers/15f30534-0e1e-46de-a35f-437241c8452d.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712618", "eventUri": "eng-9712618", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-10", "textStart": 584, "textEnd": 591}], "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

Left-footed Luke Shaw came off the bench against Switzerland for his first minutes since February after injury. Shaw says he's fit to start against the Netherlands if Southgate picks him.\n\nSouthgate has to choose whether to stick with Ezri Konsa in the center of defense after he replaced the then-suspended Marc Guehi against Switzerland.

The Dutch wrapped up their wins over Romania and Turkey without needing extra time.\n\nThe Netherlands scored the opening goal in only one of its five games so far at Euro 2024, against Romania in the last 16. England last scored the opening goal against Denmark in the group stage.\n\nThe Netherlands hasn't reached a European Championship final since it won the tournament in 1988 and was last a semifinalist in 2004.\n\nEngland's first shot on target against Switzerland was Bukayo Saka's goal to level the score in the 80th minute. One round earlier, Bellingham's spectacular overhead kick was England's first shot on target. That came in the fifth minute of second-half added time.\n\nDutch forward Gakpo is the top-scoring player left at Euro 2024 with three goals. What was initially thought to be a fourth against Turkey was instead ruled to be an own-goal. Kane and Bellingham are England's top scorers with two.\n\nWhat they're saying\n\n\"I don't really understand the criticism.

The backlash from England fans, including some who threw plastic cups at him after a group-stage game, is \"quite difficult\" to deal with, he added.\n\n-- The Netherlands will be by far the highest-ranked team England has faced after group games with Serbia, Denmark and Slovenia, followed by knockout games with Slovakia and Switzerland.\n\n-- England has relied on the right-footed Kieran Trippier at left wing back, but his tendency to cut inside has meant England has made little use of the left wing all tournament. Left-footed Luke Shaw came off the bench against Switzerland for his first minutes since February after injury. Shaw says he's fit to start against the Netherlands if Southgate picks him.\n\n-- Southgate has to choose whether to stick with Ezri Konsa in the center of defense after he replaced the then-suspended Marc Gu\u00e9hi against Switzerland. Gu\u00e9hi is eligible again.\n\n-- There's scrutiny of Harry Kane's fitness after the England captain went off with cramp in extra time against Switzerland. Ivan Toney came off the bench and scored one of England's five successful penalties in the shootout.\n\n-- Netherlands coach Ronald Koeman could keep his lineup unchanged for the third game in a row, with Memphis Depay starting alongside Cody Gakpo and Steven Bergwijn up front.\n\nBy the numbers\n\n-- England has played a full hour more than the Netherlands in the last 10 days, after beating Slovakia in extra time and then Switzerland on penalties. The Dutch wrapped up their wins over Romania and Turkey without needing extra time.\n\n-- The Netherlands scored the opening goal in only one of its five games so far at Euro 2024, against Romania in the last 16. England last scored the opening goal against Denmark in the group stage.\n\n-- The Netherlands hasn't reached a European Championship final since it won the tournament in 1988 and was last a semifinalist in 2004.\n\n-- England's first shot on target against Switzerland was Bukayo Saka's goal to level the score in the 80th minute. One round earlier, Bellingham's spectacular overhead kick was England's first shot on target. That came in the fifth minute of second-half added time.\n\n-- Dutch forward Gakpo is the top-scoring player left at Euro 2024 with three goals. What was initially thought to be a fourth against Turkey was instead ruled to be an own-goal. Kane and Bellingham are England's top scorers with two.\n\nWhat they're saying\n\n\"I don't really understand the criticism. What he's done for the country, for us as players as well, he really took us to the next level ... I've got a lot to thank him for because he showed a lot of faith and trust in picking me when he didn't have to.\" -- England defender Luke Shaw on manager Gareth Southgate.\n\n\"Hopefully it's us that will have the ball more than England. So it's more England that's running.

EUROS DAILY: Will England have a 'lightbulb moment' and stop muddling through?\n\nThey are six summers old now, but some of the images from the semi-final of the 2018 World Cup in Russia remain fresh in the mind.\n\nIt was to be a hurdle Gareth Southgate's new England could not quite overcome.\n\nStill, though, it is possible to recall Kieran Trippier's early free-kick that gave England the lead against Croatia in their first tournament semi-final for 22 years. It is easy to think back to that unusual surge of optimism that remained, even after a 2-1 defeat in extra time.\n\nSouthgate, dressed in the waistcoat that had become his trademark, was cheered from the field at the Luzhniki Stadium by England fans. Many players didn't want to leave. As tournament newcomers such as Harry Maguire leaned on barriers talking to their families about their great adventure, it felt like an awakening, the start of something new and vibrant and, as it turned out, that is exactly what it was.\n\nNow here we are, approaching the end of the Southgate era after almost eight years. England play in another semi-final tonight against the Netherlands. It is the third in four tournaments under him, but the gratitude of old has withered and a sense of entitlement -- the curse of English football for so long -- has returned.\n\nEngland face the Netherlands in the semi-final of the European Championships on Wednesday\n\nGareth Southgate's side have muddled through the tournament but are still in the final four\n\nBukayo Saka rescued England with a superb equaliser against Switzerland in the quarter-finals\n\nThe Three Lions squad gears up for their huge clash against the Netherlands in Dortmund\n\nPodcast All episodes LISTEN: Southgate only England manager to be criticised whilst winning PODCAST: The REAL reason England through despite playing badly PODCAST: 'Just ONE good performance' could change England's fortunes PODCAST: Are the England team buying into Southgate's style of play? PODCAST: Is Martinez 'spineless' over Cristiano Ronaldo management? Play on Apple Spotify\n\nThere will be no free pass for Southgate and his players if they lose tonight.\n\nThey haven't played well in Germany, haven't scored goals and haven't entertained. They have muddled through.\n\nOnce upon a time that would have been enough, but not any more. So here in Dortmund it will be death or glory for England.\n\nThere is no longer any middle ground for this manager and his players, and Southgate even nodded to that himself as he spoke about the psychological challenges his team have faced since starting their tournament with an uncertain win over Serbia in Gelsenkirchen.\n\n'For me it's been a fascinating experience to see the team fearful in the opening part of this tournament,' said Southgate.\n\n'They were almost concerned about what could go wrong. We haven't had that for a few years. In Russia, winning a knockout game was the first target and it felt that everything from that moment on was a bonus.\n\n'Here we definitely spoke about it. When you can sense that feeling you need to confront it. It's no use avoiding it and hoping it will go away. In the end we had to grind it out on the pitch.\n\n'The Denmark game, the point we got there, there's a picture of the players looking distraught afterwards. They've got a point that essentially ensured us of qualifying. Every other team was celebrating with their fans and we were on our knees.\n\nKieran Trippier (centre) fired England ahead against Croatia in the 2018 World Cup semi final\n\nThe images of England's disappointment at full time remain fresh in the mind six summers on\n\nDespite leading England to two semi-finals and final at major tournaments, Southgate has yet to win a trophy with the Three Lions, who have been far from their sparkling best in Germany\n\n'So I had to correct how the players were viewing things. But, of course, that feeling was being reinforced so vocally and actively outside and I think they were picking up on that too much. Maybe it was expectation. Maybe it was a lot of external things as well. But now they're very much in a \"what's achievable, what's possible\" sort of mindset.\n\n'We saw a truer reflection of ourselves in the last game and there was a lot within that to build on and take into the game tomorrow.'\n\nREAD MOREEXCLUSIVE LISTEN: On today's EUROS DAILY, should we trust England's referee against the Netherlands after his 'match-fixing' conviction?\n\nSouthgate has been as candid about his feelings over the last few days as he has for a while. After the quarter-final win over Switzerland, he admitted he was using criticism as fuel.\n\nWhere many people will disagree with Southgate is regarding the supposed uptick in performance he feels he saw in the last game.\n\nEngland were marginally better on the back of a change in formation in the first half, but lost control from that point on and did not have a shot on target until Bukayo Saka equalised.\n\n'The first thing is we've got this game ahead of us and we've got to get that right,' said Southgate when asked if he was worried about the lack of entertainment in his team's football.\n\n'We always want to play as well as we can. In the tournament there have been 13 goals fewer than the last Euros. A lot of teams have been really well organised. We've played three teams that play a back five.\n\n'In our sport, sometimes you play as well as the opponent allows you and we know we didn't start the tournament well.'\n\nEnglish football has history with the Dutch and Southgate has been part of it. He played in the team that beat them 4-1 in Euro '96 and was manager when his team lost to them in the semi-final of the 2019 Nations League.\n\n'Their coach Ronald Koeman was somebody I admired very much as a player,' said Southgate. 'We didn't really see centre backs stepping out with the ball and spraying passes around.\n\nEngland will make a late call on Luke Shaw's availability after he came on as a substitute against Switzerland, with the left-back still recovering from his long-term hamstring injury\n\nRonald Koeman's Netherlands side lost to Austria in their final group game and finished third\n\n'I know we see that more in the English game now, but that was unique when I was growing up.\n\n'I've got huge admiration for the Netherlands as a country. They have a fairly small population, but their football culture for decades has been phenomenally good.'\n\nKoeman's team have also had difficulties. They lost to Austria in their final group game and finished third.\n\nBut they have improved in a way that England have not, beating Romania 3-0 and coming from a goal down to beat Turkey in the quarter-finals. It feels as if England will have to improve to win. They have relied on individual moments and have not been helped by their manager's hesitancy to make substitutions.\n\nSouthgate has only made changes before the 66th minute twice in Germany. Conor Gallagher replaced Trent Alexander-Arnold in the 54th minute against Denmark, while Gallagher made way for Kobbie Mainoo at half-time against Slovenia.\n\nMail Sport's Football Editor Ian Ladyman\n\nSouthgate said: 'It depends how the team are playing and there are moments where you feel they are playing well and you can force a change.\n\n'But if the team are in the rhythm of the game and individuals are playing well, you can put freshness on or you can put a different sort of problem to the opponent, but we've still got faith in the players.\n\n'Sometimes you feel you are still posing a threat, controlling a game, and I've seen a lot of other big managers hold their nerve and wait a really long time to make changes. Everybody is going to have a different view on that.'\n\nThere has been a feeling since Southgate announced his squad in May that he would live or die by his methods in Germany. That has only grown the further England have progressed. They are close enough to the final now to picture themselves walking out at the Olympiastadion.\n\nSouthgate appears to have found the right formula with Kobbie Mainoo (above) in midfield\n\nThe days of glorious failure are gone for England... they must go big or go home quietly\n\nIf England's players find something hitherto beyond them here, then they should beat an imperfect Dutch team burdened by its own pressures from home.\n\nThe days of glorious failure are gone, though. England's play at Euro 2024 has not been anywhere near good enough for that. They must go big, or go home quietly.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

They brushed aside Romania in the round of 16 before coming from behind to topple Turkey in the quarters. They're now aiming to reach the final of this competition for just the second time having lifted the trophy in 1988 - also held in Germany.\n\nEngland continue to struggle through the tournament, but their ability to produce when it matters has seen them advance into their third semi-final with Gareth Southgate at the helm. Bukayo Saka's pinpoint effort from distance saved the Three Lions against Switzerland and they went on to produce a stunning performance in the penalty shootout.\n\nThey're far from swashbuckling, but Southgate's squad boasts the requisite knowhow and they're continuing to find ways to win.\n\nNetherlands vs England H2H Record (Last Five Games)\n\nCurrent form (all competitions)\n\nHow to watch Netherlands vs England on TV and live stream\n\nNetherlands team news\n\nKoeman has found his formula in the knockout stages and he'll likely resist the clamours from back home to start Wout Weghorst on Wednesday. Memphis Depay should continue as the Netherlands' leading man up top.\n\nTijjani Reijnders has impressed since dropping into a deeper midfield position alongside Jerdy Schouten, with Xavi Simons occupying pockets between the lines.\n\nThere are unlikely to be changes to Koeman's backline, although Tottenham's Micky van de Ven has shown his abilities off the bench.\n\nNetherlands predicted lineup vs England\n\nNetherlands predicted lineup vs Turkey (4-2-3-1): Verbruggen; Dumfries, De Vrij, Van Dijk, Ake; Schouten, Reijnders; Malen, Simons, Gakpo; Depay.\n\nEngland team news\n\nLuke Shaw made his long-awaited return to action off the bench against Switzerland and the Man Utd full-back looked spritely on the overlap.\n\nSouthgate now has a big call to make down the left, with Shaw unlikely to last the distance on Wednesday. He could, however, earn his first start of Euro 2024.\n\nMarc Guehi returns from suspension and will replace Ezri Konsa, who impressed on Saturday, and the England manager will likely retain the 3-4-2-1 formation deployed against the Swiss. Harry Kane will not be dropped.\n\nEngland predicted lineup vs Netherlands\n\nEngland predicted lineup vs Netherlands (3-4-2-1): Pickford; Walker, Stones, Guehi; Saka, Mainoo, Rice, Shaw; Foden, Bellingham; Kane.\n\nNetherlands vs England score prediction\n\nSwitzerland offered a tricky test for England last time out, but the Dutch represent another step up in quality given their two knockout stage performances.\n\nKoeman's side are hardly as gifted as the outfit that won the competition at Euro 88 but the manager has found a formula and has shown to be adaptable in their recent victories. They'll target England out wide and have the talent in midfield to steal control away from the Three Lions.\n\nSouthgate's side, though, are willing to suffer and will back themselves against anybody given the nature of their knockout stage triumphs. A real belief is starting to show within the squad, but they may be required to go the distance again.\n\nIf it does go to a shootout, Jordan Pickford and Southgate's cold-blooded killers could have the edge from 12 yards.\n\nPrediction: Netherlands 1-1 England (England to win on penalties)\n\nREAD THE LATEST EURO 2024 NEWS, PREVIEWS & PLAYER RATINGS", "source": {"uri": "90min.com", "dataType":

The backlash from England fans, including some who threw plastic cups at him after a group-stage game, is \"quite difficult\" to deal with, he added.\n\n-- The Netherlands will be by far the highest-ranked team England has faced after group games with Serbia, Denmark and Slovenia, followed by knockout games with Slovakia and Switzerland.\n\nTEAM NEWS\n\n-- England has relied on the right-footed Kieran Trippier at left wing back, but his tendency to cut inside has meant England has made little use of the left wing all tournament. Left-footed Luke Shaw came off the bench against Switzerland for his first minutes since February after injury. Shaw says he's fit to start against the Netherlands if Southgate picks him.\n\n-- Southgate has to choose whether to stick with Ezri Konsa in the center of defense after he replaced the then-suspended Marc Gu\u00e9hi against Switzerland.

Ivan Toney came off the bench and scored one of England's five successful penalties in the shootout.\n\nBY THE NUMBERS\n\n-- England has played a full hour more than the Netherlands in the last 10 days, after beating Slovakia in extra time and then Switzerland on penalties. The Dutch wrapped up their wins over Romania and Turkey without needing extra time.\n\n-- The Netherlands hasn't reached a European Championship final since it won the tournament in 1988 and was last a semifinalist in 2004.\n\n-- England's first shot on target against Switzerland was Bukayo Saka's goal to level the score in the 80th minute. One round earlier, Bellingham's spectacular overhead kick was England's first shot on target. That came in the fifth minute of second-half added time.\n\nWHAT THEY'RE SAYING\n\n\"I don't really understand the criticism.

Their three wins were all in regulation time, however, compared to one for England, and the Dutch have scored nearly double their number of goals at the tournament.\n\nThe Netherlands have the edge in attack, their nine goals at Euro 2024 coming from 20 attempts on target against 15 by an England side spearheaded by the usually lethal but currently subdued Harry Kane, Phil Foden and Jude Bellingham.\n\nEngland improved against the Swiss but their five expertly struck penalties rescued an attack that again looked frustrated, with Bukayo Saka's 80th-minute equaliser their first shot on target.\n\nNetherlands do not have that problem and will bank on the tournament's joint top-scorer Cody Gakpo to trouble an England defence that has been solid in contrast with their jaded attack.\n\nEngland manager Gareth Southgate declined to discuss the Dutch after his side's win over Switzerland, keeping media attention squarely on his players' resilience in handling the intensity of penalties.\n\nEngland's troubles in front of goal were during matches he said were not normal, against crowded defences determined to stop them.\n\n\"These are national events with huge pressure, with really young men in the middle of it. Our team has been under enormous pressure from the start. They're doing so well. So well,\" Southgate said.\n\n\"We're not able to score a load of goals at the moment. But again, we've played three teams that play back fives, very well organised defences.\"\n\nSouthgate is again expected to stick to a similar line-up having been impervious to calls to shake things up or make substitutions earlier during the tournament.\n\nThe Dutch have blown hot and cold and will need to be stronger at the back to stand any chance of reaching their first final since their 1988 Euros triumph, their only major tournament success. Austria and Turkey exploited Dutch defensive disorganisation at set pieces and England will try to do the same.\n\nNetherlands coach Ronald Koeman has also received criticism, hitting back at pundits who questioned his team's commitment and saying his players showed a big heart in coming from behind to beat Turkey.\n\n\"We need to fight to win the semifinal,\" Koeman said. \"It will be a great night on Wednesday between two big nations historically. England have good players, but we have too.\"", "source": {"uri": "businesslive.co.za", "dataType": "news", "title": "BusinessLIVE"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Romania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Romania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cody_Gakpo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cody Gakpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Koeman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Koeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Austria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/WLQkzwCxaMvu3mq3Qft4W6gN-2YPNd_rK2s8r91wra1x4AJ26u5Ndm1nW-TCaKxkdRJB22eFZRFZqNu_1y-FPHLpoXuG7XfHNq4trJ3SXdTxbxU=s1000", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712618", "eventUri": "eng-9712618", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

Five of the last eight games between these teams have finished level after 90 minutes. The Dutch have been patchy this time and England have flattered to deceive with a strong team. The prospect of shootouts looks very much a possibility.\n\nEngland, of course, can reach back-to-back European Championship finals if they come out triumphant from Wednesday's battle. The Netherlands haven't reached a European Championship final since they won the tournament in 1988 and were last semi-finalists in 2004.\n\nOn paper and as per recent form, the two appear to be evenly matched. Both the teams conceded the opening goal in their quarter-finals before coming back to win, with England beating Switzerland in a penalty shootout after a 1-1 draw and the Netherlands winning 2-1 against Turkey.\n\nGareth Southgate, however, has defended his often-cautious tactics as the kind of \"streetwise\" style successful teams use. The backlash from England fans, including some who threw plastic cups at him after a group-stage game, is \"quite difficult\" to deal with, he added.\n\nEngland have relied on the right-footed Kieran Trippier at left wing-back, but his tendency to cut inside has meant England have made little use of the left-wing all tournament. Left-footed Luke Shaw came off the bench against Switzerland for his first minutes since February after injury and is available for Wednesday.\n\nSouthgate has to choose whether to stick with Ezri Konsa in the centre of defence after he replaced the then-suspended Marc Guehi against Switzerland. Guehi is eligible against the Dutch.\n\nThere's scrutiny of Harry Kane's fitness after the England captain went off witha cramp in extra time against Switzerland. With just two goals to show, Kane has not been at his best in this tournament.\n\nNetherlands coach Ronald Koeman could keep his line-up unchanged for the third game in a row, with Memphis Depay starting alongside Cody Gakpo up front. Gakpo is the top-scoring player left at Euro 2024 with three goals.\n\nWednesday's clash has also thrown up a weird subplot with the designated referee, Felix Zwayer, once having ties to a match-fixing scandal in Germany. England midfielder Jude Bellingham was fined 40,000 euros ($43,400) while pl\u00adaying for Borussia Dortmund in 2021 for criticising the appointment of Zwayer.\n\nRice relaxed\n\nOne is not sure about the overall mood in the England camp, but Declan Rice is taking the semi-final game in his stride and believes they have the momentum to beat the Dutch and win their first-ever European Championship.\n\nThe Arsenal midfielder, the bedrock for England during what has been a lacklustre run to the last four, said he was in a relaxed mood even while expecting a tough game.\n\n\"It's business as usual... I don't put too much pressure on myself, I don't think about it too much,\" Rice told England's Lions' Den programme.\n\n\"It's another game of football, it's a semi-final and that's the only way I think about it.\" \"We're here for a reason,Holland are here for a reason and may the best team win. We feel like we've got a really good bit of momentum on our side,\" he added.\n\nThe statistics underline Rice's contribution for England, covering more distance in the tournament than any other player at 63.9km (39.7 miles) over five matches, with the fourth most tackles and balls recovered.", "source": {"uri": "telegraphindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors":

They are doing so well.\"\n\nSouthgate pointed to England's opponents using defensive formations and also blamed the grass in Germany for hampering his players.\n\n\"We're not able to score a load of goals at the moment, but we've played three teams that play a back five, well-organised defences,\" he continued.\n\n\"Pitches are a little bit bobbly so sometimes you need the extra touch and then the space is gone. None of this is easy, but we're in a third semi-final in four tournaments.\"\n\nAfter reaching the 2018 World Cup semi-finals and being beaten in the Euro 2020 final on penalties by Italy, England began this tournament as one of the two favourites along with France.\n\nLes Bleus have also played in a rather tedious, yet adequate, fashion to reach the other semi-final, facing Spain.\n\nSouthgate noted even La Roja, who by contrast have dazzled this summer in Germany, modified their style to be more direct as they beat the hosts in the quarter-finals.\n\n\"It's not just about playing well -- Spain mixed their game up, they took seven yellow cards, they found ways to win,\" said the coach.\n\nDifferent Dutch\n\nThey now face a Dutch team whose five games have produced nearly double the number of goals as in England's, despite playing 60 minutes less.\n\nIn Liverpool's Cody Gakpo and Burnley target man Wout Weghorst, Ronald Koeman's side have a variety of different tools to create havoc at the other end, leading to hope of a more entertaining, higher-calibre clash.\n\nOne bone of contention England fans have had with Southgate is his reluctance to make changes.\n\nCole Palmer, arguably the player of the season in England, has not started a game in Germany, while Ollie Watkins would offer the ability to run in behind that Kane can no longer muster. Anthony Gordon, who would add dynamism on the left, has gone virtually ignored.\n\nDespite some decisive moments Jude Bellingham has looked jaded after his exploits with Real Madrid and Phil Foden is operating at a far lower level than with Manchester City.\n\nSouthgate only rang the changes against Switzerland after falling behind, before Bukayo Saka's fine strike from distance pulled England level.\n\nThere are concerns that like in the World Cup 2018 semi-final against Croatia, if Southgate is too reactive rather than proactive, England could lose control of the game against better opposition.\n\nIf they can defeat the Netherlands with a convincing display instead of another isolated moment of brilliance, it will give the team hope ahead of a potential final.\n\nFans tossed beer cups at Southgate during a dull goalless draw with Slovenia but all will be forgiven if England triumph in Berlin on July 14.\n\n\"I don't think it is normal to have beer thrown at you,\" said Southgate.\n\n\"But we will keep grinding, keep fighting and keep enjoying this journey.\"", "source": {"uri": "france24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "France 24"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The Netherlands swatted aside Romania in the Round of 16, before showing spirit to come from behind against a talented Turkey team in the quarter-finals.\n\nCody Gakpo has been one of the players of the tournament with three goals and an assist to lead the Dutch challenge. The Liverpool forward is among several familiar names in the Dutch squad for Premier League fans, alongside club teammate Virgil van Dijk, Spurs centre-back Micky van de Ven and Brighton goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen.\n\nThe Netherlands aim to win the European Championship for the second time but will need to overcome a poor record in the semi-finals. The Oranje have lost four of their five semi-final ties in this competition, with the most recent back-to-back losses in 2000 and 2004.\n\nHowever, the Dutch boast the superior record when it comes to this particular fixture, having lost just one of their last nine meetings with England dating back to 1996.\n\nEngland are into a third major tournament semi-final under Gareth Southgate but optimism remains cautious following an unconvincing tournament so far. After group-stage draws with Denmark and Slovenia, the Three Lions needed a 95th-minute equaliser and extra time to eliminate Slovakia in the first knockout round.\n\nSouthgate tweaked his team in favour of a three-man backline for the quarter-final with Switzerland and England looked improved, even if their forward threat was still limited. Bukayo Saka's equaliser forced extra-time and penalties against the Swiss, where England went five from five in the shootout to reach the last eight.\n\nEngland are expected to retain the same shape for Wednesday's showdown with the Netherlands, and Luke Shaw's return as a substitute against the Swiss offers natural left-sided balance at wing-back. Marc Guehi is also available after being suspended for the quarter-final.\n\nSouthgate continues to polarise opinion but hope remains alive in what could be his final tournament as England manager. He has achieved more than all but Sir Alf Ramsey before him, though his legacy could hinge on whether England can finally get over the line.\n\nEngland 1-3 Netherlands, 06/06/2019, UEFA Nations League semi-final\n\nEngland suffered a disappointing defeat in extra time to lose to the Dutch in the last four of the inaugural Nations League finals.\n\nThe Three Lions opened the scoring through Marcus Rashford's penalty after the forward was brought down by Matthijs de Ligt, but the Dutch defender made amends as he powered in from a corner to equalise.\n\nJesse Lingard had a late winner disallowed for offside before England imploded in extra time. John Stones was caught on the ball by Memphis Depay in a dangerous area and the forward's shot was well saved by Jordan Pickford, only for Kyle Walker to bundle in the loose ball for an own goal under pressure.\n\nEngland again conceded possession sloppily with Ross Barkley caught after a poor pass from Stones, with Depay setting up Quincy Promes to seal the Netherlands' place in the final.\n\nNetherlands: Verbruggen; Dumfries, De Vrij, Van Dijk, Ake; Schouten, Reijnders; Malen, Simons, Gakpo; Depay.\n\nEngland: Pickford; Walker, Stones, Guehi; Saka, Mainoo, Rice, Trippier;

Both teams have shown resilience and determination throughout the tournament. England's predicted starting XI may see the return of Luke Shaw and Marc Guehi, while the Netherlands could make a change up front with Donyell Malen starting over Steven Bergwijn.\n\nAfter nervously edging their way past a spirited Switzerland, England are looking to make appearances in consecutive European Championship finals, but standing in their way are an impressive Netherlands side in EURO 2024's second semi-final matchup.\n\nThrough to their 3rd semi-final in four major tournaments, Gareth Southgate and his men will be seeking to avenge their heartbreaking loss at Wembley in 2021, which saw Italy overturn a 1-0 deficit and defeat the Three Lions by an all-too-infamous penalty shootout. They haven't been at their convincing best at EURO 2024, but have shown grit and resiliency to come from behind in both the round of 16 against Slovakia and the quarter-finals against Switzerland, advancing through both tests narrowly and setting up a semi-final clash.\n\nRelated England Beat Switzerland: Player Ratings and Match Highlights\n\nThe Three Lions booked their place in the final four of EURO 2024 via a penalty shootout win against Switzerland.\n\nEngland face a fourth major tournament meeting with the Netherlands, whom the Three Lions have not enjoyed the best luck historically against. England have failed to beat the Netherlands more than once in their last nine meetings, with their next-most-recent victory over Die Oranje coming in 1996. The most recent meeting between these two sides was also in a semi-final, that of the Nations League. The Netherlands ran out comfortable 3-1 winners on that day, with Gareth Southgate and Ronald Koeman both in the dugouts.\n\nThe latter has guided his side to a first Euro's semi-final since 2004, after a comeback victory over a brave Turkey side who had initially taken the lead, but fell to a Stefan de Vrij header and an own goal from Mert Muldur. It's been 36 summers since the Netherlands lifted their one and only Henri Delauney trophy, and have made their way through the \"weaker\" side of the draw to face their biggest test in England, the feeling there being mutual.\n\nWith a one-stop shot at glory on the line, here is all the team news and likely starting teams as England take on the Netherlands.\n\nEngland Team News The Three Lions boosted by two returns\n\nAs the only out-and-out left back that made the plane to Germany, Manchester United man, and near-hero of EURO 2020, Luke Shaw will have been bitterly disappointed to have missed out on England's first four games in the competition, battling a race for fitness that darkened his chances of coming to the tournament in the first place.\n\nHowever, after making his return to the side in England's penalty win over Switzerland, he has now declared himself fit to start, which will likely raise a headache for Southgate given the questions over Kieran Trippier's form playing on his weaker side.\n\nHaving been impressive in the tournament throughout, Marc Guehi is also eligible for a starting return, having missed the quarter-final through suspension after picking up his second yellow card of the tournament against Slovakia in the previous round. He must do battle with Aston Villa man Ezri Konsa for the space in the side, though it remains to be seen whether a three or four-man rearguard will be deployed in Dortmund on Wednesday evening.\n\nRelated \u00a365m Thiago Silva replacement who's 'perfect for Chelsea' is thriving at Euro 2024\n\nThiago Silva's natural replacement at Chelsea could come in the form of Marc Guehi after a superb Euro 2024.\n\nHarry Kane was taken off the field in extra-time against Switzerland, a risk perhaps given his penalty quality, but has confirmed he was only taken off as he had cramp, and will remain in line to start against the Netherlands come Wednesday. He'll be looking to build on his shared record as the top scorer in the Euro's knockout phases, with five goals joining him with Antoine Griezmann.\n\nEngland do not have any further suspensions to serve going into the game, and any subsequent yellow-card-induced suspensions will be wiped by UEFA for the final, should England make it through. This means that Kane, Trippier, Phil Foden, Conor Gallagher, Kobbie Mainoo and Jude Bellingham will keep their chances of playing in the final safe, should they recieve a yellow against Netherlands (and win the game).\n\nYou can keep track of any remaining suspensions in EURO 2024's final moments with our handy suspensions tracker.\n\nEngland Predicted Starting XI Changes unlikely as Southgate persists\n\nDespite many calling for Southgate to fire off changes to the team that has got them to the semi-final, we can't foresee Southgate making any, instead opting to trust a starting team that has taken him this far.\n\nThe only change likely to be made would be the return of Guehi, who may well be staking a claim to being England's player of the tournament so far. Despite their being rumours of a back-three being deployed by England against Switzerland, with Walker playing central, Saka left-back and Trippier on his natural side, it appeared largely the same strategy instead, so we predict that remaining the same against the Netherlands.\n\nRelated Alan Shearer Names his England Starting 11 to Face the Netherlands\n\nAlan Shearer has had his say on who should start England's Euro 2024 semi-final tie against the Netherlands.\n\nElsewhere, Luke Shaw will likely still not be risked, nor will the experiment of Saka at left-back. Kobbie Mainoo will continue his impressive tournament in deep midfield, partnering with Rice again, whereas Saka, Foden and Kane will be again supported by Jude Bellingham in the ten.\n\nAnd, of course, Jordan Pickford remains in goal, who genuinely may be worthy of claims as England's best ever goalkeeper in the near future.\n\nNetherlands Team News The Dutch are at full strength, but have a call to make in the attack\n\nThe Netherlands are fortunate to not have a single suspension or injury to worry about going into this contest, with no player in orange picking up more than one yellow at any stage of EURO 2024 so far.\n\nThere will, however, likely be a big decision to make in terms of the attacking force in the team. Burnley striker Wout Weghorst came off of the bench against Turkey to great effect in their comeback win, turning the game on it's head with his powerful brand of centre-forward play, and may be staking his claim as a starter in Ronald Koeman's side. The probability lies, however, within another impact being role being entrusted to Weghorst, with him and Depay being directly involved in 63.5% of the Netherlands' goals this summer.\n\nRelated England vs. Netherlands Odds and Predictions\n\nEngland face Netherlands in Dortmund for a place in the Euro 2024 final on July 14th.\n\nElsewhere, Koeman is likely to announce a mostly unchanged starting XI, with the team applied throughout the tournament impressing so far.\n\nNetherlands predicted starting XI The Dutch to join the English in a lack of changes\n\nAs mentioned, we expect the Netherlands to join England in a largely unchanged group, with us seeing just one potential change with Donyell Malen coming back into the side over Steven Bergwijn.\n\nAfter a relatively unimpressive 45 minutes against Turkey for the former Spurs man, he was replaced by Weghorst to great effect. However, with Koeman likely to want to utilise those powers off of the bench once again, he may likely opt instead to start Malen, after his impressive brace in the round of 16 against Romania.\n\nElsewhere in the team there will be a familiar story throughout. Jerdy Schouten and Tijjani Reijnders will partner in the deeper midfield in what has been a very impressive tandem deal, led in front by Xavi Simons. The attack will boast the aforementioned Malen with Depay and Liverpool's Cody Gakpo, who may well be the player of the tournament so far.\n\nRelated Netherlands 2-1 Turkey: Player Ratings and Match Highlights\n\nThe Netherlands will face England in their bid to reach the EURO 2024 final.\n\nThe defence will also consist of the same recruits. Denzel Dumfries will be preferred on the right-hand side instead of Jeremie Frimpong, with Koeman speaking out previously about his preference for a more defensive-minded fullback, something he went on the record to say Frimpong lacks. Ake will also likely keep his place on the left-hand side instead of Micky Van de Ven, despite the Spurs man's fine cameo against Turkey.\n\nVirgil Van Dijk will continue his excellent partnership with Stefan de Vrij, and Brighton stopper Bart Verbruggen will continue in goal.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

We're through to our third semi-final in four attempts but that's not where we want it to end.\"\n\nKoeman is proud of his squad for coming this far in the tournament ahead of the clash against England.\n\nHe said: \"For the whole nation, it's something special.

Netherlands in Euro 2024 semi-final", "body": "Dortmund (Germany) (AFP) - England take on the Netherlands on Wednesday in Dortmund in a Euro 2024 semi-final clash, bidding to lift a major trophy for the first time since the 1966 World Cup.\n\nHere AFP Sport looks at five of the key battles in the game with the Three Lions vying with the Euro 1988 winners to reach the final in Berlin on July 14.\n\nKane v Van Dijk\n\nEngland striker Harry Kane has endured an underwhelming tournament, far from the goal machine he proved in his first season at Bayern Munich.\n\nFinishing the season with a back problem, Kane clearly is nowhere close to his physical peak and now must tussle with Liverpool defender Virgil van Dijk.\n\nThe giant Dutchman has not been at his best either but like his team, has improved in the knock-out rounds.\n\nWith England coach Gareth Southgate reluctant to take off his stars, keeping Kane marshalled could go a long way to stopping the somewhat limited threat England have thus far been capable of offering.\n\nTrippier v Dumfries\n\nSouthgate's decision to play with Kieran Trippier on the left of defence has drawn criticism for being too defensive as it denies England any width on that flank.\n\nHowever if there is any match where his presence could prove vital it is against the Netherlands.\n\nDutch right-back Denzel Dumfries leapt to fame for his buccaneering runs down the right in Euro 2020 and he has been a menace again this summer.\n\nThe always-enterprising Dumfries set up his team's winner against Turkey in the quarter-final with a dangerous raking cross.\n\nTrippier's primary job will be to keep Dumfries out of the game, which is no easy task.\n\nDutch left v England right\n\nLiverpool winger Cody Gakpo is the joint-top scorer at the Euros with three goals and has been the Netherlands' key attacking threat.\n\nMost of their dangerous moves rely on his involvement at some point in the process, but in England right-back Kyle Walker he faces a tough defender to get the better of.\n\nThe Manchester City man can match Gakpo for pace and Southgate will instruct Bukayo Saka to be diligent in his tracking back to help minimise the threat down the Netherlands' left flank.\n\nAt the other end Arsenal's Saka faces off with a familiar foe in City's Nathan Ake, who has fared well against him at club level, but still names the England winger as one of his toughest opponents.\n\nBellingham v Schouten and Reijnders\n\nWhile England and Real Madrid midfielder Jude Bellingham has not hit top form yet, he has played a decisive role at key moments in England's run to the semi-finals.\n\nThe 21-year-old's most dramatic contribution was a stunning overhead kick against Slovakia late in the last 16 clash to save England from elimination.\n\nNetherlands will be looking to their deeper-lying midfield duo Tijjani Reijnders and Jerdy Schouten to keep Bellingham under wraps.\n\nThe Dutch pair have fared well together and coach Ronald Koeman seems all-in on them now after starting Joey Veerman against Austria but hauling him off in the first half as the Dutch fell to defeat in their third group game.\n\nSouthgate v Koeman\n\nThe managers' substitutions may well play a vital role in the outcome of the game, as was evidenced in both of these teams' quarter-final wins.\n\nSouthgate brought on Luke Shaw, Cole Palmer and others and England rapidly levelled against Switzerland with just 10 minutes to go.\n\nThree of Southgate's substitutes -- Ivan Toney, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Palmer -- also converted their penalties in England's 5-3 shoot-out win.\n\nNetherlands' Euro 1988 captain Koeman, meanwhile, threw on Wout Weghorst with his team 1-0 down at half-time against Turkey and secured a 2-1 win.\n\nThe six-foot-six Burnley target man put the proverbial cat among the pigeons and is raring to do so again against England, where his club career hit a bump in the road.", "source": {"uri": "france24.com",

It was a better performance from England who were held to a 1-1 draw against an impressive Switzerland side over the 120 minutes, with the Netherlands up next after their 2-1 win over Turkey.\n\nLuke Shaw made his first appearance of the tournament off the bench in England's last outing, with the Manchester United defender in line to start for Southgate's side this evening. The winner of the clash will take on Spain in the final after their 2-1 win over France last night.\n\nSo can England reach a second consecutive Euros final later today? Let's take a look...\n\nWe simulated Netherlands vs England to get a score prediction\n\nTo complete this simulation, we used the EA FC 24 Euro 2024 game mode and updated the squads with the latest injuries and suspensions.\n\nWe predict that the Netherlands could set up in a 4-2-3-1 formation, with their line-up as follows: Verbruggen; Dumfries, De Vrij, Van Dijk, Ake; Reijnders, Schouten; Bergwijn, Simons, Gakpo; Depay.\n\nWe predict that England could line up in a 3-4-2-1 formation, with their starting XI as follows: Pickford; Walker, Stones, Konsa; Saka, Mainoo, Rice, Shaw; Bellingham, Foden; Kane.\n\nIt was a shaky start by England in Dortmund, with the Netherlands seeing more of the ball and creating more chances in the opening stages of the game. A long-range strike from Memphis Depay stung the gloves of Jordan Pickford early on, and the Dutch should've been one goal ahead when Virgil van Dijk rattled the post with a header from a corner.\n\nSouthgate's side failed to register a shot on target in the first half, and the Netherlands came close once again before the break when Cody Gakpo powered a shot towards goal from the right, forcing Pickford into a tremendous reaction save. After riding their luck for the opening hour or so, Southgate looked to his bench for inspiration.\n\nCole Palmer, Kieran Trippier, and Trent Alexander-Arnold were all introduced, and a moment of class from the latter saw England take the lead against the run of play.\n\nCollecting the ball on the right, Alexander-Arnold played a one-two with Declan Rice to burst down the wing and ease past his marker. The Liverpool defender picked out Jude Bellingham's run into the box with a pin-point driven cross, and the midfielder fired into the roof of the net with a first-time finish to send the Three Lions into a 1-0 lead.\n\nA goal down, the Netherlands started to throw more bodies forward in the final 15 minutes as they searched for an equaliser, leaving more space for England to attack. Southgate's side missed a wonderful chance to double their lead when they hit their opponents on the break, but despite the four-on-two situation, a poor cross from Palmer evaded Harry Kane at the far post as the opportunity was wasted.\n\nThe final few minutes of the game saw England put all 11 players behind the ball, and the Three Lions managed to hold on to book their spot in the Euro 2024 final on Sunday.\n\nEA FC 24 predicted final score: Netherlands 0-1 England\n\nWhat do you think the score will be between England and Netherlands?

Netherlands on Wednesday in Dortmund in a Euro 2024 semi-final clash, bidding to lift a major trophy for the first time since the 1966 World Cup.\n\nHere AFP Sport looks at five of the key battles in the game with the Three Lions vying with the Euro 1988 winners to reach the final in Berlin on July 14.\n\nKane v Van Dijk\n\nEngland striker Harry Kane has endured an underwhelming tournament, far from the goal machine he proved in his first season at Bayern Munich.\n\nFinishing the season with a back problem, Kane clearly is nowhere close to his physical peak and now must tussle with Liverpool defender Virgil van Dijk.\n\nThe giant Dutchman has not been at his best either but like his team, has improved in the knock-out rounds.\n\nWith England coach Gareth Southgate reluctant to take off his stars, keeping Kane marshalled could go a long way to stopping the somewhat limited threat England have thus far been capable of offering.\n\nTrippier v Dumfries\n\nSouthgate's decision to play with Kieran Trippier on the left of defence has drawn criticism for being too defensive as it denies England any width on that flank.\n\nHowever if there is any match where his presence could prove vital it is against the Netherlands.\n\nDutch right-back Denzel Dumfries leapt to fame for his buccaneering runs down the right in Euro 2020 and he has been a menace again this summer.\n\nThe always-enterprising Dumfries set up his team's winner against Turkey in the quarter-final with a dangerous raking cross.\n\nTrippier's primary job will be to keep Dumfries out of the game, which is no easy task.\n\nDutch left v England right\n\nLiverpool winger Cody Gakpo is the joint-top scorer at the Euros with three goals and has been the Netherlands' key attacking threat.\n\nMost of their dangerous moves rely on his involvement at some point in the process, but in England right-back Kyle Walker he faces a tough defender to get the better of.\n\nThe Manchester City man can match Gakpo for pace and Southgate will instruct Bukayo Saka to be diligent in his tracking back to help minimise the threat down the Netherlands' left flank.\n\nAt the other end Arsenal's Saka faces off with a familiar foe in City's Nathan Ake, who has fared well against him at club level, but still names the England winger as one of his toughest opponents.\n\nBellingham v Schouten and Reijnders\n\nWhile England and Real Madrid midfielder Jude Bellingham has not hit top form yet, he has played a decisive role at key moments in England's run to the semi-finals.\n\nThe 21-year-old's most dramatic contribution was a stunning overhead kick against Slovakia late in the last 16 clash to save England from elimination.\n\nNetherlands will be looking to their deeper-lying midfield duo Tijjani Reijnders and Jerdy Schouten to keep Bellingham under wraps.\n\nThe Dutch pair have fared well together and coach Ronald Koeman seems all-in on them now after starting Joey Veerman against Austria but hauling him off in the first half as the Dutch fell to defeat in their third group game.\n\nSouthgate v Koeman\n\nThe managers' substitutions may well play a vital role in the outcome of the game, as was evidenced in both of these teams' quarter-final wins.\n\nSouthgate brought on Luke Shaw, Cole Palmer and others and England rapidly levelled against Switzerland with just 10 minutes to go.\n\nThree of Southgate's substitutes -- Ivan Toney, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Palmer -- also converted their penalties in England's 5-3 shoot-out win.\n\nNetherlands' Euro 1988 captain Koeman, meanwhile, threw on Wout Weghorst with his team 1-0 down at half-time against Turkey and secured a 2-1 win.\n\nThe six-foot-six Burnley target man put the proverbial cat among the pigeons and is raring to do so again against England, where his club career hit a bump in the road.", "source": {"uri": "today.rtl.lu", "dataType": "news", "title": "RTL Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

From hostility and beer thrown at him following their draw with Slovenia in Cologne, to dancing in front of jubilant fans after the quarter-final win on penalties against Switzerland in Dusseldorf.\n\nThere is a growing belief Southgate's eight years in charge will come to an end after Euro 2024, whether that is following Wednesday's meeting with the Dutch or a final against Spain in Berlin on Sunday.\n\nEngland's performances have been indifferent, but a mix of steely resilience and individual brilliance has placed them in the last four with the tantalising prospect of two contrasting conclusions to the tournament, and perhaps to Southgate's tenure.\n\nIf England lift the trophy at the Olympiastadion on Sunday, Southgate will go down in history, after 1966 World Cup winner Sir Alf Ramsey, as only the second manager to lead the men's team to success at a major tournament.\n\nIf his side go out to the Dutch, Southgate will be the manager who consistently led his team into what had been alien territory for so long, namely the latter stages of major tournaments, but could not quite get them over the line for the ultimate triumph.\n\nEngland victories against the Netherlands and Spain would deliver Southgate's definitive answer to questions about his tactics and perceived conservative approach, which have shrouded his eight years despite an unprecedented record of leading them to three semi-finals and a final - the Wembley loss on penalties to Italy at Euro 2020.\n\nThe caveat to all this is England have failed to clear the final hurdle, which is why so much rests on events at Westfalenstadion on Wednesday.\n\nSouthgate has suffered at times in Germany, his voice faltering and hesitant when asked by BBC 5 Live Sport whether he was hurt by the criticism after the Slovenia encounter.\n\nHe visibly bristled when questioned about whether England had landed in the more favourable half of the draw, labelling it \"a classic example of the entitlement we have as a nation that creates drama and annoys our opponents\".\n\nHe has not lost his composure publicly, but there has been an edge and angst to Southgate that has not been present at other tournaments. It is clear the criticism has wounded him.\n\n\"This is a job where you get ridiculed and your professional capability is questioned beyond belief,\" he said. \"I don't think it's normal to have beer thrown at you either, but my life's taken me through a lot of resilience and it's made me more determined. I'm just using it as fuel.\"\n\nEngland did, after all, win Group C almost in spite of themselves. The small number of people hurling beer behaved unacceptably and lacked in the respect Southgate is due.\n\nHis delight at flipping the angry reaction on its head with the win against Switzerland was made plain by his impromptu jig in front of fans who had turned on England and the manager during and after their group-game draws against Denmark and Slovenia.\n\nSouthgate also complained about the media - purely doing its job to inform and not in attendance at Euro 2024 as cheerleaders - for revealing changes in formation before the Switzerland game, referring \"our own media leaking tactical information two hours after we've walked off the training pitch\".\n\nThis, more than anything, hints at an England camp that had not been as tight as at previous tournaments and appeared, at times, to be flat, in the early part of Euro 2024 at least.\n\nFor all that, the Three Lions are in the semi-final with a chance for Southgate and his players to write a glorious new chapter in their sporting history.\n\nHe cut a relaxed figure in his media briefing at Westfalenstadion, suggesting there was a different mood and drive around the squad as they have progressed through Euro 2024.\n\nSouthgate said: \"One of our strengths over the years has been having less fear, showing less inhibition but, at the beginning of the tournament, the expectation weighed heavily and the noise from outside had never been louder. We couldn't quite get ourselves in the right place.\n\n\"Now it's about what is possible and not what might go wrong. This is now the chance to make history. We are trying to break new ground and that is not easy but the players have been resilient.\"\n\nThe manager has had praise for his work too, as former England striker Chris Sutton told BBC 5 Live Sport after they reached the last four: \"Gareth Southgate has proved a hell of a lot of people wrong at this tournament. I'm delighted for him. Gareth talked about beer being thrown at him in certain games and what have you... that is not the way to treat an England manager.\n\n\"You think about his record as England manager. Out of the last four tournaments, three semi-finals and a quarter-final, with a final in there as well. You have people saying he's not an inventive manager and he's a poor manager, he's done it again. Gareth South-great.\"\n\nEngland face an old adversary in Netherlands coach Ronald Koeman, who played in their 3-1 win over Sir Bobby Robson's side in the 1988 European Championship in Dusseldorf, but was also an infamous figure for his part in a World Cup qualifier between the sides in October 1993.\n\nKoeman dragged David Platt back when he was clean through with the scoreline goalless, escaped with only a yellow card, then scored a free-kick five minutes later as England - needing just a point to qualify for the 1994 finals - went down to a damaging 2-0 defeat. He had finished his international career before England's stunning 4-1 Wembley win at Euro '96.\n\nIn his second spell in charge, Koeman has led the Netherlands into the semi-final and looking increasingly confident and dangerous, having recovered from a 3-2 loss to Austria in the group stage. They will present a stern examination.\n\nBut England and Southgate find themselves two games from history.\n\nAnd the history books would simply record England's achievement - not how they played to write that new chapter.\n\nIt will either end with Euro 2024 glory or another bitter disappointment of Southgate and his team falling short once more. This much goes on the line in Dortmund.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The Netherlands beat Romania in the Round of 16 (3-0) and Turkey (2-1) in the quarterfinal to set up the showdown vs. England.\n\n\"We're here for a reason, Holland are here for a reason and may the best team win,\" England midfielder Declan Rice said.\n\nEngland has never won the Euros, finishing runner-up in 2020, while the Netherlands won the tournament back in 1988.\n\nFollow along for live updates from Wednesday's match in Dortmund:\n\nDefender Marc Guehi returns for England after missing the quarterfinal due to suspension and replaces Ezri Konsa.\n\nEngland: Jordan Pickford; Kyle Walker, Marc Guehi, John Stones, Kieran Trippier; Declan Rice, Kobbie Mainoo, Bukayo Saka; Jude Bellingham, Phil Foden, Harry Kane (c)\n\nNetherlands: Bart Verbruggen; Denzel Dumfries, Virgil van Dijk (c), Stefan de Vrij, Nathan Ake; Tijjani Reijnders, Jerdy Schouten, Xavi Simons; Donyell Malen, Cody Gakpo, Memphis Depay\n\nJim Reineking: Netherlands 2, England 1 - When will England's inevitable choke in a major international tournament happen? It had to sweat out wins against Slovakia in the Round of 16 (two very late goals to win) and Switzerland in the quarterfinals (in a penalty shootout). Well, England's luck will run out Wednesday against the Netherlands. Led by Golden Boot candidate Cody Gakpo, the Netherlands has displayed a more potent offense than England so far (nine goals vs. five for the Three Lions) and that will be the difference in reaching Sunday's final vs. Spain.\n\nJesse Yomtov: England 1, Netherlands 1 (ENG wins in penalties) - Say what you will about England's crawl to the semifinals, but the team showed incredible resolve in its two knockout round wins to grab late equalizers and force extra time against Slovakia and Switzerland. This game should be more open than some of England's other contests in this tournament and the Three Lions can be expected to look more dangerous in attack.\n\nTijjani Reijnders stars for Netherlands\n\n25-year-old midfielder Tijjani Reijnders has been a key player for Holland at Euro 2024. He joined AC Milan last season and played 50 games in all competitions for the Italian giants.\n\nJude Bellingham has history with semifinal referee\n\nGerman referee Felix Zwayer has been appointed to officiate the Euro 2024 semifinal between England and the Netherlands in Dortmund, and is an official with whom Jude Bellingham has previously clashed with in the same stadium.\n\nIn 2021, when Bellingham was at Borussia Dortmund, the England midfielder received a fine of 40,000 euros for comments he made regarding Zwayer following his side's 3-2 defeat by Bayern Munich.\n\n\"You can look at a lot of the decisions in the game. You give a referee, that has match-fixed before, the biggest game in Germany. What do you expect?\" Bellingham said at the time.\n\nHis comments referenced a period in Zwayer's career which he would have preferred to put behind him.\n\nIn 2005, referee Robert Hoyzer was sentenced to two years and five months in prison for his role in a massive match-fixing scandal which rocked German football, and although Zwayer was one of those who reported his suspicions, he too was punished.\n\nZwayer was given a six-month ban by the German Football Federation (DFB) for accepting 300 euros from Hoyzer for agreeing to make incorrect decisions during a game while he was an assistant referee.\n\nHe took a short break after Bellingham's comments, but since then has refereed the 2023 Nations League final and at Euro 2024 Zwayer has taken charge of three games before the semi-final.\n\nEngland has never won the European championships. The country's best finish was in 2021 as the runner-up, losing to Italy in penalty kicks.\n\nEngland's Declan Rice: 'May the best team win'\n\nDeclan Rice is taking England's Euro 2024 semi-final against the Netherlands in his stride and believes they have the momentum to beat the Dutch and win their first-ever European Championship.\n\n\"It's business as usual ... I don't put too much pressure on myself, I don't think about it too much,\" Rice told England's Lions' Den program..\n\n\"We're here for a reason, Holland are here for a reason and may the best team win. It's a game of football, we feel like we've got a really good bit of momentum on our side,\" Rice added.\n\nThe statistics underline Rice's contribution for England, covering more distance in the tournament than any other player at 63.9km (39.7 miles) over five matches, with the fourth most tackles and balls recovered.\n\n- Reuters\n\nBukayo Saka, England stayed loose with golf outing\n\nBukayo Saka won plaudits for striking the ball so sweetly in England's quarter-final win over Switzerland and did it again on his golf debut at the weekend even if his celebrations were spoiled by an embarrassing tumble over the golf bag.\n\nBeginner's luck it may have been but Saka, who equalized against the Swiss and converted his penalty in the 5-3 shootout win, shone when England were treated to some golf on their day off on Sunday.\n\n\"Oh my goodness - best shot of my life,\" Saka said after his first effort.\n\nHe struck the ball well on his next attempt too and while enjoying generous applause he stumbled comically, prompting laughter and ridicule from teammates. The distraction could be just what England need ahead of their semi-final with Netherlands on Wednesday, when they aim to reach their second successive Euros final.\n\nGareth Southgate is exactly what England need as a leader and he has instilled a sense of togetherness in a team who have grown stronger during Euro 2024 and have never been more motivated, defender Luke Shaw said on Monday.\n\n\"He really took us to the next level, no manager has really been as successful as him as what he's been doing recently,\" Shaw told a press conference.\n\n- Reuters\n\nNetherlands faced travel disruption getting to Dortmund\n\nNetherlands coach Ronald Koeman shrugged off the travel disruption faced by his squad on Tuesday and said the team were well rested ahead of Wednesday's European Championship semi-final against England.\n\nThe Dutch were forced to abandon their plans to travel to Dortmund by train from their base at Wolfsburg, after the service was canceled due to a blockage on the route, the Dutch Football Association said.\n\nInstead, they flew to Dortmund, arriving at their hotel some four hours later than planned.\n\n\"It was not a problem, we had a good rest this afternoon, we were on the plane for just 30 minutes, arrived at our hotel and we can have a good rest tonight,\" Koeman said in an interview with UEFA after his scheduled pre-match press conference had to be canceled because of the travel delay.\n\nThe final for Euro 2024 will be played at the Olympiastadion in Berlin on Sunday, July 14. The venue previously hosted the 2006 World Cup final (Italy defeated France) and 2015 UEFA Champions League final.\n\nWe occasionally recommend interesting products and services.

Euro 2024 semi-final clash, bidding to lift a major trophy for the first time since the 1966 World Cup.\n\nHere AFP Sport looks at five of the key battles in the game with the Three Lions vying with the Euro 1988 winners to reach the final in Berlin on July 14.\n\nEngland striker Harry Kane has endured an underwhelming tournament, far from the goal machine he proved in his first season at Bayern Munich.\n\nFinishing the season with a back problem, Kane clearly is nowhere close to his physical peak and now must tussle with Liverpool defender Virgil van Dijk.\n\nThe giant Dutchman has not been at his best either but like his team, has improved in the knock-out rounds.\n\nWith England coach Gareth Southgate reluctant to take off his stars, keeping Kane marshalled could go a long way to stopping the somewhat limited threat England have thus far been capable of offering.\n\nSouthgate's decision to play with Kieran Trippier on the left of defence has drawn criticism for being too defensive as it denies England any width on that flank.\n\nHowever if there is any match where his presence could prove vital it is against the Netherlands.\n\nDutch right-back Denzel Dumfries leapt to fame for his buccaneering runs down the right in Euro 2020 and he has been a menace again this summer.\n\nThe always-enterprising Dumfries set up his team's winner against Turkey in the quarter-final with a dangerous raking cross.\n\nTrippier's primary job will be to keep Dumfries out of the game, which is no easy task.\n\nLiverpool winger Cody Gakpo is the joint-top scorer at the Euros with three goals and has been the Netherlands' key attacking threat.\n\nMost of their dangerous moves rely on his involvement at some point in the process, but in England right-back Kyle Walker he faces a tough defender to get the better of.\n\nThe Manchester City man can match Gakpo for pace and Southgate will instruct Bukayo Saka to be diligent in his tracking back to help minimise the threat down the Netherlands' left flank.\n\nAt the other end Arsenal's Saka faces off with a familiar foe in City's Nathan Ake, who has fared well against him at club level, but still names the England winger as one of his toughest opponents.\n\nWhile England and Real Madrid midfielder Jude Bellingham has not hit top form yet, he has played a decisive role at key moments in England's run to the semi-finals.\n\nThe 21-year-old's most dramatic contribution was a stunning overhead kick against Slovakia late in the last 16 clash to save England from elimination.\n\nNetherlands will be looking to their deeper-lying midfield duo Tijjani Reijnders and Jerdy Schouten to keep Bellingham under wraps.\n\nThe Dutch pair have fared well together and coach Ronald Koeman seems all-in on them now after starting Joey Veerman against Austria but hauling him off in the first half as the Dutch fell to defeat in their third group game.\n\nThe managers' substitutions may well play a vital role in the outcome of the game, as was evidenced in both of these teams' quarter-final wins.\n\nSouthgate brought on Luke Shaw, Cole Palmer and others and England rapidly levelled against Switzerland with just 10 minutes to go.\n\nThree of Southgate's substitutes -- Ivan Toney, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Palmer -- also converted their penalties in England's 5-3 shoot-out win.\n\nNetherlands' Euro 1988 captain Koeman, meanwhile, threw on Wout Weghorst with his team 1-0 down at half-time against Turkey and secured a 2-1 win.\n\nThe six-foot-six Burnley target man put the proverbial cat among the pigeons and is raring to do so again against England, where his club career hit a bump in the road.", "source": {"uri": "newagebd.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "New Age | The Most Popular

England went on to clinically dispatch all five of their penalties and Jordan Pickford saved from Manuel Akanji, so for the second round running, Southgate's side squeezed through.\n\nHaving previously limped through the group phase, then required Jude Bellingham's stunning strike to spark a fightback against Slovakia, it has been a far from convincing journey to this point - but results are all that matter in knockout football.\n\nSouthgate's 101st game in charge will see England try to become just the sixth team to make consecutive European Championship finals, and a familiar foe stands between them and a place in Sunday's showpiece in Berlin.\n\nThe Three Lions now face a fourth major-tournament meeting with the Netherlands: the Oranje won 3-1 en route to glory at Euro '88, thanks to a Marco van Basten hat-trick, then a forgettable goalless draw at the 1990 World Cup was followed by a famous 4-1 England win in 1996.\n\nHowever, having won just one of the nations' last nine meetings in all competitions, precedent is not on the side of an English team packed with attacking talent but yet to find rhythm or inspire confidence among their fans.\n\nThe most recent of those nine encounters also came in a semi-final, with the Netherlands winning 3-1 after extra time in the UEFA Nations League - both Southgate and Ronald Koeman were in the dugouts on that occasion too.\n\nLast weekend, the latter guided his country to a first Euro semi since 2004 by beating a spirited Turkey side at Berlin's Olympiastadion, and - like England - the Dutch required a comeback to seal their place in the final four.\n\nA goal down and apparently heading for the exit, an unlikely saviour stepped forth, as Stefan de Vrij pulled his team level on 70 minutes, before the lurking threat of tournament specialist Cody Gakpo forced an own goal from Mert Muldur soon after.\n\nSeeking their second European title, after lifting the Henri Delaunay trophy in Germany 36 summers ago, Koeman's men are making their way through the so-called 'weaker' half of the draw, having only emerged from Group D in third place.\n\nFollowing victory over Poland, a draw with France, and an eventful defeat to Austria, the Oranje were handed a relatively kind last-16 tie against Romania, in which they ultimately ran out 3-0 winners.\n\nHowever, a squad led by captain Virgil van Dijk will attempt to win just a second European Championship semi-final tie for the Netherlands; and with a dismal record of four losses from the previous five, the burden of history weighs heavily on their shoulders.\n\nNetherlands European Championship form:\n\nWDLWW\n\nNetherlands form (all competitions):\n\nWWDLWW\n\nEngland European Championship form:\n\nWDDWW\n\nEngland form (all competitions):\n\nLWDDWW\n\nTeam News\n\nAs the only specialist left-back in Gareth Southgate's squad, the return of Luke Shaw has been eagerly awaited: the Manchester United defender missed England's first four matches while completing his return from a hamstring injury, but after appearing briefly against Switzerland he has now declared himself ready to start.\n\nHaving impressed earlier in the tournament, Marc Guehi must now battle it out with Ezri Konsa for a place in defence upon his return from suspension, though it remains to be seen whether it will be a three or four-man rearguard that lines up in Dortmund - or a hybrid of both.\n\nHarry Kane was taken off during extra time last weekend, but having since confirmed he was only suffering from cramp, the Three Lions' record goalscorer will be fit to build on a fine record in the European Championship's knockout phase: no player has ever scored more times in the elimination rounds (five, level with Antoine Griezmann).\n\nThe Netherlands, meanwhile, have a major selection call to make in the final third, as the half-time introduction of Wout Weghorst against Turkey turned their quarter-final tie on its head.\n\nRonald Koeman - who has just announced that he will stay in post until 2026 - has left the door open to the Burnley striker partnering Memphis Depay from the start; however, another impact role from the bench is more probable. Either one or both of Depay and Cody Gakpo have been directly involved in 63.5% of the Oranje's goal attempts so far this summer, and six of their nine goals.\n\nKoeman is likely to stick with his starting XI on Wednesday evening, with Bart Verbruggen in goal, Virgil van Dijk skippering the side from central defence, and Xavi Simons playing a link-up role between midfield and attack.\n\nNetherlands possible starting lineup:\n\nVerbruggen; Dumfries, De Vrij, Van Dijk, Ake; Schouten, Reijnders; Malen, Simons, Gakpo; Depay\n\nEngland possible starting lineup:\n\nPickford; Walker, Stones, Guehi; Saka, Mainoo, Rice, Trippier; Bellingham, Foden; Kane\n\nWe say: Netherlands 2-1 England (after extra time)\n\nWhile each game sees a fresh page written, England's history against their Dutch counterparts has been littered with defeats: of all nations they have faced more than 20 times to date, only versus Brazil do they have a lower win-rate (27%).\n\nThat trend could continue in the Euro 2024 semi-finals, as the Oranje's talented attackers are starting to click and will surely punish another tame Three Lions performance. If Southgate's side cannot improve, they are set to miss out on the final.\n\nFor data analysis of the most likely results, scorelines and more for this match please click here.\n\nbody check tags

The Netherlands have arrived in the knockouts without consistent performance, but they have improved. They have played good football in the knockout stage. So far, England hasn't performed as one would have expected from such a star-studded team.\n\nThe Netherlands have been Euro champions in the past century and have made three appearances in the semi-finals of the tournament, though they have never progressed beyond that stage. Ronald Koeman, the Dutch manager, has led his side to Wednesday's clash after beating Turkey in Berlin.\n\nIn the quarter-finals, the Netherlands went into half-time trailing against a highly spirited Turkey 1-0. However, the Oranje team came in the second half with much more determination. After Stefan de Vrij scored the equaliser in the 70th minute, the Oranje sealed their place in the semi-final after Cody Gakpo forced an own goal from Mert Mulder.\n\nTheir group-stage fixture saw them win against Poland, draw with France, and lose 3-2 to Austria. Their last-16 tie against Romania was a cakewalk, and they eventually won the game 3-0.\n\nEngland arrived for their third major tournament semi-final after their last four appearances, but they were on the brink of elimination throughout the tournament this time. Under Gareth Southgate, England have progressed in the backstages of both the World Cup and the Euro. To their credit, though, he has just one runners-up medal during his tenure.\n\nThe English team are playing in their fourth European Championship semi-final after beating Switzerland in the quarter-finals. Trailing Rossocrociati after a late Breel Embolo goal, England levelled in the 80th minute with Bukayo Saka's goal. This forced the game into extra time, which was ultimately decided by spot kicks.\n\nThe Three Lions haven't been the most impressive side in the group stage, with two draws and one solitary win. In the round of 16 against Slovakia, Jude Bellinghma's bicycle kick sparked a fightback to manage a 2-1 win in extra time. In fact, their elimination stage performance is far from convincing. In Southgate's 101st game, England will now try to become the sixth side to play in consecutive Euro finals.\n\nLuke Shaw is the only specialist left-back in Gareth Southgate's squad. The Manchester United defender missed the tournament's first four games due to his recovery from a hamstring injury. He briefly appeared in the game against Switzerland and has now declared himself fit to start in the semi-finals. He is unlikely to do so, as both Kieran Trippier and Bukayo Saka are most likely to occupy either flank.\n\nMarc Guehi was impressive at the start of the tournament but will now need to fight for his place against Exri Konsa in central defence as he returns from suspension. It is unclear whether it will be in a three or four-man rearguard or a mix of both. After suffering cramps, Harry Kane needed to be taken off the field during the quarter-finals. However, he seems fit to start against the Dutch side.\n\nNetherlands have an important decision to make as the half-time introduction of Wout Weghorst helped Oranje take the game to their side. Koeman would like to partner the Burnley striker with Memphis Depay from the start. However, the success of Depay and Cody Gapko is irreplaceable. They have been involved in 63.5% of Oranje's goal attempts this summer, individually or as a duo. They have been involved in six of their nine goals.\n\nThe Dutch team will likely stay with their starting XI, though right-winger Steven Bergwijn has been withdrawn at half-time during both knockout games, and Donyell Malen may replace him. Virgil van Dijk will captain his team from the central defence, while Xavi Simons will continue to play the link-up role in the Dutch attack. Jerdy Schouten and Tijjani Reijnders will stay active in the midfield area.\n\nThe two teams have a long and rich history of playing against each other. Both sides have been involved in nine draws, with Netherlands winning seven of their encounters and England winning six. The two sides have played quite a few crucial games against each other and are yet again playing for a place in the European Championship finals. In more recent years, England has often been upstaged by the Dutch side. While Netherlands have turned up for most of their knockout games, bringing their A game, England haven't found the rhythm and will need their star bench to now fire as they close the gap between themselves and the trophy.\n\nNetherlands:\n\nVerbruggen; Dumfries, De Vrij, Van Dijk, Ake; Schouten, Reijnders; Malen, Simons, Gakpo; Depay\n\nEngland:\n\nPickford; Walker, Stones, Guehi; Saka,

It has been a tough tournament for England who, despite having made it to the semi-finals, have received some brutal analysis for their poor performances throughout the tournament.\n\nTerry, who played in four international tournaments during his career and appeared 78 times for his country, has made his feelings clear on some of his former teammates who have piled the pressure onto Southgate, while also suggesting that England are capable of beating anyone in the competition.\n\nRelated Why Gareth Southgate Has Banned England Squad From Discussing Penalties\n\nThe tactic certainly seems to have worked.\n\nTerry Slams Hypocritical Ex-England Players The former defender doesn't care how England win\n\nSpeaking on Instagram Live, one of the the Premier League's greatest ever defenders stated how he didn't care if Southgate's side played well as long as they won their games.\n\n\"Funny how all of these ex-players and pundits think England are good again all of a sudden. I couldn't give a s*** how we play as long as we win.\n\n\"Those ex-players and pundits never got past a quarter-final by the way. Lot of people saying [Cole] Palmer should start - again I think he's done enough, what a season he's had. Who comes out? Hard to be England manager. I am all about getting out the group me, no matter how you do it, get out the group. Look at Argentina in the World Cup, lose their first game and go on to win it. Greece 2004, very average team go on and win it.\n\n\"I think we'd all agree if we get to the final we need to be better but in a one-off game I actually fancy us against anybody, I think this group are special.

They are doing so well.\"\n\nSouthgate pointed to England's opponents using defensive formations and also blamed the grass in Germany for hampering his players.\n\n\"We're not able to score a load of goals at the moment, but we've played three teams that play a back five, well-organised defences,\" he continued.\n\n\"Pitches are a little bit bobbly so sometimes you need the extra touch and then the space is gone. None of this is easy, but we're in a third semifinal in four tournaments.\"\n\nAfter reaching the 2018 World Cup semifinals and being beaten in the Euro 2020 final on penalties by Italy, England began this tournament as one of the two favourites along with France.\n\nLes Bleus have also played in a rather tedious, yet adequate, fashion to reach the other semifinal, facing Spain.\n\nSouthgate noted even La Roja, who by contrast have dazzled this summer in Germany, modified their style to be more direct as they beat the hosts in the quarter-finals.\n\n\"It's not just about playing well -- Spain mixed their game up, they took seven yellow cards, they found ways to win,\" said the coach.\n\nThey now face a Dutch team whose five games have produced nearly double the number of goals as in England's, despite playing 60 minutes less.\n\nIn Liverpool's Cody Gakpo and Burnley target man Wout Weghorst, Ronald Koeman's side have a variety of different tools to create havoc at the other end, leading to hope of a more entertaining, higher-calibre clash.\n\nOne bone of contention England fans have had with Southgate is his reluctance to make changes.\n\nCole Palmer, arguably the player of the season in England, has not started a game in Germany, while Ollie Watkins would offer the ability to run in behind that Kane can no longer muster. Anthony Gordon, who would add dynamism on the left, has gone virtually ignored.\n\nDespite some decisive moments Jude Bellingham has looked jaded after his exploits with Real Madrid and Phil Foden is operating at a far lower level than with Manchester City.\n\nSouthgate only rang the changes against Switzerland after falling behind, before Bukayo Saka's fine strike from distance pulled England level.\n\nThere are concerns that like in the World Cup 2018 semi-final against Croatia, if Southgate is too reactive rather than proactive, England could lose control of the game against better opposition.\n\nIf they can defeat The Netherlands with a convincing display instead of another isolated moment of brilliance, it will give the team hope ahead of a potential final.\n\nFans tossed beer cups at Southgate during a dull goalless draw with Slovenia but all will be forgiven if England triumph in Berlin on July 14.\n\n\"I don't think it is normal to have beer thrown at you,\" said Southgate.\n\n\"But we will keep grinding, keep fighting and keep enjoying this journey.\"", "source": {"uri": "jordantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jordan Times"}, "authors": [],

The Brentford attacker also played a role in Bellingham's goal against Slovakia after coming on the pitch in the 94th minute and attracting another defender to create space for Bellingham's strike on target.\n\nSouthgate could also consider other options at fullback by bringing in a natural left-footer, Luke Shaw, to replace Kieran Trippier. At the same time, Cole Palmer's dynamism in midfield could also be a boost.\n\nWhile Southgate remains a very pragmatic manager, he can reach deep into his endless pool of talented players to effect the match when he needs it most.\n\n\" READ MORE: Back this eight-leg parlay that features an Argentina win over Canada in the Copa Am\u00e9rica semifinal\n\nLike England, the Netherlands is also starving for another major tournament win. Despite producing some of the best footballers in history, the Dutch have been disappointing in these competitions with just one major tournament win (1988 Euros) in its history.\n\nSince Bert van Marwijk's appointment in 2008, Holland's last nine managers have not lasted on the job for more than two years.\n\nWhile Dutch legend Ronald Koeman is in his second stint at the helm of the Oranje, he hasn't experienced the same success as a manager that he did as a player.\n\nKoeman won domestic titles as a manager in Holland with Ajax and PSV, but when he took on bigger jobs in Spain with Barcelona and England with Southhampton and Everton, he failed to make it through two seasons.\n\nIn the final group game against Austria, Koeman left one of his best players, Xaxi Simons, on the bench before recognizing his error and bringing the PSG midfielder on in the 35th minute.\n\nAlthough Koeman is probably likelier to tinker with his lineup than Southgate, he doesn't have the same quality of players.\n\nThe Netherlands also hasn't had to endure the same challenges and frustrations as England, which appears to be knocking on the door after losing to Italy in the finals of the 2020 Euros.\n\nBetween the manager and the players, this Netherlands team seems a bit untrustworthy. It probably needs another major tournament with this group of players before it can take that next step.\n\nI've tried to fade England in back-to-back games, but perhaps the soccer gods are planning for more of an epic meltdown for England to take place in the final of a major competition.\n\nTime and again, England's depth has bailed out Southgate despite his unwillingness to take an unconventional approach in picking his starting 11. It will likely take an all-around quality team to defeat the Three Lions, and I just don't see the Netherlands as the side to do so.\n\nConsidering that these two teams are relatively evenly matched, I wouldn't be surprised if we need a penalty shootout to determine who advances to the finals.\n\nThat wouldn't bode well for the Netherlands, which lost four consecutive shootouts (Euros 1992 vs. Denmark, Euros 1996 vs. France, 1998 World Cup vs. Brazil and Euros 2000 vs. Italy) before finally winning one against Sweden at the 2004 Euros.\n\nIn the 2022 World Cup quarterfinals, the Netherlands lost another penalty shootout to Argentina, which went on to win the title.\n\nI expect England to do enough to advance, and its recent success in a penalty shootout against Switzerland should instill some confidence if it faces a similar scenario against the Dutch.", "source": {"uri": "inquirer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Philadelphia Inquirer"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Dutch football was treated as something impossibly sophisticated back then, so when Venables's tactics flummoxed the country of Johan Cruyff it was inevitable that his side's 4-1 win would still be a talking point 28 years later.\n\nThese days, though, it takes more than winning a big group game for England to capture the public's imagination. The time has passed when success is measured in cautious progress through tournaments. Expectations have gone through the roof this summer and Gareth Southgate, while proud of the advancements made during his eight years in charge, knows that the only question left to answer is whether he can push his team over the line at Euro 2024.\n\nNo one is interested in listening to talk of a third semi-final in four tournaments. In Dortmund, where England are preparing for Wednesday night's semi-final against a decent but hardly awe-inspiring Netherlands, all anyone wants to find out is whether the doubters are right about Southgate being too limited and boring to win a trophy.\n\nSome of the criticism is over the top. Nobody is pretending that England have been playing Total Football but they are defending well and their resilience against Switzerland and Slovakia owes much to Southgate.\n\nEqually there are fair questions to ask about his management. England have been unbalanced on the left and have struggled to find the right blend in midfield. They have spluttered in attack, although a lack of entertainment has been a problem for many teams during a low-scoring tournament. \"There's 13 goals fewer than the last Euros,\" Southgate said on Tuesday. \"Our sport is one where you sometimes play as well as the opponent allows you.\"\n\nCoordinated patterns are harder to implement in international football. England are not going to play like Manchester City just because they have Phil Foden, and the answer is not simply for Southgate to take off the handbrake. During their quarter-final against Switzerland last Saturday, they were better in the first half because their switch to 3-4-2-1 gave them more control in the middle.\n\nYet there are issues to resolve. Marc Gu\u00e9hi could come back in for Ezri Konsa in central defence but Kieran Trippier may continue at left wing-back, even though Luke Shaw is back after five months out with a hamstring injury. The Netherlands, who will send Denzel Dumfries marauding down the right, will look to exploit that flank. On the opposite side, they will hope that Liverpool's Cody Gakpo can continue his excellent form against Kyle Walker. If they need a goal, expect Ronald Koeman to chuck Wout Weghorst on and go direct.\n\nSouthgate has to be forward thinking if momentum swings away from England. There is no room for the kind of indecision that had them wobbling in the second half against Switzerland, making attacking changes only once they were 1-0 down.\n\nThe question is whether Southgate sees things quickly enough. He accepts his changes could come sooner, although he was also rewarded for keeping Jude Bellingham and Harry Kane on against Slovakia. \"You can force a change but if the team are in the rhythm of the game and individuals are playing pretty well, you can put freshness on, but we've still got faith in the players,\" Southgate said. \"I think the team have thrived through that support.\n\n\"I've seen a lot of other big managers hold their nerve and wait a really long time to make changes. You just have to try to have a feel of the flow of the game.\"\n\nThe hope for England is that they do not need to hit the emergency button. They need Declan Rice and Kobbie Mainoo to dominate a midfield shorn of Frenkie de Jong. The Netherlands have flaws - they were heavily criticised after losing to Austria and finishing third in their group - and were run close by Turkey in their quarter-final. Rafael Ben\u00edtez, working as a technical observer for Uefa, notes that the Dutch were vulnerable to Turkey running behind their defence.\n\nCan England do that? They have played in front of teams, building laboriously, and need to move the ball at a high tempo. Bukayo Saka is in good form and is an obvious outlet as an attacking right wing-back but Foden is not affecting the game enough and Bellingham is playing in moments. Kane's physical problems, combined with a lack of runners around him, are also clogging things up.\n\nNaturally Kane again denied that he was short of fitness. He will have seen how many chances Turkey created and will back himself against any defender - even Virgil van Dijk. \"Virgil is one of the best defenders in the world,\" Kane said. \"He's strong, powerful, quick. It might be different areas that I have to exploit and try and hurt him. It might not just be me, it might be other players that drag him out of position.\"\n\nBut if England get bogged down in the final third, or if they find themselves pinned back, it is up to Southgate to use his bench. He spoke about breaking more new ground, pointing out that England's men have never been to a final on foreign soil. He is not satisfied with another semi-final. But at BVB Stadion Dortmund, where the famous Yellow Wall is expected to turn \"Oranje\", much will depend on whether he can make bold decisions under pressure. Can he win the tactical battle? Can England finally click in attack and make it to Berlin? Can they respond if the tide turns in the second half? If not, the Southgate era will be over.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jacob_steinberg@theguardian.com", "name": "Jacob

After another dull performance, England may require a transformation in attack to reach a third major tournament final, where France or Spain will lie in wait.\n\nGareth Southgate's side have limped into the last four with tepid performances against opponents they should, on paper, have beaten easily.\n\n\"These are national events with huge pressure, with really young men in the middle of it. Our team has been under enormous pressure from the start. They're doing so well. So well,\" Southgate said.\n\n\"We're not able to score a load of goals at the moment. But again, we've played three teams that play back fives, very well organised defences.\"\n\nNetherlands, meantime, have yo-yoed through, and were 20 minutes from elimination before their fightback against Turkey in the last eight.\n\nThe Dutch have become accustomed to scrambling, however, having fallen behind in three of their four scoring games. Their three wins were all in regulation time, however, compared to one for England.\n\nThe Netherlands also have the edge in attack, their nine goals at Euro 2024 coming from 20 attempts on target against 15 by an England side spearheaded by the usually lethal but currently subdued Harry Kane, Phil Foden and Jude Bellingham.\n\nThe Dutch will bank on the tournament's joint top scorer Cody Gakpo to trouble an England defence that has been solid in contrast with their jaded attack.\n\nWhile England's progress appears surprising, given the football they have played, they were among the bookmakers' favourites ahead of the tournament.\n\nBut the Netherlands' performance has been unexpected, with the Dutch set to play in the semifinals of the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) European Football Championship for the first time in 20 years. They are aiming for their first final since their 1988 Euros triumph, their only major tournament success.\n\nExpectations and reviews of performances for the Netherlands have been as scathing as those for England. The Dutch coach Ronald Koeman has had to hit back at pundits who questioned his team's commitment, saying his players showed a big heart in coming from behind to beat Turkey.\n\n\"We need to fight to win the semifinal,\" Koeman said. \"It will be a great night on Wednesday between two big nations historically. England have good players, but we have too.\"\n\nHistorically, the Netherlands have been more successful in their encounters and beat England 3-1 in extra time in their last meeting in 2019 in the UEFA Nations League semifinal.\n\nEngland have won just one of their last nine meetings with Netherlands in all competitions (D4 L4), winning a friendly match 1-0 in Amsterdam in 2018.\n\nTheir most famous victory, and the last before that run, was at Euro 96 when Terry Venables's side stopped the likes of Denis Bergkamp and Clarence Seedorf with an exhilarating 4-1 win in the group stage. Alan Shearer and Teddy Sheringham both scored twice, while a young Patrick Kluivert came off the bench to score a consolation for Guus Hiddink's Dutch side.\n\nMuch as in the times of Bergkamp, there remains a strong English Premier League influence on both sides, which Dutch defender Micky van de Ven says could ensure an exciting semifinal.\n\nThe vast majority of the England squad are home-based while the 26-man Dutch squad at the tournament includes seven players from Premier League clubs.\n\n\"If you see the quality of the players from both teams, I think you can expect that the level and the rhythm of the game will be really high,\" Van de Ven, who plays for Tottenham Hotspur, told a press conference on Monday.\n\n\"Hopefully, it's us that will have more of the ball than England so that it is England who do the running, but I expect a high-intensity game.\"", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Jazeera Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Maybe the man who has now taken England to three semi-finals in four tournaments has finally had his fill of the abuse and the aggro that tend to come his way whether England win, lose or draw.\n\nHaving played a typically straight bat to a question about whether he and his players are afforded enough respect, he finally gave vent to his real feelings when it was subsequently put to him that he was hardened to the criticism.\n\n'This is a job where you get ridiculed and your professional capability is questioned beyond belief,' Southgate said. 'I don't think it's normal to have beer thrown at you, either.\n\n'But I'm fortunate that my life has taken me through a lot of resilience-building and it's made me more determined. I'm just using this as fuel.'\n\nIt's time to back Gareth Southgate as England prepare to face the Netherlands\n\nAlthough he can be frustrating, Southgate's tournament record is very impressive\n\nEngland showed excellent spirit as they managed to overcome Switzerland on penalties\n\nPodcast All episodes PODCAST: The REAL reason England through despite playing badly PODCAST: 'Just ONE good performance' could change England's fortunes PODCAST: Are the England team buying into Southgate's style of play? PODCAST: Is Martinez 'spineless' over Cristiano Ronaldo management? EUROS DAILY: Do you love or loathe 'main character' Cristiano Ronaldo? Play on Apple Spotify\n\nThat is as open as Southgate has ever been regarding his rather unique set of professional circumstances.\n\nAfter the surprise journey to the last four of the 2018 World Cup in Russia, a run which opened our hearts to possibilities that we had thought belonged only to other nations, the 53-year-old has slowly felt the tide of public opinion turn against him.\n\nThe morning after his team had come within a penalty shootout of winning England's first major trophy since 1966 at Wembley in the summer of 2021, Southgate was asked on a media Zoom call whether he felt he was a negative coach.\n\nFrom that point on, the label has stuck and now we have arrived at this peculiar point, where almost 26million watched England prevail against Switzerland across BBC One and the iPlayer -- and thousands more threw their beer in the air in celebration at fan parks across the country -- only to then turn the TV off or get the bus home and tell anybody who will listen the manager is not good enough.\n\nIn this context, Southgate's circumstances as England boss really are unique.\n\nPrevious coaches of the national team have had it tough, too -- Graham Taylor, Bobby Robson, Sven Goran Eriksson, Steve McClaren, Fabio Capello and Roy Hodgson. The difference is that they were placed in metaphorical stocks for losing too many matches. Southgate gets it in the neck even when he wins.\n\nHere in Germany, Southgate has not had a good tournament. It has been his worst. His tactical and in-game state of stasis has been mirrored by the largely moribund nature of England's football.\n\nNobody who has sat through England's five tournament games can argue that Southgate's team have played well. They have only won one game in regulation time, against Serbia, and have been fortunate to come through two knockout matches that could easily have been lost.\n\nThe England manager has shown himself to be inflexible and predictable with his selections\n\nNetherlands boss Ronald Koeman has also had to deal with criticism during the tournament\n\nSouthgate has shown himself to be inflexible and predictable in terms of his selections. He has, to a degree, been shown up by some of the tournament's other managers.\n\nEngland are still here, though, and under Southgate they do tend to be. His many critics will say he is simply lucky to have good players. But then many of his predecessors did, too, and before he took the job in late 2016, England had only reached two semi-finals in the previous 50 years.\n\nSo maybe Southgate can point to a change in culture and a change in attitude that now enable England to go deeper into tournaments, even when they don't play particularly well.\n\nEngland's penalties against the Swiss on Saturday were immaculately taken. Rarely if ever before has a group of English footballers looked so certain of themselves ahead of one of the most onerous tasks in the professional game.\n\nPlayers such as Bukayo Saka will talk of a debt to Southgate on this particular matter. Saka missed horribly against the Italians in that 2021 final, yet scored with beautiful conviction in Dusseldorf.\n\nWhether you choose to ignore Southgate's role in Saka's growth and development as an international footballer is up to you. But, looked at objectively, his influence is clear. So Southgate and his team go on to Dortmund and a semi-final against the Netherlands.\n\nThe hope for improvement in England's football has perhaps gone now. If it was going to arrive, it would have done so against Slovakia or Switzerland and broadly speaking it didn't.\n\nIt may well be that our best hope is the kind of stickability and dogged reluctance to lose that has suddenly become part of this group's make-up.\n\nBefore Southgate took the job England had only reached two semi-finals in the previous 50 years\n\nSome fans want Southgate gone regardless of how the rest of England's tournament unfolds\n\nSouthgate is now just one win away from a second tournament final in three summers\n\nThe Dutch have had their problems, too. Manager Ronald Koeman, with whom England have a rich and painful history, spent the early part of this tournament railing against what he saw as unfairly negative media coverage of his team.\n\nThe Dutch press, on the other hand, accused him of ducking difficult questions by sending his players out to face the music. We would be quite wrong to believe England are the only team who have stumbled to this point in the tournament.\n\nThe Dutch lost to Austria and finished third in their group. France, who play Spain in Munich on Tuesday night, have won only one game in 90 minutes and have made it this far via two own goals and a penalty from Kylian Mbappe. Their quarter-final against Portugal finished goalless and the French prevailed in the shootout.\n\nMaybe this tells us that tournament football is quite hard. Maybe it tells us we should count our blessings.\n\nFor many, their relationship with Southgate has gone well beyond that. They just want him gone and, regardless of what happens over the next seven days, they are likely to get their wish next week.\n\nBetween now and then, though, maybe it is time just to be thankful for what we have rather than all the things we haven't.\n\nSouthgate is one win away from a second tournament final in three summers. It may just be time to put the reservations to one side and pray for progress.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

All odds are provided by our best-reviewed football betting sites. Keep in mind that odds are subject to change.\n\nThe Netherlands and England are one win away from the final of Euro 2024. But one of these teams will suffer semi-final heartbreak on Wednesday night.\n\nThe Netherlands advanced to the last four courtesy of a 2-1 victory over Turkey. They fell behind in that match when Samet Akaydin nodded home in the 35th minute.\n\nBut Ronald Koeman's men did not panic. The Dutch kept plugging away and they were rewarded when Stefan de Vrij notched a headed equaliser with 70 minutes on the clock.\n\nSoon after, the Netherlands took the lead when Mert Muldur inadvertently turned the ball into his own net. Turkey had chances to level the score, but the Netherlands managed to hold out.\n\nThis is quite the turnaround. Koeman's team only finished third in their group after losing 3-2 to Austria on matchday three.\n\nYet that defeat may have been a blessing in disguise. It landed the Dutch in the kinder half of the bracket. A 3-0 victory over Romania followed in the round of 16, before the comeback triumph over Turkey at the weekend.\n\nEngland owe their place in the semis to a penalty shoot-out defeat of Switzerland last time out. The two teams drew 1-1 after 120 minutes, after which five perfect spot-kicks sent Gareth Southgate's side through.\n\nRemarkably, England have won just one game within 90 minutes at this tournament - and that was their opener against Serbia. In terms of performances, Southgate's team have been hugely disappointing.\n\nYet results trump everything when it comes to knockout football and England are now just 90 minutes away from a second consecutive European Championship final.\n\nAs for the Netherlands, they have not reached the showpiece event at this continental competition since 1988, when they went on to lift the trophy.\n\nThe hosts that year? West Germany. The Dutch are seeking to replicate that achievement, but England stand in their way on Wednesday.\n\nThe Netherlands and England will do battle in Dortmund in the second semi-final of Euro 2024.\n\nThe Netherlands have grown into this tournament. Despite a tally of four points, they were largely unconvincing in the group stage.\n\nBut the Dutch hit their stride in the last 16, breezing to a 3-0 victory over Romania. The Turkey game was pretty even, but Koeman's side did enough to get over the line. The manager, crucially, looks to have settled on a favoured starting XI.\n\nEngland, for their part, will draw confidence from the fact they continue to find a way to win, even if it is not pretty. Meanwhile Southgate will take heart from the fact his team looked more balanced in their new 3-4-2-1 shape.\n\nThe Netherlands have performed better than England up to now, but the latter have more established match-winners capable of turning a game in an instant.\n\nIt will be interesting to see which of those factors wins out - but it might take extra time or penalties to find a winner.\n\nIt is hard to imagine either team winning this semi-final comfortably. The score may well be level once 90 minutes up.\n\n\u26bd Go for a draw at 21/10 with Betfred \u26bd\n\nIf this match does go to extra time, England would have the edge. First, they have numerous quality options to bring off the bench.\n\nCole Palmer, Ebere Eze and Ivan Toney appeared as substitutes to good effect against Switzerland. Other options include Ollie Watkins, Jarrod Bowen and Anthony Gordon. There is no shortage of attacking options outside the starting XI.\n\nSecondly, they will not be fazed by the prospect of a penalty shoot-out following their triumph over Switzerland.\n\nThat is not to say the Netherlands will be, but this is a nation which has not won a shoot-out at a major competition since 2014. In their last penalty contest, they were beaten by Argentina at the 2022 World Cup.\n\nSouthgate's in-game management is still cause for concern. The England boss often leaves it too late to make changes, reluctant to deviate from the initial plan. But we reckon his side will scrape through once again.\n\n\u26bd Tip England to qualify at 4/5 with bet365 \u26bd\n\nEngland's switch to a 3-4-2-1 formation had been mooted ahead of the Switzerland game, but it was a surprise to see Saka start at right wing-back rather than on the left.\n\nSouthgate's decision paid off, though. Saka looked dangerous throughout and it was his fine goal that levelled things up late on.\n\nThe Arsenal man also scored his penalty in the shoot-out, banishing the demons from his miss in the Euro 2020 final.\n\nSaka has been one of England's top performers in an underwhelming series of performances to date.\n\nNathan Ake will be a tough direct opponent, but Saka can still have an impact on Wednesday's semi-final.\n\n\u26bd Choose a goal or assist for Bukayo Saka at 2/1 with Sky Bet \u26bd\n\nCommercial content notice: Taking one of the bookmaker offers featured in this article may result in a payment to talkSPORT. 18+.

None of this is easy, but we're in a third semi-final in four tournaments.\"\n\nAfter reaching the 2018 World Cup semi-finals and being beaten in the Euro 2020 final on penalties by Italy, England began this tournament as one of the two favourites along with France.\n\nLes Bleus have also played in a rather tedious, yet adequate, fashion to reach the other semi-final, facing Spain.\n\nSouthgate noted even La Roja, who by contrast have dazzled this summer in Germany, modified their style to be more direct as they beat the hosts in the quarter-finals.\n\n\"It's not just about playing well -- Spain mixed their game up, they took seven yellow cards, they found ways to win,\" said the coach.\n\nThey now face a Dutch team whose five games have produced nearly double the number of goals as in England's, despite playing 60 minutes less.\n\nIn Liverpool's Cody Gakpo and Burnley target man Wout Weghorst, Ronald Koeman's side have a variety of different tools to create havoc at the other end, leading to hope of a more entertaining, higher-calibre clash.\n\nOne bone of contention England fans have had with Southgate is his reluctance to make changes.\n\nCole Palmer, arguably the player of the season in England, has not started a game in Germany, while Ollie Watkins would offer the ability to run in behind that Kane can no longer muster. Anthony Gordon, who would add dynamism on the left, has gone virtually ignored.\n\nIf they can defeat the Netherlands with a convincing display instead of another isolated moment of brilliance, it will give the team hope ahead of a potential final.\n\nFans tossed beer cups at Southgate during a dull goalless draw with Slovenia but all will be forgiven if England triumph in Berlin on July 14.\n\n\"I don't think it is normal to have beer thrown at you,\" said Southgate.\n\n\"But we will keep grinding, keep fighting and keep enjoying this journey.\"", "source": {"uri": "urdupoint.com",

England are seeking their second straight appearance in the Euro final after falling to Italy on penalties in 2020. The Netherlands haven't reached the final since 1988, when they beat the Soviet Union (2-0) for their one and only European triumph.\n\nThe Euro 2024 odds entering the semifinals list Spain as +191 favorites, on average, followed by England (+246) and France (+274), with the Netherlands the longest shot on the board at +450.\n\nEngland Escapes Switzerland in Quarters\n\nFor 75 minutes on Saturday, England played a dreadfully boring nil-nil game with Switzerland before Breel Embolo poked home a cross to give the Swiss a 1-0 lead. Bukayo Saka, who was the most-dangerous England player throughout the game, pulled his team level just five minutes later on a seeing-eye shot from the top of the box that went post-and-in.\n\nEngland blasted five near-perfect penalties past Yann Sommer after a scoreless extra time while Jordan Pickford's save off Manuel Akanji on Switzerland's first attempt proved the difference. Overall, there's a strong case to be made that the Swiss were the better team and were more deserving of advancing.\n\nDutch Comeback to Beat Turkey\n\nThe Netherlands played one of their most-anemic halves of football in the first 45 against Turkey in the quarters. They didn't generate a single shot on target or even a corner kick as Turkey took a 1-0 lead into the break. But their second-half performance was a complete 180. They controlled 58% of possession and put four shots on target, two of which beat Turkish keeper Mert Gunok en route to a 2-1 comeback victory.\n\nConcerningly, Dutch goalie Bart Verbruggen was forced into a couple of victory-saving stops in the final ten minutes. Paired with the Netherlands' 3-2 loss to Austria on the final matchday of the group stage, questions abound over the Dutch backline, which is supposed to be the strength of the team.\n\nENG vs NED: Recent Head-to-Head Results\n\nThere isn't much recent head-to-head history between England and the Netherlands, especially in competitive fixtures. The sides have met just once in the last five years, playing to a 1-1 full-time draw in Portugal in the semifinals of the 2019 UEFA Nations League before the Dutch advance 3-1 after extra time.\n\nThe previous eight matches were all friendlies, and six of the last eight overall have finished level after 90 minutes.\n\nEngland vs Netherlands Expert Picks & Predictions\n\nTwo of the last three England games have gone to the half scoreless (vs Switzerland and Slovenia) and England hasn't scored a first-half goal since their 1-1 draw with Denmark in the second group-stage game. In fact, England's quarterfinal win over Switzerland didn't see a shot on target in the first 45 minutes (and just 0.50 xGF combined between the two teams).\n\nThe Netherlands were playing a similarly low-event first half against Turkey last time out until Samet Akaydin headed home a sublime, inch-perfect cross in the 35th minute. Akaydin's goal was the only shot on target in the first 45 minutes.\n\nWith even more on the line in the semis, and both teams facing a more dangerous attack, bettors should expect a cagey first half in which both teams play scared to concede.\n\nGiven the form that we've seen from both sides in the tournament, I think the wrong team is favored. The Dutch have had more lows than England, but their highs have been considerably higher. They have more speed in attack and have been getting higher-quality midfield play from Xavi Simons, Tijjani Reijnders, and Jerdy Schouten than England has from Declan Rice, Kobbie Mainoo, Conor Gallagher, and Trent Alexander-Arnold.\n\nSascha Paruk's 2024 Euro/Copa America betting record: 32-15-1 (+18.72 units)\n\nAll wagers one unit unless expressly stated otherwise.", "source": {"uri":

KENZO TRIBOUILLARD / AFP\n\nEngland have a first ever major tournament final on foreign soil in their sights in Wednesday's Euro 2024 semi-final when they face a Netherlands side hitting their stride in Dortmund.\n\nThe Three Lions are aiming to match their run to the Euro 2020 final, when they lost in heartbreaking fashion on penalties to Italy at Wembley, AFP said.\n\nEngland's only ever major tournament triumph also came on home soil at the 1966 World Cup.\n\nGareth Southgate's men are out to end 58 years of hurt and have shown remarkable resilience, if not the quality expected of one of the pre-tournament favorites, in Germany.\n\nTwice England have stared down a humiliating early exit to fight back against Slovakia and Switzerland to reach the last four.\n\nIndividual moments of brilliance from Jude Bellingham and Bukayo Saka have kept them alive with late equalizers before beating Slovakia in extra-time and Switzerland on penalties.\n\nThose were flickers of the individual talent at Southgate's disposal and the England boss has defiantly defended his record, even though his side had failed to hit top gear at the tournament so far.\n\nUnder Southgate, England are now in a third semi-final in four major tournaments - matching the three semi-finals they had reached in their history prior to his appointment eight years ago.\n\nThat has not sheltered the 53-year-old from criticism. Southgate was pelted with beer cups after a 0-0 draw against Slovenia in the group stages and has faced a backlash for his perceived negative tactics with a richly-talented squad.\n\n\"I can't deny then when things get as personal as it has that does hurt. I don't think it's normal to have beer thrown at you,\" said Southgate of his detractors.\n\n\"But we're in a third semi-final in four tournaments, and I think we continue to give people fantastic memories. So we'll keep grinding, we'll keep fighting, and we'll keep enjoying this journey.\"\n\nPremier League stars collide\n\nA change of formation for the 1-1 draw against Switzerland did result in a marginally improved display from the dramatic win over a Slovakia side ranked 45th in the world.\n\nSouthgate is expected to stick by that 3-4-2-1 system with Marc Guehi returning from suspension to replace Ezri Konsa.\n\nThe England boss has bristled at suggestions his side ended up on the kind side of the draw, away from France, Spain, Germany and Portugal.\n\nYet, the Dutch can count themselves even more fortunate for their path to the final after finishing third in Group D behind France and Austria.\n\nRonald Koeman's men produced their best display of the tournament in sweeping aside Romania 3-0 in the last 16 before battling back from a goal down to beat Turkey 2-1 in front of a hostile crowd in Berlin.\n\nComing up against a raft of Premier League stars will hold little fear for the Netherlands, who boast their own impressive crop of talent plying their trade in England's top flight.\n\n\"If you see the quality of players from both teams, you can expect the rhythm and level of the game will be really high,\" said Tottenham defender Micky van de Ven.\n\nLiverpool's Cody Gakpo has arguably been the form attacker at the tournament and is the only player to have scored three goals still alive in the competition.\n\nThe Dutch have had to wait 36 years since their own sole major tournament triumph, the last time the Euros were held in Germany.\n\nThat is also the only time they have ever made a European Championship final.\n\nBut they will fancy their chances of being in Berlin on Sunday unless England suddenly click into gear.", "source": {"uri":

England were better but still less than the some of their parts.\n\nEngland are potentially 90 minutes away from the Euro 2024 final (Image: PA)\n\nThe opening 45 minutes was an improvement. England moved the ball far neater and tried to probe against a very organised Swiss side. But chance creation remains a huge problem which is exasperating for a side overflowing with talent.\n\nPhil Foden looked more at home in the right channel after Southgate's tweak in formation, if not personnel. Bukayo Saka justified the decision to leave him on the right, when many expected him to take the left flank to give England better balance.\n\nHad he been on the opposite flank, the Arsenal winger wouldn't have been able to cut inside and rescue England. There wasn't a more popular scorer from the spot either, banishing the demons of the 2021 final in a similar manner to Stuart Pearce many years ago.\n\nEngland did look to have a better balance in a 3-4-3 system. Throw in Luke Shaw for Kieran Trippier and Southgate's side would resemble something of a balanced team. You can toss a coin over Ezri Konsa or Marc Guehi, though I'd probably lean towards the latter.\n\nBut this is about Southgate and the conflict I feel. It is without doubt that England have underwhelmed at this tournament. They were flat in the group stages and should have gone out to Slovakia, yet they're one game from the final.\n\nI have always been a huge defender of the England boss. At the age of 26, he is without doubt the best national team boss in my lifetime. He has brought excitement back to major tournaments, at least with expectation if not the recent performances.\n\nThat does not mean you can't be critical of him as a coach. His long-standing issue of being reactive rather than proactive was on display again as the second-half wandered. The Swiss goal was coming, we all felt it, apart from the man who could have done something to prevent it.\n\nBut the statistics don't lie. I do not buy into the 'who have they ever beaten' arguments. Tournament football is not that simplistic, you can only beat what is in front of you. Under Southgate, England have been excellent at that.\n\nSo, yeah, it probably should be his last tournament, regardless of the next 10 days. But England didn't reach a semi-final for 20 years, between 1998 to 2018. We have been spoiled with three in six since.\n\nIf ever you needed an example of how Southgate has reset the England psyche, rewatch those penalty kicks.\n\nIt's ok to admit it's time for change but Southgate deserves to go out on his terms, with a hell of respect on his name.\n\nGareth Southgate checks on Harry Kane after his tumble against Switzerland (Image: PA)\n\nEngland View - Marc Iles\n\nLAST seen tumbling into the technical area and nearly sending Gareth Southgate flying, Harry Kane has had a tricky time of things at the Euros so far.\n\nSome wags joked that Kane's ungainly exit against Switzerland might be the only way the England boss would contemplate taking his captain off the pitch.\n\nWhist you can see the logic behind Southgate's loyalty, there is at least scope for a debate that the time has come to consider starting Ollie Watkins or Ivan Toney as an alternative, if only to allow Kane to focus his energies into shorter bursts.\n\nThe Bayern Munich striker has scored twice in the tournament, which weirdly puts him one goal behind a cluster of players leading the way for the Golden Boot on three, all of this without having had one truly convincing performance.\n\nFor my money, Kane's relative lack of effectiveness has nothing to do with quality and everything to do with a long season in the Bundesliga, the pressure of a massive move away from Spurs and the burden of another international tournament as his country's talisman. He has led the team impressively off the pitch but he's only human, there are limits to how far one man stretch himself.\n\nIf there is a weakness in a decent Dutch defence, it is pace. It would be a brave move to swap Kane at this late stage, and perhaps that does not play into Southgate's conservative nature, but there is sense in the suggestion.\n\nThere is no doubt England looked more comfortable in the shape they played against the Swiss, and Luke Shaw's appearance late in the game might point towards him now being fit enough to feature. Having two fully functioning flanks could improve things for Kane, who has hardly been blessed with an abundance of chances so far.\n\nBut much like the England team itself, we are still waiting for conclusive evidence that Kane is in the sort of form which can win this trophy.\n\nVERY few managers have used substitutes quite as effectively as Ronald Koeman at the Euros.\n\nWhile we have been bellowing at our TV screens for Gareth Southgate to make a change, the Dutch have had it down to a fine art over the last few weeks.\n\nPlan A - try and play through the opposition using the midfield craft of Xavi Simons and Tijjani Reijnders, which barring the last 16 game against Romania, has quite honestly not been as successful as Koeman would have hoped.\n\nPlan B, however, is to bring on a completely different type of striker in big Wout Weghorst, start hitting him with diagonal balls into the box, and let the chaos ensue.\n\nThe former Manchester United loanee, who is surprisingly still on the books at Burnley, has to be one of the most effective replacements in international football. He is a much better player than many give him credit to be, yet when the Dutch throw him on to the pitch to change up their attack, the sudden shift to a more direct style of football never fails to take you by surprise.\n\nTurkey couldn't handle him in the quarter final, and he made a significant impact against Poland, France and Austria in the group stages too - albeit defeat in the third of those games meant the Dutch ended up finishing third.\n\nThe stats show that Weghorst has played 93 minutes of football in this tournament but that in his time on the pitch his team have a positive xG of 3.87.\n\nWeghorst is the type of jarring change in direction that you might think goes against the Netherlands philosophy. But it was interesting listening to Gary Lineker recently when discussing Ivan Toney's impact against Slovakia, and he recalled how the great Johan Cruyff was not averse to throwing a centre-back forward in the final few minutes and going direct, if he felt the need.\n\nIt is a trick Koeman will inevitably keep up his sleeve for England, and one Southgate will no doubt have a plan to combat.",

England will be aiming to reach back-to-back Euro finals, and there will be plenty of stake for both sides. England have won only one of their last nine meetings with the Dutch in all competitions (draw 4, lost 4), winning a friendly in Amsterdam in 2018....Read More\n\nAt a major tournament, this is England and Netherlands' fourth meeting, with the Dutch winning 3-1 at Euro 1988, courtesy of a Marco van Basten hat-trick. Meanwhile, it was a goalless draw at the 1990 World Cup and a 4-1 win for England at Euro 1996.\n\nBut luck at the Euros is also not at Netherlands' side, who have been eliminated from four of their five semi-final ties at the Euros, with this their first since 2004. The exception was a 2-1 win vs hosts Germany in 1988, where they also won the title. Speaking ahead of the match, Dutch head coach Ronald Koeman said, \"We know that there is really not much difference between the two teams, it's really 50-50 in my opinion. But we will need the perfect game to win. We know they have a lot of individual qualities but both teams are really strong and it will be a good fight.\"\n\n\"England had to play extra time in their last game (against Switzerland) so maybe that could be a difference in the latter stages of the match. We are sharp, we are focused and we are looking forward to playing a good match against them. Our country is close by. Let's hope we can make them really happy by winning and going to the final on Sunday,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_van_Basten", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marco van Basten"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amsterdam"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Amsterdam"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_game_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Perfect game (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Koeman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Koeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2024/07/10/550x309/SOCCER-EURO-ENG-SVK-REPORT-675_1720629541994_1720629556392.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712618", "eventUri": "eng-9712618", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5137254901960784, "wgt": 155, "relevance": 1}

Without his equaliser, the team may have been on their back to England.\n\nThe Arsenal star not only scored the only goal in the game but was one of the five players to convert his spot kick in the penalty shootout.\n\nIt was a massive comeback for the winger who had not taken a penalty since he missed the crucial spot-kick in the Euro 2020 final.\n\nMeanwhile, for Holland, Cody Gakpo has made 8 shots and created 11 chances at the Euros.\n\nThe Liverpool star has already scored three goals and made one assist in Germany.\n\nAnd the forward will definitely be a threat to England's defence on Wednesday.\n\nEngland have only beaten Holland once in nine meetings since a 4-1 win at Euro 96.\n\nThat is the Three Lions' only win against the Dutch in a major tournament, alongside a goalless draw at Italia 90 and the Netherlands winning 3-1 at the 1988 Euros.\n\nSouthgate is hoping the Three Lions can see it through to the final and win the tournament after failing last time out.\n\nHe said: \"Our intention is to play with the ball, but you have opponents trying to stop you.\n\n\"Our team has been under enormous pressure from the start and they did so well.\n\n\"At the moment we aren't able to score lots but the last three games we've played against five at the back. We're through to our third semi-final in four attempts but that's not where we want it to end.\"\n\nKoeman is proud of his squad for coming this far in the tournament ahead of the clash against England.\n\nHe said: \"For the whole nation, it's something special. We are a small nation and we're in the semi-finals with England, France and Spain.\n\n\"We are really proud.

'How they get there, you never know how it's going to be - it's going to be tight, maybe a mistake, or penalties.\n\n'We talk about going back to our own careers - the cup runs we had, and there's games we look back on, maybe two or three games, there's other teams who have played a lot better.\n\n'There are teams playing worse than England who are still in the tournament, we can go back to the French, a couple of days ago we said Austria have great players, they are out of it.

Recent history between the two teams is limited, but England have not beaten the Netherlands at a major tournament since 1996. Betting picks include a draw as the most likely outcome, as well as various player and match statistics.\n\nDespite many skeptics surrounding England's performances so far at EURO 2024, the Three Lions have still managed to make their way into the tournament's final four. In their way stands their biggest test of the contest so far, the Netherlands, who pulled off an impressive comeback victory over Turkey in the quarter-finals to make their way into the penultimate stage of the continental competition.\n\nThough England and penalty shootouts have so often throughout history been an infamously failed lottery for the Three Lions, Gareth Southgate and his men managed to make their way through a shootout with Switzerland to reach the last four, as Jordan Pickford denying Manuel Akanji with the first penalty of the bunch, before Cole Palmer, Jude Bellingham, Bukayo Saka, Ivan Toney and Trent Alexander-Arnold stayed perfect to get England through, with Saka getting redemption for his miss in the final in 2021 and Toney producing one of the coolest penalties of all time.\n\nThe Netherlands were certainly tested by a plucky Turkey side who were on a high after their hard-fought win over Austria, as they went 1-0 up in the first half through Samet Akaydin. The Dutch had their defenders to thank in order to get them through, however, as Stefan de Vrij and a Mert Muldur own-goal found the net to complete a turnaround, helped in part to a stoppage-time red card for Turkey's Bertug Yildirim. As the pressure gets tighter than ever with the final in clear view for the remaining four teams, here is our preview and betting picks for England vs the Netherlands.\n\nRelated Lewis Hamilton & George Russell React to England Beating Switzerland\n\nMercedes duo Lewis Hamilton & George Russell were watching England vs Switzerland at Euro 2024 at Silverstone after qualifying.\n\nEngland vs Netherlands Match Information\n\nWhere\n\nWestfalenstadion\n\nWhen\n\n10/7/24\n\nLocation\n\nDortmund, Germany\n\nTime\n\n20:00 GMT\n\nTV\n\nITV (UK)\n\nEngland vs Netherlands Stats and Info Three Lions hope to prevent Dutch delight\n\nThough there have been questions made as to the quality of England's performances at EURO 2024, it cannot be denied that they are semi-finalists all the same, warranting the same merit as the other three teams around them.\n\nThere were improvements in their penalty win over Switzerland from the comeback victory over Slovakia, attacking with a bit more freedom, but still seemingly containing some of the lethargism that has been criticised so heavily over the tournament's duration, seemingly lacking a bit of energy and a certain spark.\n\nRelated England Beat Switzerland: Player Ratings and Match Highlights\n\nThe Three Lions booked their place in the final four of EURO 2024 via a penalty shootout win against Switzerland.\n\nHowever, a semi-final is a semi-final, and we must turn an eye towards the things that England have done well so far in the competition. Starting off, if there is one thing to take away from England's performances, it is that they are hard to beat. By luck or by pure willpower, even when the Three Lions looked completely down and out at EURO 2024, most notably in the round of 16 against Slovakia, they still have something in the tank. Against the Slovaks, it was a mesmerising 95th minute bicycle-kick equaliser from Bellingham followed up by a Harry Kane winner in extra-time. Against Switzerland, it was a ripping Saka equaliser, five minutes after Breel Embolo had put England behind, before the Three Lions went on to stay perfect in the shootout to progress forwards.\n\nBeing hard to beat at a knockout tournament is arguably the most important attribute a team can carry. And though the ways England have managed to get to this stage have come into question as to their quality, their fighting spirit and never-say-die pride certainly cannot be. With the Netherlands, a much more free-flowing approach has taken them this far, with several memorable moments coming from the Dutch camp.\n\nOnly a questionable VAR decision denied them a huge win over France, but pure quality and endevour took them beyond Romania and Turkey.\n\nRelated Netherlands 2-1 Turkey: Player Ratings and Match Highlights\n\nThe Netherlands will face England in their bid to reach the EURO 2024 final.\n\nA masterclass from Liverpool forward Cody Gakpo was the catalyst behind a 3-0 success over Romania, but similarly to England, it was pure willingness that took them beyond the challenge of Turkey to overcome a 1-0 deficit. De Vrij found the net after a fine corner from Memphis Depay before Muldur inadvertently completed the turnaround for the Netherland with an own-goal.\n\nGoing into this game, it's anyone's guess as to who will make their way to Berlin for the final. Where England seek to control possession, the Netherlands look to close teams down at a rate of knots and counter-attack with similar speed and force, and that clash of style will make for an intriguing contest in the semi-final matchup.\n\nThere isn't much history in recent years to speak of going into the match, as the two teams have not faced off against each other since 2019, which ended in a 3-1 extra-time win for the Netherlands in a Nations League semi-final clash. England won a friendly game before that in 2018, a 1-0 victory thanks to a goal from one Jesse Lingard, but before that had not beaten the Dutch in nine different meetings, their last win dating back at EURO 1996.\n\nThough history plays little part in the chances of a modern-day team, the majority of games between the two have ended in draws, nine total, and their Euro's record against one another stands at 1-1 as well. The superstitious among us may see this as a factor towards this games result, whereas we feel the style of both teams may take it all the way to penalties again as well.\n\nEngland vs Netherlands Betting Picks GIVEMESPORT presents our picks with analysis Match Result\n\nThis one will be tough to call. History shows the likelihood of a draw, as does the styles of the two teams. With neither team going into the game as the clear-cut favourite, with perhaps a slight edge to the Netherlands, that's where we are going to go with our pick.\n\nPrediction: Draw (15/8) Over/Under\n\nLooking into the deeper stats of the two team's matches at EURO 2024 may provide some decent prices throughout.\n\nPrediction: Under 10 match corners (4/6, won in all but one Netherlands game) Prediction: Memphis Depay over 2.5 shots (11/10, won in all but one Netherlands game) Prediction: Over 26.5 match tackles (8/15, won in three Netherlands games and three England games) Prediction: Denzel Dumfries over 1.5 fouls committed (10/11, won in all but one Netherlands game) Player bets\n\nAcross both teams, there have been some high statistical scorers that leave good prices up for grabs.\n\nPrediction: Bukayo Saka 1+ shot on target (11/10, won in all but one England game) Prediction: Marc Guehi to be booked (11/2, two yellows so far, bookings wiped after SF) Prediction: Virgil van Dijk 1+ shot (5/6, won in all but one Netherlands game)\n\nAll stats from SofaScore, all odds from bet365, correct as of 10:30 GMT, 8/7/24", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType":

None of this is easy, but we're in a third semi-final.\"\n\nAfter reaching the 2018 World Cup semi-finals and being beaten in the Euro 2020 final on penalties, England began this tournament as one of the favorites.\n\nThey now face a Dutch team whose five games have produced nearly double the number of goals as England's, despite playing 60 minutes less.\n\nIn Liverpool's Cody Gakpo and Burnley target man Wout Weghorst, Ronald Koeman's side have tools to create havoc at the other end, leading to hope of a more entertaining, higher-caliber clash.\n\nA bone of contention Southgate faces is his reluctance to make changes.\n\nCole Palmer, arguably player of the season in England, has not started. Ollie Watkins would offer the ability to run in behind that Harry Kane can no longer do. Anthony Gordon, who can add dynamism on the left, has gone virtually ignored.\n\nDespite some decisive moments Jude Bellingham has looked jaded after his Real Madrid exploits and Phil Foden is operating at a far lower level than with Manchester City.\n\nSouthgate only rang the changes against Switzerland after falling behind, before Bukayo Saka's fine strike from distance pulled England level.\n\nThere are concerns that like in the World Cup 2018 semi-final against Croatia, if Southgate is too reactive, England could lose control of the game.\n\nIf they can defeat the Netherlands with a convincing display instead of another isolated moment of brilliance, it will give the team hope ahead of a potential final.", "source": {"uri": "thestandard.com.hk", "dataType": "news",

The Three Lions are looking to return to their second consecutive final, whereas the Dutch hope to return to the big stage for the first time in nearly four decades.\n\nSignal Iduna Park in Dortmund, Germany plays host to this decisive duel. Kickoff is slated for 2 p.m. CT on Wednesday. Fox will have nationwide coverage in the United States. Let's break down the odds.\n\nEuro 2024 preview: Netherlands vs. England odds, prediction, best bet\n\nDespite finishing third in Group D, the Netherlands has pieced it together in the knockout stages. The Oranje have begun to click in the final third with their attack scoring five times in the last two matches. Now, Ronald Koeman's team must break down one of the most stubborn defenses on the planet.\n\nEngland has continued to advance in this tournament, despite going behind in both of its knockout round matches. Many believe the Three Lions haven't lived up to their potential yet, but do they have another gear fans haven't seen yet? Gareth Southgate is hoping to guide his side to yet another final as manager amid all of the scrutiny.\n\nLet's take a closer look at the odds and trends ahead of this highly anticipated Copa America clash:\n\nNetherlands vs. England\n\nTime/TV: Wednesday, July 10 at 2 p.m. CT (Fox)\n\nLocation: Signal Iduna Park in Dortmund, Germany\n\nMoneyline: Netherlands +220 | Draw +175 | England +165\n\nPreview\n\nSouthgate has come under fire for the style of England's play at the Euros. The Three Lions have been extremely conservative, despite possessing one of the most talented attacking units. Southgate's squad now finds itself in another semifinal amid all of the criticism.\n\nThe team's style of play may frustrate fans, but it has proven to be effective. England has allowed just three goals across five games. The issue is that the Three Lions are often the first team to concede, which isn't a sustainable method of victory. Southgate's defensive style can work, the manager just needs to get more out of his attack before going behind, instead of leaving it late.\n\nLuke Shaw was fit enough to feature in England's win over Switzerland off the bench. If he could start on Wednesday, this could fix one of the Three Lions' biggest issues in the build-up on the left.\n\nOn the other side, it's no secret how Koeman will set up his side. The Dutch will line up in a 4-2-3-1 (or a variation of a 4-3-3) and look to control possession. The Oranje have had a majority of possession in every game at this tournament except one when they drew with France.\n\nThe Netherlands has found the back of the net nine times across five games, largely due to Cody Gakpo stepping up in a second consecutive major tournament. The Dutch talisman is one of two players (Spain's Dani Olmo being the other) still alive in the tournament on three goals. If he gets on the scoresheet again, Koeman will like his team's chances of grabbing a victory.\n\nEven though England is the more inconsistent of the two attacks, the Three Lions have more depth and talent overall in the final third. Southgate's squad is also more experienced in these tournament experiences. I like England to narrowly edge out the Oranje for these reasons.\n\nPrediction\n\nNetherlands 0-1 England\n\nBest bet\n\nEngland to qualify for the next round (-132 at FanDuel Sportsbook)", "source": {"uri": "theadvocate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Advocate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gabe_henderson@theadvocate.com", "name": "Gabe Henderson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Three Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westfalenstadion", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Westfalenstadion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Koeman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Koeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cody_Gakpo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cody Gakpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dani_Olmo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dani Olmo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Formation (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Shaw", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luke Shaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/theadvocate.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/b/26/b265fb9c-ce0f-51d4-a184-8b3bdfc248a9/66721ad9e66a7.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712618", "eventUri": "eng-9712618", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-04-02", "dateEnd": "-03-01", "textStart": 2454, "textEnd": 2461}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-10", "textStart": 1351, "textEnd": 1358}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

Southgate was pelted with beer cups after a 0-0 draw against Slovenia in the group stages and has faced a backlash for his perceived negative tactics with a richly-talented squad.\n\n\"I can't deny then when things get as personal as it has that does hurt. I don't think it's normal to have beer thrown at you,\" said Southgate of his detractors.\n\n\"But we're in a third semi-final in four tournaments, and I think we continue to give people fantastic memories. So we'll keep grinding, we'll keep fighting, and we'll keep enjoying this journey.\"\n\nPremier League stars collide\n\nA change of formation for the 1-1 draw against Switzerland did result in a marginally improved display from the dramatic win over a Slovakia side ranked 45th in the world.\n\nSouthgate is expected to stick by that 3-4-2-1 system with Marc Guehi returning from suspension to replace Ezri Konsa.\n\nThe England boss has bristled at suggestions his side ended up on the kind side of the draw, away from France, Spain, Germany and Portugal.\n\nYet, the Dutch can count themselves even more fortunate for their path to the final after finishing third in Group D behind France and Austria.\n\nRonald Koeman's men produced their best display of the tournament in sweeping aside Romania 3-0 in the last 16 before battling back from a goal down to beat Turkey 2-1 in front of a hostile crowd in Berlin.\n\nComing up against a raft of Premier League stars will hold little fear for the Netherlands, who boast their own impressive crop of talent plying their trade in England's top flight.\n\n\"If you see the quality of players from both teams, you can expect the rhythm and level of the game will be really high,\" said Tottenham defender Micky van de Ven.\n\nLiverpool's Cody Gakpo has arguably been the form attacker at the tournament and is the only player to have scored three goals still alive in the competition.\n\nThe Dutch have had to wait 36 years since their own sole major tournament triumph, the last time the Euros were held in Germany.\n\nThat is also the only time they have ever made a European Championship final.\n\nBut they will fancy their chances of being in Berlin on Sunday unless England suddenly click into gear.", "source": {"uri":

They were eliminated in 1968 and 1996 but reached the final in Euro 2020\n\nEngland has had a rocky journey through Euro 2024, but they've made it to another semi-final. They'll face the Netherlands on Wednesday at Dortmund's famous Westfalenstadion. Ahead of the England vs Netherlands Euro Cup semifinals, let us take a look at the prediction.\n\nDespite being favourites in previous matches, the Opta supercomputer gives England a 37.8% chance of victory in this game, while the Netherlands has a 31.6% chance, with a 30.6% probability of the match going to penalties.\n\nEngland hasn't shown their best form and looked tired against Switzerland, but they still have incredible talent with players like Jude Bellingham, Harry Kane, and Bukayo Saka. On the other hand, the Netherlands has had moments of brilliance in Euro 2024, even without two key midfielders. Cody Gakpo is the tournament's top goalscorer, and they have a strong defence. We at Insidesport.IN predict a close 1-0 win for England.\n\nThis is England's fourth appearance in the European Championship semi-finals. They were eliminated in 1968 and 1996 but reached the final in Euro 2020 after beating Denmark 2-1, only to lose to Italy on penalties.\n\nEngland's path to the semi-finals has been dramatic. They won a tense penalty shootout against Switzerland after a 1-1 draw in extra time. Their group stage performance was unconvincing, but knockout football is all about results. England has scored five times from just 4.36 expected goals (xG).\n\nFor the Netherlands, this will be their sixth semi-final at the Euros. They've lost their last four, with their only win in 1988. This is their first Euros semi-final since 2004, a shorter tournament with only 16 teams.\n\nRonald Koeman's team was unconvincing in the group stage but found form in the knockout rounds. They came from behind to beat Turkey 2-1, scoring twice in six minutes.\n\nThe Dutch have scored nine goals in five matches, with only Germany and Spain scoring more. Their 8.12 expected goals rank fourth in the competition.\n\nEngland Predicted XI:\n\nPickford; Walker, Stones, Guehi; Saka, Mainoo, Rice, Trippier; Bellingham, Foden; Kane\n\nNetherlands Predicted

England missed out in heartbreaking fashion in the final of Euro 2020, losing on penalties at Wembley to Italy.\n\nCaptain Harry Kane said reaching back-to-back finals would be an \"amazing achievement\" as he aims to win the first major trophy of his career.\n\nBut Kane has been singled out for criticism back home for his sluggish displays in Germany, where he now plays his club football for Bayern Munich.\n\nThe 30-year-old has scored two of England's five goals at the tournament but has looked physically restricted after missing the end of the club season with a back injury.\n\nKane's lacklustre performances have been symptomatic of England's struggles as a team.\n\nTwice they have stared down a humiliating early exit only to fight back against Slovakia and Switzerland thanks to individual moments of magic from Jude Bellingham and Bukayo Saka.\n\nEngland arrived in Germany as one of the favourites thanks to a richly talented squad and an upturn in their fortunes under Southgate. And he believes his players struggled to cope with that expectation early in the tournament.\n\nAlso Read: Southgate defends late substitutions at Euro 2024\n\n\"One of our strengths over the last eight years has been less fear, less inhibition but at the beginning, the expectation weighed heavily,\" said Southgate at his pre-match press conference on Tuesday. \"Now we are into that moment in the tournament where it is what is possible? What is achievable? Rather than, what could go wrong? \"That is different for a player. This is now the chance to make history, first time to make a final not held in England.\"\n\nThe selection of referee Felix Zwayer has raised eyebrows after Bellingham was fined during his time at Borussia Dortmund for bringing up a historic charge of match-fixing against the German.\n\nZwayer was handed a six-month ban in 2006 after he was investigated for taking a bribe from another official. Bellingham was fined 40,000 euros ($43,000) for his outburst after Bayern Munich beat Dortmund in December 2021.\n\nDutch face travel chaos\n\nThe Netherlands also had their troubles in the group stages as a 3-2 defeat to Austria saw them sneak through as one of the best third-placed sides.\n\nRonald Koeman's men have since found their groove in a 3-0 win over Romania in the last 16 before battling back to beat Turkey 2-1 in the last eight.\n\nThe Dutch boast one of the form attacking players in the tournament in Cody Gakpo, who is looking to move out in front in the race for the Golden Boot by adding to his three goals so far.\n\nThey have had to wait 36 years since their sole major tournament triumph -- which came the last time the Euros were held in Germany.\n\nBut their preparations for the game were disrupted by issues with the German train system, which caused chaos for fans throughout the tournament.\n\nThe Netherlands had planned to go from their base in Wolfsburg by rail to Dortmund. However, a blockage on the line meant a last-minute change of plans as they instead had to fly and missed their pre-match media duties as a result.\n\n\"We don't play until 9pm tomorrow. I'm sure they will still get dinner when they arrive,\" added Southgate. \"They've got plenty of time. I don't see it having any impact on the game. \"", "source": {"uri": "tribune.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Express Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@tribune.com.pk",

Its three wins was in regulation time, however, compared to one for England, and the Dutch has scored nearly double its number of goals at the tournament.\n\nThe Netherlands has the edge in attack, with nine goals at Euro 2024 coming from 20 attempts on target against 15 by an England side spearheaded by the usually lethal but currently subdued Harry Kane, Phil Foden and Jude Bellingham.\n\nEngland improved against the Swiss but its five expertly struck penalties rescued an attack that again looked frustrated, with Bukayo Saka's 80th-minute equaliser its first shot on target.\n\nNetherlands do not have that problem and will bank on the tournament's joint top scorer Cody Gakpo to and trouble an England defence that has been solid in contract with its jaded attack.\n\nDOING SO WELL\n\nEngland manager Gareth Southgate declined to discuss the Dutch after his side's win over Switzerland, keeping media attention squarely on his players' resilience in handling the intensity of penalties.\n\nEngland's troubles in front of goal were during matches he said were not normal, against crowded defences determined to stop them.\n\n\"These are national events with huge pressure, with really young men in the middle of it. Our team has been under enormous pressure from the start. They're doing so well. So well,\" Southgate said.\n\nALSO READ | Premier League 2024-25: Maresca to adopt aggressive approach at Chelsea\n\n\"We're not able to score a load of goals at the moment. But again, we've played three teams that play back fives, very well organised defences.\"\n\nSouthgate is again expected to stick to a similar lineup having been impervious to calls to shake things up or make substitutions earlier during the tournament.\n\nThe Dutch has blown hot and cold and will need to be stronger at the back to stand any chance of reaching its first final since its 1988 Euros triumph, its only major tournament success.\n\nAustria and Turkey exploited Dutch defensive disorganisation at set-pieces and England will try to do the same.\n\nNetherlands coach Ronald Koeman has also received criticism, hitting back at pundits who questioned his team's commitment and saying his players showed a big heart in coming from behind to beat Turkey.\n\n\"We need to fight to win the semi-final,\" Koeman said. \"It will be a great night on Wednesday between two big nations historically.

They are doing so well.\"\n\nSouthgate pointed to England's opponents using defensive formations and also blamed the grass in Germany for hampering his players.\n\n\"We're not able to score a load of goals at the moment, but we've played three teams that play a back five, well-organised defences,\" he continued.\n\n\"Pitches are a little bit bobbly so sometimes you need the extra touch and then the space is gone. None of this is easy, but we're in a third semifinal in four tournaments.\"\n\nAfter reaching the 2018 World Cup semifinals and being beaten in the Euro 2020 final on penalties by Italy, England began this tournament as one of the two favourites along with France.\n\nThey now face a Dutch team whose five games have produced nearly double the number of goals as in England's, despite playing 60 minutes less.\n\nIn Liverpool's Cody Gakpo and Burnley target man Wout Weghorst, Ronald Koeman's side have a variety of different tools to create havoc at the other end, leading to hope of a more entertaining, higher-calibre clash.\n\nOne bone of contention England fans have had with Southgate is his reluctance to make changes.\n\nCole Palmer, arguably the player of the season in England, has not started a game in Germany, while Ollie Watkins would offer the ability to run in behind that Kane can no longer muster. Anthony Gordon, who would add dynamism on the left, has gone virtually ignored.\n\nDespite some decisive moments Jude Bellingham has looked jaded after his exploits with Real Madrid and Phil Foden is operating at a far lower level than with Manchester City.\n\nSouthgate only rang the changes against Switzerland after falling behind, before Bukayo Saka's fine strike from distance pulled England level.", "source": {"uri": "khaleejtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Khaleej times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "agence_france_presse@khaleejtimes.com", "name": "Agence France-Presse", "type":

Without his equaliser, the team may have been on their back to England.\n\nThe Arsenal star not only scored the only goal in the game but was one of the five players to convert his spot kick in the penalty shootout.\n\nIt was a massive comeback for the winger who had not taken a penalty since he missed the crucial spot-kick in the Euro 2020 final.\n\nMeanwhile, for Holland, Cody Gakpo has made 8 shots and created 11 chances at the Euros.\n\nThe Liverpool star has already scored three goals and made one assist in Germany.\n\nAnd the forward will definitely be a threat to England's defence on Wednesday.\n\nEngland have only beaten Holland once in nine meetings since a 4-1 win at Euro 96.\n\nThat is the Three Lions' only win against the Dutch in a major tournament, alongside a goalless draw at Italia 90 and the Netherlands winning 3-1 at the 1988 Euros.\n\nSouthgate is hoping the Three Lions can see it through to the final and win the tournament after failing last time out.\n\nHe said: \"Our intention is to play with the ball, but you have opponents trying to stop you.\n\n\"Our team has been under enormous pressure from the start and they did so well.\n\n\"At the moment we aren't able to score lots but the last three games we've played against five at the back. We're through to our third semi-final in four attempts but that's not where we want it to end.\"\n\nKoeman is proud of his squad for coming this far in the tournament ahead of the clash against England.\n\nHe said: \"For the whole nation, it's something special. We are a small nation and we're in the semi-finals with England, France and Spain.\n\n\"We are really proud. We had to suffer but it's a great success to get the opportunity to play in a semi-final.\"", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ellie_grant@thesun.co.uk", "name": "Ellie Grant", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Three Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breel_Embolo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Breel Embolo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympiastadion_(Berlin)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympiastadion (Berlin)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovakia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerdy_Schouten", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jerdy Schouten"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Bergwijn", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steven Bergwijn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youri_Mulder", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Youri Mulder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_de_Vrij", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stefan de Vrij"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wout_Weghorst", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wout Weghorst"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penalty card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Own_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Own goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Koeman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Koeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cody_Gakpo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cody Gakpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Mah_Jongg", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Mah Jongg", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/KH_KNOCK-OUT_FIXTURE_NET_ENGv1_OP_e71592.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712618", "eventUri": "eng-9712618", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

England were better but still less than the some of their parts.\n\nThe opening 45 minutes was an improvement. England moved the ball far neater and tried to probe against a very organised Swiss side. But chance creation remains a huge problem which is exasperating for a side overflowing with talent.\n\nPhil Foden looked more at home in the right channel after Southgate's tweak in formation, if not personnel. Bukayo Saka justified the decision to leave him on the right, when many expected him to take the left flank to give England better balance.\n\nHad he been on the opposite flank, the Arsenal winger wouldn't have been able to cut inside and rescue England. There wasn't a more popular scorer from the spot either, banishing the demons of the 2021 final in a similar manner to Stuart Pearce many years ago.\n\nEngland did look to have a better balance in a 3-4-3 system. Throw in Luke Shaw for Kieran Trippier and Southgate's side would resemble something of a balanced team. You can toss a coin over Ezri Konsa or Marc Guehi, though I'd probably lean towards the latter.\n\nBut this is about Southgate and the conflict I feel. It is without doubt that England have underwhelmed at this tournament. They were flat in the group stages and should have gone out to Slovakia, yet they're one game from the final.\n\nI have always been a huge defender of the England boss. At the age of 26, he is without doubt the best national team boss in my lifetime. He has brought excitement back to major tournaments, at least with expectation if not the recent performances.\n\nThat does not mean you can't be critical of him as a coach. His long-standing issue of being reactive rather than proactive was on display again as the second half wandered. The Swiss goal was coming, we all felt it, apart from the man who could have done something to prevent it.\n\nBut the statistics don't lie. I do not buy into the 'who have they ever beaten' arguments. Tournament football is not that simplistic, you can only beat what is in front of you. Under Southgate, England have been excellent at that.\n\nSo, yeah, it probably should be his last tournament, regardless of the next 10 days. But England didn't reach a semi-final for 20 years, between 1998 to 2018. We have been spoiled with three in six since.\n\nIf ever you needed an example of how Southgate has reset the England psyche, re-watch those penalty kicks.\n\nIt's ok to admit it's time for change but Southgate deserves to go out on his terms, with a hell of respect on his name.\n\nEngland View - Marc Iles\n\nLAST seen tumbling into the technical area and nearly sending Gareth Southgate flying, Harry Kane has had a tricky time of things at the Euros so far.\n\nSome wags joked that Kane's ungainly exit against Switzerland might be the only way the England boss would contemplate taking his captain off the pitch.\n\nWhilst you can see the logic behind Southgate's loyalty, there is at least scope for a debate that the time has come to consider starting Ollie Watkins or Ivan Toney as an alternative, if only to allow Kane to focus his energies into shorter bursts.\n\nThe Bayern Munich striker has scored twice in the tournament, which weirdly puts him one goal behind a cluster of players leading the way for the Golden Boot on three, all of this without having had one truly convincing performance.\n\nFor my money, Kane's relative lack of effectiveness has nothing to do with quality and everything to do with a long season in the Bundesliga, the pressure of a massive move away from Spurs and the burden of another international tournament as his country's talisman. He has led the team impressively off the pitch but he's only human, there are limits to how far one man stretch himself.\n\nIf there is a weakness in a decent Dutch defence, it is pace. It would be a brave move to swap Kane at this late stage, and perhaps that does not play into Southgate's conservative nature, but there is sense in the suggestion.\n\nThere is no doubt England looked more comfortable in the shape they played against the Swiss, and Luke Shaw's appearance late in the game might point towards him now being fit enough to feature. Having two fully functioning flanks could improve things for Kane, who has hardly been blessed with an abundance of chances so far.\n\nBut much like the England team itself, we are still waiting for conclusive evidence that Kane is in the sort of form which can win this trophy.\n\nEuro View - Marc Iles\n\nVERY few managers have used substitutes quite as effectively as Ronald Koeman at the Euros.\n\nWhile we have been bellowing at our TV screens for Gareth Southgate to make a change, the Dutch have had it down to a fine art over the last few weeks.\n\nPlan A - try and play through the opposition using the midfield craft of Xavi Simons and Tijjani Reijnders, which barring the last 16 game against Romania, has quite honestly not been as successful as Koeman would have hoped.\n\nPlan B, however, is to bring on a completely different type of striker in big Wout Weghorst, start hitting him with diagonal balls into the box, and let the chaos ensue.\n\nThe former Manchester United loanee, who is surprisingly still on the books at Burnley, has to be one of the most effective replacements in international football. He is a much better player than many give him credit to be, yet when the Dutch throw him onto the pitch to change up their attack, the sudden shift to a more direct style of football never fails to take you by surprise.\n\nTurkey couldn't handle him in the quarter-final, and he made a significant impact against Poland, France and Austria in the group stages too - albeit defeat in the third of those games meant the Dutch ended up finishing third.\n\nThe stats show that Weghorst has played 93 minutes of football in this tournament but that in his time on the pitch, his team have a positive xG of 3.87.\n\nWeghorst is the type of jarring change in direction that you might think goes against the Netherlands philosophy. But it was interesting listening to Gary Lineker recently when discussing Ivan Toney's impact against Slovakia, and he recalled how the great Johan Cruyff was not averse to throwing a centre-back forward in the final few minutes and going direct, if he felt the need.\n\nIt is a trick Koeman will inevitably keep up his sleeve for England, and one Southgate will no doubt have a plan to combat.",

England boss to be knighted even if he loses semi-final", "body": "England manager Gareth Southgate is in line for a knighthood, even if the Three Lions fail to reach the final of Euro 2024.\n\nThe 53-year-old is set to take charge of the senior men's side for the 101st time this evening with England eyeing up a place in the final against Spain.\n\nA vibrant, disciplined Netherlands side will block England's path to a second consecutive European Championship final and Southgate's date with density in Dortmund could yet transpire to be his last game as England boss with his contract due to run until the end of the calendar year.\n\nTalks are planned with Football Association chief executive Mark Bullingham after the Euros but, regardless of the outcome of tonight's match against the Dutch, Southgate is set to become a Sir, according to The Telegraph.\n\nThe former Middlesbrough and Aston Villa centre-half, who was also capped on on 57 occasions by England during an international career that spanned nine years, came close to being awarded the accolade during Boris Johnson's regime.\n\nUnder his tenure, England have also reached a World Cup semi final in 2018 and a quarter final two years ago where they suffered an unfortunate defeat against France.\n\nDespite still waiting to win a major tournament, his success and longevity compares favorably with Sir Alf Ramsey, England's 1996 World Cup winning coach, and Sir Bobby Robson who was knighted 12 years after standing down.\n\nThe prospect of receiving such an honour is unlikely to be anywhere near Southgate's thoughts as he begins his final preparations for England's biggest match in three years.\n\nIndeed, Southgate insists England's players are ready to make history, having overcome external noise, the weight of expectation and a fear of failure to reach another semi-final.\n\nAfter topping their group in unconvincing fashion, the Euro 2020 runners-up needed a stunning Jude Bellingham strike to save their blushes against Slovakia before beating Switzerland on penalties.\n\n'You're now into that moment in the tournament where it's what's possible, what's achievable, rather than what might go wrong,' boss Southgate said.\n\n'This is now the chance to make history, which we've enjoyed doing. A chance to get to a first final not held in England - first time England will have ever done that.\n\n'We're trying to break new ground. That's difficult and it's complicated, but the players have responded brilliantly and resilience has been built.'\n\nMORE : Is England's ITV curse real?

Kobbie Mainoo opened the scoring early doors, but second-half strikes from Xavi Simons and Cody Gakpo earned the Netherlands a spot in the final. England last competed in a European Championship final in 2021, while the Netherlands haven't reached the showpiece since 1988, when they won the tournament.\n\nEngland and the Netherlands both know who is waiting for them in the Euro 2024 final after the first semi-final between Spain and France delivered a thrilling encounter. Lamine Yamal produced the most show-stopping moment of his fledgling career so far before Dani Olmo scored a superb winner after Randal Kolo Muani had put France ahead early on.\n\nSpain will be the favourites against whoever they face in the final, but for now, England and the Netherlands will purely be focussed on each other. England are aiming to make back-to-back finals in the tournament, while the Dutch haven't reached the final of any Euros since they won it in 1988. Ahead of the game, we ran a match simulation on EA Sports' FC24.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: England have a historically poor record against the Netherlands, having only won six of their 22 matches against them. England's recent record against the Dutch is even worse, with just one win in their last nine games in all competitions.\n\nNetherlands vs England Simulated on FC24 A tight contest decided at the death\n\nLine-ups\n\nEngland line-up\n\nPickford; Walker, Stones, Guehi, Shaw; Mainoo, Rice; Bellingham, Saka, Foden; Kane\n\nNetherlands line-up\n\nVerbruggen; De Vrij, Ake, Van Dijk; Dumfries, Schouten, Simons, Reijnders; Gakpo, Depay, Bergwijn\n\nJust like they did in the European Championship final in 2021, England took the lead early doors through a Manchester United player. Luke Shaw, the scorer of England's opener against Italy in the Euro 2020 final, was back in the starting line-up, but it was teenager Kobbie Mainoo, starting in his third successive game for the Three Lions, who smashed home with his left foot after being assisted by captain Harry Kane.\n\nRelated Alan Shearer Names his England Starting 11 to Face the Netherlands\n\nAlan Shearer has had his say on who should start England's Euro 2024 semi-final tie against the Netherlands.\n\nEngland held onto their lead until half-time, but the Netherlands levelled things up in the 61st minute through another prodigious midfielder, Xavi Simons. At 21, Simons has so far shown at the tournament why there was so much hype around him as a teenager, and he rifled a shot past England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford to cancel out Mainoo's early goal.\n\nWith the match seemingly heading for extra time, the Netherlands caught England on the counter in the 89th minute, and Cody Gakpo, one of the stars of the tournament so far, drilled a left-footed shot past Pickford to put England in a perilous position.\n\nUltimately, with Gakpo's goal coming so late in proceedings, England did not have enough time to find a response and it was the Netherlands who ended up winning the match 2-1, setting up a mouth-watering final against Spain in Berlin.\n\nMatch Stats England edge possession while Netherlands' higher xG proves pivotal\n\nThe match was a tight affair, with England edging the possession stats with 52 per cent to the Netherlands' 48 per cent. The Netherlands made more passes though, and their expected goals (xG) was also higher at 1.6 to England's 1.4.\n\nThe Player of the Match award went to Dutch midfielder Simons, who boasted a 90 per cent pass accuracy throughout the game, and also successfully completed 19 of his 20 dribbles at a success rate of 95 per cent. Simons also covered 12.6km during the game, more than 3km more than the team's average.\n\nOut of the England players, Harry Kane, who has yet to hit his straps at the tournament, ended the match with the highest rating (7.3 - marginally better than John Stones' 7.2). Kane assisted Mainoo's opening goal and also boasted a 91 per cent pass accuracy, as well as an 86 per cent dribble success rate.\n\nDespite being a striker, Kane only managed to get one shot off during the entire game - that's three fewer than Simons, who managed four shots on goal from midfield. Like Simons, Kane outran the majority of his teammates, covering 11.1km during the match.\n\nRelated England vs. Netherlands - Predicted Starting XI\n\nEverything you need to know about England's huge

Dumfries, De Vrij, Van Dijk, Ak\u00e9; Schouten, Simons, Reijnders; Malen, Depay, Gakpo\n\nEngland: Pickford; Walker, Stones, Gu\u00e9hi; Saka, Mainoo, Rice, Shaw; Bellingham, Foden; Kane", "source": {"uri": "sarajevotimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sarajevo Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Nations_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Nations League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Gu\u00e9hi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marc Gu\u00e9hi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cody_Gakpo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cody Gakpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donyell_Malen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donyell Malen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Pickford", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Pickford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Ak\u00e9", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nathan Ak\u00e9"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declan_Rice", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Declan Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_de_Vrij", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stefan de Vrij"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_Zwayer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Felix Zwayer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil_van_Dijk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virgil van Dijk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis_Depay", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Memphis Depay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Koeman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Koeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Mah_Jongg", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Mah Jongg", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Swamp_Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Swamp Soccer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://sarajevotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/48F34766-6EAB-47EE-AC49-5602EA8FA614.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712618", "eventUri": "eng-9712618", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

Both sides have previously gone on to reach the last four after famous group wins against their opponents in this tie, the Netherlands in 1988 and England in 1996.\n\nThe teams both endured testing quarterfinals to set up this tie, England needing a late Bukayo Saka equaliser to earn a 1-1 draw against Switzerland in D\u00fcsseldorf and subsequently converting all of their kicks in the shoot-out to win 5-3 on penalties; Netherlands had to come from behind to beat T\u00fcrkiye 2-1 in Berlin.\n\nEngland had also endured a tense round of 16 tie, Harry Kane heading the extra-time winner in a 2-1 defeat of Slovakia in Gelsenkirchen, Jude Bellingham's audacious overhead kick having levelled in the final seconds of normal time.\n\nIn contrast Netherlands swept past Romania 3-0 in Munich, Donyell Malen's late double adding gloss to Cody Gakpo's first-half strike.\n\nEngland had finished top of Group C on five points, beating Serbia 1-0 before draws with Denmark (1-1) and Slovenia (0-0). Netherlands took four points from their first two Group D games, against Poland (2-1) and France (0-0), but slipped to third place in the section after losing 3-2 against Austria in their final fixture.\n\nThe winners will play Spain in the final at Berlin's Olympiastadion on 14 July.\n\nThe sides last met on 6 June 2019, the Netherlands running out 3-1 winners after extra time in the Uefa Nations League at the Est\u00e1dio D. Afonso Henriques in the Portuguese city of Guimaraes. Gareth Southgate's England struck first thanks to Marcus Rashford's 32nd-minute penalty but a Netherlands side coached by Ronald Koeman - in his first spell in charge - levelled through Matthijs de Ligt with 17 minutes remaining and then triumphed in extra time thanks to Kyle Walker's 97th-minute own goal and a clinching third from substitute Quincy Promes in the 114th minute.\n\nThe teams' eight previous meetings had all been friendlies, a 1-0 England win in Amsterdam in March 2018 - with Koeman and Southgate again in charge - achieved with a Jesse Lingard goal ending a seven-match run without a victory against the Oranje (D4 L3).\n\nThat sequence without a victory stretched back to Matchday 3 of Euro '96, when an England side including Southgate were 4-1 winners against Netherlands thanks to two goals each from Alan Shearer (23pen, 57) and Teddy Sheringham (51, 62). A Patrick Kluivert consolation 12 minutes from time ensured the Dutch joined Group A winners England in progressing to the quarter-finals.\n\nThe teams' only other previous Euro meeting had come at the Rheinstadion in D\u00fcsseldorf in the second round of group games at the 1988 tournament. Marco van Basten gave Rinus Michels' Netherlands the lead a minute before half-time and, though Bryan Robson levelled eight minutes into the second period for an England side coached by Bobby Robson, Van Basten went on to complete his hat-trick (71, 75) to end England's hopes of progressing to the semi-finals.\n\nThe Dutch went on to beat hosts West Germany in the last four, Koeman scoring their first goal from the penalty spot in a 2-1 win, before claiming their only major silverware with a 2-0 final victory against the Soviet Union.\n\nKoeman also played in a goalless draw against England in the 1990 Fifa World Cup group stage and had a pivotal role when the countries met again in the 1994 qualifying competition.\n\nAbsent for a 2-2 draw at Wembley on 28 April 1993 in which Dick Advocaat's Dutch side fought back from two goals down to earn a point, he captained the home side in Rotterdam on 13 October 1993, scoring the free-kick opener in a 2-0 win that proved crucial in the Oranje reaching the finals at the expense of Graham Taylor's England. Dennis Bergkamp scored for Netherlands in both matches.\n\nEngland won four of the first seven matches between the sides but have managed only two wins in the 15 subsequent games, losing six including three of the last four.\n\nNetherlands' record in European Championship semi-finals is W1 L4:\n\nHaving scored a penalty equaliser against West Germany in 1988, Koeman converted the Netherlands' first spot kick against Denmark in the shoot-out four years later, with Van Basten the only player from either side to miss his kick.\n\nAgainst ten-man Italy in the 2000 semifinal in Amsterdam, co-hosts Netherlands missed two penalties in normal time and three more in the shoot-out to bow out.\n\nThis is the Netherlands' 11th Euro appearance, their most famous campaign coming in 1988 when goals from Ruud Gullit and Van Basten earned a team coached by Michels a 2-0 final win against the Soviet Union in Munich.\n\nThe Dutch are making their ninth appearance in the last ten editions of the tournament, missing out only in 2016.\n\nAt Euro 2020, under Frank de Boer, the Netherlands were first in Group C on nine points after wins against Ukraine (3-2), Austria (2-0) and North Macedonia (3-0), but then lost 2-0 to Czechia in the round of 16.\n\nWith Koeman - a European champion as a player in 1988 - returning for his second spell in charge from 1 January 2023, the Netherlands qualified for Euro 2024 as Group B runners-up. Beaten 4-0 away and 2-1 at home by section winners France, they triumphed in their other six games, a 1-0 victory against the Republic of Ireland in Amsterdam in their penultimate qualifier confirming a finals place.\n\nThe Oranje lost four of their ten games in 2023, winning the other six, but the Matchday 3 defeat by Austria is one of only two in nine matches in 2024 (W6 D1). A 2-1 friendly loss to Germany in Frankfurt on 26 March is their only other reverse in their last 12 outings, and one of only three they have not won.\n\nGakpo was one of four players to have scored three Euro 2024 goals ahead of the semi-finals.\n\nThe Dutch have progressed from the group stage eight times out of ten, including on eight of their last nine appearances.\n\nNetherlands played three group games at the BVB Stadion Dortmund in the 1974 World Cup, drawing 0-0 with Sweden before beating Bulgaria 4-1 and Brazil 2-0. Their only other visit was a 3-1 friendly loss against West Germany on 14 May 1986, a match in which Koeman played 90 minutes.\n\nEngland\n\nEngland's record in European Championship semi-finals is W1 L2:\n\nHarry Kane scored England's extra-time winner against Denmark at Euro 2020, converting the rebound after his penalty had been saved. Jordan Pickford, Walker, John Stones, Luke Shaw, Declan Rice, Saka and substitutes Kieran Trippier and Phil Foden also featured in that game.\n\nEngland are bidding to become only the fourth country to reach successive European Championship finals, after Germany (1972, 1976, 1980 as West Germany; 1992, 1996 as Germany), the Soviet Union (1960, 1964) and Spain (2008, 2012).\n\nEight of England's last 11 Euro knockout games - including all of the last four - have gone to extra time.\n\nThe Three Lions are making their 11th appearance at the final tournament and a ninth in the last ten editions of the competition, missing out only in 2008.\n\nEuro 2020 proved to be England's most successful campaign as they finished first in Group D ahead of Croatia, Czechia and Scotland before knockout wins against Germany (2-0), Ukraine (4-0) and Denmark (2-1 aet) took them into the final for the first time.\n\nShaw's second-minute goal gave them the lead against Italy at Wembley, but after the Azzurri levelled Southgate's side ultimately lost 3-2 on penalties.\n\nIn charge since 2016, Southgate oversaw an unbeaten qualifying campaign for Euro 2024, his side winning six of their eight games, scoring 22 goals and conceding only four, to finish six points clear at the top of Group C. England reached a fourth successive Euro with two matches to spare thanks to a 3-1 home win against Italy on 17 October.\n\nThe extra-time win against Slovakia is one of three in England's last ten matches (D5 L2).\n\nEngland have now qualified from the group stage on their last five European Championship appearances, having failed to progress to the knockout rounds in three of the previous four.\n\nEngland are unbeaten in their last 12 Euro matches, since a 2-1 loss to Iceland in the 2016 round of 16 (W7 D5).\n\nThat defeat by Iceland is England's only reverse in 23 Euro finals matches (W12 D10), with the penalty shoot-outs against Italy (2012, 2020), Portugal (2004) and Switzerland (2024) counted as draws.\n\nFour of England's five Euro 2024 goals have been scored by Bellingham and Kane - two each.\n\nKane made his 79th competitive appearance for England in the round of 16 against Slovakia - a new national record. He had been level with Peter Shilton on 78.\n\nEngland's sole previous match at the BVB Stadion Dortmund is a 1-0 friendly loss against Germany on 22 March 2017, a match Walker started with Shaw and Stones late substitutes.", "source": {"uri": "supersport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SuperSport.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_van_Basten", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marco van Basten"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Koeman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Koeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D\u00fcsseldorf", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "D\u00fcsseldorf"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "D\u00fcsseldorf"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Amsterdam"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Amsterdam"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Austria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donyell_Malen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donyell Malen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Rashford", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Rashford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympiastadion_(Berlin)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympiastadion (Berlin)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Est\u00e1dio_D._Afonso_Henriques", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Est\u00e1dio D.

None of this is easy, but we're in a third semi-final in four tournaments.\"\n\nAfter reaching the 2018 World Cup semi-finals and being beaten in the Euro 2020 final on penalties by Italy, England began this tournament as one of the two favourites along with France.\n\nLes Bleus have also played in a rather tedious, yet adequate, fashion to reach the other semi-final, facing Spain.\n\nSouthgate noted even La Roja, who by contrast have dazzled this summer in Germany, modified their style to be more direct as they beat the hosts in the quarter-finals.\n\n\"It's not just about playing well -- Spain mixed their game up, they took seven yellow cards, they found ways to win,\" said the coach.\n\nThey now face a Dutch team whose five games have produced nearly double the number of goals as in England's, despite playing 60 minutes less.\n\nIn Liverpool's Cody Gakpo and Burnley target man Wout Weghorst, Ronald Koeman's side have a variety of different tools to create havoc at the other end, leading to hope of a more entertaining, higher-calibre clash.\n\nOne bone of contention England fans have had with Southgate is his reluctance to make changes.\n\nCole Palmer, arguably the player of the season in England, has not started a game in Germany, while Ollie Watkins would offer the ability to run in behind that Kane can no longer muster. Anthony Gordon, who would add dynamism on the left, has gone virtually ignored.\n\nIf they can defeat the Netherlands with a convincing display instead of another isolated moment of brilliance, it will give the team hope ahead of a potential final.\n\nFans tossed beer cups at Southgate during a dull goalless draw with Slovenia but all will be forgiven if England triumph in Berlin on July 14.\n\n\"I don't think it is normal to have beer thrown at you,\" said Southgate.\n\n\"But we will keep grinding, keep fighting and keep enjoying this journey.\"", "source": {"uri": "urdupoint.com",

Classic contests ahead of Euro 2024 semi-final", "body": "Sports Mole looks at five classic contests between the Netherlands and England ahead of Wednesday's Euro 2024 semi-final.\n\nyou have updates\n\nFor the 23rd time in their long and illustrious histories, the Netherlands and England will clash in a men's football match on Wednesday evening, and few of their previous clashes have held as much significance as this one.\n\nThe victor of the titanic tie - kicking off at 8pm UK time at the Signal Iduna Park in Dortmund - will be rewarded with a coveted place in the Euro 2024 final, where either Spain or France will stand between them and the Henri Delaunay trophy.\n\nWhile the Three Lions needed their penchant for penalties to come to the fore in a quarter-final shootout victory over Switzerland - thereby reaching their third semi-final from four tournaments under Gareth Southgate - Ronald Koeman's men came from behind to sink a bullish Turkey outfit 2-1 in the last eight.\n\nAhead of Wednesday's eagerly-awaited semi-final, Sports Mole picks out five classic matches between the Netherlands and England to whet your appetite even further.\n\nEngland 1-3 Netherlands (Euro 88 Group Stage)\n\nEmulating the luminaries of 1988 is the ultimate goal for the current Netherlands crop, and during Oranje's barnstorming run to European Championship glory in that tournament - also held in Germany - England were coincidentally one of their victims.\n\nWednesday's foes faced one another in their second Group 2 match after both suffering narrow 1-0 losses in their opening affairs, but thanks to an inspirational individual display from Marco van Basten, the Dutch demons were exorcised in Dusseldorf.\n\nAfter both Glenn Hoddle and Gary Lineker struck the post for England, Van Basten's first arrived on the stroke of half time as he spun Tony Adams and fired home, but smart link-up play between Lineker and Bryan Robson saw the latter draw the Three Lions level early in the second period.\n\nHowever, Sir Bobby Robson's men had merely prodded the Van Basten bear, as the talismanic Dutch attacker rifled in his second before completing his hat-trick in the 75th minute after England failed to deal with a corner.\n\nThat beatdown still represents England's joint-heaviest loss in the men's Euros - they were defeated by the same scoreline against the Soviet Union just days later - but more desirable record was set by a 38-year-old Peter Shilton, who became the oldest Englishman to ever play at the European Championship.\n\nEngland 8-2 Netherlands (International Friendly | Nov 27, 1946)\n\nA scoreline that is perhaps best associated with Manchester United's destruction of Arsenal in 2011 or Bayern Munich's pummelling of Barcelona in 2020, England also struck 80% of the goals in just their second-ever professional meeting with the Netherlands.\n\nHeld at the old Leeds Road in Huddersfield, a 32,000-strong crowd arrived to witness Walter Winterbottom's England demolish the Dutch in a 10-goal friendly spectacular, in which Tommy Lawton ended the game with four goals to his name.\n\nRaich Carter also helped himself to a brace, while Wilf Mannion and the late great Tom Finney - who scored just his third goal for the national team - also contributed to the 8-2 rout.\n\nThat Three Lions lashing unsurprisingly remains the biggest margin of victory in any men's match involving England or the Netherlands, who had to wait until 1977 for their maiden success over the Euro 2020 runners-up.\n\nNetherlands 3-1 England (Nations League Semi-Final | June 6, 2019)\n\nThe most recent battle between England and the Netherlands - and one in which Southgate and Koeman were both in the dugouts for - was a tale of redemption for one Dutch defender and a story of woe for those in white shirts.\n\nAfter a sleeping Matthijs de Ligt conceded a first-half penalty for Marcus Rashford to dispatch, the former Ajax protege towered above his opponents to head Oranje level 17 minutes before the end of normal time, forcing an extra 30 in the process.\n\nWhile he has come on leaps and bounds since, John Stones was at fault for a Kyle Walker own goal in the 97th minute - dilly-dallying with the ball inside his own penalty area and allowing Memphis Depay to nip in and cross for Quincy Promes, who forced the ball over with the aid of a significant Walker deflection.\n\nWith six minutes of the 120 remaining, Stones then played a pass out from the back to an under-pressure Ross Barkley, who cheaply gave possession back to Depay and helplessly watched the ex-Barcelona man square for Promes to tap into an empty net.\n\nHowever, an error-strewn England - who also had a Jesse Lingard strike disallowed for a marginal offside - actually ended the tournament on a higher note, ironically beating Switzerland on penalties in the third-placed playoff while the Netherlands were bested by Portugal in the final.\n\nNetherlands 1-4 England (Euro 96 Group Stage)\n\nEight years on from the Van Basten masterclass at Euro 88, the perfect opportunity for revenge arose for England at their home Championships in 1996, where they would find themselves drawn against the Netherlands in the group phase once more.\n\nTied on four points apiece heading into their closing contest, a new-look England side - albeit one still with Adams at the defensive helm - were in the ascendancy at half time, as the skilful Paul Ince won a penalty for Alan Shearer to smash home.\n\nThe Wembley floodgates well and truly opened after the break, as a brilliant Teddy Sheringham header doubled the Three Lions' advantage, before both he and Shearer completed their braces to put England out of sight, both in the game and in the group.\n\nPatrick Kluivert did at least manage to nab a Netherlands consolation from a tight angle, but there was no stopping the Three Lions cruising to their joint-biggest win at the Championships, albeit one that preceded all-too familiar penalty heartbreak in the final four.\n\nEngland 2-3 Netherlands (International Friendly | Feb 29, 2012)\n\nOtherwise known as the night that Arjen Robben made Wembley Stadium his playground, England welcomed the 2010 World Cup runners-up to their headquarters for a five-goal friendly extravaganza in 2012, in what was Stuart Pearce's only match as caretaker manager of the Three Lions.\n\nIn dire need of some inspiration after Fabio Capello's bitter resignation, Pearce fielded a hotchpotch England team captained by Scott Parker and spearheaded by Danny Welbeck, and there were no goals to be had in a low-key first half.\n\nOranje quickly asserted their authority in the second, where Robben's scintillating solo run ended with a deserved goal for the erstwhile Bayern Munich winger, before Klaas-Jan Huntelaar was involved in a nasty clash of heads with Chris Smalling, but not without nodding in the Netherlands' second.\n\nHowever, an unexpected stalemate appeared to be on the cards when Gary Cahill and Ashley Young dramatically struck inside the final five minutes, but a stellar England comeback was rendered meaningless by the magical left foot of Robben, who curled an exquisite injury-time winner into the top corner beyond Joe Hart's futile reach.\n\nbody check tags ::", "source": {"uri": "amp.sportsmole.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title":

Enough of the criticism. Enough of the rudeness and, as Gareth Southgate himself puts it, the \"ridicule\". Not that it ever should have been like this in the first place.\n\nWhen England return from Germany, when their involvement in the European Championship is over - either as losing semi-finalists, losing finalists or winners - there should be some soul-searching over the levels of anger that have been generated. Even by Southgate himself.\n\nEngland are in the last four, again, of a major finals. The penalty shoot-out victory over Switzerland, the moment of sweet redemption for Bukayo Saka, Southgate dancing on the pitch is up there with the greatest episodes in England's tournament history.\n\nLike the shoot-out win against Colombia at the 2018 World Cup, like the last-16 triumph over Germany at the last Euros, and the run to the final, it is a big moment, an uplifting moment, a galvanising moment that Southgate has helped deliver.\n\nNow it also must be when the nation unites behind Southgate once more in what could be an epic week for England. Although quite why they were not already united is unfathomable.\n\nYes, the football has largely been unconvincing. Yes, there have been questions over tactics and approach. But this should have been the backdrop. Not the noise that has angrily threatened to drown England's campaign and so upset Southgate.\n\nIt comes with the territory, to a degree, as England manager. But the personal nature of the attacks - being called \"inept\", even if it was archly framed as a question, by Gary Lineker - and the physical nature also with beer cups being thrown in Cologne despite having won the group is unacceptable and unfair.\n\nSouthgate does not deserve these personal comment, even if they has always appeared too close to the surface when his competence to do the job is discussed.\n\nIt was during the summer camp in 2022 before the last World Cup, that Southgate, again, stated, unprompted that \"I won't outstay my welcome\" which took aback those who were talking to him. No-one had even asked Southgate about his future and it led to questions about why he felt the need to raise it. \"But that's how I have always felt about it,\" Southgate said. A few days later he was booed off at Molineux after a 4-0 Nations League defeat by Hungary.\n\nWhile Southgate has never been under any illusions about the England job - he was in the team when Terry Venables was effectively forced out and was there, also, when Kevin Keegan dramatically quit - it was still a surprise.\n\n\"I accept that is what all my predecessors have had so why would it be any different for me?\" Southgate asked. Except now he is saying it is unacceptable and rightly so. He is not a punchbag for others and he deserves more respect. Even after the shoot-out win over a tough Swiss side there was that undercurrent that England were achieving despite, not because of, the manager.\n\nSo, what now? England face the Netherlands in Dortmund on Wednesday in the semi-finals and for those complaining that they have had an easy passage to this stage of the tournament then here is a football heavyweight to defeat.\n\nIf England succeed they will head to Berlin for Sunday's final against either Spain or France. Two more big beasts. That route to winning the Euros is tough. It always is tough.\n\nIf England lose then the fear of failure has gone. Failure was not failing to win the Euros - that was always a ridiculously high bar to set.\n\nInstead failure was not getting through the group - such as losing all three games, as they did the last time the competition was held in Germany, in 1988. With Lineker up front (he did not score) England lost to the Republic of Ireland, the Dutch and the USSR.\n\nFailure would have been to go out to Slovakia in the last-16 or the Swiss in the quarter-finals. That did not happen. Now England are left with the big boys. They have made the cut and hopefully that will be liberating. Not for the players but for the fans and the public and the pundits. Maybe they can now sit back and actually begin to enjoy the tournament a bit more.\n\nSo go out and win it.\n\nEngland have not played well. It keeps being said and needs to be said. We know that. They have often looked like a team of 'moments' - such as both of Jude Bellingham's goals and Saka's super strike - but also a team that has deep reserves of resilience.\n\nThey have come from behind in both their knock-out ties - prior to Southgate they would have frozen as they did against Iceland - and they have confidently won a penalty shoot-out.\n\nIn fact England have only ever won four shoot-outs - from 12. And Southgate has won three of them as manager and was on the pitch for the fourth as a player (against Spain at Euro 96).\n\nSouthgate will probably go, come what may, after the Euros. His demeanour, his behaviour and what he is saying all suggest that the decision is made. Even if England win their first trophy since 1966 it looks like he will leave because he has been made to feel like he has outstayed his welcome. Maybe after eight years it is even time for a change.\n\nWhatever happens with Southgate's future England need to enjoy the present. There is a need to get behind him and the team. As Saka says there are (hopefully) \"two more games until we can change our lives and make some history\". Right now that is all that matters.\n\nRecommended\n\nGary Lineker backs Frank Lampard as Gareth Southgate successor Read more", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

It was predominantly blue for Italy and France's group games there, while it became white for Germany's dramatic last-16 victory over Denmark. Indeed, the stadium has become something of a fortress for the Germans down the years.\n\nThe fortunes of other teams whose fans have colonised the southern stand at Euro 2024 have been decidedly mixed. Turkey lost against Portugal there before beating Georgia, Italy struggled to see off Albania, and France were held 1-1 by Poland.\n\nHow big a part any Orange Wall will play on Wednesday, therefore, remains to be seen.\n\nHow do I buy England tickets?\n\nFans can apply for tickets for any team via the Uefa Euro 2024 ticket portal.\n\nEngland's route to the semi-finals\n\nEngland narrowly beat Serbia 1-0 in their opening match of the group state, thanks to Jude Bellingham's early header, and then drew with Denmark with a performance that drew plenty of criticism.

v England: Will Kane rediscover best form and who can contain Dumfries?", "body": "Ahead of the Euro 2024 semi-final, we take a look at the key match-ups and talking points\n\nEngland face the Netherlands in Dortmund on Wednesday evening looking to book a place in back-to-back European Championship finals.\n\nGareth Southgate's side have been heavily criticised for their performances at Euro 2024 but are one game away from Sunday's showpiece in Berlin.\n\nHere, we take a look at some of the key match-ups and talking points ahead of the semi-final.\n\nIt would have been unthinkable before a ball was kicked at the Euros to consider that Harry Kane's place in Gareth Southgate's starting XI would be called into question.\n\nEngland striker Kane has endured an underwhelming tournament, far from the goal machine he proved in his first season at Bayern Munich.\n\nKane, 30, has notched just two goals at these Euros, including the winner in England's last-16 extra-time win over Slovakia.\n\nFinishing the season with a back problem, Kane clearly is nowhere close to his physical peak and now must tussle with Liverpool defender Virgil van Dijk.\n\nThe giant Dutchman has not been at his best either but like his team, has improved in the knock-out rounds.\n\nWith Southgate reluctant to take off his stars, keeping Kane marshalled could go a long way to stopping the somewhat limited threat England have thus far offered.\n\nIn all likelihood, Southgate will stick with his talisman for such a big game, but the fact his place is even being speculated about speaks volumes for his summer so far.\n\nLuke Shaw made his long-awaited comeback from injury as he came off the bench in Saturday's quarter-final against Switzerland, racking up his first minutes since a hamstring problem he suffered at Manchester United in February.\n\nThe defender, 28, had hoped to be available earlier in the competition as Southgate opted to bring just one recognised left-back in his 26-man squad - but a setback delayed his return.\n\nNow though, he insists he is ready to start against the Netherlands on Wednesday night.\n\nSouthgate must weigh up whether to turn to Shaw or stick with Kieran Trippier to contain the threat posed by Netherlands defender Denzel Dumfries.\n\nDutch right-back Dumfries leapt to fame for his buccaneering runs down the right in Euro 2020 and he has been a menace again this summer.\n\nThe always-enterprising Dumfries set up his team's winner against Turkey in the quarter-final with a dangerous raking cross.\n\nWhether it's Shaw or Trippier, their primary job will be to keep Dumfries out of the game, which is no easy task.\n\nSouthgate made the call to switch to a back three against Switzerland and, while the tie was ultimately decided on penalties, England did produce an improved performance.\n\nShaw could now come in to help the balance even more, while Marc Guehi is available after serving a one-match ban.\n\nThe shift, though, has allowed Phil Foden and Jude Bellingham more chance to roam with the pair able to both operate centrally, while Bukayo Saka's turn at right wing-back saw the Arsenal man produce his best football of the tournament so far.\n\nAll in all, it now seems improbable Southgate would abandon the change in system after one game, although - unlike the Swiss - the Netherlands do usually operate with a back four.\n\nWhile England and Real Madrid midfielder Bellingham has not hit top form yet, he has played a decisive role at key moments in England's run to the semi-finals.\n\nHis most dramatic contribution was a stunning overhead kick against Slovakia late in the last-16 clash to save England from elimination.\n\nNetherlands will be looking to their deeper-lying midfield duo Tijjani Reijnders and Jerdy Schouten to keep Bellingham under wraps.\n\nThe Dutch pair have fared well together and coach Ronald Koeman seems all-in on them now after starting Joey Veerman against Austria but hauling him off in the first half as the Dutch fell to defeat in their third group game.", "source": {"uri": "thenationalnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The National"}, "authors": [],

This match, scheduled for Wednesday night, carries with it the hopes and expectations of nations striving to secure their spot in the final in Berlin.\n\nUnder Gareth Southgate, England's journey through the tournament has epitomized resilience. With a campaign marked by last-minute heroics and penalty shootouts, England's path has been anything but straightforward. Their qualification for the semi-finals was dramatically sealed by a 95th-minute overhead kick from Jude Bellingham against Slovakia, followed by a nail-biting penalty victory over Switzerland.\n\nThe Netherlands, managed by Ronald Koeman, have similarly navigated a complex route to the semi-finals. After a shaky group stage, the Dutch team has grown in confidence, showcased by their comeback victory against Turkey. Despite not being pre-tournament favourites, the Netherlands find themselves in a Euro semi-final for the first time in two decades, prompting a reevaluation of their potential to go all the way.\n\nThe showdown between England and the Netherlands is poised for an 8 pm BST start on July 10, 2024, at the iconic BVB Stadion Dortmund. UK viewers can catch the live action on ITV1, with coverage commencing at 6.30 pm. Additionally, the match will be available for streaming via the ITVX app and website, ensuring no fan misses out on the action.\n\nThe Dutch squad has shown consistency in selection, with Koeman sticking to the same starting XI in their knockout matches. However, Steven Bergwijn's underwhelming performances may see him replaced, with Jeremie Frimpong and Donyell Malen waiting in the wings. The Dutch will likely persist with their fluid 4-2-3-1 formation, featuring Xavi Simons behind the forward line and Cody Gakpo creating threats from the left.\n\nEngland, on the other hand, faces selection dilemmas, particularly concerning their defensive tactics and the fitness of key players like Harry Kane, who is expected to overcome cramp issues. The return of Marc Guehi from suspension provides Southgate with additional options, enhancing the team's defensive resilience.\n\nBoth teams bring distinct strengths and vulnerabilities to this encounter. England boasts a squad rich in international experience and youthful talent, factors that Southgate believes will be decisive. However, England's cautious approach in attack has often left them exposed to counter-attacks, a risk that the Dutch could exploit with their capacity for swift, incisive play.\n\nHistorically, encounters between these two have often been tightly contested, with England having a slight edge in recent competitive fixtures. The last significant meeting at Euro 96 saw England triumph, but overall, the Netherlands holds a better head-to-head record in major tournaments.\n\nThis semi-final is expected to be a chess match of football tactics, with both teams likely to be cautious, knowing what is at stake. England will need to balance their solid defensive work with more effective attacks, while the Netherlands will aim to capitalize on any English lapses with quick transitions and precise finishing.\n\nAs the anticipation builds towards this pivotal clash, it's clear that the encounter could extend into extra time, given the high stakes and the strategic nature of both teams. Fans will hope that England's quality and experience can see them through to what promises to be a memorable final in Berlin.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Southgate must have wondered if eight years' work was in danger of crashing down around him.\n\n\"I had to correct how they were viewing things,\" he said yesterday.\n\nSince the knockout wins over Slovakia and Switzerland, the manager has sensed a new belief in the group, with the players now relishing the opportunity to \"change our lives\", as Bukayo Saka put it after the quarter-final.\n\nSouthgate has nonetheless used the quick turnaround since Saturday's game to urge them to focus solely on what is possible this week. \"We don't want to be burdened by what's happened before,\" he said. \"We've got to use this opportunity to change history as a motivation.\"\n\nAt play for England is a first major final on foreign soil, even if Southgate is clear that \"we're not happy with a semi-final, our aim is to win it\".\n\nThe manager's critics claim England have stumbled against the first top team they have faced at the past three tournaments, and though the jury is out on whether Ronald Koeman's Dutch are truly among the continent's best, tonight is also a chance for this team to prove they can beat an established nation.\n\nSuch are the standards Southgate is held to, there would inevitably be claims that Holland are also-rans if England win, but there is no questioning their pedigree.\n\nThe England squad's mindset may have improved but, to be champions in Berlin on Sunday, performances surely must, too.\n\nGareth Southgate\n\nTheir two knockout wins have demonstrated grit and character, but Saka's equaliser against the Swiss and Jude Bellingham's 95th-minute bicycle-kick to rescue the last-16 tie with Slovakia were their first shots on target in each game.\n\nThe manager has excused England's stodginess by pointing out that four of five teams they have faced have used a back-five, and one question is whether Holland, who are wedded to a 4-3-3 system, will be more prepared to attack and create an open game.\n\nThere are suggestions in Holland, though, that Koeman will tell his players to sit in and counter-punch, forgetting their reputation for 'total football'. After all, why would any side open up against England, when they have looked so incapable of creating chances?\n\n\"That wouldn't be normal for the way Dutch teams play and it's not what we've seen from them,\" said Southgate, when asked if they could be more reactive. \"Equally, Ronald's an experienced coach and he could approach the game in a very different way. We're prepared for anything.\"\n\nWhatever the set-up, Holland will threaten in the final third, with Memphis Depay and Cody Gakpo, a leading contender in a limp race for the Golden Boot, looking dangerous.\n\nKoeman is considering starting hulking centre-forward Wout Weghorst and moving Depay to the wing, while Southgate's big decisions centre on the formation and Luke Shaw's readiness to start.\n\nHarry Kane's form remains up for debate and his battle with Virgil van Dijk should be intriguing, particularly after Manuel Akanji largely marked him out of the quarter-final.\n\nLike Kane, Bellingham has largely delivered in moments so far and England will hope he is inspired by a return to the ground where he spent three happy seasons with Borussia Dortmund.\n\nFans of a certain generation will not have forgotten Koeman's role in denying England a place at the 1994 World Cup, his cynical foul on David Platt and subsequent goal the decisive moments in a 2-0 qualifying defeat. Koeman became public enemy No1, a mantle briefly taken up by Southgate after Euro '96 but not before he had helped England to a 4-1 win over Holland in the group stage.\n\nBut all of that rich history in this fixture is just as irrelevant to Southgate as the defeats to Croatia, Italy and France in the past three major tournaments; he is only focused on what is ahead.\n\n\"It's the players' moment now,\" Southgate said. \"Nothing that's gone on in the past, none of that is their fault or concern.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Koeman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Koeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovakia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Formation (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cody_Gakpo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cody Gakpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wout_Weghorst", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wout Weghorst"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil_van_Dijk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virgil van Dijk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Total Football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis_Depay", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Memphis Depay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Shaw", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luke Shaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Akanji", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manuel Akanji"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/evening_standard_239/1ab86f731f62429c4f0dd540142c132f", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712618", "eventUri": "eng-9712618", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

For England especially, there's a feeling that anything less than a return trip to the final is a disappointment.\n\nYou can catch England vs. the Netherlands LIVE at UEFA Euro 2024 from Dortmund with coverage getting underway at 2pm et/11am pt on TSN1/4, TSN.ca and the TSN App.\n\nThis Three Lions side loves to leave it late. It took Jude Bellingham's spectacular overhead kick to force extra time in their Round of 16 encounter with Slovakia before a Harry Kane header won it early in the first extra 15 in a 2-1 victory. Then in the quarters against Switzerland, England fell behind again with Breel Embolo putting the Swiss up in the 75. It was Bukayo Saka who came to the rescue only five minutes later with a low strike from just outside the area that beat Yann Sommer.\n\nExtra time didn't solve anything, and the match moved on to the traditional bane of England's existence at international tournaments - penalties. This time, though, England left nothing to chance. A cheat sheet on his water bottle that let Jordan Pickford know of each potential Switzerland shooter's penalty proclivities allowed the Everton goalkeeper to start the spot kicks with a stop on Manchester City defender Manuel Akanji. That would be all his shooters needed as all five Three Lions players converted their spot kicks, with Brentford forward Ivan Toney never averting his gaze from Sommer's eyes in a moment of supreme confidence.\n\nFor Luke Shaw, it doesn't matter how England got there. All that he's concerned with is that they're in another final four.\n\n\"The most important thing is winning,\" the Manchester United left-back said. \"At the moment, whether people like it or not, the way we're playing [got us] in the semifinals. That's all that matters.\"\n\nThe 28-year-old Shaw, who had been out of action since February with a hamstring injury, made his tournament debut as a substitute in the quarters. He says he's ready to play a full 90 minutes now, and thanked manager Gareth Southgate for sticking by him.\n\n\"The last four months have been really tough,\" Shaw said. \"At the start, I was expected to come back a lot sooner, but I went through a lot of setbacks. It was really nice to get on the other night and get some minutes - I've been itching. I think before the squad got announced, we had a plan to come back around the second or third game but, unfortunately, things didn't go as planned and I was pushed back a game or so...They were really there for me, not just Gareth and [assistant manager] Steve [Holland], but the medical staff, as well. I have a lot to thank them for.\"\n\nOn the other side of the pitch, the Oranje showed their mettle in the quarter-finals. After a comfortable 3-0 win over Romania in the Round of 16, the Dutch got all they could handle from Turkiye in the final eight.\n\nFalling behind 1-0 late in the first half, it was almost curtains for Ronald Koeman's team in the 65. Bart Verbruggen did well to deal with a shot from distance from Arda Guler, but he parried directly into the path of Kaan Ayhan, who appeared to have a tap-in to double the lead. Before he could do that, though, striker Wout Weghorst intervened at the last possible moment to poke it away and keep his team alive in the match.\n\nOnly five minutes later, the Dutch were level when Stefan de Vrij met Memphis Depay's cross with a powerful header to beat Mert Gunok. Then, moments after that, Mert Muldur turned a Denzel Dumfries cross into his own net as he attempted to stop Cody Gakpo from scoring a fourth goal of the tournament to make it 2-1 and the Netherlands held on.\n\nCity defender Nathan Ak\u00e9 believes the Oranje are finally rounding into form after a disappointing group stage that saw them finish third behind Austria and France.\n\n\"We're building momentum,\" Ak\u00e9 said. \"We came through tough stages at the start of the tournament and now we've got through another test, so we're ready. Underdog or not, it doesn't matter. We focus on ourselves. We know what we need to do. We are very close now.\"\n\nFrom a tactical perspective, Southgate has a choice to make. Switching to a back three of Kyle Walker, John Stones and Ezri Konsa, in for the suspended Marc Guehi, to match Switzerland resulted in England's best performance of the tournament. With the Oranje utilizing a back four, it would make sense to go back to the four-man backline Southgate utilized in the first four matches, but there was enough to like against Switzerland to once again go with three. What Southgate opts for remains to be seen and it's unlikely he will tip his hand either way.\n\n\"A lot of our processes have been shared,\" Southgate said of the news breaking in advance of the switch to the back three. \"We live in an amazing world where it is so difficult for us because any element of surprise you might have is gone three days before the game. It's quite incredible really.\"\n\nThe Netherlands are 7-9-6 all-time against England and Wednesday's match will be the fourth between the two teams at a major tournament and third at a Euro. En route to winning the entire tournament, the Oranje defeated England 3-1 at Euro 1988 in the group stage on a hat trick from Marco van Basten. Two years later at the 1990 World Cup in Italy, the Three Lions and Netherlands would face off again in the group stage, this time playing to a 0-0 draw. Their final meeting took place at Euro 1996 as Alan Shearer and Teddy Sheringham each had a brace in a 4-1 Three Lions group-stage victory at Wembley Stadium.\n\nWhile the last time these two teams met wasn't at a major tournament, the match was of some importance. In the summer of 2019, the Oranje defeated England 3-1 in the UEFA Nations League semifinal on goals from Matthijs de Ligt and Quincy Promes and an own goal from Walker. Five England players from that match could feature on Wednesday, while seven are with the Oranje squad in Germany.\n\nNETHERLANDS POTENTIAL XI (4-3-3): Bart Verbruggen; Denzel Dumfries, Stefan de

The Dutch have so much quality but England are finding a way to win games. It is tournament football and I am not sure who is going to win it.\n\n\"My overall feeling is I am delighted for Gareth Southgate. He has been under pressure and taken a lot of flak and proved people wrong again. They are finding a way into a semi-final.\n\n\"I still don't feel like England have played anywhere near what they are capable of. Maybe it will come against the Dutch.\"\n\nReacting to the Netherlands' victory on Saturday night, meanwhile, Sutton added: \"I think we expected a dramatic game. Turkey were aggressive going forward and got themselves in front.\n\n\"It was really the change at half-time from Ronald Koeman. The Dutch dug deep, had the better chances and turned it round.

They are doing so well.\"\n\nSouthgate pointed to England's opponents using defensive formations and also blamed the grass in Germany.\n\n\"We're not able to score a load of goals at the moment, but we've played three teams that play a back five, well-organised defences,\" he continued.\n\n\"Pitches are a little bit bobbly so sometimes you need the extra touch and then the space is gone. None of this is easy, but we're in a third semi-final in four tournaments.\"\n\nSouthgate noted that even Spain, who have dazzled this summer in Germany, modified their style to be more direct.\n\n\"It's not just about playing well - Spain mixed their game up, they took seven yellow cards, they found ways to win,\" said the coach.\n\nEngland now face a Dutch team whose five games have produced nearly double the number of goals as in England's, despite playing 60 fewer minutes.\n\nIn Liverpool's Cody Gakpo and Burnley target man Wout Weghorst, Ronald Koeman's side have a variety of different tools to create havoc at the other end, leading to hope of a more entertaining, higher-calibre clash.\n\nOne bone of contention England fans have had with Southgate is his reluctance to make changes.\n\nCole Palmer, arguably the player of the season in England, has not started a game in Germany, while Ollie Watkins would offer the ability to run in behind that Kane can no longer muster.\n\nAnthony Gordon, who would add dynamism on the left, has gone virtually ignored.\n\nDespite some decisive moments Jude Bellingham has looked jaded after his exploits with Real Madrid and Phil Foden is operating at a far lower level than with Manchester City.\n\nSouthgate only rang in the changes against Switzerland after falling behind, before Bukayo Saka's fine strike from distance pulled England level.\n\nThere are concerns that like in the World Cup 2018 semi-final against Croatia, if Southgate is too reactive rather than proactive, England could lose control of the game against better opposition.\n\nIf they can defeat Holland with a convincing display instead of another isolated moment of brilliance, it will give the team hope ahead of a potential final.\n\nFans tossed beer cups at Southgate during a dull goalless draw with Slovenia but all will be forgiven if England triumph in Berlin on July 14.\n\n\"I don't think it is normal to have beer thrown at you,\" said Southgate. \"But we will keep grinding, keep fighting and keep enjoying this journey.\"", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com.my", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star "}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Van Basten's opener for the Netherlands was cancelled out by a Bryan Robson equaliser just after half-time, but two goals in five second-half minutes allowed Van Basten to complete his hat-trick and sealed a 3-1 Dutch win.\n\nThe nations were again drawn in the same group at the 1990 World Cup in Italy, and many of the players involved in 1988 again featured in this meeting in Cagliari, among them current Dutch boss Ronald Koeman.\n\nThe sides had each drawn their opening match, with England being held by Ireland and the Netherlands by Egypt. This time England kept Van Basten quiet in a 0-0 draw, and it was England who would top the group on the way to reaching the semi-finals. The Dutch, meanwhile, were beaten by West Germany in the last 16.\n\nEngland have failed to qualify for just one World Cup since the 1970s, and it was the Netherlands who denied them a place at USA 94.\n\nGraham Taylor's England had a poor campaign, taking just one point from two games against Norway, who topped the group. They squandered a two-goal lead at home to the Dutch at Wembley, but when they went to Rotterdam for the return fixture -- their penultimate game in the group -- England still had qualification in their own hands as they were above the Dutch.\n\nWith Paul Gascoigne suspended, England fell behind to a free-kick just after the hour mark by Koeman -- who the visitors felt should have been sent off earlier on -- before Dennis Bergkamp sealed a 2-0 Dutch win.\n\nEngland beat San Marino in their final game but a Dutch win in Poland ensured they qualified instead. It was a disastrous campaign for Taylor, captured in a warts-and-all TV documentary. Taylor later resigned, while the Dutch reached the World Cup quarter-finals.\n\nThe nations met again in the group stage at Euro 96. Both teams had taken four points from their first two matches before clashing at Wembley, where Alan Shearer opened the scoring with a penalty and added another goal early in the second half, in between a brace by Teddy Sheringham.\n\nPatrick Kluivert's late goal for the Dutch made the final score 4-1 as England -- who had current boss Gareth Southgate in defence -- won the group and the Netherlands squeezed through in second place ahead of Scotland.\n\nThe Dutch lost on penalties to France in the last eight, while England were beaten in a shoot-out in the semi-finals by Germany, with Southgate missing the crucial kick.\n\nThe only competitive meeting of the teams since Euro 96 came in the semi-finals of the inaugural UEFA Nations League in 2019.\n\nSouthgate was already England's manager and Koeman was in his first spell as Dutch coach as the teams clashed in Guimaraes, Portugal.\n\nMarcus Rashford put England ahead from a penalty but Matthijs de Ligt levelled, taking the game to extra time.\n\nKyle Walker's own goal gave the Dutch the lead and Quincy Promes sealed a 3-1 victory for the Netherlands, who would lose the final to hosts Portugal.", "source": {"uri":

Southgate was pelted with beer cups after a 0-0 draw against Slovenia in the group stages and has faced a backlash for his perceived negative tactics with a richly-talented squad.\n\n\"I can't deny then when things get as personal as it has that does hurt. I don't think it's normal to have beer thrown at you,\" said Southgate of his detractors.\n\n\"But we're in a third semi-final in four tournaments, and I think we continue to give people fantastic memories. So we'll keep grinding, we'll keep fighting, and we'll keep enjoying this journey.\"\n\n- Premier League stars collide -\n\nA change of formation for the 1-1 draw against Switzerland did result in a marginally improved display from the dramatic win over a Slovakia side ranked 45th in the world.\n\nYet, the Dutch can count themselves even more fortunate for their path to the final after finishing third in Group D behind France and Austria.\n\nRonald Koeman's men produced their best display of the tournament in sweeping aside Romania 3-0 in the last 16 before battling back from a goal down to beat Turkey 2-1 in front of a hostile crowd in Berlin.\n\nComing up against a raft of Premier League stars will hold little fear for the Netherlands, who boast their own impressive crop of talent plying their trade in England's top flight.\n\n\"If you see the quality of players from both teams, you can expect the rhythm and level of the game will be really high,\" said Tottenham defender Micky van de Ven.\n\nLiverpool's Cody Gakpo has arguably been the form attacker at the tournament and is the only player to have scored three goals still alive in the competition.\n\nThe Dutch have had to wait 36 years since their own sole major tournament triumph, the last time the Euros were held in Germany.\n\nThat is also the only time they have ever made a European Championship final.\n\nBut they will fancy their chances of being in Berlin on Sunday unless England suddenly click into gear.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [],

AFP\n\nSouthgate's men are aiming to reach the final of a major tournament on foreign soil for the first time and take a step closer to ending a 58-year wait to win a major tournament.\n\nThe winners will face Spain in Berlin on Sunday after they came from behind to beat France 2-1 on Tuesday.\n\nEngland missed out in heartbreaking fashion in the final of Euro 2020, losing on penalties at Wembley to Italy.\n\nCaptain Harry Kane said reaching back-to-back finals would be an \"amazing achievement\" as he aims to win a first major trophy of his career.\n\nBut Kane has been singled out for criticism back home for his sluggish displays in Germany, where he now plays his club football for Bayern Munich.\n\nThe 30-year-old has scored two of England's five goals at the tournament but has looked physically restricted after missing the end of the club season with a back injury.\n\nKane's lacklustre performances have been symptomatic of England's struggles as a team.\n\nTwice they have stared down a humiliating early exit only to fight back against Slovakia and Switzerland thanks to individual moments of magic from Jude Bellingham and Bukayo Saka.\n\nEngland arrived in Germany as one of the favourites thanks to a richly-talented squad and an upturn in their fortunes under Southgate.\n\nAnd he believes his players struggled to cope with that expectation early in the tournament.\n\n\"One of our strengths over the last eight years has been less fear, less inhibition but at the beginning the expectation weighed heavily,\" said Southgate at his pre-match press conference on Tuesday.\n\n\"Now we are into that moment in the tournament where it is what is possible? What is achievable? Rather than, what could go wrong?\n\n\"That is different for a player. This is now the chance to make history, first time to make a final not held in England.\"\n\nThe selection of referee Felix Zwayer has raised eyebrows after Bellingham was fined during his time at Borussia Dortmund for bringing up a historic charge of match fixing against the German.\n\nZwayer was handed a six-month ban in 2006 after he was investigated for taking a bribe from another official.\n\nBellingham was fined 40,000 euros ($43,000) for his outburst after Bayern Munich beat Dortmund in December 2021.\n\nThe Netherlands also had their troubles in the group stages as a 3-2 defeat to Austria saw them sneak through as one of the best third-placed sides.\n\nRonald Koeman's men have since found their groove in a 3-0 win over Romania in the last 16 before battling back to beat Turkey 2-1 in the last eight.\n\nThe Dutch boast one of the form attacking players in the tournament in Cody Gakpo, who is looking to move out in front in the race for the Golden Boot by adding to his three goals so far.\n\nThey have had to wait 36 years since their own sole major tournament triumph -- which came the last time the Euros were held in Germany.\n\nBut their preparations for the game were disrupted by issues with the German train system, which has caused chaos for fans throughout the tournament.\n\nThe Netherlands had planned to go from their base in Wolfsburg by rail to Dortmund.\n\nHowever, a blockage on the line meant a last-minute change of plans as they instead had to fly and missed their pre-match media duties as a result.\n\n\"We don't play until 9 pm (1900GMT) tomorrow. I'm sure they will still get dinner when they arrive,\" added Southgate.\n\n\"They've got plenty of time.

They are doing so well.\"\n\nSouthgate pointed to England's opponents using defensive formations and also blamed the grass in Germany for hampering his players. \"We're not able to score a load of goals at the moment, but we've played three teams that play a back five, well-organised defences,\" he continued.\n\n\"Pitches are a little bit bobbly so sometimes you need the extra touch and then the space is gone. None of this is easy, but we're in a third semi-final in four tournaments.\" After reaching the 2018 World Cup semi-finals and being beaten in the Euro 2020 final on penalties by Italy, England began this tournament as one of the two favourites along with France.\n\nLes Bleus have also played in a rather tedious, yet adequate, fashion to reach the other semi-final, facing Spain. Southgate noted even La Roja, who by contrast have dazzled this summer in Germany, modified their style to be more direct as they beat the hosts in the quarter-finals.\n\n\"It's not just about playing well -- Spain mixed their game up, they took seven yellow cards, they found ways to win,\" said the coach. They now face a Dutch team whose five games have produced nearly double the number of goals as in England's, despite playing 60 minutes less.\n\nIn Liverpool's Cody Gakpo and Burnley target man Wout Weghorst, Ronald Koeman's side have a variety of different tools to create havoc at the other end, leading to hope of a more entertaining, higher-calibre clash. One bone of contention England fans have had with Southgate is his reluctance to make changes.\n\nCole Palmer, arguably the player of the season in England, has not started a game in Germany, while Ollie Watkins would offer the ability to run in behind that Kane can no longer muster. Anthony Gordon, who would add dynamism on the left, has gone virtually ignored. Despite some decisive moments Jude Bellingham has looked jaded after his exploits with Real Madrid and Phil Foden is operating at a far lower level than with Manchester City.", "source": {"uri":

Enough of the criticism. Enough of the rudeness and, as Gareth Southgate himself puts it, the \"ridicule\". Not that it ever should have been like this in the first place.\n\nWhen England return from Germany, when their involvement in the European Championship is over - either as losing semi-finalists, losing finalists or winners - there should be some soul-searching over the levels of anger that have been generated. Even by Southgate himself.\n\nEngland are in the last four, again, of a major finals. The penalty shoot-out victory over Switzerland, the moment of sweet redemption for Bukayo Saka, Southgate dancing on the pitch is up there with the greatest episodes in England's tournament history.\n\nLike the shoot-out win against Colombia at the 2018 World Cup, like the last-16 triumph over Germany at the last Euros, and the run to the final, it is a big moment, an uplifting moment, a galvanising moment that Southgate has helped deliver.\n\nNow it also must be when the nation unites behind Southgate once more in what could be an epic week for England. Although quite why they were not already united is unfathomable.\n\nYes, the football has largely been unconvincing. Yes, there have been questions over tactics and approach. But this should have been the backdrop. Not the noise that has angrily threatened to drown England's campaign and so upset Southgate.\n\nIt comes with the territory, to a degree, as England manager. But the personal nature of the attacks - being called \"inept\", even if it was archly framed as a question, by Gary Lineker - and the physical nature also with beer cups being thrown in Cologne despite having won the group is unacceptable and unfair.\n\nSouthgate does not deserve these personal comment, even if they has always appeared too close to the surface when his competence to do the job is discussed.\n\nIt was during the summer camp in 2022 before the last World Cup, that Southgate, again, stated, unprompted that \"I won't outstay my welcome\" which took aback those who were talking to him. No-one had even asked Southgate about his future and it led to questions about why he felt the need to raise it. \"But that's how I have always felt about it,\" Southgate said. A few days later he was booed off at Molineux after a 4-0 Nations League defeat by Hungary.\n\nWhile Southgate has never been under any illusions about the England job - he was in the team when Terry Venables was effectively forced out and was there, also, when Kevin Keegan dramatically quit - it was still a surprise.\n\n\"I accept that is what all my predecessors have had so why would it be any different for me?\" Southgate asked. Except now he is saying it is unacceptable and rightly so. He is not a punchbag for others and he deserves more respect. Even after the shoot-out win over a tough Swiss side there was that undercurrent that England were achieving despite, not because of, the manager.\n\nSo, what now? England face the Netherlands in Dortmund on Wednesday in the semi-finals and for those complaining that they have had an easy passage to this stage of the tournament then here is a football heavyweight to defeat.\n\nIf England succeed they will head to Berlin for Sunday's final against either Spain or France. Two more big beasts. That route to winning the Euros is tough. It always is tough.\n\nIf England lose then the fear of failure has gone. Failure was not failing to win the Euros - that was always a ridiculously high bar to set.\n\nInstead failure was not getting through the group - such as losing all three games, as they did the last time the competition was held in Germany, in 1988. With Lineker up front (he did not score) England lost to the Republic of Ireland, the Dutch and the USSR.\n\nFailure would have been to go out to Slovakia in the last-16 or the Swiss in the quarter-finals. That did not happen. Now England are left with the big boys. They have made the cut and hopefully that will be liberating. Not for the players but for the fans and the public and the pundits. Maybe they can now sit back and actually begin to enjoy the tournament a bit more.\n\nSo go out and win it.\n\nEngland have not played well. It keeps being said and needs to be said. We know that. They have often looked like a team of 'moments' - such as both of Jude Bellingham's goals and Saka's super strike - but also a team that has deep reserves of resilience.\n\nThey have come from behind in both their knock-out ties - prior to Southgate they would have frozen as they did against Iceland - and they have confidently won a penalty shoot-out.\n\nIn fact England have only ever won four shoot-outs - from 12. And Southgate has won three of them as manager and was on the pitch for the fourth as a player (against Spain at Euro 96).\n\nSouthgate will probably go, come what may, after the Euros. His demeanour, his behaviour and what he is saying all suggest that the decision is made. Even if England win their first trophy since 1966 it looks like he will leave because he has been made to feel like he has outstayed his welcome. Maybe after eight years it is even time for a change.\n\nWhatever happens with Southgate's future England need to enjoy the present. There is a need to get behind him and the team. As Saka says there are (hopefully) \"two more games until we can change our lives and make some history\". Right now that is all that matters.", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jason_burt@aol.co.uk", "name": "Jason Burt", "type": "author",

Next up? Netherlands", "body": "{{ #verifyErrors }}{{ message }}{{ /verifyErrors }}{{ ^verifyErrors }}Something went wrong. Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nAs the magnitude of fixture becomes greater, England's preparation actually becomes less intense. The squad have done most of the actual work already. A bit like with their successful approach to penalties, there can be a danger of over-preparation. Gareth Southgate is instead intent on doing most of the preparation in meetings, ensuring the team are conscious of the different challenges posed by a competent Netherlands side.\n\nThis is the benefit that comes with experience, and Southgate now has more semi-final experience than any other England manager in history. As he prepares for his third in a major tournament, it is one reason this occasion feels less momentous, albeit no less invigorating. The team just have bigger ambitions now.\n\n\"The great thing is we're not sitting here happy with a semi-final,\" Southgate said. \"We want to go further...\"\n\nThat is one fact amid all of these different emotions that shouldn't be forgotten. England are still just a match from one of the greatest stages in the game, as well as a chance to rectify Euro 2020.\n\nThis is what the country long desired. Southgate even made a point of reminding people of that on the eve of the game, as he compared the Dutch tournament record to England's. While this is the national team's seventh semi-final, it is the Netherlands' 10th.\n\n\"Our semi-final tally looks a bit healthy now, looks a bit more like what we'd hope an England history would look like,\" Southgate said. \"But there are a lot of nations who have won the European Championship and we haven't, and we want to try and correct that balance.\"\n\nSouthgate stressed that his England have constantly managed to \"break new ground\": winning big games away, winning shootouts, and of course getting this far regularly. \"We've never been to a final outside our own shores. These are opportunities to make a difference and that's how we have to look at it. We don't want to be burdened by what's happened before.\"\n\nIf we're looking to the past, the last meeting between these two teams in a major championship weighs over this, and not just for how past results inform the psychology of a game. There were also the specifics of what happened, and how they relate to now. That match was in June 1996, when England had managed to come through a highly-anticipated European Championship with some moments of individual inspiration, but also so much inertia. They then stepped out against Netherlands, and put in one of the great tournament displays.\n\nThe late Terry Venables described that famous 4-1 win as \"perfection\" and his \"most thrilling experience in football\", which was all the more satisfying for how it represented \"the culmination of two-and-a-half years of preparation\".\n\nSouthgate's work goes back much further, to seven years. This tournament had been seen as potentially his moment of delivery, when it could all come together. It could still be, but it's difficult not to feel that depends on the performance level finally rising - to a convincing display, a spectacle.\n\nThe identity of the opposition and the resonance of the fixture only adds to that, especially with how the \"grind\" of England's progress through Euro 2024 - to use Southgate's own word - has strengthened resolve. There is hope that it can gradually bring the team to the point where the actual collective finally reflects the players' great ability.\n\nEngland's games have instead been absorbing for entirely different reasons. They have been psychodramas rather than spectacles, as if the players had to confront internal and external challenges more than they had to deal with the opposition.\n\nMaybe, as in 1996, the will to come through so much might suddenly bring the explosion everyone wants. Or, it might just see more of the same.\n\nIssues remain. The elimination of Switzerland only emphasised some of them, not least the lack of fluency. It was why Southgate felt the need to actually talk about it with the players. It almost represented a form of team therapy.\n\n\"When you can sense that feeling, you need to confront it. It's no use avoiding it and hoping it will go away. In the end, we sort of had to grind it out on the pitch.\"\n\nThat's where they are now, carrying what Harry Kane describes as an \"aura\" if not yet momentum in terms of performance. It might still be presumptuous to talk of putting in a performance rather than just putting themselves in the final. This isn't as good a Dutch side as some of the predecessors that Southgate spoke about, but they have their own resilience.\n\nThey also have a team that works, so far amplifying the team's abilities. There is no better illustration of this than top scorer Cody Gakpo, and it is all underpinned by a defender as good as Virgil van Dijk. Manager Ronald Koeman may not have his usual midfield, most notably missing the injured Frenkie de Jong, but Euro 2024 has shown they have precisely the central players that can give England difficulties in terms of possession.\n\nThat might be all the more important since it is expected to be humid in Dortmund. It's partly why the England workload has been lighter, as Southgate is just trying to keep freshness. All 26 players are available. Luke Shaw is now almost certain to come in on the left, although the main interest there will be how much England shift between a back three and a four. It was fluid against Switzerland, even if that partly meant the performance was not.\n\nThe actual line-up is expected to remain the same beyond the inclusion of Shaw, and the return of the previously suspended Marc Guehi for Ezri Konsa. For all the talk that Ivan Toney may come in, Kane says he feels like he is \"getting better and sharper\".\n\nAs has become apparent through England's campaign, however, how they start may not be important if they finish in the right way. Substitutes have become so important. They may now become essential, especially with the way England have been through two extra-time periods and the Dutch none.\n\n\"There's so much science involved in recovering players,\" Southgate said, \"but things will happen over the next five to six days for all of the teams involved, where people might start games and get an early injury because you're not able to train as fully as you might.\"\n\nThe manager does believe England are showing a \"truer reflection\" of themselves, as Kane insists they can still \"reach their full potential\". That may end up crucial but, right now, all that matters is reaching the final.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southgate,_London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southgate, London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southgate, London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Venables", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terry Venables"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Gu\u00e9hi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marc Gu\u00e9hi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cody_Gakpo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cody Gakpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Toney", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ivan Toney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frenkie_de_Jong", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frenkie de Jong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezri_Konsa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ezri Konsa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil_van_Dijk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virgil van Dijk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Shaw", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luke Shaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Koeman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Koeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/09/19/newFile-2.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712618", "eventUri": "eng-9712618", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "1996-06-", "textStart": 2364, "textEnd": 2373}], "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

Drop Phil Foden? What about Harry Kane?", "body": "Gareth Southgate changed formation for the quarter-final against Switzerland but England still needed a penalty shoot-out to progress to Wednesday's semi-final with the Netherlands. There are issues to resolve if glory is to be had at Euro 2024...\n\nLuke Shaw to return? What to do with Phil Foden? How to get the best from Harry Kane? Gareth Southgate has decisions to make ahead of England's semi-final at Euro 2024.\n\nWe pick out just some of the talking points to emerge from England's quarter-final against Switzerland...\n\nThe first matter for the England manager to consider is whether to restore Marc Guehi to the team after serving his suspension in the round-of-16 tie against Switzerland. Ezri Konsa did well as his replacement on the left side of defence with an assured display.\n\nBut Guehi had been among England's most encouraging performers throughout the first four matches, showing a composure that belied his international inexperience. Southgate was fulsome in his praise. His selection was a notable success.\n\nIf there is a complication that causes Southgate to hesitate in restoring him without thought, it is that Guehi's appearances came as part of a back four. Konsa, a some-time full-back, might be the more comfortable in a back three. Shaw, having now made his return from injury, certainly would be. What will Southgate decide?\n\nWhen Southgate switched to a back three to beat Germany at the previous European Championship, he reverted to a back four for the subsequent win over Ukraine. This particular change of formation feels like it could be more permanent.\n\nEngland had been so poor for much of their first four matches at Euro 2024 that it felt as if the players needed a change to help them believe. Was a penalty shoot-out victory over Switzerland enough to convince Southgate to stick with it against the Netherlands?\n\nThere was a little more balance, Bukayo Saka thriving in a wing-back role and Kyle Walker seemingly much happier on the right of a three. There is still the option to switch within the game but England will be more confident now that they have options.\n\nThe change of system saw Kieran Trippier operating even higher on the left, arguably further out of position than before. It is the most obvious weakness on paper, even if the Newcastle player did his best in the role. But there are contenders to take his place.\n\nShaw made his comeback late in the game against Switzerland and his availability provides England with a natural left-footer on that flank, potentially opening up more opportunities to create. He would be Southgate's first choice if fully fit but it is a big ask.\n\nIt was Eberechi Eze deployed there as England sought to chase the game upon falling behind, an unusual position for the Crystal Palace playmaker. Whether Southgate would consider such a maverick move from the start is another matter entirely.\n\nThere would be more confidence in Saka impressing there, which would have the benefit of freeing up the slot on the right for Trent Alexander-Arnold or Trippier himself. But Saka's display against Switzerland is a compelling case to keep him in position.\n\nRegardless of the formation, Foden certainly has challengers for his position in the side. The Premier League player of the year was shunted out to the left for much of this tournament but that changed against Switzerland. Sadly, his form for England did not.\n\nFoden should be capable of moments of quality but there have not been enough of them in these five matches. No goals. No assists. Just two shots on target. Surprisingly, he has struggled to find a way to function outside of the Manchester City machine.\n\nSouthgate is committed to keeping his best players in the starting line-up and with both knockout games so far going the distance, perhaps that makes sense. Cole Palmer was on the pitch for the penalty shoot-out, after all. But he will be wanting a bigger role.\n\nIf Foden is expected to retain his place, Kane is certain to stay in the team. But that does not mean that Southgate can settle for what we are seeing from the England captain. He has scored two important goals but this is not the Kane that we are used to.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, Kane is averaging more touches per 90 minutes at Euro 2024 than he has at previous tournaments for England. But being involved and being impactful are different things. He has struggled for space in this side and without wide forwards willing to run beyond him, Kane cannot showcase his range of passing.\n\nHis fitness is a concern and the tests only become more difficult with Virgil van Dijk awaiting Kane in Dortmund on Wednesday. How can Southgate improve the service to his striker? Inverted wing-backs do not aid the quality of crosses. England may look to limp on but unlocking Kane's full game could be the difference.", "source": {"uri": "skysports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SkySports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Gu\u00e9hi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marc Gu\u00e9hi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Shaw", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Luke Shaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezri_Konsa", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ezri Konsa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eberechi_Eze", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eberechi Eze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kieran_Trippier", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kieran Trippier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_upon_Tyne", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Newcastle upon Tyne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Palmer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cole Palmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil_van_Dijk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virgil van Dijk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Palace_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crystal Palace F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Alexander-Arnold", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trent Alexander-Arnold"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://e0.365dm.com/24/07/1600x900/skysports-harry-kane-gareth-southgate_6620360.jpg?20240707121148", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712618", "eventUri": "eng-9712618", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

So it's about dealing with all that.\n\n\"I think over the years since Gareth has been here and since I've been captain, we've handled that really well and I think this tournament has been no different.\n\n\"Some players will block it out and ultimately it's just down to what we want to achieve and we have a really close togetherness, not just players but staff as well and we've all been in the same direction for a while now and that's all we are thinking about.\"\n\nKane is expected to lead the line against the Netherlands despite seeing his individual performance versus Switzerland in the quarter-finals highlighted as a concern.\n\nThe Bayern Munich striker was substituted during extra-time before England secured their semi-final berth with a shoot-out win - although Southgate explained their all-time leading goalscorer was suffering from \"cramp\" at the time.\n\nSouthgate has guided England to three semi-finals in his four tournaments in charge and now has a squad that boasts a wealth of knowledge of performing in knockout football.\n\n\"I think you just use the past experiences to help you, we've got a lot of players who have experienced big games on an international level and also big games at club level,\" he added.\n\n\"So you try and use all that experience over the course of your career to prepare you in the best way possible and to control the nerves and control the excitement.\n\n\"We prepared for tomorrow like we prepare for any other game and I just think during the game you lean on experiences, you lean on the leaders in the team who have been there and done that to maybe help some of the players who haven't, but ultimately it's about going out there and taking the opportunity with both hands.\n\n\"We've got ourselves in a great spot and we've got a big game tomorrow to reach back-to-back finals in the European Championship and that would be an amazing achievement and we have the opportunity to go and do that.\"", "source": {"uri": "guernseypress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Guernsey Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.guernseypress.com/resizer/ZK7cL6dRnQ9fJoRMthOhXNpXzNI=/1200x900/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/mna/3IPQFG5YLRHQDHOAFDJ5FH5Z4E.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712618", "eventUri": "eng-9712618", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

Here is your full brief for England vs the Netherlands, including what TV channel the game will be shown on and the Three Lions' predicted line-up:\n\nEngland vs the Netherlands kicks off at 8pm on Wednesday 10 July at the Westfalenstadion, the home of Borussia Dortmund.\n\nThe two sides will know who awaits in the final, with the other semi-final of Spain vs France taking place the previous night in Munich.\n\nITV 1 will have live coverage of the match with their programme beginning at 6:30pm. The game will also be available to stream live on ITVX.\n\nFans will be praying that the infamous 'ITV curse' doesn't rear it's ugly head again...\n\nThankfully for Gareth Southgate, he'll have all 26 members of his squad fit and available for selection for the semi-final.\n\nAfter serving his one-match suspension, Marc Guehi is back and will likely retake his place in the starting XI despite the heroics of Ezri Konsa who replaced him in defence.\n\nThe gamble to bring Luke Shaw to the tournament as he recovered from a lengthy injury finally paid off in the quarter-finals as he came off the bench to good effect after the Swiss had opened the scoring.\n\nIt may be too soon to start the left-back and drop Kieran Trippier but at least the 'super-sub' option is now available to Southgate.\n\nThere were concerns that Harry Kane may be injured after awkwardly stumbling off the pitch and colliding with his manager, but the under-fire captain claims he just has cramp and will be 'fine'.\n\nSouthgate has been very reluctant to chop and change his players, so the real question is will he stick with new 3-4-3 formation? The tactics were changed to match up against the Swiss but after it delivered England's best performance of the tournament, does Southgate dare revert back to the 4-2-3-1?\n\nThat's the formation the Netherlands use and, like Southgate, Koeman has no injury or suspension worries for Wednesday night.\n\nIf the history books are anything to go by, England are in for a tough time having won just six of their 22 meetings with the Netherlands, drawing nine and losing seven.\n\nMore worryingly, only one of those six wins has come in the 21st century - a friendly in March 2018 where Jesse Lingard scored the only goal of the game.\n\nTheir most recent meeting was in the semi-finals of the 2019 Nations League, which the Dutch won 3-1 after extra time despite Marcus Rashford giving England an early lead.\n\nIn fact the Three Lions' only competitive win against the Netherlands came in the group stage of Euro 1996, with braces from Alan Shearer and Teddy Sheringham securing a memorable 4-1 win at Wembley.", "source": {"uri": "metro.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Metro"}, "authors": [{"uri": "callum_mcavoy@metro.co.uk", "name": "Callum McAvoy", "type": "author", "isAgency":

behind to beat Switzerland in a penalty shootout.\n\nIt's the third semi-final in four major tournaments for the Three Lions as they bid to end the long wait for another trophy.\n\nYet it's been far from plain sailing for Southgate's side in this tournament, with a series of dour performances causing frustration among fans and leading to some unsavoury scenes as drinks cups were thrown at the England manager after a goalless draw with Denmark.\n\nAfter overcoming an organised Swiss side that were many people's dark horses for the tournament, England now face arguably their toughest test yet against the Netherlands.\n\nRonald Koeman's Oranje have faced similar criticism to England due to some stuttering displays in the group stage but have since hit form in the knockouts, comfortably beating Romania before seeing off Turkey in the quarter-final.\n\nWith a defence containing the likes of Virgil van Dijk and Nathan Ake and a forward line with Cody Gakpo, who has arguably been one of the best players of Euro 2024 so far, the Netherlands will pose England a lot of threat, and the Three Lions will have to be at their best if they want to make it through to the final.\n\nAs such, England will need all the support they can get heading into the game, both from the fans who have made the trip to Germany and also those watching on from home.\n\nYou can now show your support for the Three Lions ahead of Wednesday's huge game by leaving a message in our cheer map above.\n\nFill out your details and send your message to roar England on!\n\nClick here if the map is not loading

We couldn't quite get ourselves in the right place.\n\n\"Now it's about what is possible and not what might go wrong. This is now the chance to make history. We are trying to break new ground and that is not easy but the players have been resilient.\"\n\nThe manager has had praise for his work too, as former England striker Chris Sutton told BBC 5 Live Sport after they reached the last four: \"Gareth Southgate has proved a hell of a lot of people wrong at this tournament. I'm delighted for him. Gareth talked about beer being thrown at him in certain games and what have you... that is not the way to treat an England manager.\n\n\"You think about his record as England manager. Out of the last four tournaments, three semi-finals and a quarter-final, with a final in there as well. You have people saying he's not an inventive manager and he's a poor manager, he's done it again. Gareth South-great.\"\n\nEngland face an old adversary in Netherlands coach Ronald Koeman, who played in their 3-1 win over Sir Bobby Robson's side in the 1988 European Championship in Dusseldorf, but was also an infamous figure for his part in a World Cup qualifier between the sides in October 1993.\n\nKoeman dragged David Platt back when he was clean through with the scoreline goalless, escaped with only a yellow card, then scored a free-kick five minutes later as England - needing just a point to qualify for the 1994 finals - went down to a damaging 2-0 defeat. He had finished his international career before England's stunning 4-1 Wembley win at Euro '96.\n\nIn his second spell in charge, Koeman has led the Netherlands into the semi-final and looking increasingly confident and dangerous, having recovered from a 3-2 loss to Austria in the group stage. They will present a stern examination.\n\nBut England and Southgate find themselves two games from history.\n\nAnd the history books would simply record England's achievement - not how they played to write that new chapter.\n\nIt will either end with Euro 2024 glory or another bitter disappointment of Southgate and his team falling short once more.

What is achievable? Rather than, what could go wrong?\n\n\"That is different for a player. This is now the chance to make history, first time to make a final not held in England.\"\n\nThe selection of referee Felix Zwayer has raised eyebrows after Bellingham was fined during his time at Borussia Dortmund for bringing up a historic charge of match fixing against the German.\n\nZwayer was handed a six-month ban in 2006 after he was investigated for taking a bribe from another official.\n\nBellingham was fined 40,000 euros ($43,000) for his outburst after Bayern Munich beat Dortmund in December 2021.\n\nDutch face travel chaos\n\nThe Netherlands also had their troubles in the group stages as a 3-2 defeat to Austria saw them sneak through as one of the best third-placed sides.\n\nRonald Koeman's men have since found their groove in a 3-0 win over Romania in the last 16 before battling back to beat T\u00fcrkiye 2-1 in the last eight.\n\nThe Dutch boast one of the form attacking players in the tournament in Cody Gakpo, who is looking to move out in front in the race for the Golden Boot by adding to his three goals so far.\n\nThey have had to wait 36 years since their own sole major tournament triumph -- which came the last time the Euros were held in Germany.\n\nBut their preparations for the game were disrupted by issues with the German train system, which has caused chaos for fans throughout the tournament.\n\nThe Netherlands had planned to go from their base in Wolfsburg by rail to Dortmund.\n\nHowever, a blockage on the line meant a last-minute change of plans as they instead had to fly and missed their pre-match media duties as a result.\n\n\"We don't play until 9 pm (1900GMT) tomorrow. I'm sure they will still get dinner when they arrive,\" added Southgate.\n\n\"They've got plenty of time.

This is expected to be the manager's final tournament in charge of England and he has seemed worn down at various points over the past month.\n\nSouthgate was upset when plastic beer cups were chucked at him after the 0-0 draw with Slovenia during the group stage, and there have been acerbic comments from a series of high-profile pundits. Drowning out the noise has not been easy. Southgate, after saying it does not matter whether he gets more respect, opened up when asked whether he had become hardened to the sniping from the sidelines.\n\nRelated: 'It's my routine': Ivan Toney vows to stick with no-look penalty at Euros\n\n\"I can't deny that some of the personal nature, you know ... ,\" he said. \"This is a job where you get ridiculed, and your professional capability is questioned beyond belief, and I don't think it's normal to have beer thrown at you either.\n\n\"But I'm fortunate that my life's taken me through a lot of resilience-building and it's made me more determined and I'm just using it as fuel. I know where I want to take the team to. The team need to see me strong in those moments as well, otherwise that messaging that you're giving them on what they need to be, it doesn't ring true.\"\n\nEngland had gone 20 years without reaching a semi-final before Southgate took over in 2016. Since reaching the last four of the 2018 World Cup, they have lost to Italy on penalties in the Euro 2020 final and fallen to France in the quarter-finals of the 2022 World Cup.\n\nNow the Netherlands stand between them and a meeting with France or Spain in Sunday's final in Berlin. It would be Southgate's 102nd game in charge, and he is desperate to see Harry Kane, England's captain, lift the trophy.\n\n\"The difference is we arrive in a quarter-final, we're not satisfied with that, so there is definitely a mindset shift in what we feel is acceptable as a team,\" Southgate said. \"Within that it's knockout football. The margins are so fine. That can easily tip the other way and it's a different story but those teams that have won consistently, they have that mindset, they're not just satisfied with being in quarter-finals, they're pushing on and that's what we have to continue. This isn't where we want it to end.\"\n\nEngland's performances have underwhelmed but they have been strong during difficult moments and responded well to going 1-0 down to Switzerland in D\u00fcsseldorf. Bukayo Saka equalised moments after a triple substitution from Southgate and England were nerveless during the shootout, brilliantly dispatching all five of their penalties. Afterwards, though, Southgate faced more questions about a lack of entertainment from his side. He believes the resilience bodes well for the future.\n\n\"These guys, they've shown more than being able to just play,\" Southgate said. \"Navigating tournaments, you need lots of other qualities. It is that resilience, it is that ability to stay composed when you go behind in games, or when momentum's against you, [we've] won three penalty shootouts out of four. All those little bits build character, build belief.\n\n\"There's this tournament, but given the age of the squad and their experiences now, they'll have that belief for a long time. It should put England in a good place, but that's the future - we've got a good week ahead of us.\"\n\nEngland will have Marc Gu\u00e9hi back from suspension, giving Southgate a decision over whether to restore the centre-back in place of Ezri Konsa. Luke Shaw, the squad's only left-back, will also be in contention for a starting spot after coming off the bench against Switzerland and playing for the first time since sustaining a hamstring injury five months ago.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southgate,_London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southgate, London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southgate, London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Toney", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ivan Toney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Gu\u00e9hi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marc Gu\u00e9hi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezri_Konsa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ezri Konsa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamstring", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hamstring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Shaw", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luke Shaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D\u00fcsseldorf", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "D\u00fcsseldorf"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "D\u00fcsseldorf"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/3f6de74243280c15753fccaf453fd02b", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712618", "eventUri": "eng-9712618", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

What is achievable? Rather than, what could go wrong?\n\n\"That is different for a player. This is now the chance to make history, first time to make a final not held in England.\"\n\nThe selection of referee Felix Zwayer has raised eyebrows after Bellingham was fined during his time at Borussia Dortmund for bringing up a historic charge of match fixing against the German.\n\nZwayer was handed a six-month ban in 2006 after he was investigated for taking a bribe from another official.\n\nBellingham was fined 40,000 euros ($43,000) for his outburst after Bayern Munich beat Dortmund in December 2021.\n\nDutch face travel chaos\n\nThe Netherlands also had their troubles in the group stages as a 3-2 defeat to Austria saw them sneak through as one of the best third-placed sides.\n\nRonald Koeman's men have since found their groove in a 3-0 win over Romania in the last 16 before battling back to beat Turkey 2-1 in the last eight.\n\nThe Dutch boast one of the form attacking players in the tournament in Cody Gakpo, who is looking to move out in front in the race for the Golden Boot by adding to his three goals so far.\n\nThey have had to wait 36 years since their own sole major tournament triumph -- which came the last time the Euros were held in Germany.\n\nBut their preparations for the game were disrupted by issues with the German train system, which has caused chaos for fans throughout the tournament.\n\nThe Netherlands had planned to go from their base in Wolfsburg by rail to Dortmund.\n\nHowever, a blockage on the line meant a last-minute change of plans as they instead had to fly and missed their pre-match media duties as a result.\n\n\"We don't play until 9 pm (1900GMT) tomorrow. I'm sure they will still get dinner when they arrive,\" added Southgate.\n\n\"They've got plenty of time.

The game's not until nine o'clock tomorrow night.\"\n\nIn the first semi-final of the tournament on Tuesday, Spain and France are playing for the right to meet England or the Netherlands in the final in Berlin on Sunday.\n\n\"From a team point of view, we know what we need to achieve,\" said England captain Harry Kane, who answered questions alongside Southgate.\n\n\"We have a really important game, a really tough game which we need to be ready for.

One conundrum facing Southgate is the worrying form of captain Harry Kane.\n\nThe Bayern Munich striker looked laboured against the Swiss and was eventually taken off in extra time, despite being England's main penalty taker. Kane could be seen limping, before suffering the embarrassment of crashing through Southgate and landing in the dug-out, in his final act of the game.\n\nBut Southgate will not drop Kane, and reckons his contribution to the cause remains huge. He added: \"I thought he did a super job for the team.\n\n\"He is perhaps not flowing, as he is arriving in those deeper areas, but he is still playing an immense part for the group.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailystar.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeremy_cross@dailystar.co.uk", "name": "Jeremy Cross", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nike, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_kick_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty kick (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33185167.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_England-v-Switzerland-Quarter-Final-UEFA-EURO-2024.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712618", "eventUri": "eng-9712618", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

Reaching a final abroad is the next step for Southgate's squad after setting records and changing the mindset of players during his eight years in charge.\n\nHe insists his young squad have none of the scars from previous tournament failure and has seen a change during the tournament after playing with 'fear' in the first two matches of the group stage.\n\n\"We've risen well to those challenges over the years and used them as motivation to break new ground,\" Southgate said. \"We've never been to a final outside of our own shores, so these are opportunities to make a difference.\n\n\"That's how we have to look at it.

And his men seem well-positioned to answer the call, having gone into overdrive since a 2-1 loss to France in the 2022 World Cup quarter-finals.\n\nIt remains England's last upset in competitive action, with the beaten Euro 2020 finalists avoiding defeat in 13 consecutive contests (W9, D4), conceding one goal or fewer on each occasion.\n\nWhile Southgate can't complain about his team's defensive effort, there's ample room for improvement in the build-up play and, particularly, in front of goal.\n\nAll eyes turn to Ballon d'Or hopeful Bellingham. He scored the winning header against Serbia and extended England's title hopes with the 'goal of the tournament' contender against Slovakia.\n\nEngland's abysmal win rate of only 27% against the Netherlands paints a bleak picture for the Three Lions faithful amidst the team's dire form in Germany.\n\nLuck smiled on Southgate several times at Euro 2024, but another tame performance against the Dutch would probably result in England's exit from the tournament.\n\nKoeman's troops are in better shape, but if Southgate's star-studded line-up can find the chemistry in these crucial moments, there would be no hope for the Oranje.\n\nEngland's sheer attacking potential leads us to believe they'd snatch away a place in the final.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

Van Basten's opener for the Netherlands was cancelled out by a Bryan Robson equaliser just after half-time, but two goals in five second-half minutes allowed Van Basten to complete his hat-trick and sealed a 3-1 Dutch win.\n\nDraw at Italia 90\n\nThe nations were again drawn in the same group at the 1990 World Cup in Italy, and many of the players involved in 1988 again featured in this meeting in Cagliari, among them current Dutch boss Ronald Koeman.\n\nThe sides had each drawn their opening match, with England being held by Ireland and the Netherlands by Egypt. This time England kept Van Basten quiet in a 0-0 draw, and it was England who would top the group on the way to reaching the semi-finals. The Dutch, meanwhile, were beaten by West Germany in the last 16.\n\nEngland miss out on USA 94\n\nEngland have failed to qualify for just one World Cup since the 1970s, and it was the Netherlands who denied them a place at USA 94.\n\nGraham Taylor's England had a poor campaign, taking just one point from two games against Norway, who topped the group. They squandered a two-goal lead at home to the Dutch at Wembley, but when they went to Rotterdam for the return fixture -- their penultimate game in the group -- England still had qualification in their own hands as they were above the Dutch.\n\nWith Paul Gascoigne suspended, England fell behind to a free-kick just after the hour mark by Koeman -- who the visitors felt should have been sent off earlier on -- before Dennis Bergkamp sealed a 2-0 Dutch win.\n\nEngland beat San Marino in their final game but a Dutch win in Poland ensured they qualified instead. It was a disastrous campaign for Taylor, captured in a warts-and-all TV documentary. Taylor later resigned, while the Dutch reached the World Cup quarter-finals.\n\nShearer, Sheringham double act\n\nThe nations met again in the group stage at Euro 96. Both teams had taken four points from their first two matches before clashing at Wembley, where Alan Shearer opened the scoring with a penalty and added another goal early in the second half, in between a brace by Teddy Sheringham.\n\nPatrick Kluivert's late goal for the Dutch made the final score 4-1 as England -- who had current boss Gareth Southgate in defence -- won the group and the Netherlands squeezed through in second place ahead of Scotland.\n\nThe Dutch lost on penalties to France in the last eight, while England were beaten in a shoot-out in the semi-finals by Germany, with Southgate missing the crucial kick.\n\nDutch win Nations League semi\n\nThe only competitive meeting of the teams since Euro 96 came in the semi-finals of the inaugural UEFA Nations League in 2019.\n\nSouthgate was already England's manager and Koeman was in his first spell as Dutch coach as the teams clashed in Guimaraes, Portugal.\n\nMarcus Rashford put England ahead from a penalty but Matthijs de Ligt levelled, taking the game to extra time.\n\nKyle Walker's own goal gave the Dutch the lead and Quincy Promes sealed a 3-1 victory for the Netherlands, who would lose the final to hosts Portugal.", "source": {"uri": "france24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "France 24"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_van_Basten", "type": "person",

Sutton's semi-final predictions", "body": "The finishing line is in sight, but which of the four teams left in Euro 2024 will make it to the final in Berlin on 14 July?\n\nLike England's penalty takers against Switzerland, BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton did not put a foot wrong with his predictions for the quarter-finals, getting all four results correct.\n\nThe majority of you were spot on each time too - although, out of more than 160,000 votes, only 57% of you thought England would beat the Swiss, the lowest proportion of the teams you correctly backed.\n\nStill, that means like Sutton you have a success rate of 54% overall, after getting a total of 26 predictions right from the 48 games played in Germany so far.\n\nCan you get the better of him in the semi-finals? You can make your predictions below for France - Sutton's pre-tournament pick to win the European Championship - versus Spain and England against the Netherlands.\n\nMunich, 20:00 BST\n\nI'm in a bit of a pickle here, because before a ball was kicked I went for France to win Euro 2024.\n\nPlus, I am at Allianz Arena for Radio 5 Live, so I cannot close my curtains and pretend Didier Deschamps' side are not playing.\n\nDidier is an old friend of mine because we joined Chelsea at the same time in 1999 and stayed in the same hotel. We used to play cards together, as a pair, and he was always quite cautious then... but nothing compared to how he has got his team playing now.\n\nWhen I think of the France football team, I think of flair and flamboyance, starting with Michel Platini's side that won the 1984 European Championship. Their sides that have won major honours in the years since then have been the same.\n\nThis version of Les Bleus, though, has been utter dross to watch.\n\nDefensively, they have been excellent. As a centre-half pairing, William Saliba and Dayot Upamecano have been absolutely outstanding and Mike Maignan has been superb in goal too.\n\nAttack-wise though, I was just shocked by their level of performance against Portugal. Ousmane Dembele came on and made a difference, but Kylian Mbappe has not got going at all.\n\nIn contrast, Spain have been the team of the tournament. Their quarter-final win over Germany took a little while to get going, but it was brilliant once it did.\n\nSpain are doing it a very different way to France, and England too, and they have been very impressive in everything they have done - other than maybe not being ruthless enough at times.\n\nTheir manager Luis de la Fuente will have to make changes for this game, because Robin le Normand and Dani Carvajal are both suspended, while Pedri will miss the rest of the tournament with a knee injury.\n\nIf I was being logical about this, I would still say Spain will win - Lamine Yamal is so exciting, Nico Williams has arguably been the player of the tournament, and Rodri and Fabian Ruiz run things in the middle of the pitch - but I just have a feeling that France will get through.\n\nOf course Mbappe could play like the superstar he is, or Dembele could cause Marc Cucurella problems if he starts... but it is more likely that France will just smother Spain and, even if they do not play well, get the job done.\n\nWout Weghorst's physicality made the difference for the Dutch against Turkey after he came on at half-time when they were 1-0 down.\n\nEngland manager Gareth Southgate has been accused of not being decisive enough with his substitutions, but Ronald Koeman got it right for the Netherlands there.\n\nRather than trying to be intricate and playing through Turkey, they got the ball wide, crossed it in and Weghorst was a massive threat.\n\nI do not necessarily think he will start against England, but they will have him as an option on the bench if they need him.\n\nIt is not just Weghorst that England have to watch out for though, because Cody Gakpo will be dangerous too.\n\nGakpo probably has not delivered the form we expected from him for Liverpool, but he has had his moments. For the Netherlands, though, he has been their best player at this tournament.\n\nThere is the possibility that, like England against Switzerland, the Netherlands will move to playing with three at the back for this game. Koeman often does that when he faces stronger teams.\n\nIf the teams do match up with the same formation, I think England have a better midfield than the Dutch duo of Jerdy Schouten and Tijjani Reijnders.\n\nThe problem is that, in an attacking capacity, England just have not turned up yet.\n\nThey have relied on some big moments so far, but the equalisers Jude Bellingham and Bukayo Saka scored against Slovakia and Switzerland were both with their team's first shot on target of the game.\n\nSo, how do you call this? I don't think anything is going to drastically change in the way England play - they are not going to suddenly find some amazing patterns of play that break the Netherlands down.\n\nInstead, if England are going to reach their second successive Euros final, they are going to have to rely on individual brilliance again.\n\nI have not just been blindly backing them to get through each knockout round in Germany but they are definitely on the more gentle side of the draw.\n\nThis is their toughest game yet, and it is going to be very close, but I do think England will edge it... somehow.",

The Dutch famously won 3-1 en route to Euro '88 glory thanks to Marco van Basten's hat trick.\n\nA forgettable goalless draw followed at the 1990 World Cup before England's memorable 4-1 victory in 1996.\n\nDespite their attacking prowess, England faces a challenge against the Netherlands, having won just one of their last nine encounters across all competitions.\n\nIn their most recent encounter, a semifinal, the Netherlands beat England 3-1 after extra time in the UEFA Nations League.\n\nBoth Gareth Southgate and Ronald Koeman were at the helm during that memorable clash.\n\nLast weekend, Koeman guided his team to their first Euro semifinal since 2004 by overcoming a resilient T\u00fcrkiye at Berlin's Olympiastadion.\n\nSimilar to England, the Dutch had to mount a comeback to secure their spot in the final four.\n\nTrailing by a goal and seemingly on the brink of elimination, Stefan de Vrij equalized for the Dutch in the 70th minute before Cody Gakpo's pressure led to an own goal from Mert M\u00fcld\u00fcr shortly after.\n\nThe Netherlands, seeking their second European title since their triumph 36 summers ago in Germany, have navigated through what's considered the \"weaker\" half of the draw, having finished third in Group D.\n\nAfter defeating Poland, drawing with France, and experiencing a dramatic loss to Austria, the Oranje faced a relatively favorable last-16 match against Romania, which they comfortably won 3-0.\n\nLed by captain Virgil van Dijk, the Dutch squad aims to secure just their second European Championship semifinal victory.\n\nHowever, their recent record of four losses in the last five semifinals adds weight to the historical challenge they face.\n\nLuke Shaw's return to Gareth Southgate's squad as the sole specialist left-back has been eagerly anticipated. The Manchester United defender, who missed England's first four matches due to a hamstring injury, made a brief appearance against Switzerland and has now declared himself fit to start.\n\nMarc Guehi, who impressed earlier in the tournament, faces competition from Ezri Konsa for a defensive spot upon his return from suspension. The tactical setup for the match in Dortmund remains uncertain, whether it will be a three-man or four-man defense or a combination of both.\n\nDespite being substituted during extra time last weekend due to a cramp, Harry Kane, England's leading goal scorer, is ready to enhance his impressive record in the European Championship knockout stages. Kane has scored five times in the elimination rounds, matching Antoine Griezmann's record.\n\nMeanwhile, the Netherlands face a crucial decision in their attacking lineup after Wout Weghorst's impactful half-time introduction changed the course of their quarterfinal against T\u00fcrkiye.\n\nKoeman, who recently extended his tenure until 2026, is considering whether to start Weghorst alongside Memphis Depay.\n\nHowever, a decisive role off the bench seems more likely.\n\nDepay and Cody Gakpo have been directly involved in 63.5% of the Netherlands' goal attempts this summer, contributing to six of their nine goals.\n\nKoeman is expected to maintain continuity with his starting eleven on Wednesday, with Bart Verbruggen in goal, Virgil van Dijk leading from central defense, and Xavi Simons linking midfield to attack.", "source": {"uri": "dailysabah.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Sabah"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daily_sabah@dailysabah.com", "name": "Daily Sabah",

They now face the Netherlands for a spot in the final.\n\nRonald Koeman's side may have finished behind both Austria and France in the group stage, but they sure have found their form in the knockouts, beating Romania 3-0 and then Turkey 2-1.\n\nBET NOW: Latest odds for Euro 2024 and best bets for England vs. Netherlands on BetMGM\n\nEngland required extra time to overcome Slovakia and then won a penalty shootout against Switzerland. Southgate's tournament record is impressive, and it would be a historic moment if they were to make the final once again.\n\nThe Sporting News takes a look at the best bets, a prediction and latest odds for this match.\n\nMORE: Euro 2024 schedule and results, updated LIVE | Euro 2024 top scorers, who is leading Golden Boot race? | How to watch all the Euro 2024 action\n\nWhile England are yet to score twice in regular time at this tournament, semifinals can often see form go out the window.\n\nThe Three Lions looked much better with their newly adopted three-at-the-back formation against Switzerland, and with Bukayo Saka finally arriving at this tournament, he could be the man to spark their attack.\n\nCody Gakpo has been the Netherlands' danger man, and Koeman's Oranje appear deadly on the counter, but England's defence has so far been resilient.\n\nSouthgate's side have fallen behind in each of their last two matches yet have still managed to reach the semifinals.\n\nThe Netherlands should prove to be their toughest test yet, and while England conceded late in the second half vs. Switzerland, they were caught early on the counter against Slovakia. Koeman's men will also look to counter, and could catch the Three Lions cold.\n\nAn early goal would still leave England with plenty of time to mount a comeback and, with odds around +1300, there's value to be had backing them to win from behind.\n\nWhile his clutch strike vs. Switzerland was his first goal involvement at Euro 2024, it may be the boost Saka needs to truly get his tournament going.\n\nThe Arsenal man has consistently been a threat down the England right and since Southgate's formation change, he's looked the most deadly, as defenders have had their focus on both Phil Foden and Jude Bellingham.\n\nLiverpool man Gakpo is in fine form and has proven to be the Netherlands' most impactful player for the last two international tournaments. He has six goals in his last nine games across Euro 2024 and World Cup 2022.\n\nHe is also only the third player to score three or more goals at two different major tournaments for the Netherlands.\n\nCutting in from the left against Kyle Walker, who has seen a dramatic dropoff in performances from his 2023/24 Man City performances, is something that Gakpo should look to thrive on.\n\nUSA: England vs. Netherlands will be televised in the United States on FOX, while Spanish TV broadcasts are provided by Univision and TUDN. These channels are all available to stream on Fubo, who are offering a FREE seven-day trial. ViX is also an option for Spanish viewers.\n\nRadio coverage of the match can be followed on SiriusXM FC.\n\nUK: Wednesday's match will be shown in the UK on ITV 1 / STV Scotland and fans can stream on ITVX / STV Player.\n\nCanada: TSN are the main English-language broadcasters for Euro 2024 while TVA provides French options.\n\nAustralia: Australia's sole broadcaster for the European Championship is Optus Sport.\n\nIndia: Euro 2024 matches are available to watch on JioTV and Sony LIV. England vs. Netherlands can also be viewed on Sony Ten Network on TV.\n\nIf this match is not available to watch live in your location, or if you're traveling abroad, you can use a Virtual Private Network (VPN).

Gareth Southgate's men will take on the Netherlands in Dortmund on Wednesday evening, with either France or Spain awaiting in Berlin this weekend.\n\nAfter an underwhelming group stage, the Three Lions needed penalties to win their quarter-final against Switzerland, while their dramatic last-16 win over Slovakia came after a stoppage-time equaliser from Jude Bellingham and a Harry Kane extra-time winner.\n\nSouthgate has chopped and changed his midfield throughout the tournament and now England fans are calling on him to make another major change.\n\nVIDEO Why Cody Gakpo's A Huge Problem For England\n\nPhil Foden was perhaps the best player in the Premier League last season, netting a career-high 27 goals across all competitions, but has struggled to replicate that form in Germany. This has partly been down to Southgate installing the Manchester City man on the left-hand side at the start of the tournament before he occupied a more familiar central role against Switzerland after Southgate moved to five at the back.\n\nDespite this switch last time out, 66 per cent of England fans survey by Sky Bet want to see Southgate ruthlessly take Foden out of the starting XI, as they called for Chelsea midfielder Cole Palmer to take his place.\n\nPalmer has impressed in his appearances off the bench in Germany and was the first player to take a penalty in the shootout against Switzerland, with his confident strike setting the tone for the rest of his teammates.\n\nSouthgate's move to five at the back was welcomed by the fans surveyed, with 71 per cent calling for him to keep that shape, with just 29 per cent wanting to revert to a back four.\n\nThe supporters were also quizzed on who England's most important player is, with 27 per cent opting for Bukayo Saka, who netted the equaliser against the Swiss, with only Jude Bellingham (29 per cent) ahead of him. Next up was goalkeeper Jordan Pickford.\n\nGet a free live stream to watch Euro 2024 from anywhere in the world and catch the final stages of the summer's big tournament\n\n'You watch Harry Kane and

England fell behind Switzerland 1-0 in the 75th minute, but equalized in the 80th and prevailed on PKs. The Netherlands trailed Turkey 1-0 for most of their quarterfinal contest, but goals in the 70th and 76th allowed the Dutch to win 2-1 in 90 minutes.\n\nBelow, we'll tackle what to expect from a betting perspective as we look to follow up on a perfect day yesterday, when all four plays cashed -- and our final score predictions were correct -- for both Spain-France and Argentina-Canada.\n\nThe battle between the English and the Dutch will kick off at 3 p.m. ET on FOX from Borussia Dortmund's Signal Iduna Park.\n\nNetherlands vs. England Moneyline Odds\n\nThe three-way moneyline odds below apply to the result after 90 minutes, plus stoppage time.\n\nIn single-elimination tournament games like this one, sportsbooks also offer \"to advance\" odds for anyone interested in simply picking the winner (regardless of how they get it done).\n\nNeither of these teams enjoyed smooth sailing in group play.\n\nThe Netherlands finished third in Group D with a win over Poland, a draw against France and a loss to Austria.\n\nMeanwhile, England had some well-documented struggles of their own in Group C, beating Serbia and drawing both Denmark and Slovenia.\n\nThe Three Lions have continued to survive despite struggling offensively in knockout play, as they needed a last-second equalizer -- and extra time -- against Slovakia in the round of 16 and a perfect showing in PKs against Switzerland in the quarters.\n\nThe Dutch enjoyed one of the most convincing victories of the entire round of 16, a 3-0 romp over Romania, before last Saturday's back-and-forth affair vs. Turkey.\n\nCan the Dutch Front Line Keep Rolling?\n\nOutside of Spain, few teams in this competition have better offensively than the Netherlands, who have scored nine goals in five matches, with at least two in all but one of their games to date.\n\nBut England will be much tougher to score on than the likes of Poland, Austria, Romania and Turkey (the Netherlands faced one tough defensive side, France, in group play, and drew that match 0-0).\n\nThe Dutch have controlled possession for the most part in this tournament, but were outpossessed 62-38 by the French. Despite conceding possession, the Netherlands finished that match with eight shots (four on target).\n\nHow Netherlands-France went could be instructive given that France are much more similar to England than any of the other Dutch opponents to date.\n\nEngland Proving Value of Substance Over Style\n\nDating back to the 2018 World Cup, England have made winning ugly (or you could call it low-scoring) a habit. Manager Gareth Southgate's team reached the semifinal of the 2018 WC and the final of Euro 2020 (played in 2021), with a quarterfinal loss to runner-up France in the 2022 World Cup.\n\nAnd, it should be noted, France have been successful with a similar formula at the last two World Cups, winning in 2018 and reaching the final in 2022.\n\nWhether you find it aesthetically pleasing or not, England's ability to limit chances for their opponents keeps their matches close, and this team is getting better and better at finding a way in extra time or PKs when it has to.\n\nIt also helps that when they've fallen behind, young stars Jude Bellingham (against Slovakia) and Bukayo Saka (against Switzerland) have proven that they can produce something spectacular out of nothing to keep their team alive.\n\nNetherlands vs. England Prediction, Best Bets\n\nIt's tough to see this match getting resolved in 90 minutes. The Dutch have gone to extra time in just one of their five matches in this competition, but England have been level with their opponent after 90 minutes in each of their last four.\n\nThis game has the same feel as Portugal-France in the quarterfinals, which had low-scoring draw written all over it. The good news for bettors who don't mind banking on a draw after 90 minutes is that the payout -- at +180 -- is substantial.\n\nAs for who will move on to meet Spain in the final, I'll take an England side that has thrived under pressure to win another nail-biter.\n\nPrediction: England 1, Netherlands 1 (England advance on penalty kicks)\n\nBest bets: Draw (+180 at BetMGM, FanDuel, DraftKings and bet365); England to qualify (-125 at ESPN BET)", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tyler_everett@newsweek.com", "name": "Tyler Everett",

The men's national team, which won the World Cup at home in 1966, have never appeared in a major tournament final outside England.\n\nAsked how the players were coping with the pressure of the moment, Kane, who has scored only once in open play at the tournament, said each player was dealing with the situation in his own way. The Bayern Munich striker said: \"I don't think we speak about it in the dressing room. The ones who have had more experience know what it's like to play for England in major tournaments. As we've been getting better the expectation gets higher and that's been no different.\n\n\"Some will use it in different ways, some will use it as motivation, some will just block it out and focus on what they need to do. Everyone's different. From a team point of view we know what we need to achieve. We have a really important game, a really tough game we need to be ready for. We've prepared for that.\"\n\nWith up to 75,000 Dutch supporters expected in Dortmund on Wednesday night, England fans are likely to be outnumbered by four to one although the number of fans in the stadium are expected to be similar. In the stands of the Westfalenstadion, the Dutch presence will be most obvious in the famous south terrace which is known as the \"Yellow Wall\" during Borussia Dortmund games but will become orange on Wednesday night.\n\nSouthgate said: \"I think our players are used to it. The atmosphere in the stadiums has been great this tournament and it's added a different feel and intensity to the games. I'm sure our fans will make themselves heard and it will be a colourful occasion. These occasions is why we're involved in football and we're looking forward to stepping up.\"\n\nThe Netherlands will be by far the highest-ranked team - seventh in the world - England have faced after group games with Serbia, Denmark and Slovenia, followed by knockout matches against Slovakia and Switzerland.\n\nThe referee for the game, Felix Zwayer, served a six-month ban for his role in a match-fixing scandal in 2006. He has always denied wrongdoing. The England midfielder Jude Bellingham hit out at Zwayer while playing for Borussia Dortmund in 2021 after a defeat against Bayern Munich describing him as \"a referee that has match-fixed before\". Bellingham was fined \u20ac40,000 (\u00a333,800) for his unproven allegation.\n\nAsked about the choice of referee, Southgate would not be drawn into criticising Uefa. He said: \"I think everybody knows how I deal with refs, with complete respect for every referee. I know the two guys at Uefa who have been running the refs programme and I think they appreciate the respect we have shown as a team to officials over eight years.\n\n\"I think there's a right way to conduct yourself towards officials and I think that's very important for the game. So no, I'm not concerned about who the ref is. He will be at a very high standard because that's the way Uefa make those decisions and the way they monitor games during the tournament. So, for me, it's not even a consideration.\"\n\nAfter weeks of dismal weather in the west of Germany, the sun was out in Dortmund as fans of England and the Netherlands filled the bars around in the centre of Dortmund. Martin Sauer, head of the organising team for the Euro games in the city, said he was concerned that the sheer number of Dutch fans could overcrowd the fan zones but not by the threat of violence between supporters.\n\nHe said: \"We are expecting 75,000 Dutch fans. We think there are 16,000 English fans with tickets for the stadium and a small number of English fans without tickets, but not as big as the Dutch number. I think the ticket holder numbers are really equal between those two but non-ticket holders will be the majority from the Netherlands.\n\n\"We know that everything is really [tight]. That's good for a really special atmosphere but it's also complicated for public transport and for the public viewing and for everybody to find a space where you can where they can watch the game.\"\n\nSauer said there would be a heavy police presence but there were no major security concerns. He said: \"Always in every fan group there will be somebody who makes trouble but we are not concerned especially for English fans. We have English fans from club level here regularly in the championship games, and usually it's no problem.\n\n\"They're very welcome. And we think that the English fans will like the city and will like our bars. The public transport isn't as big as maybe Berlin or Hamburg or bigger cities in Germany. If you like to use your own feet, it's really easy to go through the city. If you need to public transport, you maybe have to wait some minutes.\"\n\nHarvey Brown, 19, a student at Cardiff Metropolitan university, said: \"I think it will be well organised here. They are used to Borussia Dortmund Champions League games. They are talking about 75,000 Dutch fans but we hear they will be walking to the stadium from 3.30pm so there hopefully won't be any problems, especially given how well England fans have behaved so far.\"\n\nThe new culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, will be at the game as part of a \"fact-finding mission\" ahead of the staging of Euro 2028 in UK and Ireland.", "source": {"uri":

What is achievable? Rather than, what could go wrong?\n\n\"That is different for a player. This is now the chance to make history, first time to make a final not held in England.\"\n\nMore from this section Scarsdale, Rye top list of wealthiest suburbs in U.S. Report finds deficiencies with Westchester's Bee-Line Bus service Watch Sacramento Kings welcome six-time All-Star DeMar DeRozan\n\nThe selection of referee Felix Zwayer has raised eyebrows after Bellingham was fined during his time at Borussia Dortmund for bringing up a historic charge of match fixing against the German.\n\nZwayer was handed a six-month ban in 2006 after he was investigated for taking a bribe from another official.\n\nBellingham was fined 40,000 euros ($43,000) for his outburst after Bayern Munich beat Dortmund in December 2021.\n\n- Dutch face travel chaos -\n\nThe Netherlands also had their troubles in the group stages as a 3-2 defeat to Austria saw them sneak through as one of the best third-placed sides.\n\nRonald Koeman's men have since found their groove in a 3-0 win over Romania in the last 16 before battling back to beat Turkey 2-1 in the last eight.\n\nThe Dutch boast one of the form attacking players in the tournament in Cody Gakpo, who is looking to move out in front in the race for the Golden Boot by adding to his three goals so far.\n\nThey have had to wait 36 years since their own sole major tournament triumph -- which came the last time the Euros were held in Germany.\n\nBut their preparations for the game were disrupted by issues with the German train system, which has caused chaos for fans throughout the tournament.\n\nThe Netherlands had planned to go from their base in Wolfsburg by rail to Dortmund.\n\nHowever, a blockage on the line meant a last-minute change of plans as they instead had to fly and missed their pre-match media duties as a result.\n\n\"We don't play until 9 pm (1900GMT) tomorrow. I'm sure they will still get dinner when they arrive,\" added Southgate.\n\n\"They've got plenty of time.

Van Basten's opener for the Netherlands was cancelled out by a Bryan Robson equaliser just after half-time, but two goals in five second-half minutes allowed van Basten to complete his hat-trick and sealed a 3-1 Dutch win.\n\nThe nations were again drawn in the same group at the 1990 World Cup in Italy, and many of the players involved in 1988 again featured in this meeting in Cagliari, among them current Dutch boss Ronald Koeman.\n\nThe sides had each drawn their opening match, with England being held by Ireland and the Netherlands by Egypt. This time England kept van Basten quiet in a 0-0 draw, and it was England who would top the group on the way to reaching the semi-finals. The Dutch, meanwhile, were beaten by West Germany in the last 16.\n\nEngland have failed to qualify for just one World Cup since the 1970s, and it was the Netherlands who denied them a place at USA 94.\n\nGraham Taylor's England had a poor campaign, taking just one point from two games against Norway, who topped the group. They squandered a two-goal lead at home to the Dutch at Wembley, but when they went to Rotterdam for the return fixture - their penultimate game in the group - England still had qualification in their own hands as they were above the Dutch.\n\nWith Paul Gascoigne suspended, England fell behind to a free-kick just after the hour mark by Koeman - who the visitors felt should have been sent off earlier on - before Dennis Bergkamp sealed a 2-0 Dutch win.\n\nEngland beat San Marino in their final game but a Dutch win in Poland ensured they qualified instead. It was a disastrous campaign for Taylor, captured in a warts-and-all TV documentary. Taylor later resigned, while the Dutch reached the World Cup quarter-finals.\n\nThe nations met again in the group stage at Euro '96. Both teams had taken four points from their first two matches before clashing at Wembley, where Alan Shearer opened the scoring with a penalty and added another goal early in the second half, in between a brace by Teddy Sheringham.\n\nPatrick Kluivert's late goal for the Dutch made the final score 4-1 as England - who had current boss Gareth Southgate in defence - won the group and the Netherlands squeezed through in second place ahead of Scotland.\n\nThe Dutch lost on penalties to France in the last eight, while England were beaten in a shoot-out in the semi-finals by Germany, with Southgate missing the crucial kick.", "source": {"uri": "straitstimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Straits Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

But the Netherlands again are another step up, although I wouldn't consider them one of the three or four elite nations in the world.\n\n'But they are in that group behind, so normally I would fancy us to go through against them but based on current form I'd say it's a 50/50.\n\n'It's very hard to back against England because you can't help but look at the teams on paper and think we have better individual players, so it's hard to go against us.\n\n'I'd say it could even be a 1-1 draw again with us going through on penalties, or us winning 2-1. I'd go for the latter. I am quietly confident we can go through.'\n\nSouthgate, who is out of contract with England later this year, has admitted that he will likely step aside should he fail to lead his side to glory this summer.\n\nOwen believes Southgate will look to leave regardless of the outcome in Germany and feels ex-Brighton and Chelsea head coach Graham Potter could be the best fit to replace him in the hot seat.\n\n'I could imagine with Southgate that there will be a natural parting no matter what the result. If we win it, Southgate's had a fair crack at it, he's enjoyed it but he might even be ready for a change himself,' the former Liverpool, Manchester United and Real Madrid forward added.\n\n'The general feeling among fans in England has been that this is his last tournament.\n\n'A lot of people are frustrated with the cautious approach. I just think it may be an occasion whereby it's best for everyone, he might want a break or have a crack at club management.\n\n'I would say if we win or not, Southgate will be looking at life after England.\n\n'There is not an outstanding candidate to take over if Southgate goes. I personally am of the opinion that we should stick to an English manager, that's what international football is about. In fact I would almost go as far as to say there should be a rule change. You are playing for your country, the players are going to be from that country.\n\n'In club football you can have any player or coach from any country but I think when you're playing for your country it should be Scottish managers, Scottish players and Scottish physios. That's the point. Same with France. That's the point of international football.\n\n'It's not a rule but I would have that principle and would like England to have an English manager. I think possibly the one manager free and available is Graham Potter, who may take it. Apart from him, I think Steve Cooper is a good manager, Frank Lampard and Gerrard would have been tipped in the past but they probably need to do well in their current jobs to be back in the fold maybe.\n\n'Eddie Howe I really see as a top manager but he's employed at the moment. As things stand, if Southgate were to leave tomorrow I'd probably say Potter.'\n\nMORE : Ian Wright speaks out on Arsenal fans turning on him for Bukayo Saka demand\n\nMORE : Arsenal eager to sign second Euro 2024 star this summer after Nico Williams interest", "source": {"uri": "metro.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Metro"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_olver@metro.co.uk", "name": "Tom Olver", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Owen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michael Owen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Koeman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Koeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Potter", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Graham Potter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_Williams", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nico Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Howe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eddie Howe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Lampard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frank Lampard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Wright", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ian Wright"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Gerrard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steven Gerrard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/comp-1720537642.png?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712618", "eventUri": "eng-9712618", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

The big decision for Ronald Koeman will be whether to stick with Steven Bergwijn starting on the right or to bring in either Donyell Malen or Wout Weghorst, the latter meaning a reshuffle of the attack, Xavi Simons likely moving to the flank.\n\nMarc Guehi is back from suspension and with Luke Shaw having returned to fitness to appear off the bench in the quarter-final, England should also have a full 26-man squad for Gareth Southgate to choose from.

Switzerland. Slovakia. Slovenia.\n\nThose are their last three opponents. If you had to pick three teams at a major tournament to give you a ticket to the semi-finals, you wouldn't believe your luck if you landed all of those.\n\nActually, I'm wrong, there's a fourth reason. The Netherlands. Now the Dutch have a great history but it's just that. History. This is a plodding team who depend on Cody Gakpo and Memphis Depay up front. That says it all.\n\nREAD MORE: Serie A giants move for Irish teen who is also generating interest from Chelsea and PSV\n\nREAD MORE: Brendan Rodgers says Ireland youngster has the 'personality' to play for Celtic\n\nEngland couldn't have picked handier semi-final opponents.\n\nThe draw is the overriding reason why England can become champions, though I still make France favourites.\n\nIt's not that England have a good team, never mind a great one.\n\nIt's not due to the ability of Gareth Southgate as manager.\n\nHe looks more and more like what he was - a man who got Middlesbrough relegated.\n\nBut I think England will be in the final because they still have outstanding individuals.\n\nLook at their last two games. England were atrocious against both Switzerland and Slovakia.\n\nThey survived, though, because of two moments of brilliance from two class acts in Jude Bellingham and Bukayo Saka.\n\nHow many passages of good team play did England show in those games? Very few.\n\nThey are not a team at all. A manager always should aim to make the whole greater than the sum of the parts.\n\nSouthgate has done the opposite. England, with the players they have, should be much better, but he just picks individuals, not a team.\n\nAnd his conservatism is a major issue too.\n\nIt's never good to be a reactive manager, but that is what Southgate is - witness how he turned to his bench instantly after Switzerland went in front on Saturday.\n\nHe makes changes when they are forced on to him.\n\nIt was clear against Switzerland that a change was needed at left-back. Southgate turned to Luke Shaw, who hadn't played a game since February.\n\nWhen he came on to the pitch, it was clear he was in no way fit.\n\nSouthgate had the option of using Joe Gomez, who played 17 games at left-back for Liverpool last season, and did well there.\n\nBut Shaw is one of the manager's men. Even though he wasn't match fit or, in any way, fit, he turned to Shaw.\n\nHe got away with it because he is blessed with luck at this tournament.\n\nHe's had this luck at other tournaments too. It's incredible the run of good fortune he's had.\n\nIf he is to lead England to glory, though, he can't rely on luck forever.\n\nBig and brave calls have to be made. Harry Kane is badly out of form. He has posed hardly any threat across five games now.\n\nHe was only taken off well into extra time when he picked up a knock.\n\nIs Southgate going to allow a Cristiano Ronaldo situation to develop?\n\nNo player should be undroppable. It doesn't matter if you wear the captain's armband.\n\nSouthgate has plenty of other options up front. He can't afford to always wait until changes are forced upon him.\n\nIs there anyone who is willing to tell Southgate that he can't keep going the way he's going?\n\nIt seems that Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink is his main sounding board.\n\nIn September 2022, Hasselbaink resigned as Burton Albion manager after just seven games of the season.\n\nThey were bottom of League One with just one point from seven games.\n\nHe also managed Royal Antwerp in the Belgian Second Division, QPR in the Championship and Northampton Town in League One.\n\nHasselbaink had a fine playing career but his managerial one has been mediocre.\n\nBut somehow he landed the job of Southgate's assistant with England. In game after game, he is in Southgate's ear.\n\nIf that has, in part, contributed to the turgid stuff we've had to endure from England, it's bewildering.\n\nThe buck does stop with Southgate, however. He'll feel his approach has been vindicated by England's progress. It hasn't, he's just been lucky.\n\nIf such a limited team make the final, what does it tell us about Euro 2024?\n\nIt tells us that international football - in Europe, anyway - is not in a great place.\n\nPremier League clubs started preseason training last week but international football is still going on, all over the world.\n\nPlayers are tired - both physically and mentally. The best players have been defenders, even 41-year-old Pepe was able to leave his mark.\n\nThat tells me that it's a far from vintage tournament.\n\nI have enjoyed Spain but I think their younger players are starting to feel the heat and wilt under the pressure.\n\nFrance, because of the players and experience they have, are the best bet to win outright, but this is a tournament that raises serious questions about Mbappe.\n\nWe saw him as the heir to Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo as the world's greatest player.\n\nBut I'm not sure if he'll ever be the player he promised to be.\n\nHe chose to cruise in the French league for far too long and has been dreadful at the Euros. A broken nose is no excuse.\n\nWe'll know his real worth when he goes to Real Madrid. I wouldn't be convinced he'll shine there.\n\nI can see us ending up with an England v France final, and that would likely be a hard watch.\n\nEngland are dreaming again, but Southgate has come up with a team that play with fear - fear of mistakes, fear of the press, fear of their fans, fear of criticism.\n\nI'm not convinced fear can drive a team to glory, but it will get them to the European Championships final.\n\nGet the latest sports headlines straight to your inbox by signing up for free email alerts.", "source": {"uri": "irishmirror.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish mirror"},

semi-final", "body": "Our analysis shows why England should progress after their much improved showing against Switzerland\n\nTHE quarter final tie against Switzerland was arguably the first real test for England at this European Championships.\n\nThe Swiss had impressed to this point in the tournament and they had came through a tough round of 16 match against Italy and looked good in doing so.\n\nThey even managed to take the lead in the quarter final match, perhaps against the run of play, and England were put on the back foot.\n\nThis England side, however, have already shown determination and a willingness to keep working to the final whistle.\n\nIn the round of 16 against Slovakia it took an acrobatic last minute effort from Jude Bellingham to equalise before they went on to win in extra time.\n\nAgainst Switzerland the composure during the penalty shoot out also spoke of an English side who were well coached and well prepared for this scenario coming into the tournament.\n\nNow, in the semi-final England play a Netherlands side who have faced similar criticism to England during the tournament.\n\nThe Dutch have been solid defensively but they have faced issues when it comes to ball progression and chance creation in the final third, despite the strong performances so far from Cody Gakpo of Liverpool.\n\nNow, as the Netherlands and England meet this week in the semi final there is a clear sense that whichever side is brave enough to take the initiative and to play on the front foot will have a clear advantage going when it comes to reaching the final.\n\nAgainst Switzerland we saw some small changes from England and their coach Gareth Southgate that seemed effective in terms of offering greater control to the English in the match.\n\nBEST FREE BET SIGN UP OFFERS FOR UK BOOKMAKERS\n\nThe most notable was perhaps the switch of Phil Foden from a position where he started on the left-side to a more central position as the '10' between the midfield and the attack.\n\nWe will look at three of the main tactical questions going into this semi final match between the two teams.\n\nFootball is difficult and the truth is that the positions players occupy during a game can be very different from the tactical graphic that the TV channels show us before the game.\n\nIn England's first four matches at the tournament, for example, we saw Foden listed as the left-winger in Southgate's 4-2-3-1 system.\n\nDuring the matches, however, Foden continued to position himself narrow in the channels or even in the central areas.\n\nAgainst Switzerland we finally saw Foden used primarily as the '10' as his starting position, as England changed to something closer to a 3-4-3 shape.\n\nThis meant that the Manchester City man was finally free to move around the central areas as he dropped in and out of pockets of space.\n\nHis movement and positioning in these central areas was very effective for England as it meant the midfield and central defenders had an effective target to play into as they progressed the ball and broke the lines of the Swiss defensive structure.\n\nAgainst Switzerland we saw England create width on the left-side through the movement of Bellingham, who was still relatively narrow but willing to move outside to stretch the pitch.\n\nAnd also Kieran Trippier who moved high as the left-sided wingback.\n\nWhile there was a suggestion amongst some that England had shifted to a back three system in this game, the truth was that Kyle Walker, at right-back, had consistently played in a deeper and more narrow position throughout the tournament.\n\nAgainst the Netherlands and their strong defensive structure the importance of having a player like Foden who can quickly dip in and out of pockets of space to receive the ball and play is clear.\n\nIf England want to be successful in this match then creating threat in spaces in front of the Dutch defensive line will be one of the keys.\n\nPlayers like Foden will without a doubt be the key for England and Southgate as they look to unlock the Dutch defence.\n\nThroughout the entire tournament one of the biggest question marks surrounding England and their team selection has been who would be the player to partner Declan Rice in the centre of the midfield.\n\nAgainst Switzerland there can be little doubt that Kobbie Mainoo of Man United has cemented that position for the rest of the tournament.\n\nMainoo showed a poise and level of composure that is incredibly unusual in a midfield player so young and he was consistently available and in space to receive the ball and help teammates.\n\nMainoo received cleanly and showed the ability to progress the ball and break lines over and over again.\n\nThis is something that will clearly be key for Southgate in his game plan to beat the Dutch.\n\nThe presence of Mainoo in the midfield also unlocks the potential of Rice to a greater degree than we saw with either Trent Alexander-Arnold or Conor Gallagher in the midfield for England.\n\nHaving Mainoo, who is comfortable in the position whether attacking or defending, playing in there allows Rice at times to step out in possession and be more aggressive in his own right.\n\nThe presence of Mainoo alongside Rice at the base of the midfield for England will allow the likes of Saka, Foden and Bellingham more space and freedom to play further forward.\n\nWhile England are likely to be entering this match as slight favourites over the Netherlands they will still have to be careful of some of the attacking threat from their Dutch opponents.\n\nDefensively the Netherlands have been incredibly solid so far in this tournament and they are being effectively led by the Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk.\n\nIn attack, while Memphis Depay has perhaps not been at his best as the central striker, this has been made less important by the performances of the likes of Xavi Simons, from the midfield, and Gakpo from the wing.\n\nSimons will play in this match as the most attacking of the Dutch midfielders and he will show a clear tendency to look to drop into little pockets of space between or around the midfield due of Rice and Mainoo for England.\n\nGakpo has been impressive from the left-side of the attack for the Dutch and he has registered three goals and one assist so far in the tournament.\n\nHe will look to position himself wide and to hold the width on the left for the Dutch and from this position he can receive the ball and either create for others or drive dangerously towards goal.\n\nThe likes of Gakpo and Simons are dangerous opponents for England and they have the capacity to cause threat whether the Netherlands are possession dominant in this game or attacking more in transition.\n\nWhile neither England or the Netherlands have necessarily impressed so far in this tournament, this semi-final still promises to be an interesting and close match.", "source":

Koeman infamously fouled England's David Platt in a crucial World Cup qualifier in 1993 but was spared what looked like an obvious red card. The Dutchman went on to score just minutes later and England missed out on qualification for the World Cup in 1994.\n\nThere's a saying that time heals all wounds, and many of the England fans who will be watching the Euro 2024 semi-final between the Three Lions and the Netherlands on Wednesday night won't even have been born when the incident this article is about took place. But football fans are also a special breed, and few England fans over a certain age will ever fully forgive Ronald Koeman for his role in denying the Three Lions a spot at the 1994 World Cup.\n\nIn 1993, England played the Netherlands in a crucial World Cup qualifier knowing that a win, or even a draw, would have been crucial to their chances of making it through to the tournament in the United States. England were coming off the back of a disappointing European Championship campaign in 1992, when they were knocked out in the group stage, and were handed a World Cup qualifying group comprising six teams, with the top two guaranteed a place at the World Cup.\n\nEngland vs the Netherlands H2H record\n\nPlayed\n\n22\n\nEngland wins\n\n6\n\nNetherlands wins\n\n7\n\nDraws\n\n9\n\nEngland's Crunch Showdown vs the Netherlands Three Lions needed to avoid defeat\n\nGraham Taylor was the man in charge when England crashed out of Euro '92 and the Three Lions' poor form in their USA '94 qualifying campaign did little to improve the public's confidence in him as the national team's manager.\n\nEngland actually began their qualifying campaign quite well, collecting 10 points from their opening four matches, but they then went on a three-game win-less run to put themselves in trouble. After eight matches each, England and the Netherlands had the same number of points, having each won four matches, drawn three and lost one.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: England have only failed to qualify for the World Cup three times in the competition's history - in 1974, 1978 and 1994.\n\nNorway, meanwhile, were in pole position to top the group, having won six and drawn two of their first eight qualifying matches, leaving England in a straight shoot-out with the Netherlands for the final qualifying spot.\n\nEngland travelled to Rotterdam to face the Dutch in the penultimate qualifier for both teams, and the Three Lions knew that a draw would make them the favourites to progress to the tournament proper. Although a draw would've seen them stay in third place in qualifying, behind the Netherlands on goal difference, the goal difference swing was only three, and England were due to face whipping boys San Marino in their final qualifier, while the Netherlands had to travel to Poland.\n\nRelated Alan Shearer Names his England Starting 11 to Face the Netherlands\n\nAlan Shearer has had his say on who should start England's Euro 2024 semi-final tie against the Netherlands.\n\nEngland were the better team for much of the game in the Netherlands, creating chance after chance but not managing to convert their dominance into goals. Then, 10 minutes after half-time, England midfielder David Platt was bearing down on the Dutch goal following a through ball by Andy Sinton. Koeman, who had been beaten to Sinton's pass by Platt, blatantly dragged the then Sampdoria player to the ground. It was a denial of an obvious goal-scoring opportunity, and was clearly a foul deserving of a red card.\n\nKoeman Drags Platt Down Dutchman was handed lucky reprieve\n\nThe match referee, Germany's Karl-Josef Assenmacher, however, only brandished a yellow card, and to make matters worse, the foul occurred just outside the penalty area, meaning England didn't even have the chance to at least take the lead from the penalty spot.\n\nEngland boss Taylor was wearing a microphone during the match for a Channel 4 and was audibly, and understandably, furious. \"Referee! Referee! He should be sent off. Is he going to send him off? He's got to send him off! That... what are they being instructed? Eh? You know the rulings. Eh? Linesman! Linesman! What sort of thing is happening here? Absolutely disgraceful. The referee's got me the sack. (To the fourth official) Thank him ever so much for that, won't you.\"\n\nMinutes later, Koeman put his country in front with a delightful free-kick, and the game ended 2-0 to the Netherlands after Dennis Bergkamp had doubled their lead later in the second half.\n\nThat left England needing to beat San Marino, Poland to beat the Netherlands, and for there to be a significant goal difference swing in order for them to finish in second place in the group. England did thrash San Marino, but the Netherlands beat Poland, taking matters out of the Three Lions' hands.\n\nAlthough England did plenty of things wrong during that qualifying campaign, Koeman's role in their failure to make it to the '94 World Cup is what it is most remembered for.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Three Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_qualification", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup qualification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Koeman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Koeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Platt_(Coronation_Street)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "David Platt (Coronation Street)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penalty card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Sinton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andy Sinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Taylor", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Graham Taylor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Shearer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alan Shearer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_difference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goal difference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referee_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Referee (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotterdam", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rotterdam"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rotterdam"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl-Josef_Assenmacher", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karl-Josef Assenmacher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_kick_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free kick (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_kick_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty kick (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Bergkamp", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dennis Bergkamp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.C._Sampdoria", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "U.C.

This is now the chance to make history, first time to make a final not held in England.\"\n\nThe selection of referee Felix Zwayer has raised eyebrows after Bellingham was fined during his time at Borussia Dortmund for bringing up a historic charge of match fixing against the German.\n\nZwayer was handed a six-month ban in 2006 after he was investigated for taking a bribe from another official.\n\nBellingham was fined 40,000 euros ($43,000) for his outburst after Bayern Munich beat Dortmund in December 2021.\n\n- Dutch face travel chaos -\n\nThe Netherlands also had their troubles in the group stages as a 3-2 defeat to Austria saw them sneak through as one of the best third-placed sides.\n\nRonald Koeman's men have since found their groove in a 3-0 win over Romania in the last 16 before battling back to beat Turkey 2-1 in the last eight.\n\nThe Dutch boast one of the form attacking players in the tournament in Cody Gakpo, who is looking to move out in front in the race for the Golden Boot by adding to his three goals so far.\n\nThey have had to wait 36 years since their own sole major tournament triumph -- which came the last time the Euros were held in Germany.\n\nBut their preparations for the game were disrupted by issues with the German train system, which has caused chaos for fans throughout the tournament.\n\nThe Netherlands had planned to go from their base in Wolfsburg by rail to Dortmund.\n\nHowever, a blockage on the line meant a last-minute change of plans as they instead had to fly and missed their pre-match media duties as a result.\n\n\"We don't play until 9 pm (1900GMT) tomorrow. I'm sure they will still get dinner when they arrive,\" added Southgate.\n\n\"They've got plenty of time. I don't see it having any impact on the game.\"\n\nkca/nf\n\nMore from this section\n\nInformative Research Adds Brandon Hall as New EVP of Operations\n\nUnited Filmmakers Announces an Exciting

This group [is] different. They keep possession for longer periods. We haven't always got it right, but, in general, we have shown the resilience that the teams that win tournaments have had for years and years.\n\n\"Italy, France, Spain -- it's not all pure football. It's other attributes that they've had. We are showing a little bit more of that streetwise nature.\"\n\nMake no mistake, this is an England team that has a gnarled edge. Real Madrid's Bellingham might be the leading contender for the Ballon d'Or based off his skill set, but he has an uncompromisingly ruthless side as well.\n\nSouthgate's men have also had to shrug off a torrent of criticism after their performances to date. Even the Switzerland result, in which they were forced to come from behind with 10 minutes of regulation left, was only a partial improvement. During the shootout, the five successful kickers and goalkeeper Jordan Pickford showed their reserves of fortitude.\n\n[Related: Jordan Pickford's wild water bottle is just the start of England's penalty preparation]\n\n\"We are fighting,\" Southgate added. \"We are not going to stop fighting. We are in another semifinal, and we will see where we can get to. You have to show other qualities to win in tournaments, and these players are showing unbelievable qualities of character (and) resilience.\n\n\"I spoke to them about it, it is not just about playing well. (In beating Germany), Spain mixed their game up. They took seven yellow cards. They found ways to win. (Our) players are showing all those other attributes. Dealing with everything that's around this. Twice coming from behind in games. Now a penalty shootout where their composure was impeccable. I am so, so proud of them.\"\n\nIf England is winning ugly, at least the team is winning. With only four teams remaining, there are 20 others who would gladly swap places with them, despite not a single standout performance to date.\n\nEvery game it is said they need to get better. It has only happened in small increments.\n\nBut Southgate also wants to dispel the notion that elegant displays are constantly present for great teams that win major championships. Realistically, it only feels like that, because time often makes us forget in-the-moment struggles.\n\nWhile the likes of Bellingham and Foden shined during the club season on teams that espouse rapid, fluid attack, Southgate insisted the comparisons are not entirely fair, based off the differing situations.\n\n\"These are not normal football matches,\" he said. \"These are national events with huge pressure, with really young men in the middle of it. Our team has been under enormous pressure from the start. They are doing so well, so well.\n\n\"We are not able to score a load of goals at the moment, but again, we have played three teams that have ... very well-organized defenses. None of this stuff is easy, but we are in a third semifinal in four tournaments.\"\n\n[Related: 'We can change our lives forever': England's shot at history still alive]\n\nEven the exception to those four, a quarterfinal defeat to France at the 2022 World Cup, was a laudable outcome.\n\nBy these metrics, Southgate is the most successful head coach in the history of the England men's team. He knows he'll never be regarded as such unless he delivers the country only its second major trophy to follow victory on home soil in the 1966 World Cup.\n\nHis squad came so close at the last Euros, when England led Italy in the second half of the final before being pegged back and losing on penalties.\n\nThe coach has been open about how the stresses of the job largely prevent him from feeling any sense of personal enjoyment. Widespread criticism of his methods during the group stage in Germany has only added to that notion. It is widely expected that he will leave the post after this tournament, even though his contract runs until December, having been in charge since 2016.\n\nDancing on the field with the players as they celebrated in front of the England fans in D\u00fcsseldorf was a rare moment of the 53-year-old letting his guard down.\n\n\"Every now and then you think surely there has to be some enjoyment in this job,\" he said. \"If I can't enjoy that moment then the whole thing is a waste of time, really. I love the players, I love being in that moment with them.\n\n\"I took this job to try and improve England football. I wanted us to regain credibility on a world stage. I can't deny when it's as personal as it has been the last few weeks, on a human level -- that's quite difficult.\"\n\n[Related: Bukayo Saka goal, shootout redemption sends England past Switzerland, to Euros semis]\n\nSpeaking of levels of difficulty, things only get harder from here. The Netherlands only finished third in its group, but has surged to two impressive wins since then, both within 90 minutes, while England has twice gone to extra time and now has a quick turnaround to contend with.\n\nThe Dutch crushed Group E winner Romania and then showed resolve in overturning a deficit against Turkey, and its huge support, in Berlin. Cody Gakpo, one of the World Cup's breakout stars, is firing again.\n\nSouthgate knows England hasn't played its best soccer and would rank last of the semifinalists in style points, even with France's scoring troubles. Instead, though, there's a certain beauty to be found in getting the job done regardless. After all, coaches are constantly reminded that this is a results-based business.\n\n\"There is what we ideally want to be and there's how we've needed to be,\" Southgate said. \"To find ways to win.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score":

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nFormer Manchester United and England forward Teddy Sheringham has pinpointed the key factor that could propel Gareth Southgate's side to the Euro 2024 final.\n\nAs the Three Lions gear up for a pivotal semi-final clash with the Netherlands on Wednesday, they face their sternest challenge of the tournament thus far. And there's a strong sense England have a lot more to give than what's been shown already this summer.\n\nDespite not dazzling on their journey to the semi-finals in Germany, England have eked out results against Slovakia and Switzerland to secure their place in the last four. It took extra-time heroics from Jude Bellingham and Harry Kane to edge past Slovakia, followed by a nail-biting penalty shootout win over the Swiss.\n\nREAD MORE: Netherlands handed early Euro 2024 advantage as UEFA sting England for semi-finals\n\nREAD MORE: England handed Euro 2024 ban as Gary Lineker fears Netherlands penalty shoot-out tactic\n\nWhile some may see it as a bad thing not one player has dominated headlines for England at this stage, Sheringham views this as an advantage. The unity displayed during their tense win against Switzerland was singled out by the ex-Manchester United and Tottenham striker as the team's standout feature.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with the Daily Express (via Crypto Sports betting), Sheringham emphasised the importance of this camaraderie: \"It's going to take another big performance to win, but they can go out and perform and show the qualities you all have to win the game. This England squad is filled with top players who know how to perform on the big stage, and they have to make it count and take the chances they have.\n\n\"Make use of the brilliant team ethic you have and go and win the game. We came with the ambition of winning the Euros, so go and make it happen! You're all top players and as a group can win the game. They will have to dig deep at times during the game, but keep playing together as a team and hopefully our top players will come alive.\"\n\nBoth Bellingham and Kane have scored two goals apiece in Germany, while Bukayo Saka is the only other England player to find the back of the net at Euro 2024. United teenager Kobbie Mainoo, meanwhile, has impressed in midfield and forced his way into the starting XI. On the other hand, the Netherlands have been heavily reliant on Liverpool's Cody Gakpo, who is currently the competition's top scorer still active with three goals.\n\nEngland have often been labelled as a team of individuals, failing to live up to their potential in recent decades despite consistently boasting star-studded squads. However, Southgate has managed to put together a side that appears more cohesive, even though they haven't set the tournament ablaze this summer.\n\nManchester City star Phil Foden suggested this could still be viewed positively, with the team yet to fully demonstrate its capabilities. Speaking to BBC 5Live and talkSPORT, he said England have \"so many gears to go\" as they aim to defeat the Dutch and secure a final against either France or Spain.\n\nWhile the team may not have shown much in terms of individual brilliance, three-time Premier League champion Sheringham seems to concur the squad has untapped potential. He praised the \"top players\" for stepping up when necessary and expressed confidence in their ability to perform in Wednesday's semi.\n\n\"The inner belief the players have in themselves and the

You don't necessarily want to speak about that too much, it is an unusual achievement for even the most successful nations but these guys, they've shown more than being able to just play, and navigating tournaments, you need lots of other qualities.\n\n\"It is that resilience, it is that ability to stay composed when you go behind in games, or when momentum's against you, winning three penalty shoot-outs out of four, all those little bits build character, build belief.\n\n\"There's this tournament, but given the age of the squad and their experiences now, they'll have that belief for a long time, it should put England in a good place, but that's the future - we've got a good week ahead of us.\"\n\nSouthgate has spent eight years as manager and 11 years in total including his work with the Under-21s. He says that reaching the latter stages of tournaments is part of the \"DNA\" of the England set-up.\n\n\"The difference is, you know, we arrive in a quarter-final, we're not satisfied with that, so there is definitely a mindset shift in what we feel is acceptable as a team, where we want to end up,\" he said.\n\n\"Now within that it's knock-out football, the margins are so fine as we've seen again, that can easily tip the other way and it's a different story but those teams that have won consistently, they have that mindset, they're not just satisfied with being in quarter-finals, they're pushing in and that's what we have to continue.\"\n\nHarry Kane has been given unequivocal backing from Gareth Southgate, who says the striker has played an \"immense\" part in England reaching the semi-finals at Euro 2024.\n\nKane, 30, struggled for clear opportunities in the penalty shoot-out victory over Switzerland before coming off with cramp in both calves.\n\nThe England captain touched the ball nine times in the first half and had two shots at goal before being forced off in extra-time, having tumbled into the technical area.\n\nBut Southgate has saluted defensive work that saw Kane step in at left-back against the Swiss in Dusseldorf. He has played an important role in his own penalty area, defending set-pieces.\n\n\"All of the games have been slightly different, I thought he did a super job for the team in terms of defensively, his positioning, his understanding of where he needed to be,\" said Southgate.\n\n\"He's perhaps not flowing as he's arriving in those deeper areas as sometimes he looks with his passing, but he's still playing an immense part for the group.\"\n\nKane and England face Netherlands in Dortmund on Wednesday for a place in the final and he will be taking on his Bayern Munich team-mate Matthijs de Ligt. The Three Lions captain says his team-mates have belief after getting through their two knockout games with narrow victories.\n\n\"It was definitely our best performance against Switzerland,\" Kane said. \"The system caused them problems and we got on the ball more, played in their final-third more.\n\n\"We still just lacked a little bit of end product but tournaments are tough, these games are tough and you have to find a way to get through them.\n\n\"The longer we go in the competition in the manner we're doing it, it just gives us more and more belief that we're finding ways to win. That's an important factor in big competitions.\n\n\"We're enjoying it, we're enjoying the ride. We're proud to be in another semi-final because we know how much it means to everyone back home watching. We want to do everyone proud and that'll be no different on Wednesday.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D\u00fcsseldorf", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "D\u00fcsseldorf"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "D\u00fcsseldorf"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovakia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_under-21_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England national under-21 football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_kick_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free kick (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthijs_de_Ligt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matthijs de Ligt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Qx6baO08xrLM9OFdOv..KA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NTA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_818/9d1fba17de55e615b0b5e6cdfb9b3422", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712618", "eventUri": "eng-9712618", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

They now face the Netherlands for a spot in the final.\n\nRonald Koeman's side may have finished behind both Austria and France in the group stage, but they sure have found their form in the knockouts, beating Romania 3-0 and then Turkey 2-1.\n\nEngland required extra time to overcome Slovakia and then won a penalty shootout against Switzerland. Southgate's tournament record is impressive, and it would be a historic moment if they were to make the final once again.\n\nThe Sporting News takes a look at the best bets, a prediction and latest odds for this match.\n\nMORE: Euro 2024 schedule and results, updated LIVE | Euro 2024 top scorers, who is leading Golden Boot race? | How to watch all the Euro 2024 action\n\nWhile England are yet to score twice in regular time at this tournament, semifinals can often see form go out the window.\n\nThe Three Lions looked much better with their newly adopted three-at-the-back formation against Switzerland, and with Bukayo Saka finally arriving at this tournament, he could be the man to spark their attack.\n\nCody Gakpo has been the Netherlands' danger man, and Koeman's Oranje appear deadly on the counter, but England's backline has so far been resilient.\n\nSouthgate's side have fallen behind in each of their last two matches yet have still managed to battle through.\n\nThe Netherlands should prove to be their toughest test yet, and while England conceded late in the second half vs. Switzerland, they were caught early on the counter against Slovakia. Koeman's men will also look to counter, and could catch the Three Lions cold.\n\nAn early goal would still leave England with plenty of time to mount a comeback and, with odds of around 13.00, there's value to be had backing them to win from behind.\n\nWhile his clutch strike vs. Switzerland was his first goal involvement at Euro 2024, it may be the boost Saka needs to truly get his tournament going.\n\nThe Arsenal man has consistently been a threat down the England right and since Southgate's formation change, he's looked the most deadly, as defenders have had their focus on both Phil Foden and Jude Bellingham.\n\nLiverpool man Gakpo is in fine form and has proven to be the Netherlands' most impactful player for the last two international tournaments. He has six goals in his last nine games across Euro 2024 and World Cup 2022.\n\nHe is also only the third player to score three or more goals at two different major tournaments for the Netherlands.\n\nCutting in from the left against Kyle Walker, who has seen a dramatic dropoff in performances from his 2023/24 Man City performances, is something that Gakpo should look to thrive on.\n\nEuro 2024 is being shown exclusively on Optus Sport.\n\nFans can watch every match - including the final - live or on-demand via the streaming platform.\n\nOptus Sport can be accessed on

He's been taking a few of us after training to practice penalties.\n\n\"I feel like when I first came into the England side, we were maybe practicing them too much and there wasn't really a coach taking them.\n\n\"Now we have Jimmy for that reason to only take a couple, not overdo it.\"\n\nThe former Antwerp, QPR, Northampton and Burton manager has also proved to be a popular all-round member of the England camp, with Shaw, Foden and Trent Alexander-Arnold all championing his character in recent days.\n\nPenalty talk ban\n\nThe Football Association (FA) is reportedly determined to stifle talk of penalty tactics, with questions concerning the topic at recent press conferences blocked.\n\nEngland's latest approach to penalties has been the subject of much speculation, with The Athletic reporting a so-called 'buddy system', where one player is assigned to support and congratulate a penalty taker once their kick has been taken.\n\nImages of Jordan Pickford's water bottle have also been widely shared on social media, after it emerged he had attached a detailed list of Switzerland's penalty takers.\n\nKey players for the Netherlands\n\nVirgil Van Dijk - Van Dijk, as he does for Liverpool, captains the Netherlands and is widely regarded as one of the finest centre backs in world football.\n\nHe has helped the Dutch to keep two clean sheets from five games to this point and, alongside his defensive colleagues, will prove a formidable test for England's attack.\n\nXavi Simons - PSG star Xavi Simons is likely to be charged with providing a lot of the spark in the Netherlands midfield against England.\n\nThe 21-year-old has been in fine form so far at Euro 2024 and is currently joint top (three) of the assists chart, alongside Spain's Lamine Yamal.\n\nCody Gakpo - Gakpo is currently joint top-scorer at these Euros, with a goal a piece against Poland, Austria and Romania.\n\nThe Liverpool wide-man is likely to be up against England's Kyle Walker on Wednesday, and who emerges the better from that battle could play a key role in deciding the final outcome of the tie.\n\nPrevious meetings\n\nEngland have never played the Netherlands before in the knockout stages of a major tournament.\n\nThe two sides have, however, met each other in the group stages at both Euro 1988 and 1996, and the 1990 World Cup.\n\nWhen the teams last met in 2019, the Netherlands secured a 3-1 victory over England in the semi-finals of the inaugural Nations League.\n\nNetherlands Euro 2024 results\n\nThe Netherlands were drawn in Group D alongside Poland, France and Austria, and kicked off their tournament with a 2-1 victory over Poland.\n\nA goalless draw with France followed before the Dutch were duly beaten 3-2 by Austria in their final group stage match.\n\nRonald Koeman's side, despite the loss, qualified for the knockout stages where they faced Romania in the round of 16.\n\nGoals from Cody Gakpo and Donyell Malen saw the Netherlands run out 3-0 winners to set up a quarter final clash against Turkey.\n\nIt was in Berlin's Olympic Stadium where a second half rally from the Dutch saw them overturn a 1-0 scoreline to beat Turkey 2-1 and secure their place in the semi-finals of Euro 2024.", "source": {"uri": "itv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ITV Hub"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Crystal Palace star Geuhi got the nod in England's first four games, though, and was arguably the Three Lions' best player.\n\nGeuhi, 23, is expected to play on the left of a back three, with Southgate having abandoned his four-man defensive set up for the penalty shootout win over Switzerland. That means Kyle Walker should once again alongside John Stones in England's rearguard, with Bukayo Saka and Kieran Trippier playing as wing-backs.\n\nYou can follow the match by keeping up with our LIVE blog.\n\nTrippier retains his spot despite Luke Shaw making his tournament bow as a substitute against Switzerland. The Manchester United left-back last featured in February but was called up by Southgate as a calculated risk.\n\nSaka's goal in the 80th minute drew England level on Saturday, as the game went to extra-time and then penalties. The Arsenal star is joined in the XI by club team-mate Declan Rice, who'll be partnered in midfield by wonderkid Kobbie Mainoo.\n\nIn the forward line, Phil Foden keeps his place alongside Jude Bellingham and they'll support Harry Kane. Captain Kane has come in for criticism throughout the tournament and particularly after the game on Saturday, having touched the ball just 27 times - the least of any outfield player to play 90 minutes.\n\nYour turn! Who'll reach the final - England or the Netherlands? Give us your score prediction in the comments section\n\nFor the Netherlands, manager Ronald Koeman also makes a single change by bringing in winger Donyell Malen for Steven Bergwijn. Koeman has stuck with Memphis Depay up front, despite striker Wout Weghorst regularly making an impact as a sub. Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk will lead the Dutch while Reds forward Cody Gakpo, who has three goals in the tournament so far, also starts.\n\nThe game is being played in Dortmund, where Kane scored a hat-trick last season in his first campaign with Bayern Munich, having left boyhood club Tottenham in August. The 30-year-old spoke ahead of the match about the pressure on England's squad and how he and his team-mates have dealt with such expectation.\n\n\"I don't think we speak about it in the dressing room,\" Kane, who did score in the group stage against Denmark and in the round-of-16 against Slovakia, explained. \"The ones who have had more experience know what it's like to play for England in major tournaments. As we've been getting better the expectation gets higher and that's been no different.\n\n\"Some will use it in different ways, some will use it as motivation, some will just block it out and focus on what they need to do. Everyone's different. From a team point of view we know what we need to achieve. We have a really important game, a really tough game we need to be ready for. We've prepared for that.\"\n\nSouthgate wants his players to step-up their levels of performance against the Dutch, demanding: \"We need another step from what we showed in the last game, it's a step up in quality of opponents and we are ready for that.\"\n\nEngland XI: (3-4-2-1) Pickford; Walker, Stones, Geuhi; Saka, Mainoo, Rice, Trippier; Foden, Bellingham; Kane\n\nNetherlands XI: (4-2-3-1) Verbruggen; Dumfries, De Vrij, Van Dijk, Ake; Schouten, Reijnders; Malen, Simons, Gakpo; Depay.\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

The fact that the football is barely watchable does not bother him.

'But look at the data and you have the answer.'\n\nThe Netherlands' star player Cody Gakpo backed up his teammate, saying: 'Micky is the fastest in the Premier League.'\n\nCommenting on England's tactics, the Liverpool forward said: 'They play very defensively. They have a lot of quality, but they play defensively.'\n\nGakpo added of the team, many of whom are fellow Premier League players: 'They really have a fantastic group, hopefully it will be a nice match.'\n\nRonald Koeman's Netherlands beat Turkey 2-1 in Berlin to make their way into the semis against the Three Lions, as both teams bid to reach the final on July 14.\n\nMicky Van de Ven smiled as he told reporters at a press conference that he is faster than England winger Bukayo Saka\n\nThe Netherlands Lion will be hungry for a win, having last reached the tournament final in 2010.\n\nEngland fans are expected to be outnumbered, with officials estimating that 60 per cent of supporters will be from the army of Dutch fans known as Het Legioen -

England made it to the championship match for the first time in 2021 but lost to Italy on penalties. They used that format to their advantage in the quarterfinals of this edition of the competition, knocking off Switzerland to advance. The Netherlands edged Turkiye 2-1 to reach the semifinals for the sixth time in 11 Euro appearances and first since 2004.\n\nKickoff is set for 3 p.m. ET.

However, the team has conceded just three times over its five Euro 2024 contests. Since defeating Iran 6-2 in their 2022 World Cup group-stage opener, England has allowed 14 goals over 23 games across all competitions, posting 11 clean sheets in that span.\n\nOf England's five goals in this competition, midfielder Jude Bellingham and striker Harry Kane have combined to produce four. The 21-year-old Bellingham converted in the club's 1-0 victory against Serbia in the group-stage opener and Kane tallied in the 1-1 draw with Denmark, while both scored in a 2-1 triumph over Slovakia in the Round of 16. The 30-year-old Kane, who recorded a league-high 36 goals for Bayern Munich in 2023-24, is England's all-time leader with 65 goals. See which team to pick here.\n\nWhy you should back the Netherlands\n\nThe Dutch have registered nine victories and a draw over their last 12 matches across all competitions, with both defeats in that span being one-goal decisions. The side has a number of dangerous offensive weapons, with Cody Gakpo leading the charge. The 25-year-old winger, who is tied for the tournament lead after converting in three of the Netherlands' first four contests, has recorded six of his 12 career international goals in either the World Cup or the Euros.\n\nForward Memphis Depay scored his lone goal of this competition in the club's 3-2 loss to Austria in the group-stage finale. The 30-year-old is tied for 10th on the Netherlands' all-time list with 96 games and ranks second with 46 goals, four behind Robin van Persie. Forward Donyell Malen led Borussia Dortmund of the German Bundesliga in 2023-24 with 13 goals and registered a brace in the Netherlands' Round of 16 triumph over Romania to give him four goals in seven matches across all international competitions this year.

None of this is easy, but we're in the third semifinal in four tournaments.\"\n\nALSO READ | Southgate defends reluctance to use his bench\n\nEngland has gone with a four-man backline wherein Marc Geuhi - and Ezri Konsa when Guehi is suspended - has replaced an injured Harry Maguire as centre-back, while Keiran Trippier has played out of position, on the left, despite being a conventional right-sided player.\n\nBut England has had silver linings in Jude Bellingham and Bukayo Saka, who, despite playing far from their best in the tournament, have come up with goals when it mattered the most.\n\nSaka scored the equaliser in the second-half and then converted the spot kick in the shootout against Switzerland. Among England players, he ranks third, after Kieran Trippier and Phil Foden in key passes and expected assists, and the only one among them to have a goal to his name in this Euro.\n\nEngland's Bukayo Saka scores his side's opening goal during a quarterfinal match against Switzerland. | Photo Credit: AP\n\nEngland's Bukayo Saka scores his side's opening goal during a quarterfinal match against Switzerland. | Photo Credit: AP\n\nBellingham, on the other hand, has played a fox-in-the-box to an attacking midfielder in England's five games so far, equalising through a jaw-dropping bicycle kick against Slovakia in the round of 16.\n\nThe combination of Bellingham, Declan Rice and Kobbie Mainoo has fallen in place well for Southgate, but lack of experience -- Mainoo is 19 and has a senior team experience of just 32 games for club and country -- in the holding midfielder role might continue to be an issue for England.\n\nDon't change what's not broken\n\nRonald Koeman has tried a 4-3-3 formation in the Group stages but has later shifted to a 4-2-3-1 shape, which he has stuck in three games in a row now.\n\nMoreover, the Netherlands had struggled for consistency earlier in the tournament, losing, drawing and winning a match each in the Group stage.\n\nBut Koeman's selection of boys in the starting line-up since has given favourable results, with smooth sailing in the knockouts, beating Romania and Turkiye, respectively. Against the Three Lions, sticking with the same policy might make the day for the Dutch in Germany.\n\nIn attack, while Memphis Depay is expected to be the No. 9, the usual suspect for goals would be Cody Gakpo.\n\nNetherlands' forward Cody Gakpo (R) shoots to goal past Turkey's defender Ferdi Kadioglu. | Photo Credit: AFP\n\nNetherlands' forward Cody Gakpo (R) shoots to goal past Turkey's defender Ferdi Kadioglu. | Photo Credit: AFP\n\nAmong Netherlands players, the Liverpool forward leads the charts for progressive carries (22), expected assists (1.8), shots on target (8) and goal contributions (4).\n\nGakpo's trajectory along the left, after receiving the ball from Xavi Simons or Tijjani Reijnders will be the most common avenue of attack for the Oranje, with the duel between Gakpo and Walker, vis-a-vis, Manchester City versus Liverpool being one of the most significant battles on the field.\n\nAt just 21, Simons has been the heart of Netherlands' attacking build-up, assisting three goals and providing 11 key passes, the joint-highest with Gakpo.\n\nALSO READ | Stumbling England and Netherlands get shot at redemption\n\nWith Frenkie de Jong - who usually plays as a No. 8 - ruled out of the tournament with injury and Davy Klaasen - a No. 10 - out of Koeman's plans, Simons has taken up the role of an attacking midfielder adeptly, combining with Jerdy Schouten and Reijnders in the middle of the park.\n\nDonyell Malen has found the net twice for the Oranje, his pace later in the game - as an impact substitute - would be a solution Koeman might explore, as was the case against Romania. Taking the pitch in the second half to replace Steven Bergwijn, he scored a brace to help his side win the game 3-0.\n\nBart Verbruggen, the youngest Dutch goalkeeper in Euros, has had a mixed tournament, with two clean sheets and 15 saves so far.\n\nBut the 21-year-old will need to be more careful during the set-pieces as well as low shots - two of England's most potent weapons for attack in this tournament so far.\n\nExpected line-ups: Netherlands (4-2-3-1): Verbruggen - Dumfries, De Vrij, Van Dijk, Ake - Schouten, Reijnders - Bergwijn, Simons, Gakpo - Depay England (4-2-3-1):

Netherlands were European Champions in 1988, England have never won this title but are looking to return to the final after achieving that feat in 2021.\n\nNetherlands have had the smoothest route of any nation into the last four. They have not required extra time in their knockout rounds to see off Romania and Turkey and that may well benefit them coming through into this semi-final. They also have the tournament's top scorer in Cody Gakpo in their ranks.\n\nEngland have progressed to the semi-finals for the third major tournament in four attempts. This is a run of success at the top level that is unprecedented for England, and yet Gareth Southgate and his team are still criticised for their style and lack of creativity. However, can they reach back-to-back Euro finals, a rare achievement indeed.\n\nMemphis Depay certainly packed his shooting boots for his trip to Germany. He averages over 4 shots per match at the moment for the Netherlands so it feels like a safe bet to expect Depay to hit at least two shots during the 90 minutes. Kobbie Mainoo has taken at least one shot in every England start that he has made so far, he has hit two in each of the knockout matches in Euro 2024.\n\nDumfries is by far the most regular fouler for the Netherlands and he does not need to be afraid of serving a suspension for the final given the rules on suspension in this tournament. He has a track record of getting bookings, and even sendings off for the Netherlands in major tournaments. Dumfries could have a big job on his hands as well if Luke Shaw is fit enough to start on the left for England.\n\nThe main outlet for progress in terms of England's attacking output, Bukayo Saka rescued the Three Lions in the last match against Switzerland and he is likely to be a key man in this tie as well. It must be tempting for Gareth Southgate to switch Saka to the left to perhaps take advantage of Dumfries' tendencies to concentrate on his attacking rather than defending, but it would be a surprise to see that change here, especially as he has looked so dangerous cutting inside onto his stronger left foot.\n\nThe PSG forward is a dangerous player because he is very difficult to pick up. He is given the licence to float around in the spaces between midfield and attack to pick up the ball and create chaos. Simons isn't without goalscoring pedigree either having had excellent seasons in Netherlands with PSV and Germany with RB Leipzig.

If I can't enjoy that moment the whole thing is a waste of time,\" Southgate said of his post-match dance in front of the England fans.\n\n\"I took this job to try and improve English football.

The two teams each needed just a point to qualify for the knockout stages but it was the Three Lions who roared into the quarter-finals with a scintillating performance.\n\nTerry Venables led England to a 4-1 thrashing of the Oranje under the famous arch, the country's biggest-ever win in a European Championship at that time, to raise real optimism of success on home soil for the host nation.\n\nAhead of their latest showdown, we've remembered the England XI that thrashed the Dutch in 1996.\n\nDavid Seaman had to be patient for his chance with England but by Euro '96 was the established number one for the Three Lions. He played every minute of the tournament and saved a spot-kick from Gary McAllister in the group-stage win over Scotland before a stop from Miguel \u00c1ngel Nadal helped England eliminate Spain via a shootout in the quarter-finals.\n\nSeaman won 75 caps for England before losing his place as first-choice in 2002.\n\nGary Neville made his England debut in 1995 and spent the next decade as an automatic selection at right-back.\n\nThe 1995-96 season had been a breakthrough campaign for Neville at club level as Manchester United won a domestic double before he helped England reach the semi-finals of Euro '96 on home soil.\n\nTony Adams recovered from a series of setbacks with England to captain the Three Lions at Euro '96. The centre-back had endured a difficult Euro '88 as England went out in the group stage, before missing the following three tournaments due to omission, injury and England's failure to qualify.\n\nHe retired from international football in 2000, having scored five times in 66 appearances for the Three Lions.\n\nThe now-England manager partnered Adams in central defence for the tournament. Having only debuted in December 1995, Southgate featured in every minute of England's campaign at Euro '96. In the semi-final, Southgate's missed penalty saw England lose to Germany at Wembley.\n\nStuart Pearce rose from non-league football to make his England debut aged 25 and went on to win 78 caps for the national team.\n\nHe represented the Three Lions at the 1990 World Cup and missed a crucial spot-kick in the semi-final shootout defeat to Germany, before earning redemption with a converted kick as England beat Spain at Euro '96. His outpour of emotion after scoring his penalty is one of the most memorable images of England's tournament.\n\nPart of Terry Venables' refresh of the England squad after his appointment, Anderton became a regular after his debut in 1994. Venables showed faith in the winger after he missed the majority of the 1995-96 season through injury, including the Spurs star who scored twice in a pre-tournament friendly and featured in every fixture of Euro '96.\n\nAnderton - who came agonisingly close to scoring a Golden Goal after hitting the post against Germany in the semi-finals - won 30 caps for the Three Lions but saw his role reduced due to injuries and the emergence of David Beckham.\n\nPaul Gascoigne became a household name after helping England to the 1990 World Cup semi-finals, with his tears after being booked in the defeat to Germany - a caution that would have ruled him out of the final - indelible in the memory of England fans.\n\nGascoigne recaptured his finest form at Euro '96 after some difficult seasons, including that wonder goal against Scotland and an influential role in two goals during the dismantling of the Dutch. Arguably England's greatest-ever natural talent.\n\nPaul Ince made history after becoming England's first-ever black captain in 1992 and the mid-nineties were the height of his tour-de-force midfield performances. Ince had been named in the PFA Team of the Year in three straight seasons from 1993 to 1995, as Manchester United dominated the early Premier League, before joining Inter Milan.\n\nAt Euro '96, he was the box-to-box ball-winner to complement Gascogine's craft and won the penalty from which England opened the scoring against the Netherlands.\n\nWhat is Paul Ince's legacy? Why England's first black captain is football's forgotten man\n\nSteve McManaman was curiously overlooked by England for much of his career, despite a dearth of left-sided options for the Three Lions. He won 37 caps and scored three goals, featuring in three major tournaments.\n\nHe was devastating in the 4-1 win over the Netherlands and involved in England's first three goals of the game. At club level, McManaman became one of England's greatest exports after winning two Champions League trophies and two La Liga titles with Real Madrid, following his move from Liverpool.\n\nOne half of England's 'SAS' partnership in attack, Teddy Sheringham scored twice in the defeat of the Dutch in a career-best game in an England shirt. Often viewed as the perfect foil for an out-and-out goalscorer in attack, Sheringham scored 11 times in 51 caps for the Three Lions.\n\nHe spent the bulk of his club career at Millwall and Tottenham, though had his greatest success at Manchester United. Sheringham scored in the FA Cup and Champions League finals as United won the treble in 1998-99 and was named PFA Player of the Year in 2000-01.\n\nAlan Shearer's place in the England side was being doubted heading into Euro '96, despite a Golden-Boot winning season at Blackburn Rovers.\n\nHe emphatically answered question marks over his place by ending a 21-month goal drought for England with five goals to win the tournament's Golden Boot. His return included a double to down the Dutch at Wembley, part of an overall haul of 30 goals in 63 appearances for the Three Lions. One of the greatest goalscorers England have produced.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The first semi-final takes place on Tuesday night when Spain - Euro 2024's standout team - take on an out of sorts Les Bleus in Munich.\n\nThen it's all eyes on Dortmund as England go in search of reaching another major tournament final. Gareth Southgate's side suffered penalty heartache in the last edition of the competition in 2021 and are looking to go one better this time around.\n\nBut like France, England have flattered to deceive during their time in Germany, with the Dutch set to provide the sternest test of their campaign so far. The Three Lions will be roared on by millions at home and abroad, but are expected to be heavily outnumbered in the city itself on Wednesday night.\n\nDutch fans have a significantly shorter journey to make and they are anticipated to arrive in their thousands. UEFA have also given them a timely pre-match boost by handing them the stand which houses Borussia Dortmund's fabled 'Yellow Wall' inside Signal Iduna Park.\n\nIf England are to go all the way, it may require another nerve-jangling penalty shootout. They were a perfect five for five against Switzerland, with Jordan Pickford making his customary save. But that hasn't stopped Southgate banning his players from giving away anything about their spot-kick routines should they be needed again.\n\nAhead of two nights of drama, Mirror Football will have all the latest news from the camps, and then updates from the games themselves...\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp communityand receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

But in this tournament, players have also been blocked from talking about shootouts in a clear attempt to stop it from becoming too much of an obsession.\n\nEngland stars Jordan Pickford, Marc Guehi and Ezri Konsa have all been stopped from answering questions on penalties during this tournament.\n\n08:52KEY EVENTEngland handed early disadvantage for Netherlands clash\n\nAfter a toss of the coin helped England over the line against Switzerland, the end in which their supporters will be housed is again a topic of conversation.\n\nKyle Walker winning the toss before Saturday's shootout meant that the spot-kicks were taken in front of England's vociferous support. The players admitted that was a major advantage, with Manuel Akanji's failure the difference between the two sides.\n\nBut in Dortmund, Netherlands will feel like they have struck an early blow after UEFA confirmed they would make up the 'Orange Wall' on Wednesday night.\n\nDutch fans, who are expected to massively outnumber England supporters, will be behind the goal Borussia Dortmund's famous Yellow Wall sit. That will allow them to make a huge noise, with the anticipation it will sound much more like Amsterdam than London.\n\n08:48Simon MullockKylian Mbappe 'told to play through pain barrier'\n\nDidier Deschamps has told Kylian Mbappe that he will have to play through the pain barrier if France are going to reach the Euro final.\n\nDeschamps revealed that his most potent forward is struggling to come to terms with having to wear a mask to protect the nose he broke in the opening game against Austria three weeks ago.\n\nMbappe also admitted he asked to come off during the quarter-final penalty shoot-out victory over Portugal because he was shattered - but the France coach has urged the Real Madrid superstar to come to the party as the tournament starts to reach its climax with a semi-final against Spain in Munich.\n\nDeschamps said: \"For Kylian it is a new situation with the mask. He has a field of vision that is modified. It has been a huge shock for him. He has had to get used to that because he will need to wear the mask for the next few weeks or even months.\n\n08:47Ben HusbandMorning and welcome\n\nThanks for joining us....how are the nerves?\n\nThe Euro 2024 semi-finals get underway on Tuesday night, with Spain taking on France in Munich.\n\nThen it's the small matter of England playing Netherlands in Dortmund for a place in

But after England kept their nerve from the penalty spot during a quarter-final shootout against the Swiss, they're potentially 180 minutes away from lifting their first trophy since 1966.\n\nThe Dutch firstly stand in their way, having came from behind to beat Turkey 2-1 on Saturday. That followed up their impressive 3-0 win against Romania in the round-of-16, although they only finished second in their group.\n\nThe other semi-final sees France take on red-hot Spain, who dumped hosts Germany out with an extra-time win on Friday. A few hours later, the French needed penalties to beat Portugal after a goalless draw.\n\nAhead of the semi-finals, the Grosvenor Sport Supercomputer has calculated each team's chances of winning the tournament next Sunday - with England only third favourites. The Three Lions have been given just a 24.4 per cent chance of lifting the trophy.\n\nThat's more than the Netherlands' 15 per cent chance but behind Spain's 30.2. France, though, have the edge on 30.4 per cent, despite Didier Deschamps' side also being criticised for a lack of excitement and goals.\n\nYour turn! Will England win Euro 2024? Let us know your prediction in the comments section\n\nA positive for England, however, is that they've been given a 58 per cent shot of reaching the final, superior to any other team in the last four. That's likely because France and Spain are so hard to separate.\n\nTo get to Berlin on Sunday, England will need to get stop the Netherlands in their tracks and frustrate the likes of Virgil van Dijk and Cody Gakpo, who've been instrumental to Ronald Koeman's side.\n\n\"For the whole nation it is something special,\" Koeman remarked, with the Netherlands having last reached the semi-finals of a European Championship in 2004. \"We are a small nation and to be part of the semi-finals with England, France and Spain we are really proud to get the opportunity.\"\n\nThe ex-Barcelona manager even has a preferred opponent for the final, saying: \"First of all we need to fight to win the semi-final. It will be a great night on Wednesday between two big nations historically. If we play the final, my preference is Spain because we had France in the group stage.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Former England international Stephen Warnock has claimed that the Three Lions' hopes of winning their Euro 2024 semi-final against Netherlands could lie in their ability to \"outrun\" and \"overpower\" their opponents in midfield.\n\nA place in Sunday's final against Spain is at stake for both England and Netherlands ahead of their showdown in Dortmund, with England aiming to reach a second successive Euros final and Netherlands attempting to make the showpiece event for the first time since winning the trophy in 1988.\n\nBoth teams have been criticised en route to the last four, with England in particular flattering to deceive throughout the tournament and not winning a single match inside 90 minutes since their opener against Serbia.\n\nGareth Southgate's side drew with Denmark and Slovenia in their other two group games, before requiring a dramatic late Jude Bellingham equaliser on their way to beating Slovakia in extra time in the last 16, and another late goal in Saturday's eventual penalty shootout triumph over Switzerland.\n\nBy contrast, Netherlands have recorded victories over Poland, Romania and Turkey as well as a draw with France, but did finish third in Group D behind Austria and France following a 3-2 defeat to the former in their final group game.\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\n\"It could be quite boring - a game of chess\"\n\nLike England, Netherlands' tactics have been questioned during the tournament for being overly negative, particularly in their goalless draw with France during the group stages.\n\nWith England having sometimes struggled to break down teams who sit back and defend during this summer's tournament, Warnock is not overly optimistic that the second semi-final will prove to be as absorbing and entertaining as Spain's win over France on Tuesday night.\n\n\"It could be quite boring, a game of chess almost where it's quite slow and thought out. Neither team will want to leave themselves a little bit light at the back because they'll be fearful of pace on the counter-attack,\" Warnock told Sports Mole.\n\n\"They'll be fearful of going behind, because what we know is that both teams are capable of shutting up shop if they if they need to and sitting deep and making the game a little bit ugly.\n\n\"That's where you're going to find that maybe it might be an individual piece of brilliance that's going to unlock this game. Hopefully it's from our side.\"\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nMidfield could be key to England beating Netherlands\n\nEngland have relied on such individual pieces of brilliance to rescue them in both knockout games so far - namely Bellingham's bicycle kick against Slovakia and Bukayo Saka's equaliser against Switzerland - and, on paper at least, boast a superior squad of players to that of Netherlands.\n\nHowever, Ronald Koeman's side contains world-class players of their own, while they also have the tournament's joint top-scorer in Liverpool forward Cody Gakpo.\n\n\"The Dutch have got good players, but they've also got weaknesses as well, and you've got to try and take advantage of those weaknesses,\" former Liverpool man Warnock told Sports Mole.\n\n\"I don't think they're particularly blessed down the right back position if I'm being honest. They've tried to change that position a couple of times now and I think in midfield, they're a good footballing team but I think you can outrun them.\n\n\"You can overpower them in midfield as well. But they'll probably be looking at England's vulnerabilities and saying that they can cause England a lot of problems as well.\"\n\nShould England beat Netherlands then it would mark the first time that they have reached successive finals at a single major tournament, having agonisingly lost the Euro 2020 final on penalties against Italy at Wembley.\n\nStephen Warnock was speaking to Sports Mole

The ground is usually home to Borussia Dortmund.\n\nWhat TV channel is it on?\n\nIt will be broadcast live on ITV.\n\nWhat is the latest England news?\n\nNetherlands have been handed a potential advantage for their Euro 2024 semi-final against England in Dortmund, with the Westfalenstadion's Yellow Wall set to turn orange for the game.\n\nThe 25,000-capacity southern terrace of Borussia Dortmund's home ground is one of the most famous stands in world football and rivals Anfield's equally iconic Kop for the atmosphere fans there generate.\n\nEurope's largest freestanding grandstand looks poised to become a sea of orange rather than white on Wednesday thanks to the Netherlands being notionally designated the home team for the fixture.\n\nThat has seen Uefa hand the Dutch Football Association (KNVB) 8,000 tickets in the stand for its supporters, with its English counterpart given tickets at the opposite end of the ground.\n\nAlthough England fans could still get their hands on many of the remaining seats in the southern terrace, they are likely to be competing against other Dutch supporters, who are expected to dominate that section of the stadium.\n\nDortmund is staging the joint most matches at Euro 2024, with Wednesday's the sixth and last to be played there.\n\nThe previous five have all seen the notional home team take over the southern terrace, with Turkey twice turning it into a Red Wall during the group stages. It was predominantly blue for Italy and France's group games there, while it became white for Germany's dramatic last-16 victory over Denmark. Indeed, the stadium has become something of a fortress for the Germans down the years.\n\nThe fortunes of other teams whose fans have colonised the southern stand at Euro 2024 have been decidedly mixed. Turkey lost against Portugal there before beating Georgia, Italy struggled to see off Albania, and France were held 1-1 by Poland.\n\nHow big a part any Orange Wall will play on Wednesday, therefore, remains to be seen.\n\nWhat is the latest Netherlands news?\n\nNetherlands' preparations for their European Championship semi-final against England have been thrown into disarray after their train journey to Dortmund was caught up in the latest travel chaos to engulf the tournament.\n\nRonald Koeman's team were forced to cancel their planned pre-match press conference at the Westfalenstadion because of \"a blockage on the track\" between their Wolfsburg headquarters and the venue for Wednesday night's game.\n\nThe Dutch resorted to arranging a Tuesday night flight to Dortmund and were \"looking for other options\" in respect of their obligation to speak to the media before their biggest match since the 2014 World Cup.\n\nThey trained earlier in the day at their Wolfsburg base and Koeman and Manchester City defender Nathan Ake had been due to speak at a press conference at 7.45pm local time.\n\nTelegraph Sport chronicled at the start of Euro 2024 how fans planning to travel by train at this summer's tournament were being warned to expect major delays.\n\nHaving once put Britain's creaking railways to shame, Germany's own network has been plunged into similar chaos in what is an embarrassing blow to the country's reputation for efficiency.\n\nDetleff Neuss, chair of Germany's rail passenger lobby group Pro Bahn, warned such a mass influx would simply lead to \"more problems with delayed trains and trains cancelled\".\n\nNeuss told Telegraph Sport: \"I would say if you want to visit a football game, you take [a train] one or two trains before [the scheduled train] to be on time.\"\n\nAdmitting Germany's railways had become a source of national embarrassment, he added: \"Many years ago, the German train system was a very good system. But, just now, the German train system is very bad.\"\n\nNeuss's forecast immediately proved prophetic for England fans caught up in the travel chaos that left many stranded in Gelsenkirchen and facing \"dangerous levels of overcrowding\" after their opening game against Serbia.\n\nSo bad have the railways been that the Deutsche Bahn board member responsible for long-distance travel, Michael Peterson, was eventually forced to issue an apology in Germany's top-selling newspaper.\n\n\"We understand the dissatisfaction and criticism from fans,\" Peterson told Bild. \"Deutsche Bahn is not currently offering the quality that everyone deserves. But, at the same time, we are doing everything possible to bring passengers reliably to their destinations.\"\n\nHow do I buy England tickets?\n\nFans can apply for tickets for any team via the Uefa Euro 2024 ticket portal.\n\nEngland's route to the semi-finals\n\nEngland narrowly beat Serbia 1-0 in their opening match of the group stage, thanks to Jude Bellingham's early header, and then drew with Denmark with a performance that drew plenty of criticism. Performance-wise, the 0-0 draw with Slovenia was little better.\n\nJune 16: England 1 Serbia 0June 20: England 1 Denmark 1June 25: England 0 Slovenia 0\n\nIn the first knockout match, against Slovakia, England were indebted to Kane's close-range header which won the game after Bellingham scored an overhead kick to equalise little more than a minute before the final whistle.\n\nJune 31: England 2 Slovakia 1 (AET)\n\nIn the quarter-finals, Trent Alexander-Arnold slammed home the decisive kick to give them a shoot-out victory over Switzerland after the teams had drawn 1-1 after extra time.\n\nJuly 6: England 1 Switzerland 1 (Eng win 5-3 on pens) What are the latest odds?

EUROS DAILY: Have England really been playing with fear at Euro 2024?\n\nSo far for England at Euro 2024, it's been success without reassurance, possession without conviction and - bottom line - wins without playing well.\n\nOn Wednesday they will face their toughest opponents yet. It's crunch time, no second chances, and a European final awaits.\n\nThey have been here before. Three semi-finals in four tournaments for Gareth Southgate, the most successful Three Lions boss since Sir Alf Ramsey, and he knows what it's about.\n\nBut so have, and do, their opponents. Netherlands are looking to tee up a repeat of the 2010 World Cup final against Spain on Sunday, while they've had a couple more top four finishes along the way.\n\nThey only need to beat England to get there. It won't be regulation - it will be tough - but former Manchester United coach Rene Meulensteen, from a village called Beugen in North Brabant, Netherlands, has explained how they can get the job done.\n\nRene Meulensteen has explained how the Netherlands can get the better of Gareth Southgate (pictured) and England tonight\n\nVirgil van Dijk and Co have impressed in their run to the semi-finals against the Three Lions\n\nFormer Manchester United coach Meulensteen (right) has explained how his nation can win the ball high up the pitch\n\nPodcast All episodes LISTEN: Southgate only England manager to be criticised whilst winning PODCAST: The REAL reason England through despite playing badly PODCAST: 'Just ONE good performance' could change England's fortunes PODCAST: Are the England team buying into Southgate's style of play?

Play on Apple Spotify\n\n'I think they'll try to dominate possession, try to get hold of the ball and move it around,' he says, speaking exclusively to Mail Sport on behalf of Free Bets. 'When you get possession but lack the purpose of trying to open the opposition up, you just keep shifting the ball for sake of it and give it away.\n\nREAD MOREEXCLUSIVE Have England been playing with fear at Euro 2024 and can they shake it off for Netherlands semi-final showdown?\n\n'You can look at the possession stats, but if nothing came of it, you got nowhere. So, I really hope that Netherlands use that possession constructively, to make sure we move it well, quickly and through the lines, asking questions of England.\n\n'Every team that has gone more on the front foot and moved to press England, they ended up making them give the ball up easily and quickly, allowing the opposition all the opportunity to create chances. That's what I want Netherlands to do.'\n\nNetherlands have perhaps the most star power that England have come up against so far. Whether it's Memphis Depay or Xavi Simons, the talent is there, even if they've not fully shown it yet.\n\nAt the other and of the pitch is captain Virgil van Dijk. A winner, a beast of a defender who has had success against Harry Kane in the past, and England will know as much as anyone what he's about.\n\nAnd then there's Cody Gakpo. Netherlands' star man in Germany, scoring three goals and leading the race for the Golden Boot from the left side of attack.\n\nMeulensteen, now assistant coach of Australia, has also given his verdict on star man Cody Gakpo\n\nGakpo (right) has been Netherlands' best player in Germany and is in the running for the Golden Boot\n\nEngland, meanwhile, are targeting their second final in as many European Championship tournaments\n\nIt will likely be Bukayo Saka and Kyle Walker on the right side for England, tasked with defending him. Potentially the most important thing in the game.\n\n'He's been good, played with a lot of confidence. Lively,' Meulensteen, now assistant at Australia's men's team, says in his assessment of his nation's star man. 'He's a little bit of what we had with Arjen Robben so many years ago, coming in on the left foot and putting it in the top corner. Cody is the exact same coming off the right.\n\n'The only problem is the Turkish team dealt with that really well by doubling up on him, so every time he came inside there was another player to stop that space, so he never had a chance to shoot.\n\n'You need to counterattack that by having overlapping runs, so he has an option to play somebody in with a reverse pass. Cody against Kyle Walker will be difficult.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren\u00e9_Meulensteen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ren\u00e9 Meulensteen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alf_Ramsey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alf Ramsey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil_van_Dijk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virgil van Dijk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Brabant", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Brabant"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Brabant"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cody_Gakpo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cody Gakpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristiano_Ronaldo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cristiano Ronaldo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavi_Simons", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xavi Simons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis_Depay", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Memphis Depay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arjen_Robben", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arjen Robben"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Movies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/07/10/15/87163305-0-image-m-12_1720623567986.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712618", "eventUri": "eng-9712618", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

Harry Kane-led the Three Lions finished the group stage as the table toppers with a win and two draws and accumulated 5 points to qualify for knockout stage.\n\nIn the round of 16, England defeated Slovakia 2-1 to qualify for the quarterfinal, where they defeated Switzerland 5-3 in a penalty shootout following 1-1 draw in regular and extra time and booked their spot for the semifinal.\n\nThe Netherlands, on the other hand, have had a good campaign in the ongoing Euro championship. In the group stage, the Dutch side finished third with a win, a draw and a defeat and booked their spot for the knockout. In the pre-quarterfinals, Virgil van Dijk-led side dominated Romania with 3-0 win and qualified for the quarterfinal.\n\nIn the quarterfinal, the Netherlands managed to overcome Turkey challenge with 2-1 win to book their spot for the semifinal.\n\nAs the Euro 2024 semifinal clash between England and Netherlands is expected to grab the eyeballs, let's keep eye on the key players to watch out for in epic battle in Dortmund.\n\nEngland skipper Harry Kane has not been in his best form in the Euro 2024 thus far as he has been struggling to find the back of the net consistently. Kane is the joint-second leading goalscorer in the tournament with 2 goals so far, but neither of them has been enough to showcase his scoring ability. However, Kane often step up in crucial games when he is needed the most by the team. England skipper's contribution is vital for the Three Lions to qualify for the final.\n\n2. Cody Gakpo\n\nThe 25-year-old Dutch football star Cody Gakpo has been impressive in the ongoing Euro 2024. Gakpo has been one of the most instrumental players in the Netherlands' attack. Cody Gakpo is a versatile player as he can play both as a winger and forward, giving a balance to the team. The youngster is the joint-leading goalscorer in the tournament with three goals and he is expected to play a crucial role for Netherlands in the semifinals.\n\n3. Jude Bellingham\n\nAnother player that one should definitely keep an eye on is the 21-year-old Jude Bellingham who has been one of the mainstays of England's midfield in the Euro 2024. His ability to score the goal at any situation and extraordinary work rate have made him an asset for Harry Kane-led side. Bellingham is currently joint second-leading scorer of the tournament with 2 goals.

Virgil van Dijk\n\nNetherlands Virgal van Dijk has been brilliantly leading the team in the Euro 2024. Under his leadership, the Dutch side performed well in the pre-quarterfinals and quarterfinal against Romania and Turkey, respectively.

Against Slovenia, it trailed for roughly 70 minutes and looked destined for a Round of 16 exit before Jude Bellingham threw his country a lifeline via a bicycle kick goal deep into stoppage time.\n\nIn Saturday's quarterfinal against Switzerland, the Three Lions fell behind 75 minutes in, got a Bukayo Saka equalizer a few minutes later before panic truly set in, and ultimately survived on penalty kicks. They now play the Netherlands in Dortmund on Wednesday (3 p.m. ET, FOX), cast in a favorite's role again, according to betting odds on top sportsbook sites.\n\nOn paper, the Dutch will be England's toughest opponent to date in Euro 2024, ranked seventh in the FIFA rankings. England is fifth. The teams most recently played in the semifinals of the UEFA Nations League in 2019 with the Netherlands winning 3-1 in extra time. England last won 1-0 in an Amsterdam-based friendly in '18. Over 22 all-time meetings, L'Orange has won seven, lost six and there have been nine draws.\n\nHere are live UEFA Euro 2024 betting odds for the Netherlands vs. England semifinal match at top-rated US sportsbooks.\n\nThe Netherlands is +105 to advance to the final, while the English are -135 to reach the championship round.\n\nAlso check: Top sports betting promos\n\nSaka was employed at left wingback by coach Gareth Southgate against the Swiss, while Ezri Konsa started for suspended defender Marc Guehi. Between Bellingham, Phil Foden and Kobbie Mainoo, there's plenty of skill and creativity in midfield hoping to set striker Harry Kane up in front of goal, but this group has rarely pushed forward and taken advantage of their talent.\n\nGuehi had a great run through the first four matches, so Southgate has a decision to make along his backline between him and Konsa. Veteran Kieran Trippier started ahead of Trent Alexander-Arnold at right wingback, but that could change here.\n\nThe Dutch have had a rollercoaster ride of a Euros, too, losing to Austria 3-2 to close out Group D play after playing France to a goalless draw. They rallied past Poland 2-1 in their opener and stared down a second-half deficit against Turkey in the quarterfinals, also posting a 2-1 win. Its most impressive effort came in a 3-0 Round of 16 rout of Romania in which sub Donyell Malen scored twice in a 10-minute stretch to put the match away.\n\nLiverpool striker Cody Gakpo has a team-high three goals. Head coach Ronald Koeman is likely to stay with Memphis Depay as Gakpo's strike partner, but has options in Malen and Wout Weghorst.\n\nThe Dutch midfield has been solid despite the absence of Frenkie de Jong, who is missing the tourney due to a nasty ankle injury, and Teun Koopmeiners, due to a muscle injury. Will this be when their absences catch up to the Netherlands?\n\nHere is a sampling of Netherlands vs. England prop bets from FanDuel Sportsbook.\n\nGiven the respect both teams have for the offensive arsenal of the other, we could see the conservative approach that has frustrated fans play out to result in a goalless first half. That's priced at +130, while 1-0 pays +410. Correctly backing either team to advance via penalty kicks pays +800.\n\nKane is deemed the most likely goal scorer (), while Depay () is the favorite to score for the Dutch. Given the role he's played as a playmaker, Depay to score or assist at +200 could work out to double your investment. Other goal-scoring options to consider include the Netherlands' Malen (), Steven Bergwijn () and Xavi Simons (), as well as England's Foden (), Saka () and Bellingham ().\n\nThe Dutch are in their first Euro semi in 20 years, while England were runners-up three years ago and have routinely gone deep into tournaments lately. Between the Netherlands being so young in midfield, the Three Lions having already stared down elimination to create a \"team of destiny\" feel and Bellingham having a magical 2024 with Real Madrid and his run with the National Team, expect him to make the difference as England reaches a second straight European Championship final.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news",

No more Trent in midfield; few expected this to work and many forecast it to be a disaster. Shaw's come in to add balance; But Southgate chose to only bring one left-back. Mainoo has done well in the middle; well he was the third midfield pairing Southgate tried (and some still push to try a fourth). Konsa and Guehi have been brilliant; Ah well, Southgate didn't have a choice and actually if he'd benched Maguire a half century earlier they could have proved themselves in the qualifiers....\n\nEngland are better, but all the positives have been diluted.\n\nThen you get to the questions about the side that are still up for debate, and everyone seems to have wildly different opinions and in that situation Gareth can't make everyone happy, including one big decision.\n\nFor my two cents, I can entirely understand why Gordon has barely played. There's the rumours about this headspace, but outside of hearsay there is the very salient context of our absentee captain. Without starting Toney or Watkins, I can't really see the point of Gordon on the field. He'll skin a full back with ease, but so what; to what end? Saka has been wonderful and he has at no point been able to find our captain in five games; he's ether actively hiding from the pass like a nervous trialist, or near his own corner flag setting up the opposition (how didn't that cause more column inches?!).\n\nYe gods the only players who have set up our captain are a defender who mis-controlled a clearance, and Ivan Toney who Kane is keeping out of the side. Beyond that, there was the utterly free header he couldn't even get on target against Slovakia, or the header sent straight at the keeper against Serbia. He may not create any opportunities on his own, and his dropping deep actively hinders Foden and Bellingham, and his runs have made it impossible for him to get to Saka and Mainoo cut-backs, but give him a free chance straight in front of goal and.... he has at-best a 50/50 record, which is worse than the xG for those chances.\n\nIn this situation I can't see how Southgate wins. There are still pundits who advocate starting Kane. The squad players have given bland platitudes to the papers, but in terms of the starting 11's active decisions on the pitch, and as is both quantitively and qualitatively been proven, they are entirely ignoring and passing around the useless maypole and I agree with their assessment.\n\nIn using a striker so hopelessly out of form, I can't see how it's possible for our to have attractive play rather than sterile domination. In playing without any presence in the box I can't see the point in daring wing-play. There are genuinely interesting tactical conversations to whether playing Walker to make runs outside, or Trent to make runs inside, is the better option - but if the end result is no-one in the box it's all a bit pointless.\n\nWhen there were rumours about 3 at the back, I'd hoped for a 352 and a partner for Kane, but that never happened.\n\nNo subs ahead of the 60th minute: so what if your captain is playing pointless hollywood balls from the full-back position. Football is a fairly simple game, and outside of Barca playing the world's best ever player as a false nine, victory tends to go to the side that's better in both boxes.\n\nWe're seemingly quite well structured in one, and entirely missing in the other. In that situation, penalties is the likely positive outcome and I can't really see how Gareth can fix that without making a decision the pundits are advocating he doesn't make.\n\nTom G\n\nMORE ON ENGLAND FROM F365:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 No Kane or Foden in England teams picked to play the Netherlands\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Eusebio, penalties, Germans, Southgate: ranking England's six previous major tournament semi-finals\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Ranked: All of Gareth Southgate's England subs at Euro 2024, from pointless to actually good\n\nEngland's grass-roots revolution should have reaped more\n\nIt's strange how little discourse can be found in this country from paid journalists to offer perhaps a tad more insightful nuance to the pro-Southgate argument that Jonny Nic's latest article presents - namely that Southgate is doing a great job because his record with England in recent tournament so good compared with England's overall history.\n\nI don't mean just revealing the favourable draws Southgate has been handed during his tenure. But also the surrounding circumstances within the England national team set up that coincided with his appointment. In 2010, the FA systemically restructured grass roots football, and has since led to a period of English youth team success never seen before in England's history. It began bearing fruit in 2017 in the form of 7 combined World Cup/Euros/Toulon Tournoi titles across age groups since then. 2017 also happens to be the year after Southgate took over the senior team.\n\nIt should be obvious why this context is important when looking at Southgate's record. No other England manager in history has presided over a senior team that is being supplied with such a successful conveyor belt of international football experienced players and coaching talent.\n\nIf anyone doubts the benefits of youth team success, just look at France and Spain. Prior to 1998 and 2008 respectively, these nations were similar to England: massive footballing nations with a barren historical record of success. They then reformed their grass roots set up that led to winning youth tournaments before translating into success for their senior sides.\n\nNow, if anyone else has been watching the England youth teams down the years - including the Euro winning team of last year which England won against Spain in a final that Cole Palmer scored the winner - the contrast in the playing style of that team with this Euro 2024 team could not be more stark.\n\nSo, given both the favourable draws AND this rich supply of resources being provided by England youth teams, it seems that the question which paid journalists with all of their insights and knowledge should be asking publicly is: is Southgate's record really that impressive?\n\nAnd also, why hasn't his deeply pragmatic approach to tournaments at least evolved a little bit over the 8 years since he took over, given England have already proven they can go deep in tournaments with less talented squads and also given in that time more players - and presumably coaches - have graduated from the successful England youth teams playing an expansive and dynamic style of football, thus suggesting it's really not necessary to treat every game of football as a war of attrition simply because of England's less than successful pre-2017 history?\n\nMy own opinion is that Southgate is frittering away an opportunity of a lifetime to herald a period of English success because he is incapable of properly leveraging the benefits of this new era provided by England's youth teams, and is paralyzed by the fear of always looking backward at a past that this England team should have moved on from by now - namely an acceptance of getting outplayed as a team by pretty much everyone they come up against, because our record wasn't that good before World Cup 2018.\n\nGreg\n\nThis is England\n\nI get the frustration in England have been playing but don't we always play like this? That top ten England tournament performances list is pretty damning, I don't think we played particularly well in any of those games. Our best performances that I can remember (Other than the 4-1) have ended in defeat (Argentina '98, Brazil '02, France '22 etc).\n\nI think Shearer wrote the other day that this is England, get used to it. I think he is right, maybe this is the FA vision. At least we keep the ball these days and look reasonably tight at the back. Granted we would all rather not have to sit through 110 minutes of football so dull it makes you want to scratch your eyes out but 10 minutes will be played at a faster pace, and will feature a spectacular 'moment'. Maybe thats all we need?\n\nIt might happen but if we don't win, I think I'll be fine with it because we won't have deserved it. If we do (win) it will be because our defence has done its job and someone has stepped up with something special.\n\nWhoever comes in after GS has to keep the spirit of the team, if they can add some dynamism into our game play then great but this is international football, its never going to be harum scarum like the Prem. We have a young team stacked with the kind of players we used to dream of being able to produce so I think the future is bright (not orange, hopefully) whatever the outcome of the next week.\n\nTom\n\nPS. People need to stop banging on about how we have completed penalties though. The only reason we won that was because I switched off.\n\nMore fan mail for John Nicholson\n\nI don't often read John Nicholson's articles and have never felt compelled to write in about one. However, even by John's standards, his defence of Gareth Southgate really is something.\n\nIt's difficult to pinpoint my favourite part. Was it when he attributed the motivation of the growing anti-Southgate narrative to rebellion against the manager's apparent liberalism? Or was it the grossly offensive assertion that Britain standing against Adolf Hitler was due to \"the people's hatred of foreigners telling us what to do\"?\n\nThis article really wasn't about Gareth Southgate, though, it was about John Nicholson. A verbal outpouring of his own insecurities, projected onto the national team manager, conjuring images of Grampa Simpson sitting on the Shelbyville border, rambling about lemons.\n\nBlaming the anti-Southgate rhetoric on little Englanders not wanting a woke manager conveniently forgets the era of \"Southgate you're the one\", sung by waistcoat-wearing England fans. It's an insult to a supportive fanbase who follow the team around the world and just want a manager who can learn from mistakes and coherently organise arguably the most gifted collection of attacking players in international football into a team who look remotely like scoring.\n\nJohn wasn't against those Carling-swilling, Brexit-supporting gammons of England fans in October, when they booed Jordan Henderson for abandoning his principles and going to Saudi Arabia for money. In fact it led to John writing an open letter to Gareth Southgate where he talked about how 'we want to express our disgruntlement'. John was very much on our side and against Gareth then.\n\nFast forward ten months and the fans have expressed their disgruntlement again, however this time it's for purely footballing reasons. It's against the England manager taking zero fit left backs to a major international tournament, playing a right back in midfield instead of a midfielder, sitting back every time we score and winning one of our last six games (after 90 minutes), despite playing nobody higher than 19th in the FIFA world rankings.\n\nThis time John disagrees and therefore the solidarity of 'we want' has shifted into 'you miserable shites'. Charming. It isn't for me to tell John or anybody else to 'stick to football' but his dogged insistence on making absolutely everything to be not about football is so tiring.\n\nStatistics don't tell entire stories and Gareth Southgate's international tournament record certainly does not tell his. His record is good and it isn't his fault that the routes haven't been harder. However, the bottom line is that they were easy and we have gone out to the first serious team we've faced in each of these tournaments, even blowing 1-0 leads against Croatia in 2018 and Italy in 2021. John talks about how previous managers fared worse but they were simply unfortunate enough to encounter our eventual conquerors, like Germany, Brazil, Argentina and Portugal, earlier in tournaments.\n\nI'm a Palace fan and I've been subjected to years of this negative management style under Roy Hodgson. We were gaslit at times into fearing change on the grounds of 'be careful what you wish for'. Yet when we did finally show some courage and brought in Oliver Glasner, every subsequent week made Roy's prehistoric tactics, inability to pick a functional XI and apparent hatred of proactive substitutions look more ridiculous.\n\nEngland can have the same progression. We have some genuinely world-class players in our squad who could have lit up this tournament under different circumstances. The FA must now be similarly brave and try to bring somebody in with fresh ideas.\n\nSo I'm sorry John, Southgate's record isn't enough for me to want him to stay on, or to stop me having an opinion if I think we've played badly, and if that makes me a 'miserable shite', a 'dumb keyboard pundit' or 'in denial of my own empire guilt' in your eyes then so be it.\n\nEd Acteson\n\nMORE ON ENGLAND FROM F365:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 No Kane or Foden in England teams picked to play the Netherlands\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Eusebio, penalties, Germans, Southgate: ranking England's six previous major tournament semi-finals\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Ranked: All of Gareth Southgate's England subs at Euro 2024, from pointless to actually good\n\nAnother Southgate/Hodgson comparison\n\nA lot of good chat in the mailbox about Southgate, but I can't help feel that he's in the mix with a lot of other managers who we thought were doing a good job until their replacement showed that they weren't.\n\nI'm maybe a bit biased as I've been in the \"Southgate isn't good enough\" camp since the Croatia semi, but each passing tournament, the nearly moments leave me with a \"what if\" feeling. He's done a good job, but England now, legitimately, have as good a squad as we've had in ages, and series of kind (ish) draws. I just can't escape feeling what could have happened with a more astute tactician at the helm.\n\nWe've seen countless examples of this over the past few years - Hodgson at Palace, replaced by Glasner and the football improves. Bruce at Newcastle, Gerrard at Villa, Atkins at Southampton... I can't help feel that Southgate is one of those guys.\n\nI hope we manage to do it in the next few days, and I'll be as delighted as anyone, but I do worry that if we fall short and see an upturn in the next cycle we'll be ruing these near misses.\n\nJames, Sussex (Potter would be a great national team manager, very tactically astute)\n\nWhere are those Three Lions?\n\nI don't want to jinx it, but I haven't heard Three Lions a single time through this tournament. Maybe I'm not listening to the right radio stations, but has it reached its natural end? Has it finally ebbed away?\n\nI'm one of those guys who loves this song. It's cheesy as hell and has been played to death in the past, but I love it. It captures what it's like to be an England supporter more than any other song I've ever heard.\n\nIt should be the anthem we sing before every match... Let's face it, our actual national anthem is so bad, we don't even know when we're supposed to come in with the vocals. Let's go with the one that means something.\n\nPhil, Manchester", "source": {"uri": "football365.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Football News -"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

You live for these tournaments, that's where you step up.\"\n\nFollowing the disappointment of a quarter-final exit at the World Cup in Qatar back in 2022, England comfortably qualified for Euro 2024 by finishing top of their group without losing a game.\n\nThe Three Lions were billed among the favourites for the tournament before it kicked off, and that didn't change when Gareth Southgate's 26-man squad announcement threw up some surprises.\n\nPrevious stalwarts from the last few major tournaments - Harry Maguire, Marcus Rashford, Kalvin Phillips and Jack Grealish - were left out entirely, while the then-unfit Luke Shaw was the only recognised left-back picked in the squad.\n\nRegardless, England still headed to Germany boasting a squad that included the best players from three of Europe's top divisions last season.\n\nFew could argue that Southgate didn't come into the tournament with the most exciting trio of attacking players on the continent in Manchester City's Phil Foden, Real Madrid's Jude Bellingham and Bayern Munich's Harry Kane.\n\nBut, despite that, England didn't look anywhere near their free-flowing best in Group C.\n\nGroup stages\n\nWith the previously mentioned trio of attacking players joined by Arsenal star Bukayo Saka in the starting XI, it was felt by many that England would be finding the net regularly.\n\nInstead, they only scored twice - Bellingham's header in the 1-0 win over Serbia to get the tournament started and a goal from Kane in a 1-1 draw with Denmark.\n\nA 0-0 draw with Slovenia ensured the Three Lions came through the group in top spot, but there were underlying worries over England's inability to cut their opponents open.\n\nOf the 24 nations participating in the group stage at Euro 2024, Southgate's side ranking 20th with just 29 shots, while they managed only 53 touches in the opponents' box.\n\nSome fans were at this point calling for Southgate to be replaced as manager mid-tournament, such was the disappointment among supporters at England's lacklustre start to life in Germany.\n\nOn the positive side, England looked solid in defence, conceding just a single goal during their three group games.\n\nThey were also the team with the lowest expected goals against (xGA) score - a metric that calculates the number of goals a team is expected to concede based on the quality of chances their opponents create.\n\nInto the knockouts\n\nAfter making it into the knockout stages, England were fortunate that their side of the draw had an absence of big hitters - Spain, Germany, Portugal and France were all on the other half of the bracket.\n\nStill, Southgate's side had to beat what was in front of them, and in the round of 16 that was Slovakia, ranked the 48th best country in world football ahead of kick-off.\n\nDespite this, England were seconds away from an embarrassing exit in Gelsenkirchen as Slovakia defended a lead they had held since the 25th minute thanks to Ivan Schranz's low finish past Jordan Pickford.\n\nThen came a moment of brilliance from Bellingham who, with an overhead kick in the final minute, sent Marc Guehi's headed flick into the net to spare England's blushes after a woeful performance.\n\nCaptain Harry Kane then emphasised England's new-found superiority with his headed winner, snatching victory from the jaws of defeat and setting up a quarter-final clash with Switzerland.\n\nA change of system beckoned for the last eight, but once again England laboured in the final third. And, once again, they went behind after Breel Embolo scored with 15 minutes remaining.\n\nThis time it was down to Bukayo Saka, not Bellingham, to be the hero, equalising with a fine finish through a crowded box before stepping up to slot home his penalty in the resulting shoot-out.\n\nIt was another performance at this tournament that won't live too long in the memory for England fans, not that Southgate will care.\n\n\"Winning tournaments isn't just about playing well,\" he said at full-time. \"I thought we did play well, but it's not just about that, you have to show all the other attributes to win, but we showed them tonight.\"\n\nSupporters came into Euro 2024 hoping to see England play their way to the final with free-flowing, high-scoring football.\n\nThey haven't managed it, but they are still in the tournament and are just two wins away from lifting a major trophy.", "source": {"uri": "news.sky.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sky News"}, "authors": [],

Southgate was pelted with beer cups after a 0-0 draw against Slovenia in the group stages and has faced a backlash for his perceived negative tactics with a richly-talented squad.\n\n\"I can't deny then when things get as personal as it has that does hurt. I don't think it's normal to have beer thrown at you,\" said Southgate of his detractors.\n\n\"But we're in a third semi-final in four tournaments, and I think we continue to give people fantastic memories.\n\nSo we'll keep grinding, we'll keep fighting, and we'll keep enjoying this journey.\"\n\nSouthgate is expected to stick by that 3-4-2-1 system with Marc Guehi returning from suspension to replace Ezri Konsa.\n\nThe England boss has bristled at suggestions his side ended up on the kind side of the draw, away from France, Spain, Germany and Portugal.\n\nYet, the Dutch can count themselves even more fortunate for their path to the final after finishing third in Group D behind France and Austria.\n\nLiverpool's Cody Gakpo has arguably been the form attacker at the tournament and is the only player to have scored three goals still alive in the competition.\n\nThe Dutch have had to wait 36 years since their own sole major tournament triumph, the last time the Euros were held in Germany.\n\nThat is also the only time they have ever made a European Championship final.", "source": {"uri": "urdupoint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UrduPoint"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southgate,_London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southgate, London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southgate, London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Gu\u00e9hi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marc Gu\u00e9hi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cody_Gakpo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cody Gakpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezri_Konsa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ezri Konsa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Liverpool"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Austria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://photo-cdn.urdupoint.com/images/UrduPoint-English-22.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712618", "eventUri": "eng-9712618", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-03-04", "dateEnd": "-02-01", "textStart": 1455, "textEnd": 1462}], "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

call, contentious ref, Van Dijk in way - England-Netherlands talking points", "body": "The winners will play Spain or France in Sunday's Berlin showpiece.\n\nEngland face the Netherlands in Dortmund on Wednesday evening looking to book a place in back-to-back European Championship finals.\n\nGareth Southgate's side have been heavily criticised for their performances at Euro 2024 but are one game away from Sunday's showpiece in Berlin.\n\nHere, the PA news agency takes a look at some of the key talking points ahead of the meeting with the Dutch.\n\nIt would have been unthinkable before a ball was kicked at the Euros to consider that Harry Kane's place in Southgate's starting XI would be called into question.\n\nCaptain, all-time leading goalscorer and a man who hit the back of the net 44 times in 45 appearances for Bayern Munich last season.\n\nBut the 30-year-old has struggled throughout the tournament and in the the quarter-final win over Switzerland in particular, and has been substituted as many times as he has scored - twice - while Ivan Toney has impressed in his short outings from the bench.\n\nIn all likelihood, Southgate will stick with his talisman for such a big game, but the fact his place is even being speculated about speaks volumes for his summer so far.\n\nLuke Shaw made his long-awaited comeback from injury as he came off the bench against the Swiss, racking up his first minutes since a hamstring problem he suffered at Manchester United in February.\n\nThe 28-year-old had hoped to be available earlier in the competition as Southgate opted to bring just one recognised left-back in his 26-man squad - but a setback delayed his return.\n\nNow though, he insists he is ready to start against the Netherlands on Wednesday night.\n\nIf the Dutch are to down England and reach their first Euros final since 1988, the chances are a couple of Premier League players will have a big say.\n\nLiverpool duo Virgil van Dijk and Cody Gakpo have been crucial in the run to the semi-final for Ronald Koeman's men.\n\nCaptain Van Dijk, who turned 33 on Monday, remains one of the best centre-backs in Europe and will fancy his chances against whoever plays up front for England - while Gakpo is one of four players jointly leading the Golden Boot race having scored three goals in Germany.\n\nSouthgate made the call to switch to a back three against Switzerland and, while the tie was ultimately decided on penalties, England did produce an improved performance.\n\nShaw could now come in to help the balance even more, while Marc Guehi is available after serving a one-match ban.\n\nThe shift, though, has allowed Phil Foden and Jude Bellingham more chance to roam with the pair able to both operate centrally, while Bukayo Saka's turn at right wing-back saw the Arsenal man produce his best football of the tournament so far.\n\nAll in all, it now seems improbable Southgate would abandon the change in system after one game, although - unlike the Swiss - the Netherlands do usually operate with a back four.\n\nFelix Zwayer - a German referee who was banned over his part in a match-fixing scandal - will take charge of the game at Signal Iduna Park.\n\nThe 43-year-old was given a six-month ban by his country's football federation in 2006, having worked as an assistant referee alongside Robert Hoyzer.\n\nBellingham was fined by the German federation after he referenced Zwayer's involvement in that scandal after a defeat for his old club Borussia Dortmund against Bayern Munich in 2021.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the game, Shaw said the England players \"respect UEFA\" in terms of its selection of officials and that they were not concerned by Zwayer's appointment.", "source": {"uri": "irishnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

The squad have done most of the work to get this far. A bit like their successful approach to penalties, there can be a danger of over-preparation.\n\nGareth Southgate is instead intent on doing most of the preparation in meetings, ensuring his players are conscious of the different challenges a competent Netherlands side pose.\n\nThis is the benefit of experience; Southgate has been in more semi-finals than any other England manager. As he prepares for his third at a major tournament, it feels less momentous for their fans, albeit no less invigorating. England just have bigger ambitions now.\n\n\"The great thing is we're not sitting here happy with a semi-final,\" Southgate said. \"We want to go further...\"\n\nThat is one fact amid all these different emotions that shouldn't be forgotten. England are just a match from one of the greatest stages in the game, offering a chance to rectify Euro 2020.\n\nThis is what England have long desired. Southgate even made a point of reminding people of that on the eve of the semi, as he compared the Dutch tournament record to England's. While this is their seventh semi-final, it is the Netherlands' 10th.\n\n\"Our semi-final tally looks a bit healthy now, looks a bit more like what we'd hope an England history would look like,\" Southgate said. \"But there are a lot of nations who have won the European Championship and we haven't - and we want to try and correct that balance.\"\n\nSouthgate stressed his team have constantly managed to \"break new ground\", be that winning big games away, triumphing in shoot-outs and, of course, regularly getting far in tournaments.\n\n\"We've never been to a final outside our own shores. These are opportunities to make a difference and that's how we have to look at it. We don't want to be burdened by what's happened before.\"\n\nIf we're looking to the past, the last meeting between these two teams in a major championship weighs over this and not just for how past results inform the psychology of a game. There were also the specifics of what happened and how they relate to now.\n\nThat match was in June 1996, when England had managed to come so far through a highly anticipated European Championships with some moments of individual inspiration but also so much inertia. They then stepped out against the Netherlands and put in one of the great tournament displays.\n\nThe late Terry Venables described that 4-1 win as \"perfection\" and his \"most thrilling experience in football\"; all the more satisfying for how it represented \"the culmination of two-and-a-half years of preparation\".\n\nSouthgate's work goes back much further, seven years. This tournament has been viewed as potentially his moment of deliverance when it could all come together. It's difficult not to feel that prospect still being dependent on the performance level finally rising; to putting in a properly convincing display - a spectacle.\n\nThe identity of the opposition and the resonance of the fixture only add to that, especially with how the \"grind\" of England's progress through Euro 2024 - to use Southgate's own words - has so strengthened resolve. The English hope it can bring the team to the point where the actual collective can finally reflect the great ability of the players.\n\nEngland's games have instead been absorbing for entirely different reasons. They have been psychodramas rather than spectacles as if the players had to confront many internal and external challenges as much as the opposition.\n\nMaybe, as in 1996, the will to come through so much might suddenly bring the explosion the English want.\n\nOr, it might just see more of the same. Issues remain. The elimination of Switzerland only emphasised some of them, not least the lack of fluency. It's why Southgate felt the need to talk about it with the players.

Read on to get all the key details about the penultimate match of continental extravaganza.\n\nEURO 2024 Semi-Finals: Netherlands vs England - Date, Time & Where To Watch In US\n\nThe mouth-watering semi-final clash between Netherlands and England will take place at the Signal Iduna Park in Dortmund on Wednesday night, July 10. The game will kick off at 9 PM CET / 3 PM ET / 12 PM PT.\n\nSoccer aficionados in the States can catch the game live on TV on FOX. Alternatively, one can watch the game live on Foxsports.com, Fubo TV, and the Fox Sports app.\n\nAfter claiming a thumping 3-0 victory over Romania in the Round of 16, the Netherlands locked horns with stubborn Turkiye in the quarter-finals. The underdogs drew first blood through Samet Akaydin in the 35th minute, putting pressure on Koeman's side.\n\nHolland probed and pushed for the equalizer, but it did not arrive until the 70th minute. Center-back Stefan de Vrij emerged as the Netherlands' messiah, dispatching a thumping header to send Memphis Depay's cross into the back of the net. Six minutes later, the Oranje went 2-1 up, with Mert Muldur diverting Denzel Dumfries' effort into the back of the Turkish net. Turkiye pushed hard for the equalizer but the Netherlands held firm to secure the win.\n\nEngland, meanwhile, had to rely on penalties to book their place in the EURO 2024 semi-finals. Southgate's goal-shy England went behind in the 75th minute, with Breel Embolo tapping the ball in from close range. The Three Lions, however, were behind only for five minutes, as Bukayo Saka dispatched a gem of a left-footed curler to find the back of the net from outside the box. With the scoreline level at 1-1, the match went into extra time.\n\nNeither team managed to find the breakthrough in the added 30 minutes, which pushed the game to penalties. England commendably held their nerve in the shootout, claiming a 5-3 victory.\n\nTeam News\n\nThe Netherlands have all of their players fit and firing, so Koeman is unlikely to tinker with his starting XI. England, meanwhile, will have Marc Guehi available for selection after the center-back sat out the last game due to suspension.\n\nHead-To-Head\n\nThe two sides have 22 times since their first meeting on May 18, 1935. The Dutch have won seven times in their meetings whereas the Three Lions have claimed six times. There have been nine draws so far. Their most recent meeting came in the UEFA Nations League in 2019. The Netherlands thoroughly outclassed England in that game, bagging a 3-1 victory.\n\nNetherlands vs England - Prediction\n\nOn paper, England have a much superior team, but they have not fired as a unit this summer. The Netherlands, meanwhile, had a slow start but have picked up pace in the knockouts. It is incredibly close to call, but since we have to pick a winner, we are putting our weight behind the Dutch.\n\nWe believe the Oranje have a more tactically astute coach in their corner, who will help them overcome the individual brilliance of England stars.\n\nWe are backing the Netherlands to bag a 2-1 victory over England on Wednesday night.", "source": {"uri": "sportslens.com", "dataType":

It took a bicycle kick from Jude Bellingham and extra time for the Three Lions to progress past Slovakia into a quarter-final against Switzerland which was ultimately decided on penalties.\n\nIt's not been smooth sailing for Ronald Koeman's Netherlands side either. They finished third in the group stage after beating Poland, drawing with France and losing in a 3-2 thriller against Austria. Since then, they put in a dominant display against Romania in the round of 16 and battled from behind to defeat a sharp Turkey team 2-1.\n\nWith all that in mind, tonight's England v Netherlands game is set to be a tense affair. England fans will be optimistic that Harry Kane can finally begin firing and will certainly be hoping for more magic from the likes of Bukayo Saka and Bellingham.\n\nMeanwhile, the Netherlands will be relying on a solid defensive performance from Liverpool star Virgil van Dijk and explosive displays from forwards Memphis Depay and former Spurs man Steven Bergwijn.\n\nWithout further ado, let's take a look at how the two squads currently compare in FC 24.\n\nBoth teams are closely matched in FC 24, but overall England has a slightly higher rating compared to the Netherlands.\n\nSouthgate's team has a five-star rating, as does Koeman's. However, England's midfield statistics are higher with a score of 84 compared to the Netherlands' 80.\n\nWith regards to attacking and defensive numbers, both squads are scored at 84 and 83 respectively. It looks as though tonight's England v Netherlands match could be decided in the middle of the park then as the likes of Jude Bellingham and Declan Rice will line up against Xavi Simons and Tijjani Reijnders.\n\nEngland lineup with a 4-3-3 holding formation in FC 24's Euro 2024 mode. The current squad, along with their live ratings, are below.\n\nThe Netherlands use a 4-2-3-1 wide formation in FC 24's Euro 2024 mode. Here is the squad's current starting line-up along with each player's live rating.\n\nAccording to the game Virgil van Dijk is Holland's best player, with an 88 rating.\n\nAs you can see from the above, in FC 24's Euro 2024 mode England has the better squad of players. But will the real life England v Netherlands match reflect that?\n\nAs we know, in football quite literally anything can happen, so both teams will need to put in a strong performance to stand any chance of reaching the final, where they will meet Spain.", "source": {"uri": "radiotimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Radio Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joshua_lamb@radiotimes.com", "name":

In the previous edition of the European Championship, England were runners-up, while the Netherlands were knocked out of the final 16.\n\nThe first time these two teams met was in 1935 when England won 1-0 in Olympisch Stadion, Amsterdam. Since then, the team have played nine draws, as England have won six games and Netherlands have won seven occasions.\n\nFor English football fans, one of the best memories against the Dutch team was their 4-1 win in the Euro '96. Both Alan Shearer and Teddy Sheringham scored braces, pushing the Three Lions to the quarter-finals.\n\nHowever, the team's performance in the nine matches since that spectacular night involves just one win. In the 1988 Euros, Marco van Basten's hat-trick ensured the Oranje won 3-1 against an English side that lost all three games of the tournament. The Netherlands would go on to win the championship that year.\n\nIn 1994, Netherlands and England were in the same group for World Cup qualifying. The Dutch team's 2-0 win over the Three Lions ensured that the latter failed to qualify for the World Cup, only the third time the team failed to do so.\n\nMaking their fifth semi-final appearance in the European Championship, the team arrived at the elimination stage third-placed behind France and Austria in their Group. Despite their shaky group stage performances, the Oranje team are two games away from their second Euro championship.\n\nTheir group-stage results weren't consistent. They won 2-1 against Poland and played a goalless draw against France before losing their final group game 3-2 to Austria. Despite how the scorecard may show the result, Austria and France's hald were constantly threatened by the Dutch players. Against Austria, Netherlands levelled the goals twice before Marcel Sabitzer sealed the Austrian fate.\n\nNetherlands picked the pace against Romania, ending the match with 3-0. However, they faced criticism for their goal-scoring frequency. Against Turkey, Netherlands went into half-time trailing 1-0. In the second half, the Dutch team made a strong comeback, scoring two goals within just six minutes.\n\nThe English side have lacked the flair that they usually play with. It is a team full of superstars who have struggled in all the five games they have played in the tournament. Their only win on the group stage came against Serbia in their opening game. They drew two games to top their group stage. In the Round of 16, they were out of the game for the full 90 minutes. They won the game with two goals in the extra time. Their performance was expected to get better in the quarter-finals. They drew the game 1-1 after Bukayo Saka, a leveller, within five minutes of the Swiss goal. In the Penalty shootout, they won 5-3 to make their fourth semi-final appearance in the tournament.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The Mirror bring us the big news:\n\nNetherlands in Euro 2024 chaos as England plans cancelled and UEFA release statement\n\n'Euro 2024' chaos sounds bad. And you know what sounds even worse? A 'horror journey'. That sounds awful and something that absolutely had to be 'endured'.\n\nIn shock news, it transpires that the Dutch could not travel on the train so they had to seek 'alternative plans'.\n\nAnd what were those 'alternative plans'? A coach? A horse and cart? A platoon of Ubers?\n\nWorse, they had to 'endure' a 'plane'. Sounds awful.\n\nOver to Ronald Koeman to describe the 'chaos' and the 'horror journey':\n\n\"Strange, but no problem at all. We were in the bus in front of the hotel, we hadn't left yet. The players were able to rest for two to two-and-a-half hours in the hotel. Otherwise they would have had to do that on the train.\n\n\"In the end, the trip was shorter than by train. So it was better to get here this way. It's fine.\"\n\nSo to precis: The 'horror journey' was quicker and better.\n\nThe Entitled\n\nEven if we ignore the fact that the Daily Mail's Ian Ladyman has been among England and Gareth Southgate's staunchest critics at this tournament, this headline is kind of patronising nonsense makes Mediawatch's skin itch:\n\nThe gratitude shown towards Gareth Southgate's England at the start of his reign has withered and a sense of entitlement has returned... it's death or glory now, writes IAN LADYMAN\n\n'Sense of entitlement'? Is it really a 'sense of entitlement' that makes England fans believe they deserve more than one 90-minute win in five games against opposition ranked 32nd, 21st, 57th, 45th and 19th in the world?\n\nLadyman notes that England were happy enough to lose in a World Cup semi-final just six years ago - two summers after losing a last-16 Euros clash with Iceland - and they won't be now. Odd that. Must be a 'sense of entitlement' and not just, well, a sense of perspective.\n\nNow here we are, approaching the end of the Southgate era after almost eight years. England play in another semi-final tonight against the Netherlands. It is the third in four tournaments under him, but the gratitude of old has withered and a sense of entitlement - the curse of English football for so long - has returned.\n\n'The curse of English football'!\n\nSilly English football fans; should they be grateful to reach a European Championship semi-final regardless of how they got there? We're sure the Mail will react with nothing but 'gratitude' if England fail to beat the Netherlands.\n\nHere's just a selection of headlines from Ladyman pieces in the last few weeks:\n\nTime for England's decorated players to step out of the dark and show their true colours, writes IAN LADYMAN... this England squad contains serial winners, but where have they been?\n\nEngland's tournament has been characterised by bickering and arguing on the pitch, writes IAN LADYMAN... Gareth Southgate's side now must step up and let their football do the talking\n\nGareth Southgate is tied up in knots by his safety-first ideology... he must change NOW if England are to win Euro 2024, writes IAN LADYMAN\n\nEngland's big name players have not brought their true selves to this stage - they look lost and are a team waiting to be beaten, writes IAN LADYMAN\n\nGareth Southgate's flawed England tactics have resulted in frazzled minds, chaos and a team shredded of self-respect, writes IAN LADYMAN\n\nMaybe IAN LADYMAN was writing about his own 'sense of entitlement'.\n\nMORE ON ENGLAND FROM F365:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 No Kane or Foden in England teams picked to play the Netherlands\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Eusebio, penalties, Germans, Southgate: ranking England's six previous major tournament semi-finals\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Ranked: All of Gareth Southgate's England subs at Euro 2024, from pointless to actually good\n\nA correction\n\n'If England are enjoying relative success in any tournament, the moment arrives when it is necessary to retell the story of King Canute' - Martin Samuel, The Times.\n\nDeutschland \u00fcber alles\n\nHaving told us that England fans should never have admired Austria, Martin Samuel is here to tell us that England fans should never have admired Germany.\n\nIf England were Germany we'd be in awe.

Look at Germany, playing well, getting knocked out. Why can't we be like that?\n\nNonsense. If England were Germany and had just been knocked out by a very good Spanish side in the quarter-finals, while Germany were in the semi-finals having failed to beat Denmark, Slovenia, Slovakia or Switzerland in 90 minutes, we would be calling them 'jammy bastards'.

And then it happens. One of the most controversial moments in England's history.\n\nNetherlands captain Ronald Koeman reaches out with his right arm and hauls Platt to the turf. Referee Karl-Josef Assenmacher instantly charges over pointing to the penalty spot - and surely his next act will be to send Koeman off, who is adamant it should be a free-kick instead.\n\nBut Assenmacher reverses his decision, agreeing with Koeman, before most shockingly, showing the defender a yellow card.\n\n\"What are they being instructed?\" rages England boss Graham Taylor in footage later seen on Channel 4's documentary An Impossible Job. \"What sort of thing is happening here? Absolutely disgraceful.\"\n\nIt gets worse for Taylor and England. Five minutes later, Legendary ITV commentator Brian Moore's prophecy of \"he's going to flick one, he's going to flick one\" comes true as Koeman sends a free-kick into the top left corner to give Netherlands the lead.\n\n\"You know we've been cheated, don't you?\" Taylor says to the assistant referee. \"The referee's got me the sack. Thank him ever so much for that, won't you?\"\n\nEngland fall to a 2-0 defeat and despite a 7-1 win over San Marino a month later in November 1993, the Three Lions fail to qualify. Taylor resigns six days later.\n\nKoeman, the former Southampton, Everton and Barcelona manager, now in charge of Netherlands for a second time, has since admitted he should have walked.\n\n\"It was a clear foul,\" he said in 2018. \"Nowadays it would have been a red card for sure but I was very happy that the referee said it was a free-kick and not a penalty.\"\n\nEngland have won six and lost seven against Netherlands but their greatest day over the Dutch came at Euro 1996.\n\nPaul Gascoigne's iconic goal against Scotland had started the party but England's scintillating performance in the final group game had the country believing.\n\nDoubles from Alan Shearer and Teddy Sheringham had Terry Venables' England four up inside 62 minutes before Patrick Kluivert pulled one back late on - a goal that sent Scotland home.\n\n\"We took on Holland at total football and beat them,\" said Shearer. \"A performance I don't think England have bettered in my living memory, notwithstanding the five goals Sven-Goran Eriksson's team stuck past Germany in 2001.\"\n\nNetherlands have not reached a Euros semi-final since 2004 and Koeman is bidding for a unique double as player and now manager having featured in their Euro 88 success.\n\nHe began his first spell in charge by suffering a 1-0 defeat to England in March 2018 which was seen as somewhat of a statement victory for Gareth Southgate ahead of the World Cup.\n\nJesse Lingard scored his first international goal as England earned victory over Netherlands for the first time since Euro 1996 and their first in the Dutch capital since 1969.\n\nSouthgate continued his back three experiment and moved Kyle Walker onto the right side of the defence alongside John Stones and Joe Gomez as England extended their unbeaten run to seven matches despite being without Harry Kane.\n\nKoeman named Virgil van Dijk as his new captain while Stefan de Vrij, Memphis Depay and Wout Weghorst all featured and will do so again on Wednesday night.\n\nNetherlands roared back a year later, reaching the Nations League final in June 2019 with a 3-1 victory after extra-time over England, the last meeting between the two countries.\n\nMarcus Rashford scored from the penalty spot but in a sign of things to come under Southgate, England sat back and didn't build on their lead, allowing Matthijs de Ligt to equalise.\n\nJesse Lingard had a late winner ruled out for offside by VAR before errors from John Stones and Ross Barkley in extra time when trying to play out from the back led to an own-goal by Kyle Walker and a Quincy Promes third.", "source": {"uri": "skysports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SkySports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_kick_(association_football)", "type":

They've reached the World Cup quarter-finals eight times, but only got to one final. With Gareth Southgate as manager, they are hoping to win the Euros for the first time in 2024, yet by reaching the semi-finals, it is already one of their best tournaments.\n\nEvery two years, England dream of glory. A major football tournament is one of the best things in the world -- and the pubs, gardens and streets fill up in the nation as everyone, from every background, unites to support the team. Sometimes, the Three Lions are seen as the laughing stock of international football; they've only won one tournament, but they have come close consistently.\n\nOver the years, England have had some of the greatest players of all time in their hands, yet they've often succumbed to the pressure in the most important matches. It's why being manager of the country is seen as one of the hardest jobs in football; the nation expects glory, but it is easier said than done.\n\nAs England look to end their years of hurt and win Euro 2024, we have ranked their nine greatest major tournaments based on where they finished. After beating Switzerland to reach the semi-finals in Germany, they have now reached the final four for just the seventh time in their history -- yet that could improve under Gareth Southgate.\n\nGreatest England Tournaments\n\nRank\n\nTournament\n\nYear\n\nFinishing Place\n\n1.\n\nWorld Cup\n\n1966\n\nWinners\n\n2.\n\nEuros\n\n2020\n\nRunners-Up\n\n3.\n\nEuros\n\n1968\n\nThird\n\n4.\n\nWorld Cup\n\n1990\n\nFourth\n\n5.\n\nWorld Cup\n\n2018\n\nFourth\n\n6.\n\nEuros\n\n1996\n\nSemi-Finals\n\n7.\n\nEuros\n\n2024\n\nSemi-Finals*\n\n8.\n\nWorld Cup\n\n2002\n\nQuarter-Finals\n\n9.\n\nWorld Cup\n\n2022\n\nQuarter-Finals\n\nRelated 10 Best England Wins in World Cup History (Ranked)\n\nEngland have only won the World Cup once in 1966, but have enjoyed some memorable wins over the years. Here are some of the best.\n\n9 2002 World Cup Quarter-Finals\n\nEngland have reached the World Cup quarter-finals on eight separate occasions, yet their run to that round in 2002 might be one of the most painful ones. The Three Lions hardly waltzed through their group, picking up five points to finish second behind Sweden.\n\nHowever, when they beat Denmark 3-0, partially thanks to a strike from wonderkid Michael Owen, they started to believe. When they took the lead against Brazil in the last eight, that only grew, but goals from Rivaldo and Ronaldinho, which David Seaman should have saved as his long-ranged free-kick looped over his head, ended their dreams. Heartbreak in Asia.\n\nTournament Record\n\nRound\n\nMatch\n\nGroup Stage\n\nEngland 1-1 Sweden\n\nEngland 1-0 Argentina\n\nEngland 0-0 Nigeria\n\nRound of 16\n\nEngland 3-0 Denmark\n\nQuarter-Finals\n\nEngland 1-2 Brazil\n\n8 2022 World Cup Quarter-Finals\n\n20 years later, England had every reason to be confident going into the tournament. They were truly one of the favourites, with a young and thriving squad ready to leave their mark in Qatar. Typically, the Three Lions start slowly in major tournaments, but that wasn't the case in 2022, as they won their first match 6-2 to outline their intentions.\n\nThey went on to finish top of their group and beat Senegal 3-0 in the Round of 16, yet one major test awaited them in the Middle East. It was billed as the match of the tournament -- and England narrowly lost 2-1 to France, as Harry Kane, normally one of the best players in the world, blazed his late penalty over the bar.\n\nTournament Record\n\nRound\n\nMatch\n\nGroup Stage\n\nEngland 6-2 Iran\n\nEngland 0-0 USA\n\nEngland 3-0 Wales\n\nRound of 16\n\nEngland 3-0 Senegal\n\nQuarter-Finals\n\nEngland 1-2 France\n\n7 2024 Euros Semi-Finals* Close\n\nEngland were the favourites among betting companies going into Euro 2024. It was expected to be Gareth Southgate's final tournament as manager -- and they finished top of their group in Germany. Maybe it was not convincing as they finished with five points, but they completed their initial job.\n\nDespite having a squad full of talent, they struggled against Slovakia in the Round of 16, winning 2-1 after extra time, before beating Switzerland on penalties in the quarter-finals. The style of play was dull, yet - somehow - they grounded out results. A match against the Netherlands in the semi-finals awaits as the Three Lions look to reach back-to-back Euro finals.\n\nTournament Record\n\nRound\n\nMatch\n\nGroup Stage\n\nEngland 1-0 Serbia\n\nEngland 1-1 Denmark\n\nEngland 0-0 Slovenia\n\nRound of 16\n\nEngland 2-1 Slovakia (aet)\n\nQuarter-Finals\n\nEngland 1-1 Switzerland (5-3 on pens)\n\nSemi-Finals\n\nEngland x-x Netherlands\n\n6 1996 Euros Semi-Finals\n\nThe year football 'came home'. England were hosting their first tournament since their 1966 triumph on home soil, but expectations were low after a challenging few years for the national team. However, by the time their second group game ended, that negativity was washed away, as they beat bitter rivals Scotland 2-0 at Wembley.\n\nThe following game saw them beat the Netherlands 4-1 -- a match which is widely considered one of their greatest wins of all time, whilst the Three Lions also had luck on their side to progress past Spain on penalties. Only a Gareth Southgate penalty miss in the following round against Germany stopped them from reaching the final.\n\nRelated 'England Boss Gave us One Night Out Before Euros - It Ended up as a 20-Man Bender'\n\nTeddy Sheringham shares all the details about the famous night out in Hong Kong before Euro '96.\n\nTournament Record\n\nRound\n\nMatch\n\nGroup Stage\n\nEngland 1-1 Switzerland\n\nEngland 2-0 Scotland\n\nEngland 4-1 Netherlands\n\nQuarter-Finals\n\nEngland 0-0 Spain (4-2 on pens)\n\nSemi-Finals\n\nEngland 1-1 Germany (5-6 on pens)\n\n5 2018 World Cup Fourth Place\n\nGareth Southgate's first major tournament was expected to be one of progress, but very few tangible results. It wasn't the nation's greatest team ever -- and there were noticeable weaknesses, yet they shone under the Russian sun in 2018. They qualified for the knockout stages after just two matches and a demolition job against Panama.\n\nIn the Round of 16, they won their first-ever shootout at a World Cup against Colombia before cruising past Sweden to reach their first semi-final at the biggest tournament since 1990. It wasn't to be on that occasion as they lost 2-1 to Croatia, yet they inspired the nation throughout.\n\nTournament Record\n\nRound\n\nMatch\n\nGroup Stage\n\nEngland 2-1 Tunisia\n\nEngland 6-1 Panama\n\nEngland 0-1 Belgium\n\nRound of 16\n\nEngland 1-1 Colombia (4-3 on pens)\n\nQuarter-Finals\n\nEngland 2-0 Sweden\n\nSemi-Finals\n\nEngland 1-2 Croatia (aet)\n\nThird-placed Play-off\n\nEngland 0-2 Belgium\n\n4 1990 World Cup Fourth place\n\n\"Italia 90\" holds fond memories for any Englishman growing up in the nation. It was truly a summer of glory for the Three Lions, as they started to dream of glory. Just like most tournaments, it was a slow start, picking up just one win in the group stage, but it was enough to face Belgium in the Round of 16.\n\nA famous David Platt volley secured victory in extra time, whilst two goals from Gary Lineker, who eventually won the Golden Boot, saw them beat Cameroon 3-2 to reach the semi-finals. However, their fierce enemy stood in the way once more, as West Germany beat them on penalties to leave Paul Gascoigne crying on the pitch. Yet more heartbreak for England -- and they failed to win the third-placed play-off as well.\n\nTournament Record\n\nRound\n\nMatch\n\nGroup Stage\n\nEngland 1-1 Ireland\n\nEngland 0-0 Netherlands\n\nEngland 1-0 Egypt\n\nRound of 16\n\nEngland 1-0 Belgium (aet)\n\nQuarter-Finals\n\nEngland 3-2 Cameroon (aet)\n\nSemi-Finals\n\nEngland 1-1 West Germany (3-4 on pens)\n\nThird-placed Play-off\n\nEngland 1-2 Italy\n\nRelated Every FIFA World Cup Logo From 1930 to 2026\n\nAs the United States prepares to host the 2026 World Cup, here is a list of all the logos created for the competition since 1930.\n\n3 1968 Euros Third place\n\nEuro 68 was the first time England had qualified for the European Championships -- and, compared to now, the format was drastically different. UEFA opted to have a prolonged qualifying round that spanned two years and a set of quarter-finals to determine the four teams which would compete at the Finals.\n\nEngland finally secured their place, but they lost 1-0 to Yugoslavia in the semi-finals. Two years after World Cup glory, it was bitterly disappointing, but they did regain pride by beating the Soviet Union 2-0, thanks to goals from Geoff Hurst and Bobby Charlton, to secure third.\n\nTournament Record\n\nRound\n\nMatch\n\nSemi-Finals\n\nEngland 0-1 Yugoslavia\n\nThird-placed Play-off\n\nEngland 2-0 Soviet Union\n\n2 2020 Euros Runners-up\n\nEverything about Euro 2020 was chaos. Taking place a year late due to the COVID-19 pandemic, England played all of their matches, bar one, at home, providing them with a clear advantage. They progressed through the group stages comfortably, before finally beating bitter rivals Germany 2-0 at a raucous Wembley, which was not even full due to restrictions.\n\nAfter destroying Ukraine, they produced one of the most memorable nights in the nation's history by beating Denmark 2-1 to reach the final, yet that's where the glory ended, as the Three Lions lost to Italy on penalties in the final. It was a day marred by violence, attempted break-ins and racial abuse, forever leaving a stain on the country.\n\nTournament Record\n\nRound\n\nMatch\n\nGroup Stage\n\nEngland 1-0 Croatia\n\nEngland 0-0 Scotland\n\nEngland 1-0 Czechia\n\nRound of 16\n\nEngland 2-0 Germany\n\nQuarter-Finals\n\nEngland 4-0 Ukraine\n\nSemi-Finals\n\nEngland 2-1 Denmark (aet)\n\nFinal\n\nEngland 1-1 Italy (2-3 on pens)\n\n1 1966 World Cup Winners\n\nWhen you ask any Englishman what is the greatest day in the country's footballing history, everyone will say their World Cup triumph in 1966. With a team featuring some of the greatest English players ever, they achieved the ultimate goal in football on home soil.\n\nThe group stages were relatively stress-free before the Three Lions scraped past both Argentina and Portugal to reach the final. In a match which was perfect for the biggest stage in the sport, England beat their main rivals, West Germany, 4-2 at Wembley to claim the title. A hat-trick from Geoff Hurst helped secure victory, yet one of his goals has forever been contested as it was unclear if it crossed the line.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Kylian Mbappe is the only

Key talking points ahead of Holland semi-final clash", "body": "England face the Netherlands in Dortmund this evening looking to book a place in back-to-back European Championship finals.\n\nGareth Southgate's side have been heavily criticised for their performances at Euro 2024 but are one game away from Sunday's showpiece in Berlin.\n\nHere, we take a look at some of the key talking points ahead of the meeting with the Dutch.\n\nNo Kane, no gain?\n\nIt would have been unthinkable before a ball was kicked at the Euros to consider that Harry Kane's place in Southgate's starting XI would be called into question.\n\nCaptain, all-time leading goalscorer and a man who hit the back of the net 44 times in 45 appearances for Bayern Munich last season.\n\nBut the 30-year-old has struggled throughout the tournament and in the the quarter-final win over Switzerland in particular, and has been substituted as many times as he has scored - twice - while Ivan Toney has impressed in his short outings from the bench.\n\nIn all likelihood, Southgate will stick with his talisman for such a big game, but the fact his place is even being speculated about speaks volumes for his summer so far.\n\nA Shaw thing\n\nLuke Shaw made his long-awaited comeback from injury as he came off the bench against the Swiss, racking up his first minutes since a hamstring problem he suffered at Manchester United in February.\n\nThe 28-year-old had hoped to be available earlier in the competition as Southgate opted to bring just one recognised left-back in his 26-man squad - but a setback delayed his return.\n\nNow though, he insists he is ready to start against the Netherlands tonight.\n\nLiverpool pair hoping to make Oranje boom\n\nIf the Dutch are to down England and reach their first Euros final since 1988, the chances are a couple of Premier League players will have a big say.\n\nLiverpool duo Virgil van Dijk and Cody Gakpo have been crucial in the run to the semi-final for Ronald Koeman's men.\n\nCaptain Van Dijk, who turned 33 on Monday, remains one of the best centre-backs in Europe and will fancy his chances against whoever plays up front for England - while Gakpo is one of four players jointly leading the Golden Boot race having scored three goals in Germany.\n\nThree and easy\n\nSouthgate made the call to switch to a back three against Switzerland and, while the tie was ultimately decided on penalties, England did produce an improved performance.\n\nShaw could now come in to help the balance even more, while Marc Guehi is available after serving a one-match ban. The shift, though, has allowed Phil Foden and Jude Bellingham more chance to roam with the pair able to both operate centrally, while Bukayo Saka's turn at right wing-back saw the Arsenal man produce his best football of the tournament so far.\n\nAll in all, it now seems improbable Southgate would abandon the change in system after one game, although - unlike the Swiss - the Netherlands do usually operate with a back four.\n\nThe man in the middle\n\nFelix Zwayer - a German referee who was banned over his part in a match-fixing scandal - will take charge of the game at Signal Iduna Park.\n\nThe 43-year-old was given a six-month ban by his country's football federation in 2006, having worked as an assistant referee alongside Robert Hoyzer.\n\nBellingham was fined by the German federation after he referenced Zwayer's involvement in that scandal after a defeat for his old club Borussia Dortmund against Bayern Munich in 2021.\n\nSpeaking ahead of the game, Shaw said the England players \"respect Uefa\" in terms of its selection of officials and that they were not concerned by Zwayer's appointment.", "source": {"uri": "shropshirestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Shropshire

But to try and settle our nerves a bit - or at least distract ourselves ahead of the Euro 2024 semi-final - we've had a look at how England and the Netherlands compare from the spot historically.\n\nThe data was provided to the BBC by Opta, and we've chopped it up a few different ways to see if we can learn anything from it.\n\nVIDEO How Spain's Lamine Yamal Just DESTROYED France\n\nIf you think penalty data from the early 90s is at all relevant to what might happen on the pitch in Dortmund this evening...well, we still don't have anything conclusive to tell you, weren't afraid.\n\nThe Netherlands have almost exactly the same conversion rate in shootouts (67.6%) as England (68% exactly), with a comparable win/loss record.\n\nBoth sides have overwhelmingly lost their shootouts in the past, though England have recently turned a corner on that front. Having won just one of their first seven, up to and including Euro 2012, Gareth Southgate's side have triumphed in two of their past three. Of course, they fell short where it mattered most, coming undone against Italy in the Euro 2020 final.\n\nThe Netherlands have meanwhile won just two of their eight shootouts, doing so in the Euro 2004 quarter-finals against Sweden and the 2014 World Cup quarter-finals against Costa Rica. The latter is the only time they have managed to score all of their spot kicks; England have done so twice, against Spain at Euro 96 and against Switzerland just a few nights ago.\n\nBut that's all in the past...what about the here and now?\n\nWell, the good news for England fans is the current Three Lions squad have had a lot more recent experience of stepping up from 12 yards than the Netherlands (at international level, at least).\n\nKieran Trippier and Harry Kane both scored against Colombia at the 2018 World Cup; Kane and Bukayo Saka stepped up against Italy (Kane scored, Saka's was saved); and Cole Palmer, Jude Bellingham, Saka, Ivan Toney and Trent Alexander Arnold all succeeded against the Swiss.\n\nAmong the Dutch contingent, only Virgil van Dijk and Wout Weghorst have taken shootout penalties for their country before, in their 2022 World Cup quarter-final defeat to Argentina. Van Dijk's was saved, Weghorst scored. Two other players who featured in that shootout, Teun Koopmeiners and Luuk de Jong, pulled out of the Netherlands squad injured before Euro 2024 began.\n\nEngland also have several more reliable players to call upon than the Netherlands. Across their careers for club and country, England have five players who have taken at least three penalties and maintained a 100% record: Palmer (12), Bellingham (5), Lewis Dunk (4), Alexander-Arnold (4), Anthony Gordon (3).\n\nConversely, Jordan Pickford has most cause to be wary of Steven Bergwijn, who has scored ten out of ten, and Denzel Dumfries, who has not faltered in his three goes to date.\n\nAs for the keepers...Transfermarkt credit Dutch number one Bart Verbruggen with just one penalty save in his career, with another 11 making it past him (8.3%).\n\nPickford's record? Outside shootouts, it's eight denied, 54 conceded (14.8%) - but for England in shootouts, it's five saved, 15 conceded (25%).\n\nGet a free live stream to watch Euro 2024 from anywhere in the world and catch the final stages of the summer's big tournament.\n\nWe have a guide on how to get Euro 2024 tickets if you're still looking to go to the final.

Why Dutch plan might suit England", "body": "The Netherlands have really impressed me with their adaptability at Euro 2024, but the way they attack could give England some new opportunities in Wednesday's semi-final.\n\nI've co-commentated on two of their games so far - the 3-2 defeat by Austria in the group stage, and the 2-1 win over Turkey in the quarter-finals.\n\nThe Dutch had good and bad spells in both games, and are far from flawless, but they were able to react each time when things went wrong and that has kind of been the story of their tournament, whoever they have faced.\n\nIn terms of how they set up, the first thing I'd say about Ronald Koeman's side is they are not as high-energy or the kind of high-pressing, front-foot type of team you might expect.\n\nSo they will not come after England and try to press them high up the pitch - but when they have got the ball, they will throw numbers forward.\n\nThat is not something we have seen very often from the five teams that Gareth Southgate's side have faced so far in Germany, and it is definitely something England can take advantage of.\n\nMost of the time, the Dutch are set up a little bit lopsided because their right-back, Denzel Dumfries, pushes so high up the pitch as often as he can.\n\nSteven Bergwijn, who has started on that side in the past couple of games, has been drifting in to get close to Memphis Depay and Xavi Simons, who has really impressed me in the number 10 role.\n\nThey will obviously pose a threat with the way they link up but, on the flip side, when Dumfries flies forward it is going to leave some space for England to break into once there is a turnover in possession.\n\nThat could leave Stefan de Vrij a little bit isolated and, although he is a very experienced defender, he is not as quick as Virgil van Dijk or Micky van de Ven. There should be some chances to expose him.\n\nThe other area where I think England can get some joy in Dortmund is in central midfield.\n\nEngland have got a lot of players who like to pop up in the pockets in front of the opposition defence - Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden, for example - no matter which system we use.\n\nThe Dutch are without Frenkie de Jong, Teun Koopmeiners and Marten de Roon at these Euros because of injury, so are missing some top quality in those positions.\n\nJerdy Schouten and Tijjani Reijnders, who play in the middle for the Dutch, are both really elegant technical footballers, but they like to have the ball and I would not describe them as defensive-minded.\n\nThey fill in holes and do the job when their team is out of possession but they are not the same type of player as Declan Rice, and it is not their strong point.\n\nIn front of them, Simons tends to get forward, so there should be plenty of opportunities to get in and around Schouten and Reijnders, and get at the Dutch defence.\n\nThere has been a bit of talk that Koeman might change his formation against England and match up to Southgate's side by playing three at the back.\n\nThe way the Dutch have been playing, however, they kind of end up as a three anyway, with Dumfries going so high so early in such an unusual way.\n\nWhen that happens, Nathan Ake tucks in and then they have got him, Van Dijk and De Vrij as a three, and their system actually ends up looking a lot like the one England used against Switzerland anyway.\n\nCody Gakpo is a left-winger rather than a left wing-back but he gives them width on that side, like Bukayo Saka did on the right for England against the Swiss because we did not have the same threat on the other side of the pitch.\n\nBoth formations are a little unbalanced in that way, with players on each flank asked to do different jobs, and what tends to happen in that scenario is the team which has the better possession highlights the other's weaknesses more quickly.\n\nI am expecting a similar pattern to unfold this time. One team will take control - probably England if they maintain the same possession levels as in previous matches - and the other will have to adapt to that.\n\nAs I said at the start, what I really like about the Netherlands is that when things are not working, Koeman is not afraid to change it.\n\nFor example, in the Austria game, he brought Simons on for Joey Veermans after 35 minutes and ended up pushing Lutsharel Geertruida, who was playing at right-back instead of Dumfries, into an inverted midfield role that transformed the momentum of the game, even though they ended losing it late on.\n\nAt half-time against Turkey, when the Dutch were trailing 1-0, he basically went from a 4-3-3 to a 4-4-2 formation and put Wout Weghorst up front with Depay. This time, they were the winners.\n\nSo, however the Dutch are set up at the start of the game, you can be sure they will give England some different problems depending on what happens during it.\n\nHopefully England won't go behind and won't have to be reactive like that, but there is still likely to be a time in the game when they need to make changes too.\n\nThat was definitely the case against Switzerland when, even before the Swiss took the lead, it felt like Southgate needed to freshen things up.\n\nThis time, Koeman won't wait... and neither should he.", "source": {"uri":

Now we want to deliver one more thing - we have never been to a final outside England, never won a Euros, so there are two bits of history we would love to create,\" said Southgate to BBC five.\n\nNetherlands on the other hand have won only one major tournament in the country's history (1988 Euros) and find themselves with an opportunity to recreate history. The Dutch side, like their opposition have not been at their strongest through the campaign. A dismal outing in the Group Stages saw them qualify after finishing third in their group behind Austria and France.\n\nAlthough a strong outing in the Round of 16 saw them defeat Romania (3-0) with comfort, they struggled heavily against Turkey in the quarterfinal and trailed for a majority of the game before scoring two late goals to secure a 2-1 victory.

Southgate was not going to let anything spoil his mood, and he responded to both questions with his usual thoughtfulness and tact.\n\nIf it was not already clear, though, England do not go into Wednesday's semi-final here as the neutrals' choice.\n\nSouthgate's side have ground their way to this stage, providing little in the way of entertainment -- spectacular goals from Jude Bellingham and Bukayo Saka aside.\n\nFrance, who face Spain in Tuesday's other semi-final, have been equally dull, more able to create openings than England, but even less capable of finishing one; a French player is still yet to score from open play.\n\nThis commitment to functional football is part of the story of the two semi-finals. On one side, you have Spain and Holland, the two nations who have done more to champion style and entertainment in the modern era than any others. On the other, there is France and England, both successful tournament teams run by arch pragmatists, for whom the result trumps the need to put on a show.\n\nThe question tonight is whether France's experience and defensive nous will prove too much for a vibrant but youthful Spain side, who have been the easiest on the eye at the tournament.\n\nEngland are unlikely to face a Dutch side playing Cruyffian 'total football' -- in fact, they are expected to counter-punch -- but it still feels like a contest between style and substance, one team which never loses sight of the need to entertain versus a side for whom winning is everything.\n\n\"Whether you play good or bad football, the most important thing is winning games,\" said Luke Shaw yesterday, neatly summing up England's mentality.\n\n\"And at the moment, we're doing that. Whether people like or not how the team are playing, we're in the semi-finals. For us, that's all that matters.\"\n\nFor Southgate's disciples, the end justifies the means, and the parallels with France are no coincidence. The England manager has studied his French counterpart Didier Deschamps, and believes his approach is the best way to deliver at major tournaments.\n\nMinimise risk, keep it tight, rely on moments of brilliance from big players. There is every reason to think their approach is justified; Deschamps' France won the World Cup in 2018, in between losing the finals of Euro 2016 and Qatar 2022, while England have enjoyed unprecedented success under Southgate without yet getting over the line.\n\nLow-risk teams, built on defence, tend to win tournaments, and even the celebrated Spain side won every knockout game 1-0 at the 2010 World Cup.\n\nIn responding to the barbed lines of questioning on Saturday, Southgate pointed out that \"these are not normal football matches\" but \"national events\" which come with enormous pressure for his young players.\n\nThere is, however, also a degree of risk in the manager's reluctance to play to the strengths of his top-heavy squad. When winning is all that matters, winning is all there is.\n\nPlaying safe arguably raises the stakes further, because if England fall short this week, what is left behind?\n\nWhile Deschamps has already achieved immortality, Southgate's legacy will be altogether more complicated if England do not go all the way in Germany; for all their progress, there will be a sense they could have done even more with an attacking approach.\n\nAs English, perhaps we should accept that \"national events\" come with a degree of boredom -- royal weddings spring to mind -- and what does it matter if the end result if positive?\n\nThat is Southgate's calculation, even as the neutrals long for a Spain-Holland final.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southgate,_London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southgate, London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southgate, London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didier_Deschamps", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Didier Deschamps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Total Football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Shaw", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luke Shaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/evening_standard_239/10fcd6f2da689fb73dfa8485ecf18bc8", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712618", "eventUri": "eng-9712618", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 129, "relevance": 1}

It was the only success in their five previous Euro semi-finals.\n\nThe omens are less good on the English side as Gareth Southgate's most telling contribution to the semi-final of Euro 96 was missing a penalty in England's semi-final shootout defeat to Germany.\n\nThe sides will do battle in Dortmund's Westfalenstadion on Wednesday at 8pm BST with England seeking to win a semi-final at a major tournament on foreign soil for the first time.\n\nLet's take a closer look at five key battles which we feel could decide the last-four match, shall we?\n\nThis looks like it could be the key match-up in the middle of the park.\n\nFrenkie De Jong was a big miss for the Netherlands after failing to recover from an ankle injury sustained in March but his play-making responsibility for the Dutch has fallen to 21-year-old Xavi Simons, playing slightly advanced of Jerdy Schouten and AC Milan's Tijani Reijnders, who has been particularly impressive so far in the Oranje campaign.\n\nSimons has assisted three goals already, putting him level with Spain starlet Lamine Yamal at the top of the tournament standings, and his ability to drift into space and drive forward on the counter attack mean Rice is going to need to keep his eyes on him.\n\nRice has covered more ground than any other player at Euro 2024, clocking an eye-watering 39.8 miles across England's five games so far.\n\nThis has been helped of course by the fact that he has played extra-time in his last two matches, whereas the Dutch players are relatively fresh having seen-off Romania in the Round of 16 and then Turkey in the last-eight in 90 minutes.\n\nEngland fans will hope he's made the most of his three-day recovery period and is ready to go again in Dortmund, a stadium where Simons inspired Leipzig to a 3-2 win in the Bundesliga last December, picking up an assist.\n\nThe Yellow Wall will become orange for the night, and Simons will hope for a repeat outcome.\n\nThe Netherlands might not play the attractive total football of their predecessors, but they have made their functional style work for them.\n\nOnly Spain and Germany have scored more than their nine goals in the tournament so far - by contrast England have scored just five.\n\nCody Gakpo is the favourite to land the Golden Boot at the competition - he is joint top of the standings with three goals but temporarily thought he had four before the Dutch winner against Turkey went down as an own-goal by Mert Muldur.\n\nJust as he did in his successful spell at PSV, Gakpo has enjoyed service from the right flank from marauding full-back Denzel Dumfries.\n\nThe Liverpool forward operates from the left for the Dutch which means the responsibility for looking after him falls to Kyle Walker.\n\nFor whatever reason, off-field distraction, different system, you name it, Walker has failed to hit the heights he did with Man City in the five games England have played so far. There have been highly unusual lapses in concentration which have seen him gift possession to the opposition and lose his man more than once. England fans will hope this is back to the norm for Walker as anything less than that could prove problematic against in-form Gakpo.\n\nMan City and Arsenal's Premier League rivalry resumes on the biggest stage.\n\nWhile he tends to operate in the left-sided centre-back role for Pep Guardiola, Nathan Ake is used as a left-back by Ronald Koeman, which should put him in direct opposition to... Bukayo Saka.\n\nFor the Netherlands Ake tends to sit back at left-back and slot in when Denzel Dumfries on the opposite flank makes his trademark roams up the field from right-back.\n\nThis might work to the Netherland's advantage, given Saka's obvious danger, meaning Ake is less likely to be caught out of position. However it does raise the possibility of an overload on the right with Saka and Ake's Man City teammate Kyle Walker bombing on.\n\nSaka missed the home game against Man City in the league this year and was subbed early in the return at the Etihad, which ended goalless. England fans will be hoping he finds more joy in Dortmund.\n\nThe absence of Frenkie De Jong has also hurt Memphis Depay. De Jong was the one who pulled the strings in most of the Dutch attacks and threaded passes through the deep lying defences which have been a feature of at this tournament.\n\nDepay has not been particularly effective leading the line as a central striker, scoring only once in the 3-2 defeat to Austria, and there is a growing clamour for Wout Weghorst to be given the nod through the middle from the start, having scored the winner in the opening group game against Poland and then changing the game after coming off the bench in the quarter-final against Turkey.\n\nIf that happens then expect Memphis to slide right. If it does not then he will have to try to find his way past John Stones, his old cross-Manchester rival.\n\nStones did make a rare costly slip which allowed Switzerland to pinch an opener in the last round, but he will know the dangers of Depay only too well and would possibly prefer facing him than the battering ram which is another former Man United man, Weghorst.\n\nOn paper, we're saving the best for last. But if we are honest, these two have failed to hit the heights they are capable of so far in Germany this summer. Is this the match in which they both spring to life?\n\nVan Dijk's partnership with Stefan De Vrij in the heart of defence is so enduring that Micky van de Ven of Tottenham and Man United target Matthijs de Ligt can't get in the team.\n\nDefence is definitely the Dutch's strongest area these days, but Van Dijk in particular has shown signs of being fallible, particularly in the 3-2 group stage defeat to Austria and spells of the Turkey quarter-final.\n\nThe thought of a country leaving out their captain and record goalscorer in a semi-final is so far-fetched it's almost laughable, however there is a huge section of the England faithful who think Harry Kane should be dropped for this last-four tie.\n\nWhether he is carrying a lingering injury, or whether a season in Germany has dulled the sharpness and fitness built up over a decade in the Premier League, we may never know, but although he has scored a couple of handy goals, he has contributed very little across the five games and, if anything, has made things harder for his teammates by dropping deep and leaving no focal point up top.\n\nIvan Toney caught the eye in cameos against Slovakia and Switzerland but, much like with Cristiano Ronaldo and Portugal, there is simply no way Kane won't be lining up in Dortmund before kick-off.", "source": {"uri": "101greatgoals.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "101greatgoals.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_hoad@101greatgoals.com", "name": "Alex Hoad", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cody_Gakpo", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cody Gakpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Koeman", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Koeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavi_Simons", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xavi Simons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frenkie_de_Jong", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frenkie de Jong"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denzel_Dumfries", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denzel Dumfries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympiastadion_(Berlin)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympiastadion (Berlin)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westfalenstadion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Westfalenstadion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Summer_Time", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "British Summer Time"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C._Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "A.C.

Netherlands are chasing their second European Championship title while England were runners up of the previous edition.\n\nNetherlands started their tournament with a 2-1 win over Poland, a draw with France, and a 3-2 loss to Austria. The Oranje entered the knockout stage with inconsistent performances. However, they showed character in both their elimination stage games.\n\nGiven that Romania were considerably inexperienced in this tournament, the Dutch side took advantage of this and ended the night with a 3-0 win. Progressing to the quarter-finals, Netherlands next opponent were the highly spirited Turkey. In the half-time, the game favoured Turkey as they headed in the break 1-0. Netherland needed a comeback and it came in the 70th minute with Stefan de Vrij scoring the levelling goal followed by an own goal from Turkey with Cody Gapko charging into the nets.\n\nEngland on the other hand are yet to hit the intensity level expected of a team playing in the elimination. Throughout the tournament they haven't performed well despite having star players in their side and won once in the group stage and drawing twice. Until the round of 16, the team had a total of four goals with Harry Kane and Jude Bellingham scoring two each.\n\nAgainst Slovenia in the knockout 16 stage, England won the game only in the extra time thanks to Bellingham and Kane both firing quick goals. In the quarter-final, the game remained goalless till the 75th minute when Breel Embolo scored for Switzerland. In the 80th minute, Bukayo Saka helped England with a levelling goal. The match went into the extra time and was finally decided with spot kicking which England won 5-3.\n\nEngland's attackers have been appalling in many senses. They have scored only five goals in this entire tournament. The likes of Bellingham, Kane and Phil Foden haven't been in the impressive form they had been during their club games. A lot of expectation was on Bellingham who was the joint third-highest goal scorer with 19 goals in La Liga season 2023-24. Though the midfielder has scored twice, it hasn't been at the flair expected from him. His captain, too, has scored twice in this tournament. Kane had helped Bayern Munich go undefeated this season, scoring 36 goals from 32 appearances.\n\nBukayo Saka had scored 16 times this season for Arsenal in the Premier League but, so far in the tournament, has only one goal. Phil Foden had a good season with 19 goals in the Premier League for Manchester United but, so far, hasn't made any impact in this tournament. The Three Lions also have the second lowest chances created in this tournament. What England does need to address now is their low-scoring and tactical challenges. Their star players must attack the opposite goalpost more in the remaining two games.\n\nWhile England's attack isn't solid, they have been one of the best sides in this tournament in terms of their defence line. While they have conceded only thrice, the Dutch side is much more susceptible to attacks on their goalpost.\n\nAs soon as they are in possession, Netherlands back-four converts to a three-man defence, with Ake moving forward. This means there's an extra player in their attack but that also means their defense is under pressure. The backline often presses high in order to cross the halfway line and apply pressure on the opposition. They have to ensure that they are not so vulnerable during counter attacks.\n\nThe two sides first met in 1935 in Olympisch Stadion, Amsterdam where England won 1-0 and have since played each other 22 times. Through the years thewse two sides have met each other at crucial stages.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "roheen_ghosh@news9live.com", "name": "Roheen Ghosh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_de_Vrij", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stefan de Vrij"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Own_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Own goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Romania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Romania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Poland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Poland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Austria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breel_Embolo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Breel Embolo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Foden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phil Foden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "La Liga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Amsterdam"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Amsterdam"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Mah_Jongg", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Mah Jongg", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://images.news9live.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Cody-Gapko-L-Jude-Bellingham-R.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712618", "eventUri": "eng-9712618", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

The Three Lions have been underwhelming but continue to push their way towards the final and are very much like France in their approach. The Dutch saw off plucky Turkiye while the English edged Switzerland out in their respective quarterfinals.\n\nGareth Southgate's men are still searching for a truly convincing win and will be hoping to deliver just that in the semifinal. Jude Bellingham and Harry Kane came up big in the round of 16 win over Slovakia, but it was Bukayo Saka who was the hero against the Swiss with a stunning strike. Still, it took penalties to overcome the Nati and book a place in the final four, which pitted them against Ronald Koeman's Netherlands.\n\nOranje have seen off Romania in the round of 16 and Turkiye in the quarterfinals so we could say that they are yet to face a true continental giant. Cody Gakpo has been outstanding in attack and joint-leads the top scorers with three goals ahead of Donyell Malen, Bellingham and Kane who will hope to be amongst the goals for this one, having been hot and cold so far in Germany.\n\nHere's our storylines, how you can watch the match and more:\n\nGolazo Starting XI Newsletter Get your Soccer Fix from Around the Globe Your ultimate guide to the Beautiful Game as our experts take you beyond the pitch and around the globe with news that matters.\n\nI agree to receive the \"Golazo Starting XI Newsletter\" and marketing communications, updates, special offers (including partner offers), and other information from CBS Sports and the Paramount family of companies.

How to watch and oddsDate: Wednesday, July 10 | Time: 3 p.m. ETLocation: BVB Stadion - Dortmund, GermanyWatch: Fox or Fubo (try for free)Odds: Netherlands +200; Draw +190; England +170How they got here\n\nNetherlands surprisingly finished third in Group D behind Austria in top spot and France in second but ahead of Poland, so it put the Dutch into an unexpected role of underdog here after a favorable run to the final four of Romania and then Turkiye. England topped Group C but only won one of three games to finish ahead of Denmark, Slovenia and Serbia before making hard work of it against Slovakia and then Switzerland to now face Oranje which is arguably their biggest test so far in terms of stature.\n\nTeam news\n\nNetherlands: Xavi Simons and Cody Gakpo have impressed so far with the Paris Saint-Germain man boasting three assists and the Liverpool star three goals of which two have been provided by Simons. Nathan Ake and Denzel Dumfries should continue to be on either side of the defense although Micky van den Ven is pushing for inclusion after some important late interventions against the Turkish.\n\nPossible Netherlands XI: Verbruggen; Dumfries, De Vrij, Van Dijk, Ake; Schouten, Simons, Reijnders; Bergwijn, Depay, Gakpo.\n\nEngland: Marc Guehi could be reinstated after suspension alongside John Stones although Ezri Konsa would be unlucky if that happens. Kobbie Mainoo looks to be finding a home for himself in midfield next to Declan Rice after Trent Alexander-Arnold and Connor Gallagher while Luke Shaw could now be an option in place of Kieran Trippier after coming on against Switzerland although another caemo might be most likely.\n\nPossible England XI: Pickford; Walker, Stones, Guehi, Trippier; Mainoo, Rice, Saka; Bellingham, Foden; Kane.\n\nPrediction\n\nAlthough England have not been at their best, the Netherlands have not been up against top opposition since their loss to Austria and also went goalless against France. The Three Lions should just about do enough to roar on but only after 120 minutes.

Teams win big games by being brave. It'll actually be a disgrace if he engineers another stinker.\n\nGreg\n\n...Spain have won all 6 of their games.

They have struggled against Denmark, Slovakia, Slovenia and Switzerland.\n\nThe kit is sexy as f***\n\nLook, can we just admit that the most important factor about winning an international tournament is the kit?\n\nSpain's kit is liquid sex. They deserve to win it all.\n\nThanks Tickers\n\nExcellent work from Tickers, talking about France being France and all of their inevitability meaning that they will knock out Spain, and in doing so, thus proving that the F365's writer's curse is the strongest force in the sporting world.\n\nTickers - any chance of writing up something about the Netherlands being too powerful for England to handle and how we should all be preparing for a Spain vs Netherlands final please?\n\nAlex, Madrid (Curtis Jones will be nodding wryly)\n\nWho is the best ever teenage footballer?\n\nNote that this is only an analysis of how good they were as teenagers specifically - so you can argue Wilshere was as good a teenager as Ronaldo (though their overall careers were quite the contrast, to say the least). Cue apoplectic rival fans lambasting my Arsenal bias.\n\nFor more modern viewers (such as myself) the obvious answer to gravitate towards is Messi (well...more on this later) while a teenage Pele's exploits are obviously the stuff of legend. In between the eras of these two - who else gets a shout? I wouldn't know - I'll leave it up to the middle-aged folk who frequent the mailbox and complain about things like not mixing politics with football to fill that knowledge gap.\n\nAnyway - I genuinely think Yamal might be the best footballing teenager I've personally ever seen (off the top of my head, it's a competition between Messi, Ronaldo, Rooney...maybe Gotze gets a shout). He's younger than Messi was when he was in his first pro season and arguably (or definitely) carrying a much larger burden for their respective Barcelona's and at country level.\n\nHe first came on my radar last August - I was working on a marketing research project for a Nike-owned brand which was looking to get a list of potential brand ambassadors who were still very young, not yet super-famous, could attract the Gen-Z crowd and were about to be the next big thing in their respective sports. My research into soccer prospects brought me to highlights of Yamal - and I can say this now without sounding crazy that he reminded me of a more athletic Zidane/Bergkamp.\n\nThe way he touches the ball but also the power in his drives towards goal - I knew literally after 45 seconds of the first YouTube reel that this kid was destined for greatness. He went straight to the top of the list - I even wrote in the notes something to the effect \"If he's not chosen to be the ambassador by this time next year - it will already be too late.\"\n\nAnd to score a goal like that - I have a feeling he saw Rabiot defending him and wanted to make his point loud and clear. The confidence in the kid...whatever the case, we're watching someone who (health in body and mind permitting) we'll be talking about on these pages for years to come.\n\nMAW, LA Gooner\n\nEngland will only go through if the Dutch bottle it\n\nI'm Swiss, so while my views on the England-Switzerland match are biased, my views on England, Southgate and Euro 2024 are fairly neutral. I have found the fan and media reactions to be utterly bewildering throughout the tournament, but especially in light of the Switzerland match, both in terms of performances and in terms of results.\n\nPerformances: pre-Switzerland, England/Southgate were criticized throughout the tournament. They were mediocre going forward in all four matches, they did not create the quantity and quality of chances that one would expect from a tournament favorite. On the other hand, they were also defensively solid and difficult to break down.\n\nPost-Switzerland, nothing about the performance was any different. I acknowledge my bias but all statistics show that England and Switzerland were either evenly matched, or that Switzerland was the marginally better team on the day. If someone primarily cares about performances, nothing about the Switzerland match should have changed anything.\n\nYou can be optimistic based on England's defensive solidity and ability to stumble through knockout games with 1 goal wins or shootout victories, or you can be pessimistic based on England's inability to create chances and two fixtures against far better players than in the 5 matches so far.\n\nResults: pre-Switzerland, England/Switzerland got the results they needed. They won their opening match. They drew against their rivals for first place in the second match. They drew their third match to clinch first place. Due to the absurdity of 24 team tournaments and having 4 of 6 third-placed teams qualify, there was never any real risk that England would fail to qualify from the group. There was never any guarantee that finishing first would be advantageous from a knockout fixtures perspective. Germany, Spain and Portugal all finished first but ended up on the harder side of the group. Switzerland conceding a late equalizer to Germany instead of winning directly led the Swiss to the easier draw.\n\nSo pragmatically speaking, the group stage was a non-issue, the Slovakia game was an actual win, the Switzerland game was a shootout victory. For those who care primarily about results rather than performances, again, what has changed?\n\nWe all know that you cannot treat fanbases as a single entity, any given group of fans will have contrastingly different views. There is always a risk of taking the viewpoints of different people and mistakenly concluding that individuals are being contradictory or inconsistent. But conscious of this, I am pretty sure I have seen the same exact pundits and Mailbox contributors being critical of England/Southgate pre-Switzerland, now acting confident and optimistic post-Switzerland. To anyone in this camp I humbly ask: what on Earth has changed?\n\nOther England thoughts:\n\n* Objectively, the world would have been a better place if Shaqiri's attempted Olimpico had gone in.\n\n* I think Gareth Southgate has been a fantastic England manager from 2016 through 2023. I also think Gareth Southgate has been borderline incompetent as an England manager in 2024, particularly during the tournament but also beforehand with his squad selections and media comments.\n\n* I see the semi-final as Holland's to lose. We know what England will play like. If Holland turns up and plays to their ability, they will win. If Holland bottles it, England will stumble through yet again.\n\n* It is really impossible to imagine the final being won by anyone besides Spain.\n\n* Non-English people don't mock the English fans nearly enough for their 'Sweet Caroline' nonsense. An American song by an American songwriter, popularized by American sports fans since the mid 1990s, being adopted in 2021 by a fanbase noted for its jingoistic attitudes, while supporting a country with barely-concealed anti-American sentiment.\n\nOliver Dziggel, Geneva Switzerland\n\nMORE ON ENGLAND FROM F365:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 No Kane or Foden in England teams picked to play the Netherlands\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Eusebio, penalties, Germans, Southgate: ranking England's six previous major tournament semi-finals\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Ranked: All of Gareth Southgate's England subs at Euro 2024, from pointless to actually good\n\nStats v Stars\n\nOne of Billy Bean's core points in Moneyball was that stats work over a season (in baseball's case, a long season) while stats have minimal to no impact on the shorter playoff games. In fact, having better players than the other teams could afford was the difference between his Oakland team consistently making the playoffs with one of the lowest squad spends and always failing during the playoffs.\n\nWhat has this got to do with football and the Euros. Well, it seems that sums up this England team. They have reached the semis on the back of individual performances rather than as a team. Of course, if this were totally true, it would/should sum up most tournaments.\n\nThe alternative argument is that too many 'fancied' teams have relied on their stars, who have failed to come through. The less fancied teams have done well off the back of sheer getting stuck in, balanced formations, bags of effort and not a small amount of skill to disrupt the more fancied teams. And the use of excellent young players - Guler, in the case of Turkiye. But in a short time frame, that effort is hard to sustain. Perhaps those playing the 'long game' understand it's a risk in the early stages to try and play a more disciplined, slower game to pay off in the latter stages - if you make it through.\n\nFor quite a few years, we have been seeing the demise of the out-and-out centre forward. Is this Euros the icing on that cake? England are blessed with three pretty decent alternatives. One isn't firing, and the other two aren't getting game time. But how many of the other teams have either got a centre forward or at least one that scores goals with some regularity to make it worth taking a spot in the side?\n\nIn the prior England incarnations we had Sterling and Rashford on each wing who did go outside their opponents and did pull the ball back for Kane. This England doesn't do that, so Kane ends up further back, on average than Foden and Bellingham. At least Toney or Watkins would make more space and give the Dutch defence more headaches. The Dutch rely on Dumfries pushing up, so having a player who can both counter him and push past him, will keep him pinned back for part of the time, and hopefully, this is the case where Walker's pace will cut off or reduce the risk of the Dumfries diagonal to Gakpo.\n\nI have consigned myself to the fact England, other than playing Shaw on the left, will pick pretty much the same side. Perhaps keeping the three at the back with Guehi brought back in. For whatever reason, the left footed Saka does player better on the right. At no time did he ever try to go outside his man when on the left.\n\nLet's hope Billy Bean was right and we get yet another one of our 'stars' using their inherent skill to get us over the line again.\n\nPaul McDevitt\n\nSouthgate is to England as Wenger was to Arsenal\n\nStrap in folks, it's a Harry Hooler whirlitzer coming (Pacho, be warned, it's a lot of words)\n\nIn a back and forth over the last few days on Southgate, it's dawned on me that by overachieving in 2018 and by jumping the shark in 2024, Southgate may now be destined to never be given the credit he deserves and may up leaving the England job under a cloud despite genuinely achieving the sort of sustained competitive football that England fans of a certain generation (or three) would absolutely have bitten our own arms off for.\n\nFirst, the truth, much like Wenger (as per the title), Southgate and England have now very much got to a stage where the relationship has gone sour. The truth is that leaving after a respectful quarter final loss to eventual finalists was likely the safest way to an amicable departure and short of winning 2024 (which, I still hope England do) he will now leave having overseen a decent tournament run with terrible optic football.\n\nWhether it was the weirdness around Henderson, the \"Southgate safety\" jokes, or the pining for Kalvin. It's quite clear that Gareth himself has lost the love for the job, even before our own opinions muddy the waters.\n\nBut why the brutal revisionism after one tournament?\n\nWhy pretend like Southgate hasn't absolutely decimated the England job, high scores, top-tier achievements and such in context? No-one's suggesting Southgate has always played explosive exciting football but then, how many successful International teams have? Pragmatic as he was, he still absolutely nailed tournament football and gave us more great games of tournament football to watch than the previous 40 years combined. Here's some arguments debunked:\n\nSouthgate has the best ever England squad - Nope. even generously can't call Southgate's squads the best ever. In the main, defenders win tournaments and there have been about 5 better back lines for England in the last 40 years that Southgate hasn't had the pleasure of managing. He may have had squads that have had the most individual world-class players, but even then that is speculative at best. His squad is nothing on 2002-2006, that's for sure.\n\nSouthgate has had easy routes to the final - Yes. He has. You know why? Because he won the damn groups. It meant he didn't face Argentina in the last 16 because of losing a group to Romania. It meant he didn't face Brazil in the quarter final because we came 2nd to Sweden and it sure as heck meant he didn't face a rampant Germany and get embarrassed 4-1 because we couldn't win a group containing USA, Slovenia and Algeria. The only group he didn't win was 2018, and we were comfortably 2nd seed in that group. We have been dining good in qualification friends, in feasts that we've never tasted before.\n\nSouthgate doesn't win games of football - Southgate has 5 knockout wins in 90 minutes, see above, that's because he has an unprecedented qualification rate from the group stages and in those knockout wins, we have 2-1 win from behind, a 4-0, a couple of 2-0 and a 3-0. Yes, those 5 were against nations of equal or worse standing than England but a) Iceland 2016 and b) he won the damn groups he was supposed to.\n\nSo no, don't pretend him taking us past Colombia on penalties after a soul-sapping injury time equaliser that we were all sure would do us, isn't one of the all time nights for us. Don't pretend you didn't get giddy in the 2021 run as we swept past Germany and Sweden, took on the romantic-favourites Denmark and then scored early in the final.\n\nDon't diminish the fact we were FINALLY a team that won group games against minnows 5-0 or 6-1 after years of 0-0 draws against such opposition. Is it time for him to go? Not even a question of it, as BadWolf said, \"get him gone\" even if we win the tournament, but is he leaving us with a bundle of good memories the size of a Harry Hooler post from 6 years that are probably more than the previous 40 years combined? You're so god damn right he is, that I'm talking in the third-person.\n\nDon't give him a statue, but do hope whoever comes in the next 5 appointments wins. the damn. group.\n\nHarold \"this might be the biggest yet\" Hooler Esq\n\nTime to get behind England\n\nOh Badwolf bore off. Clearly nothing has changed between today and yesterday. There is no need to send in the same tired nonsense everyday. If Southgate loses and quits he is going to remain the most successful England manager for 50 years. Who knows when he'll get knocked off that perch. If the FA decide to replace him with Frank Lampard it could be 50 years and three games! Seriously mate, Frank Lampard. We'd be better off with Lee Carsley. He's also done some work experience managing in the midlands but at least he's managing the England u21s and not writing children books about a boy called Frank who plays football. Where does Lampard get these ideas??\n\nIf we assume that anyone in football is worth the money that flies around then everyone is. If Alonso wants a pay rise he can come and work in England where all the money is. \u00a34m for his first job as manager seems like a touch for me. As for Southgate, he needs to be paid this level of money. When even the debutants are earning \u00a35m-\u00a310m a year basic, he needs to be paid a good whack so that they can look him in eyes and know that he's backed.\n\nIt's not perfect, neither is Southgate, but it's working. It's time to get behind the team or this hill you are prepared to die on will be washed away by your salty tears.\n\nAlex, South London\n\nMORE ON ENGLAND FROM F365:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 No Kane or Foden in England teams picked to play the Netherlands\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Eusebio, penalties, Germans, Southgate: ranking England's six previous major tournament semi-finals\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Ranked: All of Gareth Southgate's England subs at Euro 2024, from pointless to actually good\n\nYou're reffing joking\n\nJust reading about the referee for our game against the Dutch. While it's inevitable that the rags have made a mountain out of his past with Bellingham, there is something odd about it and his appointment to referee at this level is quite surprising.\n\nYeah, he's re-proven himself - clearly he can do the job - but in most industries, a relevant criminal record will be a black mark against you forever. You couldn't, for example, get a record for stealing money and then be allowed to work in finance. Indeed, allegations of theft (later overturned) against that Post Office lady stopped her being able to even volunteer at her local school. It's an odd difference in standards. Six months is enough to be reformed in some quarters and yet unproven allegations can destroy you for posterity in others.\n\nBut then this is UEFA. I'm probably equally surprised he didn't get an instant promotion as they very much like that kind of thing.\n\nBadwolf", "source": {"uri": "football365.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Football

England prepare to face Netherlands at Euro 2024", "body": "A decision on Gareth Southgate being knighted by the King has reportedly been made ahead of England's crucial Euro 2024 semi-final against the Netherlands.\n\nSouthgate has had many critics over the years, but there is no doubt that the England boss has made a positive impact on a national team that was in absolute no man's land before his arrival.\n\nPrior to Southgate's appointment ahead of the 2018 World Cup, England had failed to win a knock-out game since 2006, and even failed to make it to Euro 2008.\n\nSince then England have made it to at least the quarter-final stage at every. major tournament, with three out of four semi-finals.\n\nIt can be argued that particularly in Euro 2020 England should have gone on to lift the trophy, but those wrongs could be put right on Sunday if England get past Netherlands and Spain.\n\nEuro 2024 has probably been the most scrutiny Southgate has faced during his England tenure, with fans furious at the style of football that could have easily seen his side knocked out early.\n\nDespite all the criticism, The Telegraph are reporting that Southgate will be knighted if he brings the trophy home, and could still receive the honour even if England don't go all the way.\n\nSouthgate would join fellow British sports stars such as Sir Lewis Hamilton, Sir Alex Ferguson, Sir Andy Murray, and Sir Chris Hoy who have been knighted for their service to sport.\n\nThe 53-year-old has already been awarded an OBE in 2019, alongside his captain Harry Kane who received an MBE.\n\nKane

But they are one game from entering uncharted territory and, if they can negotiate a pressure-cooker \u00adatmosphere in Dortmund to win the 23rd meeting of these old rivals, they will have achieved something unmatched by their male predecessors.\n\nThree years ago Southgate's players reached the final at Wembley after beating Denmark. But their previous last-four appearance, against \u00adCroatia at the 2018 World Cup in Russia, ended in heartbreak and the manager hopes such setbacks fuel their hunger to take the next step.\n\nRelated: Netherlands v England: tactical conundrums that will settle semi-final\n\n\"We've risen well to those \u00adchallenges over the years and used them as motivation to break new ground,\" Southgate said of the task England face at BVB Stadion \u00adDortmund. \"We've never been to a final outside our own shores. These are opportunities to make a \u00addifference and that's how we have to look at it.\n\n\"We don't want to be burdened by what's happened before. We've got to use this opportunity to change \u00adhistory as a motivation, and that's how the players see it. It's about their moment now, nothing that's gone on in the past. None of that is their fault or concern.\"\n\nAlthough not without flaws, the shootout win over Switzerland was England's best performance of the tournament and suggested an improvement at the right time. Southgate spoke of a \"fascinating experience\" overseeing a team he felt was \"fearful\" in earlier fixtures.\n\n\"[They were] almost concerned about what could go wrong,\" he said. \"We haven't had that for a few years. Maybe that was expectation, maybe that was a lot of external things as well. But now they're very much in a 'What's achievable, what's \u00adpossible?' sort of mindset. I think we saw a truer reflection of ourselves in the last game.\"\n\nThe response, inside and outside his squad, to England's second group game, against Denmark, concerned Southgate and prompted him to address their trepidation head on. Before they met Slovenia he showed them photographs of other sides' more carefree reactions. \"We \u00addefinitely spoke about it,\" he said. \"When you can sense that feeling you need to \u00adconfront it. It's no use avoiding it and hoping it will go away.\n\n\"The Denmark game, the point we got, there's a picture of the \u00adplayers looking distraught. They've got a point that essentially ensured us qualifying. Every other team was \u00adcelebrating with their fans at that, and we were on our knees. So I had to correct how they were viewing things. That feeling was being \u00adreinforced so vocally and actively outside, and I think they were picking up on that too much.\"\n\nSpeaking after England had \u00adcompleted a training session in temperatures exceeding 30C, Harry Kane suggested the sheen acquired through recent successes can carry them through when performances falter. The real fear factor, he observed, may be transmitted by England's players to their opposition.\n\n\"We still haven't reached the full potential you've seen for several years now,\" Kane said. \"But we're still in a good place and leaning on a lot of experience. We're leaning on being here before, even just the perception from other teams. When you've been in finals, semi-finals, on a consistent basis that gives you a certain aura as a team that other nations look at.\n\n\"We've built that up over past \u00adtournaments and now we're in a \u00adsituation where we deserve to be [here]. It's not easy getting through any round and we've found a way to do it.\"\n\nKane acknowledged semi-finals are viewed differently, comparing this year with the newness of \u00ad\"riding that wave\" in 2018. \"You have to \u00adhandle a different kind of pressure,\" he said. \"If you get knocked out in the quarter-finals or round of 16 there'll be a lot more uproar than in previous tournaments.\"\n\nA goal return of two, coupled with some below-par showings, has brought calls for Kane to be dropped but he dismissed suggestions he is struggling physically. \"Sometimes when I don't score I think the fitness one is an easy one to throw in: 'Why? Is there a reason? Is it his fitness?' But I felt I had a good preparation going into the tournament; I feel I'm \u00adgetting better and sharper as the games go along.\"\n\nEngland can call on a fully fit squad who have enjoyed smoother \u00adpreparation than their opponents. The Netherlands' train from their camp in \u00adWolfsburg was cancelled on Tuesday afternoon and led to a hastily scheduled evening flight. Southgate's biggest selection call will be whether to bring in Luke Shaw, who staked a claim in returning against Switzerland and has a chance of displacing Kieran Trippier at left-back. Marc Gu\u00e9hi is also pushing to regain his place from Ezri Konsa after suspension.\n\nSouthgate wants Wednesday to be merely the start of a summer success story. \"Our semi-final tally looks a bit more like what we'd hope an England history would look like,\" he said. \"But there are a lot of nations who have won the European Championship and we haven't.

I thought we saw a better version of us with the ball, freer.\n\n\"I'm not sure any of the messaging changed, but I just felt the group changed.\n\n\"You're now into that moment in the tournament where it's what's possible, what's achievable, rather than what might go wrong.\n\n\"This is now the chance to make history, which we've enjoyed doing.\n\n\"A chance to get to a first final not held in England - first time England will have ever done that.\n\n\"We're trying to break new ground. That's difficult and it's complicated, but the players have responded brilliantly and resilience has been built.\n\n\"You can bond and we've been very fortunate that we've had Ed Sheeran in to sing and it was great, the players had a couple of beers before the last game.\n\n\"You can bond in that way, but when you're having to head the ball out your box in the 92nd minute and you're having to find a goal in the 96th minute, there's nothing stronger than that for building the spirit of a team.\"\n\nThat togetherness has been clear as their two knockout matches went the distance, beating Slovakia 2-1 in the last 16 in extra time before the spot-kick triumph against the Swiss.\n\nNow comes their toughest challenge yet against the team seventh in FIFA's world rankings, just two places below England.\n\nAsked if he expected the Dutch to sit in like many of their opponents so far in Germany, Southgate said: \"That wouldn't be normal for the way Dutch teams play and it's not what we've seen from them.\n\n\"Equally Ronald's an experienced coach, he could approach the game in a very different way to the games they've played already, so we're prepared for anything.\n\n\"I think it will be an exciting game. You've got a lot of very good players on the pitch, a lot of good forward players, both teams.\n\n\"We've got to be another step (on) from what we showed in the last game. It's another step up in terms of the quality of some of the opponents and we have to be ready for that.\"\n\nSouthgate has a full squad available for the first time at these Euros, with Marc Guehi back from a one-match ban and Luke Shaw fit to start after making his long-awaited return against Switzerland.\n\n\"Luke has been injured for four months, so it wasn't a possibility for him to play until the last match,\" he said of the latter.\n\n\"He made a good contribution to the game, so that's the decision we have to make - whether he's ready to start, whether that's the best way to use him.\n\n\"But we're very happy to have him back. He obviously gives us balance, a different balance with the team.\n\n\"But also Kieran (Trippier) has done a fantastic job.

The Three Lions have been underwhelming but continue to push their way towards the final and are very much like France in their approach. The Dutch saw off plucky Turkiye while the English edged Switzerland out in their respective quarterfinals.\n\nGareth Southgate's men are still searching for a truly convincing win and will be hoping to deliver just that in the final. Jude Bellingham and Harry Kane came up big in the round of 16 win over Slovakia, but it was Bukayo Saka who was the hero against the Swiss with a stunning strike. Still, it took penalties to overcome the Nati and book a place in the final four which pitted them against Ronald Koeman's Netherlands.\n\nOranje have seen off Romania in the round of 16 and Turkiye in the quarterfinals so we could say that they are yet to face a true continental giant. Cody Gakpo has been outstanding in attack and joint-leads the top scorers with three goals ahead of Donyell Malen, Bellingham and Kane who will hope to be amongst the goals for this one, having been hot and cold so far in Germany.\n\nHere's our storylines, how you can watch the match and more:\n\nGolazo Starting XI Newsletter Get your Soccer Fix from Around the Globe Your ultimate guide to the Beautiful Game as our experts take you beyond the pitch and around the globe with news that matters.\n\nI agree to receive the \"Golazo Starting XI Newsletter\" and marketing communications, updates, special offers (including partner offers), and other information from CBS Sports and the Paramount family of companies.

England topped Group C but only won one of three games to finish ahead of Denmark, Slovenia and Serbia before making hard work of it against Slovakia and then Switzerland to now face Oranje which is arguably their biggest test so far in terms of stature.\n\nTeam news\n\nNetherlands: Xavi Simons and Cody Gakpo have impressed so far with the Paris Saint-Germain man boasting three assists and the Liverpool star three goals of which two have been provided by Simons. Nathan Ake and Denzel Dumfries should continue to be on either side of the defense although Micky van den Ven is pushing for inclusion after some important late interventions against the Turkish.\n\nPossible Netherlands XI: Verbruggen; Dumfries, De Vrij, Van Dijk, Ake; Schouten, Simons, Reijnders; Bergwijn, Depay, Gakpo.\n\nEngland: Marc Guehi could be reinstated after suspension alongside John Stones although Ezri Konsa would be unlucky if that happens. Kobbie Mainoo looks to be finding a home for himself in midfield next to Declan Rice after Trent Alexander-Arnold and Connor Gallagher while Luke Shaw could now be an option in place of Kieran Trippier after coming on against Switzerland although another caemo might be most likely.\n\nPossible England XI: Pickford; Walker, Stones, Guehi, Trippier; Mainoo, Rice, Saka; Bellingham, Foden; Kane.\n\nPrediction\n\nAlthough England have not been at their best, the Netherlands have not been up against top opposition since their loss to Austria and also went goalless against France. The Three Lions should just about do enough to roar on but only after 120 minutes.

We didn't fully appreciate how much of a demand that was.\n\n\"It's been factored into all our operations for the last few years. For not just managing the day to day, but the weeks we've been away, managing staff energy, managing players' energy. We cover all of those things.\"\n\nEngland benefited from a five-day gap between the last 16 and quarter-final, but are now in the middle of what would be three crucial matches in nine days were they to reach Sunday's final against Spain in Berlin.\n\n\"It's a strange thing where in the biggest games you get less time to prepare and less time to recover,\" said Southgate, who admitted temperatures in excess of 30 degrees in Germany yesterday had added another layer of complication to his planning.\n\n\"You would assume in the biggest matches you get the best preparation, but we haven't really been able to get on the training pitch, you're just walking through things or covering things in meetings, so there is a different physical aspect now, but all of the players are going into this game in good condition, have recovered well.\"\n\nGareth Southgate\n\nSouthgate has used a relatively small pool of players in his starting line-ups throughout the tournament, never making more than one change from game to game, and is expected to stick with that method tonight, with Marc Guehi set to return from suspension in place of Ezri Konsa.\n\nThat would mean Kieran Trippier keeping his place at left wing-back, with Luke Shaw to be used off the bench, despite declaring himself fit to start after finally recovering from a hamstring problem.\n\nSouthgate's hesitancy in using his substitutes has also drawn criticism this summer, with the 53-year-old making changes in the quarter-final only after Switzerland had gone ahead with 15 minutes of normal time to play. Speaking at Borussia Dortmund's Signal Iduna Park last night, however, the England boss defended his approach.\n\n\"We've kept a consistent team and I think the team have thrived through that support, the confidence that's given them,\" he said.\n\n\"I understand people will question when you don't change, but sometimes you feel you are still posing a threat, controlling a game, and I've seen a lot of other big managers hold their nerve and wait a really long time.\n\n\"I don't think you can premeditate things. I certainly know the sort of changes we would make to accelerate the game and you just have to try to have a feel of the flow of the game when it's happening.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_cricket_team", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England cricket team"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovakia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Gu\u00e9hi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marc Gu\u00e9hi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezri_Konsa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ezri Konsa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westfalenstadion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Westfalenstadion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kieran_Trippier", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kieran Trippier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Shaw", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luke Shaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/evening_standard_239/385d8fed98e7041478d0a8f5fc772cb8", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712618", "eventUri": "eng-9712618", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

They could have ventured to World Cups before World War 2 but, in their arrogance and isolationism, chose not to. But they first played in a tournament in 1950, 74 years ago.\n\nSince then, there were four semi-finals: 1966, 1968 (in a four-team tournament), 1990 and 1996, only two of them on home soil. Then came the Southgate years and there have been three more. They are coming at three-year intervals: 2018, 2021 (in the delayed Euro 2020) and now 2024.\n\nMaybe England are living in the golden years, even if they don't know it. They have ploughed the most prosaic path possible to the semi-finals of Euro 2024, but they are there. Gareth Southgate's three semi-finals put him ahead of Alf Ramsey, with two, Bobby Robson and Terry Venables, who reached one apiece.\n\nThe rest - including managers as decorated at club level as Fabio Capello, Sven-Goran Eriksson and Don Revie - are on zero. Two of Southgate's semi-finals will be abroad, as many as England had experienced in their history when he was appointed in 2016; Ramsey and Robson had one each. They have never reached a final on foreign soil.\n\nSo when Southgate spoke after the quarter-final win over Switzerland about being \"ridiculed\" and \"questioned beyond belief\", he had a point. Perhaps, in an age of short attention spans, longevity brings ennui; in a time of overreaction, underwhelming performances from teams who look less than the sums of their considerable parts brings outrage. Yet disparaging England's most consistent manager has become a strange national pastime, notable for the warped way many are desperate to be offended by an inoffensive man.\n\nSouthgate seems to have united various England groups, whereas their predecessors could look fractured and unhappy. Maybe it is a sign of the times that even unifying figures are deemed divisive by the wider world.\n\nThere is a legitimate strand to the criticism. This has been Southgate's least impressive progress to the last four. In 2018, he smashed through a glass ceiling for a team who had not won a quarter-final since he was a young centre-back. In 2021, he had a tougher group, with Croatia, Czech Republic and Scotland, and more fearsome opponents in the last 16, in Germany. In each of his three previous tournaments, England may not have always played sparkling football, but there was an evident clarity of thought, the sense a plan was being implemented by players who knew their duties.\n\nEngland have not shown such cohesion in Germany.\n\nThe head coach has worked his way through three very different midfield partners to Declan Rice. He has, a suspension for Marc Guehi aside, persisted with the same 10 others even if the lack of chemistry has made it seem less a case of strategy than of hoping. His apparent passivity paid off against Slovakia when he didn't take Jude Bellingham and Harry Kane off, and both ended up scoring.\n\nHe has not answered criticisms about his in-game management; there are others with a more intuitive feel for a game, who can play slicker football, who stand for a style of play. Yet Southgate's attention to detail was reflected in a penalty shootout triumph against Switzerland, his determination to create a happier camp in the way the divisions of the past are replaced by the sight of fringe figures being given and relishing such a centrality that they scored three of the five spot kicks.\n\nAnd over four tournaments, the only team to eliminate England before the semi-finals are France, themselves the most consistent team of their era. Perhaps England have become Germany, just without the trophies. And yes, that is a significant difference. There is a case that it would be preferable to be the modern Italy, winning Euro 2020 even while failing to qualify for the World Cups that sandwiched it. But consistent achievement is a feat in itself.\n\nIf England don't win Euro 2024, if Southgate's last game is either a semi-final against Netherlands or a final with France or Spain, it creates alternatives scenarios. Maybe another manager could build on the platform he has provided, adding better football and silverware. Or possibly England relapse: either to the days when they could not win a quarter-final or the time when they could not even get to one.\n\nThere is a notion Southgate is holding England back. Time may be the ultimate arbiter of that but the advantages England have include many they have often possessed: a large country with a deep talent pool, a strong domestic league, players accustomed to competing at the business end of European club competitions.\n\nThe disadvantages are familiar, too: injuries to key players, positions where there are a lack of alternatives, club managers who omit English footballers and build around foreign talent.\n\nIn relatively normal circumstances, Southgate has reached relatively abnormal levels, often by doing the obvious of winning the winnable games. It scarcely sounds revelatory yet in its own way, it has been revolutionary. And if he is approaching his endgame, there is the possibility the age of Southgate will forever stand out in the history of a team whose only glimpse of the semi-finals usually comes on television.",

How about pausing to appreciate he's part of the reason you're in Germany in the first place celebrating more success?\n\nOr back home chucking expensive lager in the air, when England get through another round of Euro 2024? Kobbie Mainoo is still just 19, but has already reached as many semi finals of a major tournament with England as Gary Lineker and Alan Shearer did. So has Ivan Toney.\n\nWhile Harry Kane and Jordan Pickford have made it to three times as many semis. Or if you want to be a little pedantic, three more than Micah Richards. And the reason for this is mainly down to Southgate.\n\nREAD MORE: 'I watched England's Euro 2024 penalty win in Benidorm - it was hell on earth'\n\nREAD MORE: Football fans joke they'll 'give up sleep' to watch viral Colombia supporter at Copa America\n\nA bloke who knows his face will never quite fit with some people, no matter how much success he has. But here's the thing about the good folk from England. For some bizarre reason, despite winning just one trophy in their history, England have an attitude of arrogance of entitlement.\n\nReaching the latter stages of tournaments is not good enough. We should be winning more. There's a little reason Brazil have won five World Cups, and Germany won four. Or Spain won back-to-back European Championships, with a World Cup triumph thrown in.\n\nThose teams were the best on the planet at football at the time. They were better at playing the game than England were. Just because England invented football, it doesn't mean we have the right to win all the time.\n\nAnd the bottom line is England have had some good teams down the years, but not great ones. Otherwise England would have more to show than a World Cup triumph back in 1966.\n\nSouthgate has resembled a man on the edge during Euro 2024. He's had enough of being ridiculed and disrespected by supporters, pundits and the media.\n\nDo you think England will go on to win Euro 2024?

Despite having players like Wayne Rooney, Paul Scholes, Frank Lampard, Steven Gerrard, Rio Ferdinand, John Terry and Ashley Cole, England went more than two decades without reaching a semi-final.\n\nWe appointed less-than-adequate managers like Kevin Keegan, Steve McClaren, Glenn Hoddle and Roy Hodgson, plus proven winners at club level like Sven-Goran Eriksson and Fabio Capello - but all were serial failures with England on the international stage.\n\nSam Allardyce lasted one game, before the FA turned to Southgate. And since that moment in 2016, England have reached a World Cup quarter final and semi final, Euros final, and another Euros semi final, which takes place tomorrow against Holland in Dortmund.\n\nUltimately it's the hope that kills you. But it's better to have that genuine hope of being able to lift a trophy in the first place, than never to have it at all. In short, Southgate has taken charge of 100 games as manager, and after Sir And Ramsey, is the most successful one we've ever had.\n\nHe's given a nation a team to be proud of. He's also given some idiots a side, and memories, they don't deserve. It's a fact of life that we tend not to appreciate someone, or some things, until they are gone.\n\nAnd trust me, win or lose this week in Germany, there will be no better example of this than when Southgate decides to leave his post as England boss.\n\nHow dare Emma Raducanu put the spoilers on Andy Murray's retirement do?\n\nGet invited to his testimonial then decide not to show up?

That she finds it 'astonishing' Raducanu didn't want to jeopardise her chances of winning the women's singles title.\n\nThe biggest of her career, for the sake of an exhibition match alongside someone whose been rebuilt more times than the 'Six Million Dollar Man'. Judy Murray needs to get over herself.\n\nBecause Wimbledon no longer revolves around her son. If the tennis shoes were on the other feet, what does she think her beloved would decide to do? Raducanu's job isn't to indulge in Murray's farewell.\n\nHer job is to think of herself. Because, if she wants to get back to the heights of tennis she once scaled, Raducanu has to be selfish. And no-one should grasp that more than Murray and his mother.", "source": {"uri": "dailystar.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeremy_cross@dailystar.co.uk",

They needed penalty kicks to get past Switzerland in the quarterfinal and were rescued by Jude Bellingham five minutes into stoppage time the round before.\n\nOn the other side is the Netherlands, which has +440 odds to win the competition. They've scored more goals than any of their remaining opponents, but haven't looked solid in defense either. Luckily, they face a Three Lions club that appears more than willing to play a cagey affair.\n\nEuro 2024 semifinal England vs. Netherlands predictions: Regulation Draw (+190 or better), Under 2.5 goals (-210 or better)\n\nSimilar to France, England has not been anywhere near one of the four best teams at this tournament. Their reluctance to attack, questionable substitutions and dependence on late-game miracles have been extremely frustrating for arguably the most talented team at the tournament.\n\nThe Netherlands team doesn't mind leaving itself stretched at the back if it means it can commit more bodies to the attack. They scored five goals in two knockout matches and regularly both score and concede lots of goals. That sets up an interesting stylistic showdown between an England team which is often hesitant to come out of its shell.\n\nEngland manager Gareth Southgate will not play on the front foot unless he is coerced into doing so. The Netherlands' commitment to sending bodies forward but also to leaving itself vulnerable in defense leads us to believe that this will be a back-and-forth match that is ultimately decided on penalties.\n\nThere are multiple ways to bet such a situation, beginning with looking for value with a draw at a strong +190 price. If you want to play it somewhat safer in this low-scoring affair, you can go under 2.5 goals but be prepared to pay a hefty price for it at around -190.\n\nYou must be over 21 to play.

Budden didn't make it much further along the professional football road, retraining as a teacher, a field in which he has since changed many lives.\n\nHis stories are superb - vivid, utterly compelling - and none more so than 'The Boot Room', an apprentice's perspective on the oppressive, racist football culture that teenagers like he and Southgate encountered at Palace back then.\n\nThe central figure is Trevor Cain, the foul and dictatorial club captain. He forces the apprentices to shout, 'You f***ing spastics', at a group of deaf children who visit the club. 'He said it didn't matter because they couldn't hear us anyway.' He locks the apprentices in a dressing room, where he forces them to strip off and fight each other. 'I want proper men. Do you understand? Because this is English football. It's not for ponces doing tricks. It's for men.'\n\nThe old alpha male English dressing room culture, drowning in ego, has been painfully hard to break. John Terry actually thought he was being impressive when recently revealing on a podcast that he had refused to fly on a pre-season trip until Chelsea manager Andre Villas-Boas reversed his decision to seat senior players in economy class and young players in first. 'I promise you the plane wasn't going.'\n\nGareth Southgate (above) has walked England out of its old alpha male dressing room culture\n\nThe Three Lions triumphed on penalties against Switzerland to reach the Euro 2024 semi-finals\n\nSouthgate took over from Sam Allardyce (above) during a chaotic time for England and the FA\n\nPodcast All episodes LISTEN: Southgate only England manager to be criticised whilst winning PODCAST: The REAL reason England through despite playing badly PODCAST: 'Just ONE good performance' could change England's fortunes PODCAST: Are the England team buying into Southgate's style of play? PODCAST: Is Martinez 'spineless' over Cristiano Ronaldo management? Play on Apple Spotify\n\nWhatever the outcome on Wednesday night, Southgate has walked England out of the old version of itself. Had Sam Allardyce not bragged to an undercover reporter that he could break FA rules, whilst on a \u00a33million salary as their England manager, we would have possibly not have witnessed the progressive form of management and patriotism his successor has brought. A successor who has had the intelligence to see the unreconstructed elements of game for what they were, make things different and engender a far broader national affection for the England team.\n\nREAD MOREEXCLUSIVE LISTEN: On today's EUROS DAILY, should we trust England's referee against the Netherlands after his 'match-fixing' conviction?\n\nIt was seven years ago in Dortmund, scene of this semi-final, that Southgate first demonstrated the intellectual self-confidence which told you his managerial reign might be different. English football's lunatic fringe had been at it again, occupying various pubs in the city to sing about 'the RAF from England' shooting German bombers down, and he chose that moment, the eve of his first match as permanent manager, to challenge some established thinking.\n\n'We're an island,' Southgate said. 'We've got to get off the island and learn from elsewhere, look in the mirror and change the way we do things tactically, with our physical preparation, our style of play and our mentality.' Germany might actually teach us something, he observed. The creed of Trevor Cain it was not.\n\nThough we didn't know it then, his voice would become one of sanity, humility and intelligence through some unimaginably difficult years. Before he arrived, no English football manager would ever have answered a question about the team helping salve national divisions caused by Brexit. Southgate did so with confidence on the eve of the 2018 World Cup semi-final against Croatia.\n\n'Yes,' he told us, in a packed little press conference room at Moscow's Luzhniki Stadium. 'The chance to connect everybody through football and to make a difference to how people feel... is even more powerful than what we are doing with our results.' I recall him also saying, that afternoon, that 'the FA' had hired him, then immediately qualifying his words to say 'the English FA'. He was showing that England no longer viewed themselves as football's reference point.\n\nThe arguments about Southgate's tactical conservatism have been more than adequately dealt with here. No need to press home points about his results and track record - three semi-finals in four tournaments for a nation which had won a mere six knockout games between 1968 to 2016.\n\nDespite producing star-studded teams over the years, England have failed to lift trophies\n\nSouthgate has revitalised England with culture, identity and a sense of self-confidence\n\nEngland won a mere six knockout games between 1968 and 2016. Pictured: Gary Neville (left) and David Beckham (right) react after Argentina beat the Three Lions 3-2 on penalties in 1998\n\n'But England have all the greatest players,' the detractors cry, blinded to every other nation's talents by the Premier League propaganda machine. Watching back some of the fly-on-the-wall documentary 'An Impossible Job' this week, I was reminded of what a galaxy of world-class talents England also had back then: Shearer, Adams, Wright, Seaman, Ince.\n\nIn the pre-match press conference before they played the Netherlands in 1993, Graham Taylor argued with journalists as Ince watched on, looking embarrassed. In the dugout the following day, the management team bawled at the players. The team lost.\n\nRead More ALL 26 England players train on the eve of Netherlands semi-final at Euro 2024\n\nSouthgate thinks and doesn't shout. As someone far wiser than me put it this week, 'He talks in words. He doesn't ROAR. He doesn't surge or unleash.' The flip-side to that caution and reflection is perhaps the lack of in-game tactical dynamism. And because of an inverse snobbery, and because of the relentless wish for change, and because hate fuels the social media realm, there are now tidal waves of opprobrium for England's most successful manager since Ramsey.\n\nA manager who has brought a culture, identity and self-confidence which has allowed the team, playing yet another tournament semi-final, to succeed for a longer continuous period than ever before.\n\nSouthgate will probably write his own book when this England race is run. It will go with the one he once co-wrote with another player from those Palace days, apprentice goalkeeper Andy Woodman. They called it Woody and Nord, because Southgate had been known as 'Nord' ever since Wally Downes, one of the Palace coaches, decided that he talked like TV host Denis Norden.\n\nEngland have now reached their third semi-final under Southgate, who was appointed in 2016\n\nDespite his excellent record, several fans have criticised Southgate's conservative style of play\n\nIt is a book about friendship, as well as football and Southgate reflected in passing on his old friend Budden's move into a teaching, a profession he considered far more honourable than his own. It showed that he saw the bigger picture. It said a lot that did not consider himself interesting enough to warrant a book of his own.\n\nWe Aim to Live, by John Budden.

Careless. The most terrible look, bereft of any thought that, star material though she might be, there is a world out there beyond her own.\n\nThere were 'no regrets,' she said. 'I had to put myself first. I have to prioritise myself, my singles and my body.'

Clashes ensued.

So it's about dealing with all that.\n\n\"I think over the years since Gareth has been here and since I've been captain, we've handled that really well and I think this tournament has been no different.\n\n\"The expectation has maybe been a little bit different from the start and maybe the noise has been a bit louder but I think we've all handled that really well and some players will use it as motivation.\n\n\"Some players will block it out and ultimately it's just down to what we want to achieve and we have a really close togetherness, not just players but staff as well and we've all been in the same direction for a while now and that's all we are thinking about.\"\n\nKane is expected to lead the line against the Netherlands despite seeing his individual performance versus Switzerland in the quarter-finals highlighted as a concern.\n\nThe Bayern Munich striker was substituted during extra-time before England secured their semi-final berth with a shoot-out win - although Southgate explained their all-time leading goalscorer was suffering from \"cramp\" at the time.\n\nSouthgate has guided England to three semi-finals in his four tournaments in charge and now has a squad that boasts a wealth of knowledge of performing in knockout football.\n\nThe expectation has maybe been a little bit different from the start and maybe the noise has been a bit louder but I think we've all handled that really well and some players will use it as motivation\n\nIt is those collective memories, reaching the 2018 World Cup semi-finals as well as losing to Italy in 2021, which Kane believes the squad can call upon at Signal Iduna Park.\n\n\"I think you just use the past experiences to help you, we've got a lot of players who have experienced big games on an international level and also big games at club level,\" he added.\n\n\"So you try and use all that experience over the course of your career to prepare you in the best way possible and to control the nerves and control the excitement.\n\n\"We prepared for tomorrow like we prepare for any other game and I just think during the game you lean on experiences, you lean on the leaders in the team who have been there and done that to maybe help some of the players who haven't, but ultimately it's about going out there and taking the opportunity with both hands.\n\n\"We've got ourselves in a great spot and we've got a big game tomorrow to reach back-to-back finals in the European Championship and that would be an amazing achievement and we have the opportunity to go and do that.\"", "source":

The Oranje are very much the remaining underdogs in this edition of the competition. The Three Lions have been underwhelming but continue to push their way towards the final and are very much like France in their approach, but will hope to avoid the same fate as the France side that fell in the final four. The Dutch saw off plucky Turkiye while the English edged Switzerland out in their respective quarterfinals.\n\nGareth Southgate's men remain in search of a truly convincing win and will be hoping to deliver just that in the semifinal. Jude Bellingham and Harry Kane came up big in the round of 16 win over Slovakia, but it was Bukayo Saka who was the hero against the Swiss with a stunning late strike to equalize the match. Still, it took penalties to overcome the Nati and book a place in the final four, which pitted them against Ronald Koeman's Netherlands.\n\nOranje have seen off Romania in the round of 16 and Turkiye in the quarterfinals so we could say that they are yet to face a true continental giant. Cody Gakpo has been outstanding in attack and joint-leads the top scorers with three goals ahead of Donyell Malen, Bellingham and Kane who will hope to be amongst the goals for this one, having been hot and cold so far in Germany.\n\nHere's our storylines, how you can watch the match and more:\n\nGolazo Starting XI Newsletter Get your Soccer Fix from Around the Globe Your ultimate guide to the Beautiful Game as our experts take you beyond the pitch and around the globe with news that matters.\n\nI agree to receive the \"Golazo Starting XI Newsletter\" and marketing communications, updates, special offers (including partner offers), and other information from CBS Sports and the Paramount family of companies.

England topped Group C but only won one of three games to finish ahead of Denmark, Slovenia and Serbia before making hard work of it against Slovakia and then Switzerland to now face Oranje which is arguably their biggest test so far in terms of stature.\n\nDon't miss CBS Sports Golazo Network's Morning Footy, now in podcast form! Our crew brings you all the news, views, highlights and laughs you need to follow the Beautiful Game in every corner of the globe, every Monday-Friday all year long.\n\nTeam news\n\nNetherlands: Xavi Simons and Cody Gakpo have impressed so far with the Paris Saint-Germain man boasting three assists and the Liverpool star three goals of which two have been provided by Simons. Nathan Ake and Denzel Dumfries should continue to be on either side of the defense although Micky van den Ven is pushing for inclusion after some important late interventions against the Turkish.\n\nPossible Netherlands XI: Verbruggen; Dumfries, De Vrij, Van Dijk, Ake; Schouten, Simons, Reijnders; Bergwijn, Depay, Gakpo.\n\nEngland: Marc Guehi could be reinstated after suspension alongside John Stones although Ezri Konsa would be unlucky if that happens. Kobbie Mainoo looks to be finding a home for himself in midfield next to Declan Rice after Trent Alexander-Arnold and Connor Gallagher while Luke Shaw could now be an option in place of Kieran Trippier after coming on against Switzerland although another caemo might be most likely.\n\nPossible England XI: Pickford; Walker, Stones, Guehi, Trippier; Mainoo, Rice, Saka; Bellingham, Foden; Kane.\n\nPrediction\n\nAlthough England have not been at their best, the Netherlands have not been up against top opposition since their loss to Austria and also went goalless against France. The Three Lions should just about do enough to roar on but only after 120 minutes. Pick: Netherlands 1, England 2 (England win after extra time).", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jonathan_johnson@cbssports.com",

The wide-right forward can then tuck inside and link up with the centre forward, leaving the flank open for the rampaging Dumfries.\n\nSTEFAN DE VRIJ 7.5\n\nStrong, experienced and good in the air, he scored his first international goal for nine years against Turkey. Has a good understanding with Virgil van Dijk and the fact he's naturally right-sided means he sweeps across to cover Dumfries.\n\nVIRGIL VAN DIJK 8\n\nLeader of the Dutch pack. Perhaps not as swift across as he was at his peak but the Liverpool star remains a dominating presence who has seen it all. The captain inspires those around him with his aura. Did not give Harry Kane a kick in the 2019 Champions League final.\n\nBart Verbruggen pulled off a number of fine saves to deny Turkey at the tail end of the clash\n\nNathan Ake is imbued with winning after spending his season playing with Manchester City\n\nNATHAN AKE 7.5\n\nDeployed primarily as a left back. Can get forward and supplement attack but more often becomes a third centre-half when Dumfries breaks forward. Mobile, tenacious and knows all about winning from his time at Manchester City.\n\nRead More How the Dutch have ditched Total Football as Ronald Koeman's side bid to beat England at Euro 2024\n\nMIDFIELDERS\n\nTIJJANI REIJNDERS 6.5\n\nElegant passer who started the tournament in a more advanced midfield position, but the AC Milan man dropped deeper as the Netherlands searched for balance in the absence of Frenkie de Jong. More likely to screen and pass than engage defensively.\n\nJERDY SCHOUTEN 6.5\n\nPaired deep alongside Reijnders recently. Another who will circulate possession in midfield with a more defensive instinct. Has filled in at centre-half for PSV. Established in Ronald Koeman's team since the turn of the year.\n\nDONYELL MALEN 6\n\nMain alternative to Steven Bergwijn on the right. Scored an own goal on his only start against Austria, but came on to score two as a substitute as the Netherlands overran Romania in the last 16. Blistering pace.\n\nDonyell Malen was at fault for an own goal against Austria but has bags of pace to call upon\n\nXavi Simons (pictured) is an energetic presence in Ronald Koeman's side - but has struggled to click with Memphis Depay\n\nXAVI SIMONS 7\n\nPlaying in the No 10 role in Koeman's new 4-2-3-1 shape, where he brings energy and vision. Simons can pick a pass and has an eye for goal but lack of chemistry with Memphis Depay concerns his boss.\n\nRead More What England must look out for in semi-final showdown against the Netherlands\n\nCODY GAKPO 8\n\nScorer of three goals at Euro 2024 and unfortunate to see another ruled an own goal. Effective if not fluent on the left wing, and always dangerous at the back post. Enjoys a strong understanding with right back Dumfries.\n\nSTRIKER\n\nMEMPHIS DEPAY 6.5\n\nOnly one goal at the tournament but remains Koeman's favourite centre forward. Perhaps the only one in the squad with ability to create something from nothing. Excellent Netherlands goal ratio of 46 in 97 caps.\n\nTOTAL: 77.5/110\n\nDepay (centre) hasn't brought his shooting boots to Germany but continues to start in the XI\n\nEngland (3-4-2-1)\n\nGOALKEEPER\n\nJORDAN PICKFORD 7\n\nEasily the team's most consistent performer here and, if this tie goes to penalties, England have a huge advantage because Pickford as good as guarantees at least one save.

Or are his best days behind him? Either way, Walker has not shown the same energy he does for Manchester City. He does not see danger as part of a back three and was caught out for Switzerland's goal.\n\nJOHN STONES 6\n\nSome good, some not so good, but below-par on the whole and you worry, against top-class opposition, that his game isn't where it needs to be. Like Walker, he hasn't reproduced his City form.\n\nMARC GUEHI 6.5\n\nThe centre back had been a rare success story before his quarter-final suspension. Likely to return here in place of Ezri Konsa, who was England's best performer at the back against the Swiss.\n\nJohn Stones has been unable to replicate his blistering form for Man City within the England XI\n\nMarc Guehi was suspended to face Switzerland but will hope to make his immediate return\n\nWING BACKS\n\nBUKAYO SAKA 6.5\n\nAlong with Jude Bellingham, he is the reason England are still here. By some distance the team's best performer in the last round. Before that, he had existed in moments and did not look 100 per cent fit. A lot riding on him given others' struggles.\n\nRead More England need the REAL Harry Kane to stand up, writes OLIVER HOLT\n\nKIERAN TRIPPER 6\n\nContinues to do a job out of position on the left and was not helped by being used at wing back against Switzerland, with the space in behind exposed. It's not his fault, but the team lack balance. He's done OK.\n\nMIDFIELDERS\n\nKOBBIE MAINOO 6.5\n\nHe's offered more in terms of creativity and attacking intent than his senior team-mates, but the suspicion remains he struggles to see out games and make an impact over a prolonged period. His spark is needed, though.\n\nDECLAN RICE 6\n\nHe will be disappointed with his performances because the midfield has lacked the control and drive that he is good enough to provide. Still, his commitment and defensive work have been key. Not helped by having three different midfield partners.\n\nBukayo Saka was England's strongest performer versus the Swiss, saving the day with his goal\n\nPhil Foden has not looked like the Premier League Player of the Season but is keen to impress in his favoured position\n\nPHIL FODEN 5\n\nDoes not look like the Premier League Player of the Year and, while there is sympathy with him playing the first four games on the left, he still hasn't done enough when on the ball. Doing well to stay in the team on this form.\n\nJUDE BELLINGHAM 6\n\nWithout him, England wouldn't be here, but if he'd performed to his Real Madrid level, England might not have needed his last-minute heroics. There has been no connection so far with Foden and Kane.\n\nSTRIKER\n\nHARRY KANE 4.5\n\nNot fully fit and there's a strong case for dropping him given how ineffective he has been, especially against Switzerland, when he failed to get into the area enough. It feels detrimental to the team to keep him in, but two goals in the tournament do prove his worth.\n\nTOTAL: 65/110", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail

But for their unsuccessful semi-final against the Germans, this was unquestionably England's best performance, but I had forgotten just how close to Dutch had come to making a much tighter game of it.\n\nDavid Seaman kept his team in the first half, which seemed to be a long string of defensive set pieces before Paul Ince won the penalty for the first goal, and Dennis Bergkamp, well, I could watch him all day even now.\n\nWhen I think back to Euro 96 I don't remember the bad bits - the dour draw with Switzerland and the nerves against Spain, they have all have faded like the memory of that God-awful Simply Red song which they sang before the tournament began.\n\nMy memory is selective where England is concerned, it is the only way I can carry on putting myself through this. I remember the words to Three Lions, Gazza's goal against the Scots and giving the Netherlands their biggest hiding in 20 years.\n\nI have given up hope of seeing the modern-day England rack up that sort of scoreline or even giving me that sort of instant gratification. It must be an age thing.\n\nIt would be marvellous to think that there is that type of performance, a lightbulb moment hiding deep down in Gareth Southgate's squad which will make all the cynicism and doubt disappear, Men in Black style. Even Sunday's penalty win against the Swiss made me left feeling more relieved than elated, and every step they have taken so far seems to have been marked with an asterisk.\n\nIt shouldn't be that way and when you think back to the glorious failures of England's past, would an ounce more of Southgate's pragmatism have turned them into successes? Would the counter measuring years of hurt have been set back to zero?\n\nIf tonight's game can come close to that June afternoon at Wembley, then I might be inclined to chuck on some Fugees, grab a bottle of Hooch and make it 1996 all over again.\n\nEzri Konsa battles with Breel Embolo in England's quarter final win at Euro 2024 (Image: PA)\n\nEngland View - Dan Barnes\n\nEzri Konsa has provided Gareth Southgate with a selection headache in defence - but it is a good problem to have as England prepare for their Netherlands clash.\n\nThere were question marks over who would slot into the backline after Marc Guehi picked up a second yellow card against Slovakia.\n\nThe Crystal Palace man had impressed during the opening games of the tournament, slotting in seamlessly alongside John Stones.\n\nSouthgate opted to switch to a back five against Switzerland and Konsa was thrown in at the deep end.\n\nHe was given the tough task of handling Breel Embolo at times but did an admirable job, using his physical attributes to nullify the Monaco forward.\n\nWhen Embolo managed to get on the scoresheet 15 minutes from time, it was Kyle Walker who had let him get goal-side.\n\nA return to the bench would be incredibly harsh on Konsa after his performance against the Swiss, which is why Southgate finds himself in a tough spot.\n\nGuehi would also be hard done by not to make the side. The only other option would be to drop Walker, or even move him to wing-back. The Manchester City veteran has been a key figure for England under Southgate but hasn't exactly set the world alight in Germany.\n\nKieran Trippier also isn't in his best form but, in fairness, had been filling in at left-back prior while Luke Shaw was unavailable to the Switzerland clash. Regardless of which personnel Southgate picks against the Dutch, England must build on the resilience that has helped them reach the last four.\n\nThe Three Lions haven't conceded more than one goal in any of their five tournament matches so far and while the football hasn't been pretty at times, Jordan Pickford has been rather quiet between the sticks most of the time (penalties aside).\n\nThat record is particularly pleasing given Harry Maguire's absence from the squad. He might have had a rocky spell at club level but the centre-back has been a dependable figure on the international stage.\n\nNow, the backline is in for its biggest test yet against a Dutch squad with some serious firepower in the final third.\n\nKieran Trippier hugs Gareth Southgate after the quarter final win (Image: PA)\n\nEngland View - Marc Iles\n\nBy 7pm tonight, any England fan who has done half an ounce of research will have a good idea what Gareth Southgate's team will look like way before the team-sheet comes out.\n\nThe tabloids tend to write their informed views on the day of the game, dozens and dozens of websites will have had their stab at the starting line-up, and thousands more will have had their say on social media.\n\nWhen you consider the options, there are really not that many realistic permutations, especially when a head count is taken at every training session by reporters who are present.\n\nIt really surprised me that Gareth Southgate had a little nibble at the press 'leaking' information about his proposed changes against Switzerland. It is literally part of their job out there in Germany.\n\nI can understand how it can be perceived as unhelpful but the writers who have spent 24/seven following the team in the last few weeks can't very well pretend they don't know what's coming, when it was obvious to someone like myself, sat miles away.\n\nOf course he was going to match up the Swiss. The shape hadn't worked to that point.\n\nHis opposition were playing quite well, there was little chance they were going to change direction, so with Marc Guehi suspended it was a very obvious move and knowing about it 24 hours in advance was not going to change a thing.\n\nI have had similar grumbles and accusations from managers in the past, asking why I'd speculate on what their team would be, or how it would line-up. And my answer is always the same: \"It's my job.\"\n\nIn this digital day and age, there are surely no true surprises. If Southgate played Anthony Gordon at centre-back, or Kieran Trippier as a right wing-back (wink) then maybe Ronald Koeman would get caught on the hop. But surely an international manager should have faith in his own gameplan and players to get the job done?", "source": {"uri": "theboltonnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Bolton News"},

Regardless of whether they deliver the ultimate success from this point on, this England side will not be remembered as one of them,' Carragher wrote in a column in The Telegraph.\n\n'When you think of the elite-level winners, France in 2000 or Spain in 2008 and 2012 are still fresh in my memory.\n\n'If England go all the way, they will not be taking their place in such esteemed company. What we will have witnessed will be comparable to the victories of Greece in 2004 and Portugal in 2016, when a series of underwhelming displays led to improbable success.'\n\nGreece, seemingly bumbled their way through to the finals at Euro 2004, scoring only three goals across all three of their knockout fixtures, beating France 1-0, Czech Republic 1-0 and claiming a 1-0 win against Portugal in the final.\n\nPortugal, meanwhile, would finish third in their group, with Hungary and Iceland qualifying for the last 16 as the top two sides in the group. The Selecao, similar to Greece, would go on to score just four goals in each of their four knockout matches, notably also beating Poland on penalties in the quarter-finals.\n\n'As was the case with the Portuguese eight years ago, England are defying football logic to still be in the conversation. It is highly unusual for a strong nation to play so consistently poorly in a major tournament and reach the semi-final,' Carragher added.\n\n'We can't escape reality. We cannot dress it up any other way. England have been extremely lucky, first against Slovakia and now Switzerland. They are through to the last four despite performances, rather than because of them.'\n\nYet, some have lauded Southgate for his epic record as England boss, having transformed England's fortunes in recent years.\n\nBut Southgate leads the way having won more major tournament knockout games, seven, compared to any other England manager since 1966 combined.\n\nCarragher's Sky Sports colleague, Gary Neville, lumped praise on the Three Lions boss during ITV Football's live broadcast of Netherlands vs Turkey.\n\n'Southgate's record is absolutely brilliant and when you think about where we were before we came in. When you think about the reception he got when he got the job - I have to say He's the Englishman who knows more about tournament football than anyone in English football history,' Neville said.\n\n'He knows about youth tournaments playing in tournaments and managing tournaments. He knows the good the bad and the ugly.\n\n'We've challenged him to make changes in every game, he makes one change in every game and he's proven himself right. He's got more experience than all of us.'\n\nSouthgate, meanwhile, heaped praise on his side's character and resilience to come up trumps on penalties against Switzerland.\n\nDuring his post-match press conference, the England boss said: 'If I can't enjoy that moment, then the whole thing is a waste of time. I took this job to help. I can't deny when it's as personal as it's been in recent weeks...\n\n'But we're still fighting.\n\n'We showed unbelievable qualities of character and resilience. You have to find ways to win and dealing with everything around them.\n\n'To twice come from behind and and to have that composure was impeccable.'", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType":

While he didn't get the score correct - backing a 1-0 win rather than the penalty shoot-out victory which transpired - it capped a four-out-of-four return in his quarter-final predictions.\n\nHe got two of the other three results spot on, backing 2-1 wins for Spain against Germany and the Netherlands against Turkey, while expecting France to be more comfortable against Portugal than their eventual shoot-out win. If he gets things right again for the semis, we'll be looking at an England vs France final.\n\n\"I don't think anything is going to drastically change in the way England play - they are not going to suddenly find some amazing patterns of play that break the Netherlands down,\" Sutton wrote in his BBC column. \"Instead, if England are going to reach their second successive Euros final, they are going to have to rely on individual brilliance again.\n\n\"I have not just been blindly backing them to get through each knockout round in Germany but they are definitely on the more gentle side of the draw. This is their toughest game yet, and it is going to be very close, but I do think England will edge it... somehow.\"\n\nHe has backed a 2-1 win for England, and a victory by the same scoreline for France against Spain. \"Of course [Kylian] Mbappe could play like the superstar he is, or [Ousmane] Dembele could cause Marc Cucurella problems if he starts... but it is more likely that France will just smother Spain and, even if they do not play well, get the job done,\" he wrote.\n\nWill Chris Sutton go two for two in the semis? Have your say in the comments section\n\nEngland have been unconvincing at times during the Euros, only winning one of their five matches inside 90 minutes. Despite this, though, they are just one game from the final - and Southgate indicated he isn't too fussed by the manner of his team's progress.\n\n\"For me that doesn't matter,\" the England boss said after the Switzerland game. \"The fact is we're there, for the group of players and staff that are so focused on it, and wanting to go the next step, it really doesn't matter.\n\n\"We're still in there, it's where we wanted to be at this point, we're showing signs of improvement, in the way that we've played and... yeah, we've got to keep doing it.\"", "source": {"uri": "mirror.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_victor@mirror.co.uk", "name": "Tom Victor", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Sutton", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chris Sutton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cap (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugal", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Cucurella", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marc Cucurella"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article33198251.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Rangers-v-Celtic-cinch-Premiership-Ibrox-Stadium.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712618", "eventUri": "eng-9712618", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4901960784313726, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

Konsa could keep his spot should Southgate persist with a back three, though.\n\nKobbie Mainoo has enjoyed a positive summer over in Germany and the 19-year-old Manchester United midfield sensation will continue to partner Declan Rice in the engine room.\n\nEngland predicted lineup (4-2-3-1): Pickford (GK) -- Walker, Stones, Guehi, Shaw -- Mainoo, Rice -- Saka, Bellingham, Foden -- Kane.\n\nNetherlands boss Ronald Koeman stuck with the same starting lineup for both of his side's knockout games so far, but there could be one change in the offing in Dortmund.\n\nSteven Bergwijn has been unimpressive on the right wing and his place is under threat from Donyell Malen, who bagged a quick-fire brace in the Round of 16 against Romania. Jeremie Frimpong, who typically plays right-back for Bayer Leverkusen, is another possible option.\n\nWith RB Leipzig's playmaking sensation Xavi Simons sitting behind Memphis Depay and Liverpool's Cody Gakpo posing a serious danger on the left wing, notching three goals in his five Euro 2024 outings and leading the Golden Boot race, the Dutch have deployed a pretty fluid 4-2-3-1 formation. Super-sub Wout Weghorst would be the go-to option off the bench.\n\nExperienced Inter Milan star Stefan de Vrij will again support captain Virgil van Dijk at the heart of Koeman's defence. Nathan Ake is expected to stay at left-back ahead of Tottenham's Micky van de Ven, while Denzel Dumfries offers a bombarding option on the opposite flank.\n\nNetherlands predicted lineup (4-3-3): Verbruggen (GK) -- Dumfries, De Vrij, Van Dijk, Ake -- Schouten, Simons, Reijnders -- Malen, Depay, Gakpo.\n\nThe Three Lions undeniably boasts more talent and experience in these high-profile games. Southgate emphasized this fact following the victory over Switzerland, and it's a factor that should heavily influence the outcome here.\n\nDespite their impressive defensive work, England have struggled to decisively finish off their chances, while their vulnerability to counter-attacks becomes evident whenever they take offensive risks.\n\nThe Dutch, however, are not without their own flaws. Their defense can be sluggish and cumbersome, and they've often lacked midfield dominance and a clinical edge in attack. Nevertheless, they pose a threat with their ability to deliver dangerous crosses, execute quick interchanges on the ground, and unleash powerful shots from distance.\n\nThis clash is shaping up to be a tight contest that could very well go the distance. England's experience and quality should give them the advantage, but it promises to be a nail-biting affair.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"},

Though to be fair, Portugal were a man down from the first whistle.\n\nSpain vs Germany was the only other quarter final that had me invested and amused.\n\nPrediction time, if England get their act together and start to believe in themselves and play some actual free flowing football they should probably come out on top against a somewhat toothless Netherlands. We have the quality and will come out of the gates roaring like we did against Turkey, so withstand that initial onslaught and your experience of semi-finals might pull you to the final.\n\nHowever, if you make it there, you have no shot against Spain, who are better at our game then we are.. or the Master vs Apprentice battle that France will offer by being even more boring and have even more quality in their team.\n\nBring on Wednesday!\n\nStijn (wonder who the ref will be) Amsterdam\n\nMORE ON ENGLAND FROM F365:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 16 Conclusions on England beating Switzerland: drop Foden and Kane, Southgate subs, Saka phenomenal\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Harry Kane is an England 'passenger'; Gareth Southgate should 'crash tackle' him again\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Gareth Southgate 'state of statis' is weird way to 'get behind' England manager\n\nPROS\n\nOnly one player playing slightly out of position (Palmer) but he can handle it.\n\nFour ace penalty takers on the pitch from the kickoff.\n\nNo misfiring Trippier, Walker, Gallagher, Foden, or Kane!\n\nCONS\n\nI really wanted to get Eze into the team, but there's no room, so he'll have to settle for super sub.\n\nI don't pick the team. Southgate does.\n\nBad Hamster (forgive me, I've just had a brainectomy), Manila\n\n...Having seen England limp to another unconvincing result via multiple different formations thrown out there in desperation, Southgate would do well to try a diamond 4-4-2 and go for it against the Dutch.\n\nGK: Pickford\n\nDEF: Trent-Guehi-Konza-Shaw\n\nDM: Stones\n\nCM: Rice-Mainoo\n\nAM: Bellingham\n\nFW: Saka-Palmer\n\nTrent has to start on the right as Walker has been a liability from matchday 1. Guehi and Konza in the middle, as they've both proven they belong on the big stage. A now fit Shaw has to start as Trippier has been less than useless as an outlet on the left. If Shaw can't last the game, then surely give Gomez a chance off the bench, otherwise what was the point of bringing him.\n\nStones has played DM for City as much as he has in defense, plus it would make much better use of his passing range. When the fullbacks bomb forward, he can slot back in to create a solid back 3. Plus it frees up Rice to move further up the pitch, where he's played his best for Arsenal.\n\nRice and Mainoo in the middle, as they're both much more adept at carrying the ball forward and creating something for the attackers.\n\nBellingham at the tip of the diamond, where he's excelled all season long for Madrid. With no Foden or Kane (both truly disappointing so far) crowding into his zone, expect him to get involved and make things happen much more frequently.\n\nUp top, Saka and Palmer as wide forwards with license to roam and switch sides. With them (+Jude) England would have plenty of pace and guile to terrorize the opposition defense, rather than a lumbering, static and seemingly not 100% fit Kane.\n\nOf course, we can fully expect Southgate to start a 5-4-1 formation next and play for penalties.\n\nSanjit (Spain will still win it though) Randhawa, Kuala Lumpur\n\nGareth Southgate makes England suck less\n\nEnglish expectations are out of balance with their team. When we drew with Slovakia they were ecstatic, we were morose.\n\nIf we were to fully realise how poor we are at the Euros maybe we'd be happier with the team and what Southgate is doing.\n\nHere's the finals results of the other 'big 5' leagues in Europe, or those with the biggest population to draw from:\n\nTeam 1st 2nd Total\n\n-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --\n\nGER 3 3 6\n\nSPA 3 1 4\n\nITA 2 2 4\n\nFRA 2 1 3\n\nENG 0 1 1\n\nUntil Southgate came along there was a big fat zero in the total column for England. It took us 60 years to get to the final.\n\nWe clearly suck at the Euros.\n\nWe should not expect to win it, we should be happy to make the quarters.\n\nEngland are basically PSG in the Champions league. Got to the final once, semi-final a few times and spent a fortune getting that.\n\nFanmail for Johnny\n\nI see John Nic is on another contrarian rant today. Apparently, we're all wrong to expect England to play better than the absolute dross we've currently been served up. Indeed, we're wrong to believe that players who have demonstrated their ability vs their peers at the upper levels of the club game to be able to do it in a different context.\n\nAnd critically, we're wrong to be frustrated that Southgate continues to be timid in his selections and changes and should just \"shut up\" as we've never had it so good.\n\nFirst off then, the players. We know they can play well, we've seen each player doing better and against stronger teams, but it's fair to acknowledge that they do this generally in different positions to the ones they're being put in. One of the few players who is in his normal position is Saka, and coincidentally he's our best performer so far. Mainoo has slotted in, in his preferred position and is doing well too.\n\nThree of the defence are playing in theirs and the two centre-backs at least have generally been good. The rest are not really playing where or how they usually do, certainly in terms of what the players around them are doing. The answer is likely as I've always said: don't pick try to pick all your best/favourite players, pick the ones that make the best team.\n\nOn to the manager, is it not ok to be frustrated that a manager blessed with an array of attacking talent that mostly matches the best in the tournament refuses to use it? We should just accept it, meekly and quietly and just be delighted that we're somehow squeezing through against weaker teams.\n\nTo be clear, it isn't a surprise. This is how Southgate operates. God forbid that anyone dare complain. I mean, no one mentions Brexit any more, do they John? And yes, fortune has given him the best record. So we should just sit on the sidelines, and pour on our adulation even as our eyes bleed. If you dare to show dissent, you must be \"hard of thinking\" and be pilloried. A desire to see our team actually play nice football is just a \"precious sense of aesthetics\". Maybe we should all be more like that horse Boxer, eh John?\n\nI'll say it once again: we don't watch football matches for the result, we watch it because of the reasons that make it the \"beautiful game\". It sounds like you've drunk the Kool Aid, John. My, how things have changed. No more raging against the machine, we should instead worship it.\n\nBadwolf\n\n...Any chance Johnny N would think Southgate was rubbish if his team played exactly like they have been playing, got the same results, but Gareth voted Reform and thought Brexit was the best decision ever?\n\nJust wondering.\n\nG Thomas, Breda, The Netherlands (Hup Holland Hup)\n\nMORE ON ENGLAND FROM F365:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 16 Conclusions on England beating Switzerland: drop Foden and Kane, Southgate subs, Saka phenomenal\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Harry Kane is an England 'passenger'; Gareth Southgate should 'crash tackle' him again\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Gareth Southgate 'state of statis' is weird way to 'get behind' England manager\n\nNot a fan of Lineker\n\nSpeak for yourself when saying we all listen to Lineker.\n\nHe's only become a hippie since he split up with his wife. I see it among many people that split up with their partner, they suddenly change their lifestyle to try and get the partner they've always dreamed of, but fail miserably. I am lucky because I am already married to a hippie.\n\nAgain, it's all PR with Lineker so stop listening and don't think about agreeing or disagreeing because it's not worth it\n\nGary is the most banale, boring presenter I've ever seen. I just ignore him until the highlights are shown and so should everyone else.\n\nLet me ask this question: do you honestly watch the game for punditry? Do you watch the match for the presenters? Of course not, so stop pretending you listen to it because all the people I know, couldn't give a f**k about punditry.\n\nIn fact, I think punditry should be abolished because we (licence payers) should not be paying to keep these over paid morons in a job. They've more money than god yet we still keep paying them for more bullshit.\n\nThe Euros format is fine, actually\n\nThere's nothing much wrong with the format of the Euros (beyond the third place strangeness)\n\nThe reason that France are on the same side as Portugal, Germany and Spain is that they didn't win their group. Belgium would have been on our side of the draw too, but they didn't win their group.\n\nWe did win our group, so got to play teams that didn't win theirs. There's nothing wrong with the draw, just other teams' performances.\n\nTom, Andover\n\nDon't worry, you humiliated me, as did other readers in the comments section, with your response although I still feel abuse is abuse. Also, what's my spelling got to do with it?\n\nChris, Croydon", "source": {"uri": "football365.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Football News -"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The Ringer, an American sport and popular culture website, published an article with the headline: \"Can England Bore Its Way to Euros Glory?\"\n\nUndeniably, England have been dull. According to analysis by statisticians Opta, England have had fewer shots -- only 45 -- and shots on target -- 15 -- than any of the teams that reached the quarter-finals.\n\nTheir expected goals - the statistic that predicts how many goals a team should score based on the volume and types of chances created - is 4.36, beneath Georgia, Croatia and Slovakia, none of whom made it to the quarter-finals.\n\nBy comparison, Spain's xG (prior to their semi-final) was 10.31 and the Netherlands' 7.65, making them almost twice as likely to score.\n\nDoes it matter if it's boring? Is it an issue that a squad worth more than a billion pounds has failed to record more than one shot on target in each of the last two knockout games?\n\nShould fans and neutrals expect more from a front line that includes the Bundesliga top scorer, the Premier League and La Liga player of the year, and Bukayo Saka, the player who has asked them to hold his beer while he shows them all how to do it?\n\nFrance and their manager Didier Deschamps - a finalist in the last two World Cups, winning one - have faced the same accusations. \"If we're boring you, you can watch something else, it doesn't matter,\" Deschamps replied bluntly when questioned about it.\n\nSouthgate, when asked if entertainment ever crossed his mind shortly after beating Switzerland on penalties, offered a sarcastic apology, insisting, \"These are not normal football matches, these are national events. Huge pressure. With really young men in the middle of it. Our team's been under enormous pressure from the start and they're doing so well. So well.\"\n\nWe all know about the fans shouting loudly about how boring it is, but when I canvassed the opinion of supporters on the ground who have been in the stadiums in Germany I was surprised to discover a different perspective.\n\nGeorge Smith, 41, has been at all the England games at Euro 2024 and is travelling back to Dortmund for the semi-final. \"We are two more boring performances from glory, I would take that any day,\" he says. \"I think we have a great group of penalty takers now so would be confident if it goes that far again.\"\n\nSmith, who has wide-ranging perspective of England having been at every tournament since the Germany World Cup in 2006, adds: \"While the performances have not been great at all, it's the sign of a good team to win when not playing well.\n\n\"If that's true we are a very good team although it does feel like we have played our get out of jail free card with Jude Bellingham's magic versus Slovakia. The games being so tight have made them emotional rollercoaster for the fans in the stands.\"\n\nNed Pendleton, 38, has been to all bar the Slovakia game. \"The dull football hasn't affected my enjoyment at all -- I've felt this throughout,\" he says.\n\n\"It's just been such great fun going to the matches, drinking with my friends and all the England fans during the day. Then there's been great atmospheres in the stadium, the crowd have been so supportive during the matches.\"\n\nHe recalls the second half of the goalless draw with Slovenia in England's third group game, when the England fans created such a phenomenal atmosphere for almost the entirety that it has been referenced several times since by Southgate.\n\n\"That was one of the best atmospheres I've ever been part of,\" Pendleton says. \"The fact the football was boring was almost a reason why the fans decided to go for it and make their own entertainment.\n\n\"I think it has helped that this is the first tournament since 2016 in an easily accessible fun country where lots and lots of fans have travelled.\"\n\nAndy Hughes went to all the group games and the quarter-final. \"It doesn't matter whether we win ugly or if the football's a little bit boring,\" he says.\n\n\"If a lot of England fans are being honest -- and I go to every game -- we don't expect the football to be as expansive as some of the best teams in the Premier League. That's not how England have been set up under Southgate. And we're OK with that.\"\n\nHis issue, however, is that you can still play good football while not being so expansive and that in recent months England have failed to do that, citing struggles against North Macedonia, Malta, losing to Iceland and Brazil, almost losing to Belgium.\n\n\"We've not won any game in our last 10 games comprehensively,\" he says, but adds: \"All of that said -- I don't think it matters. England fans at the games just want to go through. It's tournament football it doesn't matter how you get there, win ugly, just get through.\"\n\nAhead of the quarter-final I asked friends and family back home about the atmosphere, expecting it to start ramping up, in spite of the football. But Bellingham's stoppage-time overhead kick against Slovakia was not the match thrown onto the petrol-soaked bonfire I anticipated.\n\nIt was a \"weird vibe with England\" one said. Very flat. Another recalled seeing a large pile of flags and bunting in a local shop and asking the owner how many they'd sold. They hadn't sold any.\n\nShouldn't England at major tournaments be about getting excitement bubbling back home? The looking forward to the games, the planning where to watch them, the St George's flags flapping on every other car you drive past, the fun, the excitement, the suspense? The flames of hope fanned by a team going for it in games, daring to take risks for the sake of entertainment?\n\nThose who believe this will never see eye-to-eye with Southgate on the issue.\n\nHe has watched the nations that have come before and lifted trophies on the back of a solid defence and few goals and knows their fans only remember the glitter of silverware, not how they got there.\n\nItaly won the 1982 World Cup after three draws in the group stage, progressing in second place. They scored only nine goals in the six games leading up to the final (adding three in the final). England have scored five goals so far so it would require a four-goal haul against the Netherlands to match that low tally.\n\nCameroon one-nilled their way to the 1988 Afcon, scoring four goals in five games.\n\nDenmark reached the Euro 1992 final with a back five and abused the time-wasting tactic of goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel passing out to a defender, receiving the ball back and picking it up so extensively that Fifa subsequently banned back-passes after the tournament.\n\nSpain, with its exquisitely gifted midfield of Xavi, Iniesta and David Silva, lifted the 2010 World Cup despite losing 1-0 to Switzerland in the opening game and then managing one-nil wins in every knockout round. It was the moment people started getting bored by tiki-taka.\n\nIn a way, Southgate's brutally efficient, data-driven, consultant-like approach to managing England is, in itself, taking a great risk. Do you remember who played in the semi-finals of previous World Cups and European Championships? Not generally. Maybe if pushed.\n\nHis big gamble is to sacrifice the thrill and excitement for an entire tournament if it means England winning a first European Championship in history.\n\nHe will face fan mutiny if it fails. If he succeeds? The achievement will not only travel around the world but will be remembered throughout time in the years ahead.", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "inews.co.uk"},

Cody is the exact same coming off the right.'\n\nKoeman has tinkered around with his side throughout the Euros but appears to have settled on an XI at last, with the highlight being an imperious defence featuring Van Dijk, Stefan de Vrij, Nathan Ake and Denzel Dumfries.\n\nGakpo will start on the left-wing, but there are other attacking threats to be wary of as Meulensteen reveals: 'Xavi Simons can do things, he's a good player but hasn't been at his best and then you've got impact players.\n\n'I don't know what Koeman's going to do on the right-hand side, whether [Donyell] Malen, [Jeremie] Frimpong or [Steven] Bergwijn. I hope he's going to play Malen because I think he has something, he's got a change of pace, can come inside, outside.\n\n'Bergwijn was a bit questionable, people thought why did you play him but that was more to release Dumfries on the right hand side. If he can run forward, he can cause problems Dumfries.\n\n'From set pieces, Van Dijk with his head is strong. Those are the players I'd say can cause real problems for England.\n\n'I think they'll try to dominate possession, try to get hold of the ball and move it around. When you get possession but lack the purpose of trying to open the opposition up, you just keep shifting the ball for sake of it and give it away.\n\n'You can look at the possession stats, but if nothing came of it, you got nowhere. So I really hope that the Netherlands use that possession constructively, to make sure we move it well, quickly and through the lines, asking questions of England.\n\n'Every team that has gone more on the front foot and moved to press England, they were giving the ball up easily and quickly, allowing the opposition all the opportunity to create chances. That's what I want Holland to do.'\n\nMan-to-man, England are probably stronger than the Dutch but have thus far lacked their cohesion and effective tactical set-up.\n\nThere were signs of improvement from the Three Lions in their quarter-final though and with the Netherlands unlikely to sit deep they may have more freedom to finally utilise their impressive attacking talent.\n\nAnd even though Oranje are strong offensively, they have lacked a clinical touch at times at the Euros, and if Southgate can mastermind a plan to stop Gakpo it could give them the edge.\n\n'The only problem is the Turkish team dealt with [Gakpo] really well by doubling up on him, so every time he came inside there was another player to stop that space, so he never had a chance to shoot,' Meulensteen noted.\n\n'You need to counterattack that by having overlapping runs, so he has an option to play somebody in with a reverse pass. Cody against Kyle Walker will be difficult.'\n\nMORE : How England went from dreadful to joyous at Euro 2024 under our greatest ever manager\n\nMORE : Spain boss Luis de la Fuente slams fans who booed Marc Cucurella in Euro 2024 semi-final win over France", "source": {"uri": "metro.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Metro"}, "authors": [{"uri": "callum_mcavoy@metro.co.uk", "name": "Callum McAvoy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Koeman", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Koeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavi_Simons", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xavi Simons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cody_Gakpo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cody Gakpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_Football_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Polish Football Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wout_Weghorst", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wout Weghorst"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil_van_Dijk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virgil van Dijk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Substitute (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video assistant referee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Romania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Romania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austria", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Austria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Austria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donyell_Malen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donyell Malen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Bergwijn", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steven Bergwijn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denzel_Dumfries", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denzel Dumfries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_de_Vrij", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stefan de Vrij"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Nations_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Nations League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arjen_Robben", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arjen Robben"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feyenoord", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Feyenoord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Ajax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AFC Ajax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southampton_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southampton F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSV_Eindhoven", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "PSV Eindhoven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.L._Benfica", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S.L.

The winner of the England-Netherlands clash will face either France or Spain in the final on Sunday.\n\nKonsa Looked at Home in Team Against Switzerland\n\nGareth Southgate called upon Konsa to feature in his starting XI against Switzerland in his new 3-4-2-1 formation. Despite it being the defender's first start at a major tournament, he looked very comfortable. After that solid performance from England, they are now 5/2 in the Euro 2024 odds to lift the trophy.\n\nSouthgate has a big decision to make with his team for England's next game. In the Netherlands vs England betting, the Three Lions are odds-on at 8/11 to qualify from the tie. Southgate must choose to either stick with the same XI that played against Switzerland or to make a change again.\n\nKonsa had an excellent season for Aston Villa in the 2023/24 campaign playing under Unai Emery. He was rewarded by Southgate for his consistency in the Premier League for the Villa with a place in his 26-man squad.\n\nThe 26-year-old is a player who is versatile enough to play in several positions. He could be used on the left side of Southgate's defence, just as he was when he came off the bench against Slovakia in the last 16.\n\nWatkins Ready in Case Required\n\nStriker Watkins' only involvement in Euro 2024 so far was coming off the bench during the 1-1 draw against Denmark as a second-half substitute. The Villa man will be hoping he gets the chance to feature more against the Netherlands in the semi-final.\n\nWatkins scored 27 goals in all competitions last season for Aston Villa. It was his best campaign since moving to Villa Park in 2020 from Brentford. Despite that excellent year, the 28-year-old finds himself third in the pecking order in Southgate's team behind Harry Kane and Ivan Toney respectively.\n\nGiven his record from the spot kick, Watkins may be called upon in the semi-final or final if the tie goes to penalties. Southgate has shown he is not afraid to change his team just before the penalty shootout to bring on better spot-kick takers.\n\nAs frustrating as it has been for Watkins so far in this tournament, his patience may pay off. England have not been at their best, but they have a great chance of winning their first major tournament since 1966, and every member of the squad will go down if they prove successful.\n\nA peak television audience of 16.8 million tuned in to watch England's quarter-final triumph against Switzerland on the BBC.

Holland's tournament so far have been the sea of orange-clad hard-partiers that have taken over every city where their national team has been playing.\n\nVideos have gone viral of the Dutch fans

star power, the Euro 1988 champions - who beat England 3-1 in that tournament - will be quietly confident that they can prevail.\n\nIn the 15 games between the two sides since then, Holland have won six and England just two - but one of those victories was the famous 4-1 spanking at Euro 1996.\n\nFor the Dutch, it will be a sixth semi-final at the Euros, the last four of which they have lost.\n\nEngland, on the other hand, will be looking to reach back-to-back finals at the Euros - a tournament they have never won.\n\nStatisticians Opta assess that the game has a 30% chance of going

It's a huge game. I think we felt at the start of the tournament that England had a decent chance of going far in the Euros,' ex-England and Liverpool defender said on Sky Sports.\n\n'You need a little bit of luck, anyone does in a knockout competition, and we had that in the last couple of rounds.\n\n'But I think with the players we've got, the squad we've got and our recent success in terms of getting to the latter stages of tournaments, we always felt we would get to this stage.\n\n'We're here now so this almost where it all begins for us.'\n\nWhile Kane has performed well below par this summer, Carragher believes the Dutch defence will give England's out-of-sorts attack opportunities to score in Dortmund.\n\nAsked if the match can be boiled down to a clash of the two captain, Kane and Virgil van Dijk, Carragher replied: 'I think there will be a lot more to it than that. I think it's fair to say that Harry hasn't been at his sharpest in this tournament.\n\n'He's got a couple of goals but he's coming up against one of the best and, for me, Virgil van Dijk over the last few years has been one of the best centre-backs in not just European football but world football.\n\n'But he [Van Dijk] has had a couple of moments in this tournament as well where he probably hasn't done as well as they would have liked. The Austria game in the group stage comes to mind.\n\n'And the last game that Holland played, they did well to come back against Turkey, but there was a lot of hairy moments towards the end of the game as well.\n\n'So there is certainly things to look at there and not just Harry Kane, all of England attacking players, that they can capitalise if those chances arise.'\n\nOn the back of a string of uninspiring performances, Carragher is hopeful that it will finally click for the Three Lions against the Netherlands.\n\nHe added: 'We need to see the real England and that may come through playing better opposition because up until now, with some of the players we've got, we just haven't seen enough of what we'd expect, nowhere near.\n\n'When you consider what we've seen from certainly Spain, who await in the final. Even Holland have had a couple of bumpy moments but in the main they've done quite well.\n\n'They have scored goals, looked quite dangerous, and we haven't quite done that yet so hopefully that changes tonight.'\n\nAsked for his prediction, Carragher replied: 'I think England just do it, yeah. I think it will be really tight and I wouldn't be surprised if it goes to penalties.\n\n'Yeah, I think England will go through on penalties.'\n\nMORE : Antoine Griezmann aims digs at teammates and

Their journey hit a bump with a thrilling 3-2 defeat to Austria, but they managed to advance as one of the best four third-placed teams.\n\nIn the Round of 16, they made a statement, dismantling Romania 3-0 and showcasing their true attacking firepower. Their resilience shone through again in the quarterfinals, where they clawed back from behind to secure a hard-fought victory over Turkey, scoring twice in a frantic six-minute spell in the second period.\n\nStefan de Vrij's strike and an own goal swiftly nullified Samet Akaydin's opener, confirming a place in a European Championship semifinal for the first time since 2004.\n\nElsewhere, Gareth Southgate's Three Lions managed to clinch the top spot in Group C despite not playing up to their full potential. Phil Foden, Harry Kane, and Jude Bellingham all showed moments of brilliance during the three games, but consistency to churn out chances was sorely missing. Bellingham's incredible overhead kick necessitated extra time in the Round of 16 win against Slovakia, resulting in Kane's decisive goal.\n\nIn the quarterfinal encounter with Switzerland, England overcame a deficit with Bukayo Saka's equalizer, eventually prevailing in the penalty shootout by flawlessly dispatching all five spot-kicks. The Three Lions now stand just one victory away from securing a second consecutive European Championship final berth.\n\nMORE: Euro 2024 schedule and results, updated LIVE | Who will win Euro 2024? Latest odds and predictions | How to watch all the Euro 2024 action\n\nThis Euro 2024 semifinal kicks off from Signal Iduna Park on Wednesday, July 10 at 9 p.m. local time in Dortmund, Germany.\n\nHere's how that time translates across all of the time zones in North America:\n\nUSA: England vs. Netherlands will be televised in the United States on FOX, while Spanish TV broadcasts are provided by Univision and TUDN. These channels are all available to stream on Fubo, who are offering a FREE seven-day trial. ViX is also an option for Spanish viewers.\n\nRadio coverage of the match can be followed on SiriusXM FC.\n\nCanada: TSN are the main English-language broadcasters for Euro 2024 while TVA provides French options.\n\nIf this match is not available to watch live in your location, or if you're traveling abroad, you can use a Virtual Private Network (VPN). VPNs offer a secure and private online connection, allowing you to bypass geographical restrictions to access your favorite streaming services from any device anywhere in the world.\n\nWATCH FROM ANYWHERE: Sign up for NordVPN (30-day moneyback guarantee)\n\nEngland's much-discussed switch to a three-man defence for the Switzerland game hardly proved to be a significant change from previous lacklustre displays, but Luke Shaw made his long-awaited return from injury as he came on in the second half of the quarterfinal, so he will likely be in serious contention to replace right-footed Kieran Trippier here to provide proper balance on the left side.\n\nHarry Kane was forced off in extra time with an injury picked up during the game, but it seems like he will recover in time to keep his place in the starting XI for this one, despite calls for the captain to be dropped following some anonymous centre-forward displays.\n\nThe Three Lions will also welcome back Marc Guehi from his one-game ban, and he should start alongside mainstay John Stones even though Ezri Konsa performed admirably in his absence last time out. Konsa could keep his spot should Southgate persist with a back three, though.\n\nKobbie Mainoo has enjoyed a positive summer over in Germany and the 19-year-old Manchester United midfield sensation will continue to partner Declan Rice in the engine room.\n\nEngland predicted lineup (4-2-3-1): Pickford (GK) -- Walker, Stones, Guehi, Shaw -- Mainoo, Rice -- Saka, Bellingham, Foden -- Kane.\n\nNetherlands boss Ronald Koeman stuck with the same starting lineup for both of his side's knockout games so far, but there could be one change in the offing in Dortmund.\n\nSteven Bergwijn has been unimpressive on the right wing and his place is under threat from Donyell Malen, who bagged a quick-fire brace in the Round of 16 against Romania. Jeremie Frimpong, who typically plays right-back for Bayer Leverkusen, is another possible option.\n\nWith RB Leipzig's playmaking sensation Xavi Simons sitting behind Memphis Depay and Liverpool's Cody Gakpo posing a serious danger on the left wing, notching three goals in his five Euro 2024 outings and leading the Golden Boot race, the Dutch have deployed a pretty fluid 4-2-3-1 formation. Super-sub Wout Weghorst would be the go-to option off the bench.\n\nExperienced Inter Milan star Stefan de Vrij will again support captain Virgil van Dijk at the heart of Koeman's defence. Nathan Ake is expected to stay at left-back ahead of Tottenham's Micky van de Ven, while Denzel Dumfries offers a bombarding option on the opposite flank.\n\nNetherlands predicted lineup (4-3-3): Verbruggen (GK) -- Dumfries, De Vrij, Van Dijk, Ake -- Schouten, Simons, Reijnders -- Malen, Depay, Gakpo.\n\nThe Three Lions undeniably boasts more talent and experience in these high-profile games. Southgate emphasized this fact following the victory over Switzerland, and it's a factor that should heavily influence the outcome here.\n\nDespite their impressive defensive work, England have struggled to decisively finish off their chances, while their vulnerability to counter-attacks becomes evident whenever they take offensive risks.\n\nThe Dutch, however, are not without their own flaws. Their defense can be sluggish and cumbersome, and they've often lacked midfield dominance and a clinical edge in attack. Nevertheless, they pose a threat with their ability to deliver dangerous crosses, execute quick interchanges on the ground, and unleash powerful shots from distance.\n\nThis clash is shaping up to be a tight contest that could very well go the distance. England's experience and quality should give them the advantage, but it promises to be a nail-biting affair.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"},

Harry Kane is only one behind him, and while the England captain's performances so far have divided opinion, he has a very good record when he's come face to face with Van Dijk.\n\nIt's likely to be a tight, tense night and it would surprise no one if it meandered to extra time and penalties.\n\nWhile the fans here and at home might find that a terrifying prospect, it would definitely make England favourites to face Spain in the final.", "source": {"uri": "itv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ITV Hub"}, "authors": [{"uri": "steve_scott@itv.com", "name": "Steve Scott", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cody_Gakpo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cody Gakpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil_van_Dijk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virgil van Dijk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/War_and_Politics", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/War and Politics", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail/Companies", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play-By-Mail/Companies", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images.ctfassets.net/pjshm78m9jt4/2rxgMdCZFmktrj2BhFW5gy/4c83faf7e9d8650a456842ae9bf070c1/PA-76771678.jpg?fm=jpg&fit=fill&w=1600&h=900&q=80", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712618", "eventUri": "eng-9712618", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

The English, with their abundance of talent and quality, did not provide entertainment in any way.\n\n\"The greatest amount of entertainment surrounding the England team this tournament comes not from the players but from their wives. They provide more pages of entertainment, arguments and glamour performances in Germany than their highly paid men.\"\n\nHe added: \"That those affairs and the ladies in pink slippers and Chanel bags on the runway in front of half a dozen private jets score more headlines than Harry Kane, who again had the fewest kilometres to his name against Switzerland, or the entire, very boring England team says everything.\"\n\nVan der Kraan was also critical of the Swiss.\n\nHe said: \"Fifteen minutes before the end, everyone in the packed D\u00fcsseldorf stadium thought that a team worth one and a half billion euros was being sent home by a country where they have 450 types of cheese and barely 11 reasonable football players.\"\n\nSuch criticism comes despite the Netherlands not exactly experiencing a vintage tournament either.\n\nLucky to beat the Polish last minute and loss to Austria, the Dutch had to once again come from behind late on to beat Turkey in the quarter-finals.\n\nThe press in other European nations were equally keen to hop on the England-critical bandwagon.\n\nSpanish paper Marca focused on Real Madrid star man Jude Bellingham saying \"he did little, like the rest of the team.\"\n\nVictor Romeo wrote: \"Jude Bellingham is exhausted and if the helmsman does not pull the cart, the cart will not go forward.\n\n\"England went through to the semi-finals of the Euro Cup, but their great star is far from the best level. Like the rest of his team-mates, with the exception of the scorer Saka against Switzerland.\"\n\nIn the lead up to the big semi-final showdown between the Netherlands and England, Dutch players have had their say on the England squad.\n\nLiverpool's Cody Gakpo said: \"But they win. They win. That's a good sign. Like us. [Winning] is all that matters, at the end. It's the most important to win. You can play very good football, but if you don't win, you're out.\"\n\nNathan Ake of Manchester City compounded this idea.\n\nHe said: \"Sometimes, tournament football is not always about playing great. They are in a semi-final again. I think every team in the semi-final deserves to be there otherwise they wouldn't be there.\"", "source": {"uri": "joe.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "JOE.co.uk"}, "authors": [{"uri":

But they are one game from entering uncharted territory and, if they can negotiate a pressure-cooker \u00adatmosphere in Dortmund to win the 23rd meeting of these old rivals, they will have achieved something unmatched by their male predecessors.\n\nThree years ago Southgate's players reached the final at Wembley after beating Denmark. But their previous last-four appearance, against Croatia at the 2018 World Cup in Russia, ended in heartbreak and the manager hopes such setbacks fuel their hunger to take the next step.\n\n\"We've risen well to those \u00adchallenges over the years and used them as motivation to break new ground,\" Southgate said of the task England face at the Westfalenstadion \u00adin Dortmund. \"We've never been to a final outside our own shores. These are opportunities to make a \u00addifference and that's how we have to look at it.\n\n\"We don't want to be burdened by what's happened before. We've got to use this opportunity to change \u00adhistory as a motivation, and that's how the players see it. It's about their moment now, nothing that's gone on in the past. None of that is their fault or concern.\"\n\nAlthough not without flaws, the shoot-out win over Switzerland was England's best performance of the tournament and suggested an improvement at the right time. Southgate spoke of a \"fascinating experience\" overseeing a team he felt was \"fearful\" in earlier fixtures.\n\n\"[They were] almost concerned about what could go wrong,\" he said. \"We haven't had that for a few years. Maybe that was expectation, maybe that was a lot of external things as well. But now they're very much in a 'what's achievable, what's \u00adpossible?' sort of mindset. I think we saw a truer reflection of ourselves in the last game.\"\n\nThe response, inside and outside his squad, to England's second group game, against Denmark, concerned Southgate and prompted him to address their trepidation head-on. Before they met Slovenia he showed them photographs of other sides' more carefree reactions. \"We definitely spoke about it,\" he said. \"When you can sense that feeling you need to \u00adconfront it. It's no use avoiding it and hoping it will go away.\n\n\"The Denmark game, the point we got, there's a picture of the \u00adplayers looking distraught. They've got a point that essentially ensured us qualifying. Every other team was \u00adcelebrating with their fans at that, and we were on our knees. So I had to correct how they were viewing things. That feeling was being \u00adreinforced so vocally and actively outside, and I think they were picking up on that too much.\"\n\nSpeaking after England had \u00adcompleted a training session in temperatures exceeding 30 degrees, Harry Kane suggested the sheen acquired through recent successes can carry them through when performances falter. The real fear factor, he observed, may be transmitted by England's players to their opposition.\n\n\"We still haven't reached the full potential you've seen for several years now,\" Kane said. \"But we're still in a good place and leaning on a lot of experience. We're leaning on being here before, even just the perception from other teams. When you've been in finals, semi-finals, on a consistent basis that gives you a certain aura as a team that other nations look at.\n\n\"We've built that up over past \u00adtournaments and now we're in a \u00adsituation where we deserve to be [here]. It's not easy getting through any round and we've found a way to do it.\"\n\nKane acknowledged semi-finals are viewed differently, comparing this year with the newness of \u00ad\"riding that wave\" in 2018. \"You have to \u00adhandle a different kind of pressure,\" he said. \"If you get knocked out in the quarter-finals or round of 16 there'll be a lot more uproar than in previous tournaments.\"\n\nA goal return of two, coupled with some below-par showings, has brought calls for Kane to be dropped but he dismissed suggestions he is struggling physically. \"Sometimes when I don't score I think the fitness one is an easy one to throw in: 'Why? Is there a reason? Is it his fitness?' But I felt I had a good preparation going into the tournament; I feel I'm \u00adgetting better and sharper as the games go along.\"\n\nEngland can call on a fully fit squad who have enjoyed smoother \u00adpreparation than their opponents. The Netherlands' train from their camp in Wolfsburg was cancelled on Tuesday afternoon and led to a hastily scheduled evening flight. Southgate's biggest selection call will involve Marc Gu\u00e9hi, who is pushing to regain his place from Ezri Konsa after \u00adsuspension. Luke Shaw staked a claim in returning against \u00adSwitzerland but will be hard-pressed to displace Kieran Trippier at left back.\n\nSouthgate wants Wednesday to be merely the start of a summer success story. \"Our semi-final tally looks a bit more like what we'd hope an England history would look like,\" he said. \"But there are a lot of nations who have won the European Championship and we haven't. We want to try and redress that balance.\" -- Guardian", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Denmark"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westfalenstadion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Westfalenstadion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wembley_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wembley Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Croatia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Gu\u00e9hi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marc Gu\u00e9hi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezri_Konsa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ezri Konsa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kieran_Trippier", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kieran Trippier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VfL_Wolfsburg", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "VfL Wolfsburg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Shaw", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luke Shaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/ISoanpjUwwWCpb6aHuPdrgnwLgU=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/K5RMPJW7L56XYD7OFMMGNIVVXY.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712618", "eventUri": "eng-9712618", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

No other nation has been more consistent in recent history.\n\nBut when he walked into his post-match press conference, deep in Dusseldorf Arena, to reflect on the occasion, if Southgate thought he was stepping into a celebration he would have been bitterly disappointed.\n\nInstead he faced questions about the lack of entertainment and their \"easy\" tournament opponents.\n\nIt had started relatively jovially, but then Southgate was asked about Jordan Pickford having penalty instructions written on his water bottle and he vented, sharing his frustrations that in the build-up to the tournament England's preparations had been revealed to all by experts who had worked with him to fix that particular problem in 2018.\n\nThat he lost the \"element of surprise\" when his decision to switch formation to a back three for the first time in the tournament had been revealed three days before the game.\n\n\"A lot of our processes have been shared,\" he said, with an exasperated laugh.\n\nAnother question asked if there was \"any thought of entertainment when you plan games, when you plan the way you play, for the neutrals? Because being not easy on the eye is part of the game\".\n\nSouthgate looked taken aback, mustering a measured answer and concluding that \"none of this stuff is easy. But we're in a third semi-final in four tournaments. And for the staff and players involved in that... yeah I think that's a pretty good achievement.\"\n\nHe was asked about his little celebratory dance with the fans after all the criticism.\n\n\"Every now and then you think surely there has to be some enjoyment in this job,\" Southgate said.\n\nWhat a statement to make. And it didn't end there.\n\n\"If I can't enjoy that moment then the whole thing's a waste of time really.\n\n\"I love the players, I love being in that moment with them. I took this job to try and improve English football. Not the seniors but when I first joined the Football Association. And I wanted us to regain credibility on the world stage.\"\n\nThere was a long pause.\n\n\"I can't deny that when it's been as personal as it's been in the last few weeks, on a human level that's quite difficult.\"\n\nThen came a moment that really shocked.\n\nAnother journalist asked: \"The tournament three years ago, the opponents you had to play it was Croatia, Scotland, the Czech Republic, a poor German team, Denmark -- .\"\n\nSouthgate cut him off: \"A poor German team? It had about eight Champions League winners in, yeah?\"\n\nThe most patient man in England, finally losing it.\n\nThe journalist persisted: \"The German team three years ago.\"\n\nSo did Southgate: \"I'm saying they had eight Champions League winners.\"\n\nThe journalist, speaking in non-native English, pressed on: \"And this tournament -- Denmark, Slovenia, Slovakia and Switzerland. Avoiding Netherlands, Spain, France, Portugal. Is it better for you to play better football if the team on the other side is better or are you afraid of coming up against them?\"\n\n\"Are you sure you're not English?\" Southgate asked. It was a joke, but the underlying point remained that he usually gets this kind of thing from his own country -- this was all foreign journalists.\n\nSouthgate made an attempt to explain his view on that but finished with: \"I'm not really sure what to say.\" Another exasperated half-laugh. \"It's the madness of this job, but we've had an enjoyable night and I'm going to try to keep it enjoyable if that's OK.\"\n\nThese are not the words, nor the demeanour, of a man who is overly happy in his job, of someone who is fine with continuing valiantly to keep the tsunami of negativity and criticism at bay, somebody who is planning on sticking around when he lands back in England, regardless of what happens in the next week.\n\nSouthgate always knew the England job was like this -- he has such a rich history with the national team, it is intrinsic to his identity: as a fan, then a 57-cap player, then taking a back-room job at the FA trying to fix the system that underpinned the national team, then as Under-21 head coach, then the first-team manager.\n\nHe knew about the impossible job, as it became forever known after a 1990s documentary, even felt he had helped remove some of that stigma when managers such as Mauricio Pochettino and Thomas Tuchel made it be known they would be interested in taking over from him.\n\nIt was always Southgate's superpower to cut out the crap. But maybe eight years of it and those powers are flickering and fading. During tournament camps Southgate avoids the news, TV, radio, podcasts, papers. He has never much been into social media anyway.\n\nBut the messages still seep through on WhatsApp. Gary Lineker's did, when the former England striker described his team as \"s**t\".\n\nAnd this time the criticism is closing in from everywhere. Those mood-dampening questions half an hour after his quarter-final victory were not from English journalists, but elsewhere. The foreign presses have been savage.\n\nDe Telegraaf, the largest daily newspaper in the Netherlands, described England's win over Switzerland as \"like a William Shakespeare tragedy\".\n\n\"Fifteen minutes before the end, everyone in the packed Dusseldorf stadium thought that a team worth one and a half billion euros was being sent home by a country where they have 450 types of cheese and barely 11 reasonable football players,\" the report read.\n\nFrance's L'\u00c9quipe, with its famous ratings, have been scathing of England's players throughout the tournament, and gave Kyle Walker his third 3/10.\n\n\"In difficulty, the English have relied on their best weapon since the start of this Euro: individual exploits,\" a report read. \"This time it came from Bukayo Saka, a rare brilliance in a dreary evening.\"\n\nSpain's Marca, focusing on Real Madrid star Jude Bellingham, reported that \"Jude Bellingham is exhausted and if the helmsman does not pull the cart, the cart will not go forward,\" claiming that his only \"significant\" moment in the game was when he dribbled down the wing in the 31st minute. \"Before and after that, he did little, like the rest of his team.\"\n\nOnline, closer to home, it has been a relentless tide of hatred. The endless clips, designed to go viral, of fans calling for Southgate to go have been posted since day one. One fan was asked what they wanted to see in the second half of a game and they said for Southgate to resign.\n\nWhy does the reaction not reflect the achievements? Southgate is to his bones a good bloke -- not necessarily a nice manager, he has ruthless streak that is a necessity of the job -- he is measured and calm and reflective, and maybe people refuse to accept those characteristics in their heroes.\n\nHaving covered all of Southgate's major tournaments, this one has felt different. In the short times we get to speak with Southgate he has seemed jaded, a touch short, snappy.\n\nMaybe there is a personal disappointment that he hasn't been able to get this unbelievably talented group of players to put on the sort of thrilling performances that are the only thing that keep the masses at bay. Maybe even the most resilient and thick-skinned person reaches the point where they no longer have the energy to keep those defences up.\n\nYou either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain. Southgate has been long enough in the job to watch himself become the villain.\n\nOr maybe England reach the final, and win it, and Southgate is the hero, after all. He lives to be the hero, and walks away the hero.\n\nThere is always an anomaly to the rule, and perhaps Southgate can defy that convention. He has, after all, been defying convention since the day he was appointed.", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "inews.co.uk"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Navigating tournaments, you need lots of other qualities. It is that resilience, it is that ability to stay composed when you go behind in games, or when momentum's against you? We have won three penalty shootouts out of four. All those little bits build character, build belief.\"\n\nPortuguese star Cristiano Ronaldo has taken to social media following Portugal's penalty shoot-out defeat to France on Friday.\n\nFor the first major tournament of his career, the 39-year-old failed to find the net as Roberto Martinez's side exited in the last eight, fuelling speculation that the former Manchester United and Real Madrid star would call time on his international career.\n\nWhile his immediate plans on that front remain unclear, the forward has thanked fans on social media for their support this summer in Germany.\n\n\"We wanted more. We deserved more. For us. For each one of you. For Portugal,\" said Ronaldo.\n\n\"We are grateful for everything you have given us and for everything we have achieved so far. On and off the field, I am sure that this legacy will be honoured and will continue to be built.

In total, he has won 63 games, lost 17 and drawn 20.\n\nSpain are the only nation to have successfully defended their European Championship title, having gone all the way in both 2008 and 2012, while

England's run to the Euro 2024 semi-final certainly hasn't been one of those classic cases of a team finding itself as a tournament goes on. So much around Southgate's side still doesn't make sense, bar their own iron will, as was all illustrated so chaotically in that quarter-final victory over Switzerland.\n\nWhat is maybe most significant is that this doesn't feel as important as it did even a week ago, whatever about three weeks ago. England very much don't start like they'll finish, and this doesn't seem to matter that much. By contrast, the eventual changes seem to result in the winning of ties.\n\nThat doesn't actually mean Southgate has stumbled on what works, though, in another way that can happen in such games.\n\nIt's more that England do what is required in the moment, only to revert to type and retreat. They were again hanging on against the Swiss, who wasted a series of openings. It isn't really the same as the kind of dependable rigour England showed in previous Southgate campaigns.\n\nA tournament team have become a moments team, that are characterised by a more ad hoc quality. It's just as well Southgate has so many individual match-winners.\n\nThe manager, for his part, might say this was what he always meant by \"finishers\". This was a concept that Southgate took from his ample research into other sports, particularly rugby. The idea was to encourage the squad to think more collectively, and that there shouldn't be the same hang-up about starting games. Given the number of subs now possible, and the intensity of modern football, many players are going to get more opportunities.\n\nSouthgate made a point of stressing this in his very first comment to media after the game.\n\n\"So many bits of behind-the-scenes work that have played a part in tonight, like Luke [Shaw] getting back on the pitch, medical team, physical performance team, as well as Luke, penalties, so many people involved in that, different departments, preparation for the game, tactical plan.\n\n\"We've got such good staff, I'm so fortunate to have that support, the players are showing such amazing togetherness, camaraderie, their involvement from the bench when they're coming into the game is huge, and it's great so many of them are getting these little moments where they shine, because they are all playing a part, they don't all get the headlines but, tonight, you could write a story about any number of them, really.\"\n\nIvan Toney, previously a player at this tournament used almost exclusively to replicate opposition forwards at training, has become a fine example in how he's been influential to two huge moments. He set up Harry Kane's winner against Slovakia and then scored maybe the pick of the penalties against Switzerland.\n\nThe nonchalant manner with which he spoke about it was almost what it put above the rest. \"I wouldn't say pressure. I just do what I always do... step up and roll it into the net.\n\n\"I never look at the ball. People might think it's strange but it's my routine.\"\n\nIt's all so relaxed, which is perhaps why Southgate seems to take a similar attitude to bigger questions about his team. It is why there doesn't need to be the same frenzy about the first XI for any given match.\n\nIt is why he evidently isn't going to obsess about what has become the biggest question, that Toney's contribution touches on. That is what to do with Kane.\n\nIt has got to the point where, rather than just not impacting games, the captain and star striker is actively slowing England down.\n\nSouthgate would never properly address such doubts about a player he considers one of his best lieutenants, mostly out of loyalty, but he was at least more expansive on Kane's performance.\n\n\"All of the games have been slightly different, I thought he did a super job for the team in terms of defensively, his positioning, his understanding of where he needed to be, he's perhaps not flowing as he's arriving in those deeper areas as sometimes he looks with his passing and stuff, but he's still playing an immense part for the group.\"\n\nThis is the message now.\n\nThat still doesn't mean it's the optimum way to go about trying to win this tournament, or beating Netherlands. Southgate still has so much to solve, and the danger of trying to do so mid-match is that it leaves a team so much more hostage to fortune. There were only centimetres between Xherdan Shaqiri hitting the bar from a corner and hitting the net, and a similar moment could easily go the other way against the Dutch if England persist in being so chaotic.\n\nThe return of Shaw will help. Southgate might now be able to play the 4-2-3-1 he always planned. That is worth a chance.\n\nIt will likely mean the manager is more inclined to keep the same team - with Kane at the top. The striker's low number of touches have already drawn comparisons with Cristiano Ronaldo, although it isn't really the same thing. Southgate does want to use him in a different way. The question may be whether a faster striker is better suited to the latter stages, when a game is stretched. In other words, a finisher.\n\nToney may come in then. It would show how England's campaign has come on. As with games, they may indeed finish the tournament in a very different manner to how they started.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southgate,_London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southgate, London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southgate, London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Toney", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ivan Toney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rugby football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovakia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xherdan_Shaqiri", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xherdan Shaqiri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Formation (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristiano_Ronaldo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cristiano Ronaldo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/087ba996e6cdb8cbaffc2834c6813f61", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712618", "eventUri": "eng-9712618", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-04-02", "dateEnd": "-03-01", "textStart": 4747, "textEnd": 4754}], "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 120, "relevance": 1}

Netherlands rank sixth for possession at 55.09 per cent, and press more aggressively than England or France, allowing opponents 13.2 passes per defensive action.\n\nThey want to play, and an open contest could prove more to England's liking. These are five areas England can target.\n\nCounter-attack down the left\n\nWhile Netherlands' formation is written down as a 4-3-3 or 4-2-3-1, the asymmetry of their two full-backs mean they morph into a back three in possession. Denzel Dumfries, who plays as a wing-back for his club Inter Milan, runs free to join Netherlands' forward line from right-back, while left-back Nathan Ake tucks in to play like a third centre-back.\n\nThis means the Dutch are more stretched defensively down their right, with Stefan de Vrij asked to cover Dumfries' raids forward and defend the right-hand channel. With Virgil van Dijk, Ake and, later in the game, Micky van de Ven patrolling the left side of Netherlands' defence, opportunity knocks on the other side. Austria's three goals against the Dutch were all created with moves down their left flank.\n\nThe problem for England is that their left side has been an attacking void in this tournament. The return of Luke Shaw to the starting XI could enliven it. On a horses-for-courses basis, there is a strong case for putting a runner such as Ollie Watkins or Anthony Gordon in this space. It appears unlikely Southgate will do so.\n\nMaximise set-pieces\n\nFor a squad featuring De Vrij, Van Dijk, Ake, Van de Ven and Matthijs de Ligt, Netherlands have looked strangely shaky defending crosses into their penalty area. Goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen was called into action on a couple of occasions when Turkey piled on the pressure in search of an equaliser in their quarter-final.\n\nThe Dutch rank 17th of 24 teams at Euro 2024 for expected goals conceded from set-pieces, giving up 0.39xG per 90 minutes from dead-ball situations. France, Spain and England have conceded just 0.08, 0.09 and 0.12xG from set-pieces per 90 minutes, the sort of return you would expect from potential tournament winners.\n\nNetherlands have also been far from dominant in the opposition's penalty area, ranking 16th for expected goals created from set-pieces with a meagre 0.19 per 90 minutes. England must improve their delivery and set-piece efficiency, though. They rank 15th for expected goals created from set-pieces, a far cry from the 2018 World Cup when their love train and bus stop routines befuddled teams.\n\nUse system change to smother Depay\n\nWhen Memphis Depay joined Manchester United in 2015 for an ill-fated spell at Old Trafford, he was classed as a direct and skillful wide player.\n\nNow 30, Depay occupies more central positions. His role as the national team's false nine prompts much debate in the Netherlands but, while Depay can frustrate, he can also produce some exquisite touches, flicks and first-time lay-offs.\n\nSome of his combination play calls to mind Roberto Firmino at Liverpool, playing in the space between the opposition's midfield and backline and drawing defenders out of position. Depay's touchmap from the quarter-final against Turkey shows how frequently he receives the ball in these dangerous pockets of space.\n\nWhen playing against a false nine, there is the dilemma of whether they should be tracked by a defender or passed on to a central midfielder. Given Declan Rice and Kobbie Mainoo are likely to come up against three Dutch midfielders, they could be otherwise engaged.\n\nSouthgate switched to a back five against Switzerland, and one virtue of this system is it emboldens defenders to step in and be aggressive, knowing they have cover. John Stones can get tight to Depay, with Kyle Walker and Marc Guehi covering around the Man City defender.\n\nShow Van Dijk to his left foot\n\nAs England fans will be well aware, Van Dijk's long-range distribution from the back is an attacking weapon. In a Liverpool shirt, he looks to shift the ball to his right foot and open up his body to send raking diagonals out to Mohamed Salah or Trent Alexander-Arnold. He will look to find Dumfries with similar passes.\n\nEngland's pressing strategy on Wednesday should be aimed at limiting Van Dijk's influence. This could be done by shaping England's pressure from right-to-left, leaving De Vrij as the spare player and encouraging the Dutch to play down that side. Or if Netherlands do play down their left to Van Dijk, by pressing him from his right to encourage either a lateral pass to Ake or a riskier ball forward with his weaker foot. Van Dijk's pass map against Turkey shows he is more vulnerable to misplaced passes when playing short and to the left.\n\nHarry Kane has looked laboured when defending from the front, but shepherding Van Dijk away from his right foot could be one of his key details on Wednesday.\n\nCarry the ball through midfield\n\nIn Mainoo, Rice and Jude Bellingham, England have three players who are capable of breaking lines by dribbling through central zones. Once they push the ball out of their feet and get into stride, all three are very difficult to stop.\n\nShould Koeman stick with the system he used against Turkey, Netherlands will operate with two specialist central midfielders and Xavi Simons in front of them in a No 10 position. That puts a lot of strain on Jerdy Schouten and Tijjani Reijnders, who are tidy technicians but not the strongest of defenders, especially in transition.\n\nAccording to football data website FBRef, Schouten and Reijnders rank in the 56th and 17th percentile for players tackled per 90 minutes among central midfielders in Europe's big five leagues. There is potentially a soft centre that England's running power can exploit.", "source": {"uri": "telegraph.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nEngland face Netherlands in the Euro 2024 semi-finals as Gareth Southgate aims to guide his team to a second successive European Championship final.\n\nLast time, in 2021, it was despair for the English. An Italian outfit captained by legendary Juventus centre-back Giorgio Chiellini defeated the Three Lions 3-2 on penalties at Wembley.\n\nEngland have been far from impressive so far this tournament, and have done well to get this far, although they are on the more favourable side of the draw. The Netherlands will be the first top quality opposition they have faced all tournament.\n\nAt the helm of the bid for glory is Southgate, a man who cops a fair amount of criticism from England fans, but has done very well in recent times.\n\nWhat is Gareth Southgate's net worth?\n\nAccording to figures from 2020, Southgate is worth over \u00a39million.\n\nThe 53-year-old is the highest-paid manager at Euro 2024, raking in over a reported \u00a35million per year at the moment. Therefore, that \u00a39m figure is likely to be far higher given how much he currently takes home per year as England boss.\n\nThe next-best paid is Germany manager Julian Nagelsmann. Formerly Bayern Munich manager between 2021 and 2023, the 36-year-old takes home \u00a3200,000 less than Southgate at \u00a34.8m.\n\nFor context, Luis de la Fuente, who is at the helm for favourites Spain, is on just \u00a31m a season. The lowest paid at this year's tournament is Willy Sagnol of Georgia, who makes \u00a3170,000 a season.\n\nEngland future\n\nSouthgate has publicly stated that if England do not win the Euros, he likely will not remain in his role.\n\nHowever, the FA would like him to stay with the squad until the 2026 World Cup, which takes place in the United States, Canada and Mexico.\n\nSouthgate's contract with the FA expires in December, and he told German newspaper BILD: \"If we don't win, I probably won't be here anymore. Then it might be the last chance.\n\n\"I think about half the national team coaches leave after a tournament -- that's the nature of international football.\n\n\"I've been here for almost eight years now and we've been close. So I know that you can't keep standing in front of the public and saying, 'A little bit more please', because at some point, people lose faith in your message.\n\n\"If we want to be a great team and I want to be a top coach, then you have to deliver in the big moments.\"\n\nInfluencer daughter and family\n\nSouthgate's daughter Mia is a budding fashion influencer on social media and has over 4,000 followers on Instagram. She also has a separate account called 'Mia's Wardrobe' where she posts daily outfit inspiration.\n\nSouthgate has been with wife Alison Bird since the England manager was just a trainee at Crystal Palace. The pair were married in 1997 and currently live in Harrogate, Yorkshire.\n\nThe couple have a second child - Flynn. He's 20 and four years younger than older sister Mia. Flynn has opted to go for a career far away from football and is a trainee lawyer. He has a BA degree in politics after studying at King's College in London.", "source": {"uri": "walesonline.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "WalesOnline"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Netherlands rank sixth for possession at 55.09 per cent, and press more aggressively than England or France, allowing opponents 13.2 passes per defensive action.\n\nThey want to play, and an open contest could prove more to England's liking. These are five areas England can target.\n\nWhile Netherlands' formation is written down as a 4-3-3 or 4-2-3-1, the asymmetry of their two full-backs mean they morph into a back three in possession. Denzel Dumfries, who plays as a wing-back for his club Inter Milan, runs free to join Netherlands' forward line from right-back, while left-back Nathan Ake tucks in to play like a third centre-back.\n\nThis means the Dutch are more stretched defensively down their right, with Stefan de Vrij asked to cover Dumfries' raids forward and defend the right-hand channel. With Virgil van Dijk, Ake and, later in the game, Micky van de Ven patrolling the left side of Netherlands' defence, opportunity knocks on the other side. Austria's three goals against the Dutch were all created with moves down their left flank.\n\nThe problem for England is that their left side has been an attacking void in this tournament. The return of Luke Shaw to the starting XI could enliven it. On a horses-for-courses basis, there is a strong case for putting a runner such as Ollie Watkins or Anthony Gordon in this space. It appears unlikely Southgate will do so.\n\nFor a squad featuring De Vrij, Van Dijk, Ake, Van de Ven and Matthijs de Ligt, Netherlands have looked strangely shaky defending crosses into their penalty area. Goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen was called into action on a couple of occasions when Turkey piled on the pressure in search of an equaliser in their quarter-final.\n\nThe Dutch rank 17th of 24 teams at Euro 2024 for expected goals conceded from set-pieces, giving up 0.39xG per 90 minutes from dead-ball situations. France, Spain and England have conceded just 0.08, 0.09 and 0.12xG from set-pieces per 90 minutes, the sort of return you would expect from potential tournament winners.\n\nNetherlands have also been far from dominant in the opposition's penalty area, ranking 16th for expected goals created from set-pieces with a meagre 0.19 per 90 minutes. England must improve their delivery and set-piece efficiency, though. They rank 15th for expected goals created from set-pieces, a far cry from the 2018 World Cup when their love train and bus stop routines befuddled teams.\n\nWhen Memphis Depay joined Manchester United in 2015 for an ill-fated spell at Old Trafford, he was classed as a direct and skillful wide player.\n\nNow 30, Depay occupies more central positions. His role as the national team's false nine prompts much debate in the Netherlands but, while Depay can frustrate, he can also produce some exquisite touches, flicks and first-time lay-offs.\n\nSome of his combination play calls to mind Roberto Firmino at Liverpool, playing in the space between the opposition's midfield and backline and drawing defenders out of position. Depay's touchmap from the quarter-final against Turkey shows how frequently he receives the ball in these dangerous pockets of space.\n\nWhen playing against a false nine, there is the dilemma of whether they should be tracked by a defender or passed on to a central midfielder. Given Declan Rice and Kobbie Mainoo are likely to come up against three Dutch midfielders, they could be otherwise engaged.\n\nSouthgate switched to a back five against Switzerland, and one virtue of this system is it emboldens defenders to step in and be aggressive, knowing they have cover. John Stones can get tight to Depay, with Kyle Walker and Marc Guehi covering around the Man City defender.\n\nAs England fans will be well aware, Van Dijk's long-range distribution from the back is an attacking weapon. In a Liverpool shirt, he looks to shift the ball to his right foot and open up his body to send raking diagonals out to Mohamed Salah or Trent Alexander-Arnold. He will look to find Dumfries with similar passes.\n\nEngland's pressing strategy on Wednesday should be aimed at limiting Van Dijk's influence. This could be done by shaping England's pressure from right-to-left, leaving De Vrij as the spare player and encouraging the Dutch to play down that side. Or if Netherlands do play down their left to Van Dijk, by pressing him from his right to encourage either a lateral pass to Ake or a riskier ball forward with his weaker foot. Van Dijk's pass map against Turkey shows he is more vulnerable to misplaced passes when playing short and to the left.\n\nHarry Kane has looked laboured when defending from the front, but shepherding Van Dijk away from his right foot could be one of his key details on Wednesday.\n\nIn Mainoo, Rice and Jude Bellingham, England have three players who are capable of breaking lines by dribbling through central zones. Once they push the ball out of their feet and get into stride, all three are very difficult to stop.\n\nShould Koeman stick with the system he used against Turkey, Netherlands will operate with two specialist central midfielders and Xavi Simons in front of them in a No 10 position. That puts a lot of strain on Jerdy Schouten and Tijjani Reijnders, who are tidy technicians but not the strongest of defenders, especially in transition.\n\nAccording to football data website FBRef, Schouten and Reijnders rank in the 56th and 17th percentile for players tackled per 90 minutes among central midfielders in Europe's big five leagues. There is potentially a soft centre that England's running power can exploit.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

"England's dream of Euro 2024 glory remains very much alive but their performances have not been typical of champions-in-waiting.\n\nConservatism has been the name of the game for The Three Lions under Gareth Southgate, whose side has lacked the attacking spark of those left in the competition.\n\nSpain have been the standouts, playing some excellent football to reach the final four while the Netherlands have found the net with regularity.\n\nFrance meanwhile, despite their own conservatism, are a winning machine as evidenced by their runs to the last two World Cup finals.\n\nEngland have looked nervy in each of their fixtures, beating Serbia by a goal before settling for drab draws with Denmark and Slovenia.\n\nTheir last 16 win against Slovakia came in extra-time, while they needed a penalty shootout to get the better of Switzerland in the quarter-finals.\n\nStill, they have benefitted from being in a weaker side of the draw and will harbour hopes of beating the Dutch on Wednesday to reach another major final under Southgate.\n\nWhether they have what it takes to go on and win a major trophy for the first time since 1996 remains to be seen, but they have had some serious backing.\n\nAccording to Ladbrokes, the majority of punters have backed England to win Euro 2024 outright, ahead of Spain, France and the Netherlands.\n\nA sizable 31.8% of outright bets have been placed on Southgate's side, more than bookies' favourites Spain who have been the subject of 29.2% of bets.\n\n24.1% have opted for France with just 14.9% choosing to take a punt on the Netherlands after they came from behind to beat Turkiye.\n\nA big surprise on the evidence of what we have seen from England this tournament.\n\nHowever, as ex-Ireland star Kevin Kilbane pointed out, there has

The Netherlands beat Romania in the Round of 16 (3-0) and Turkey (2-1) in the quarterfinal to set up the showdown vs. England.\n\n\"We're here for a reason, Holland are here for a reason and may the best team win,\" England midfielder Declan Rice said.\n\nEngland has never won the Euros, finishing runner-up in 2020, while the Netherlands won the tournament back in 1988.\n\nFollow along for live updates from Wednesday's match in Dortmund:\n\nJim Reineking: Netherlands 2, England 1 - When will England's inevitable choke in a major international tournament happen? It had to sweat out wins against Slovakia in the Round of 16 (two very late goals to win) and Switzerland in the quarterfinals (in a penalty shootout). Well, England's luck will run out Wednesday against the Netherlands. Led by Golden Boot candidate Cody Gakpo, the Netherlands has displayed a more potent offense than England so far (nine goals vs. five for the Three Lions) and that will be the difference in reaching Sunday's final vs. Spain.\n\nJesse Yomtov: England 1, Netherlands 1 (ENG wins in penalties) - Say what you will about England's crawl to the semifinals, but the team showed incredible resolve in its two knockout round wins to grab late equalizers and force extra time against Slovakia and Switzerland. This game should be more open than some of England's other contests in this tournament and the Three Lions can be expected to look more dangerous in attack.\n\nContributing: Reuters\n\nWe occasionally recommend interesting products and services.

The path to the semi-final has been very difficult for both teams and will require them to be at their best to reach the finals.\n\nEngland will look to reach their second successive final as they come into this game after defeating Switzerland in the shootouts, which was more of a relief than a redemption. It would require improvement on their past performances if they were to reach the finals and not repeat what happened in the previous edition against Italy.\n\nGoalscoring has been a problem for Southgate's boys, but when asked at the press conference, he said, \"We're not able to score a load of goals at the moment. But again, we've played three teams that play back fives, very well organised defences.\"\n\nThe Dutch, on the other hand, have fared well in attack, scoring nine goals in EURO 2024. The team will highly depend on the tournament's joint top scorer, Coady Gakpo, to trouble the England defenders. It also needs to be stronger at the back to reach the final for the first time since 1988. They were exploited in dead-ball situations by the opponents, and Southgate will also look to do the same.\n\nWhere to get the live telecast of Netherlands vs England, EURO 2024 Semi-Final game in India?\n\nSony Sports Network are the official broadcasters of UEFA Euro 2024 in India.

Euro 2024 second semifinal preview", "body": "Today we will have the second semifinal of Euro 2024, after which we will fully form a pair of finalists. The Netherlands, with their phenomenal run, will meet England, which is still among the favorites to win the championship. Unlike the English, the Dutch have a Euro victory in their history and will definitely not refuse to take the trophy again. OBOZ.UA collected the main facts around the game and prepares you for the most unpredictable confrontation.\n\nWho overcame the performance crisis better?\n\nOf course, this semifinal raises a lot of questions about the performance of both teams. The players began to reach a high level only after the groups, but the realization never fully unfolded. Koeman's men easily beat Romanians but barely got past the Turks. Southgate's team, on the other hand, needs to feel a special welcome and hate from the stands to finally hit the opponent's goal. In short, we need to hope that the Netherlands will not be afraid of the giant, and England will not wait long for the right moment.\n\nThe Netherlands realized that the European title was at stake only after the group stage. They were very lucky to jump out of the quartet through the third place table. Since then, the national team has been fighting for every single episode and even creating comebacks, like in the match against Turkey. The reward was not long in coming: this is their first semifinal appearance in a major European tournament in twenty years. Journalists note the complete relaxation of the Orange team at training, as if they are not worried and are ready to face the most risky experiments of the opponent.\n\nOn the other hand, it's hard to find a person without high expectations among English football connoisseurs and especially loyal fans. England has never won the Euros, so players of this level are required to do their best, not play defensive football without sharp moments ahead. Although the players themselves, as well as the coach, do not see this as a problem: Luke Shaw said that they need to win. And it doesn't matter at what cost because the team is in the semifinals even if people don't like the performance on the field. And anyway, look at the players at training: despite the catastrophic criticism from their own fans, there is a rather friendly atmosphere.\n\nPrevious meetings\n\nThe history of meetings between England and the Netherlands has 31 matches, but they were mostly friendly. Only 6 games were official, and the total advantage was on the side of the... Orange team! Yes, you're not imagining things. They were stronger three times (UEFA EURO 88, World Cup qualification 94 and LN 19), and the Lions won once again (at Euro 96). The last official meeting dates back to the League of Nations in 2019, and then in extra time the English were beaten by an auto-goal and the efforts of Promes. Today's game is an opportunity for the Dutch to improve their statistics, and for the English to regain their name in this pair.\n\nThe teams are 110% ready in terms of personnel\n\nBoth coaches can count on a full complement of players - 26 on each side - who are ready to fight for a ticket to the final in their own style. The Netherlands has more key players, including van Dijk, Depay, assistant Simons, and Cody Gakpo, one of the best Euro scorers. The winger himself noted that being in the semifinals is a strong result but not the final one. Ambition will lead his team to the final.\n\nPickford will remain England's main man until the end. The team relies on the goalkeeper's reflexes, vision and ability to deliver the longest pass with unique accuracy. Before the match, he noted the special style of the Dutch that he would face and emphasized that this pressure would push him forward! We all saw how expressive the goalkeeper was during and after the penalty shootout last time, so he definitely won in terms of his energy for the game.\n\nIn the center of the field, the incredible Kobbie Mainoo will definitely be paired with Rice. No matter how terrible the English team has been, the midfielder is incredibly effective at moving the ball into the final third and allowing it to be passed from flank to flank faster. Also, Luke Shaw's returned to form: he helped keep the result in the match against Switzerland and Lions fans expect the defender to appear on the field from the first minutes.\n\nBy the way, the players of both national teams have an interesting personal goal: they have the opportunity to get into the Top 10 Best Dribblers of the Euro! So much time has already passed, the tournament is almost over, and there are no representatives of England and the Netherlands in the ranking. The undisputed leader is the Belgian J\u00e9r\u00e9my Doku: although he was eliminated, his 34 successful dribbling attempts remain the best among all the players in the championship! The German Musiala is next: he was also eliminated, but his 32 successful attempts keep him at the top. In general, half of the top ten in this indicator have not played for a long time, and it is strange that our current semifinalists are still not there. If you are a neutral viewer, then in the evening count the successful attempts of dribblers to pass the opponent. Well, at least at the end of the Euro, the players should show a beautiful personal game, should not they?\n\nKey words\n\nThe players spoke more about the mood of the Dutch. Before the match, however, the team's coach Ronald Koeman paid attention to the fans and thanked them for their support even despite the difficult moments during the games. As for the opponent, he said this:\n\nSouthgate, in his typical manner, said that anything can happen in cup football. Among those options is an England victory:\n\nWhen will the game take place?\n\nThe match will take place at the Westfalenstadion stadium in Dortmund, and start at 22:00 Kyiv time. Interestingly, the issue of refereeing is still a hot topic. UEFA has announced that 43-year-old German Felix Zwayer will be the main referee, but this decision may be canceled due to another scandal between a player and a referee.\n\nThe fact is that twenty years ago, Zwayer received a bribe, and two years later he was suspended for six months for failing to report match-fixing that he knew about. Time passed and Zwayer refereed the match between Borussia and Bayern Munich. After the match, Jude Bellingham criticized the refereeing, saying how could a referee who was involved in match-fixing be allowed to work? The Englishman was fined, but Zwayer was also partially suspended. And now they can cross paths again at the Euros. And what do we have? A potential conflict of interest. As of Wednesday morning, there was no information on the referee's replacement, which will make this match even more interesting to watch.", "source": {"uri": "eng.obozrevatel.com", "dataType":

But the Dutch turned the tide and progressed to their first Euros semifinal since 2004 thanks to two quick-fire goals in six second-half minutes, the first coming from Stefan de Vrij and the second being an own goal.\n\nMORE: Euro 2024 schedule and results, updated LIVE | Who will win Euro 2024? Latest odds and predictions\n\nEngland's much-discussed switch to a three-man defence for the Switzerland game hardly proved to be a significant change from previous lacklustre displays, but Luke Shaw made his long-awaited return from injury as he came on in the second half of the quarterfinal, so he will likely be in serious contention to replace right-footed Kieran Trippier here to provide proper balance on the left side.\n\nHarry Kane was forced off in extra time with an injury picked up during the game, but it seems like he will recover in time to keep his place in the starting XI for this one, despite calls for the captain to be dropped following some anonymous centre-forward displays.\n\nThe Three Lions will also welcome back Marc Guehi from his one-game ban, and he should start alongside mainstay John Stones even though Ezri Konsa performed admirably in his absence last time out. Konsa could keep his spot should Southgate persist with a back three, though.\n\nKobbie Mainoo has enjoyed a positive summer over in Germany and the 19-year-old Manchester United midfield sensation will continue to partner Declan Rice in the engine room.\n\nEngland predicted lineup (4-2-3-1): Pickford (GK) -- Walker, Stones, Guehi, Shaw -- Mainoo, Rice -- Saka, Bellingham, Foden -- Kane.\n\nNetherlands boss Ronald Koeman stuck with the same starting lineup for both of his side's knockout games so far, but there could be one change in the offing in Dortmund.\n\nSteven Bergwijn has been unimpressive on the right wing and his place is under threat from Donyell Malen, who bagged a quick-fire brace in the Round of 16 against Romania. Jeremie Frimpong, who typically plays right-back for Bayer Leverkusen, is another possible option.\n\nWith RB Leipzig's playmaking sensation Xavi Simons sitting behind Memphis Depay and Liverpool's Cody Gakpo posing a serious danger on the left wing, notching three goals in his five Euro 2024 outings and leading the Golden Boot race, the Dutch have deployed a pretty fluid 4-2-3-1 formation. Super-sub Wout Weghorst would be the go-to option off the bench.\n\nExperienced Inter Milan star Stefan de Vrij will again support captain Virgil van Dijk at the heart of Koeman's defence. Nathan Ake is expected to stay at left-back ahead of Tottenham's Micky van de Ven, while Denzel Dumfries offers a bombarding option on the opposite flank.\n\nNetherlands predicted lineup (4-3-3): Verbruggen (GK) -- Dumfries, De Vrij, Van Dijk, Ake -- Schouten, Simons, Reijnders -- Malen, Depay, Gakpo.\n\nUSA: England vs. Netherlands will be televised in the United States on FOX, while Spanish TV broadcasts are provided by Univision and TUDN. These channels are all available to stream on Fubo, who are offering a FREE seven-day trial. ViX is also an option for Spanish viewers.\n\nRadio coverage of the match can be followed on SiriusXM FC.\n\nUK: Wednesday's match will be shown in the UK on ITV 1 / STV Scotland and fans can stream on ITVX / STV Player.\n\nCanada: TSN are the main English-language broadcasters for Euro 2024 while TVA provides French options.\n\nAustralia: Australia's sole broadcaster for the European Championship is Optus Sport.\n\nIndia: Euro 2024 matches are available to watch on JioTV and Sony LIV.

Was this always the masterplan from Gareth Southgate? Or are we the imposters of the Euro 2024 semi-finals? Does anyone really know anymore? The Three Lions are a mystery wrapped up in a puzzle.\n\n'Every now and then surely there has to be some enjoyment in this job'. Poor Southgate. If you can't enjoy reaching a third semi-final in four tournaments, then something is definitely wrong. And yet for all England's failure to impress overall, in four matches prior to Saturday's hard-fought shoot-out win over Switzerland, his team are in the semi-finals.\n\nHow did they get there? At times, it is scarcely believable but, maybe, just maybe, consider this: England are good. Yes, it flies in the face of all the evidence. The three group-stage matches appeared to take place in a state of inertia while the Slovakia last-16 tie was unwatchable at times, an England team consumed by their inability to function.\n\nBut in terms of being hard to beat and making progress, it works. This way works. How far it takes them remains to be seen but few saw a last-four spot on the horizon over the past three weeks, so we will probably end up winning the thing.\n\nAs far-fetched as that sounds, who else? Spain are the most attractive team left but attractive teams don't always succeed (sorry, Turkey). Portugal's 2016 triumph showed you can grind it out.\n\nSouthgate has been ground down and the joy of that 2018 World Cup run has evaporated from his face. Six years as England boss takes a toll and it's no wonder a siege mentality exists in the camp. Maybe channelling the noise from outside is working to England's advantage.\n\nThe only thing that might rekindle that same pure feeling for him at this difficult competition is by winning it. He will never convince some people - possibly even if his team do lift the trophy.\n\nBut, on results, he will still go down as the nation's greatest manager whether or not he wins this trophy. His record deserves respect. It's just that few truly appreciate it. In Gareth we still trust. No, really.\n\nThe grit and determination, the defensive stability, the ability to get over the line is only half the story. Once again, England were pretty dreadful at times: giving the ball away cheaply, lacking much urgency until going behind and looking for all the world like they were playing for penalties.\n\nA strategy which has worked so far but not one we'd love to see again. Jordan Pickford referred to it as England's 'trenches' game post-match. If someone misses and we lose on spot-kicks, the tale of woe would be evident, so to don rose-tinted glasses now we've won seems rather disingenuous. It was hard to watch and nothing about England's progress has been easy.\n\nThey defy logic. The only time they looked in full control in Dusseldorf was during the shoot-out.\n\nTrent Alexander-Arnold could have tapped out of Euro 2024 as the (unfair) focus of the struggles in the group stage through his midfield cameos. But he summed up England's penalty prowess with the winning spot-kick.\n\nIvan Toney will feel a closer part of things after his conversion - he didn't even look at the ball. Extraordinary. Cole Palmer belied his young age and inexperience by taking penalty No.1 and Jude Bellingham - of course - made it look easy.\n\nBut it was hyper-versatile Bukayo Saka's moment of redemption, a la Stuart Pearce in '96 but rather more understated, which provided the joy.\n\nThere has been little magic from England so far. Could it be returning? If the players feel joy again, that will transmit to the stands in Dortmund. Put it all together and memories of those shocking early displays can be consigned to history.\n\nMORE : Gary Lineker backs ex-Chelsea boss to replace Gareth Southgate as next England manager\n\nMORE

I know where I want to take the team to, and the team need to see me strong in those moments as well, otherwise that messaging that you're giving them on what they need to be, it doesn't ring true.\"\n\nNo other England manager has had the consistent success Southgate has enjoyed but he believes the players are not content with a semi-final place and he sees a determination to go further.\n\n\"I think the difference is we arrive in a quarter-final, we're not satisfied with that, so there is definitely a mindset shift in what we feel is acceptable as a team, where we want to end up,\" he said.\n\n\"Now within that it's knock-out football, the margins are so fine as we've seen again [against Switzerland], that can easily tip the other way and it's a different story but those teams that have won consistently, they have that mindset, they're not just satisfied with being in quarter-finals, they're pushing on and that's what we have to continue.\n\n\"This isn't where we want it to end, you don't necessarily want to speak about that too much. It is an unusual achievement for even the most successful nations but these guys, they've shown more than being able to just play. And, navigating tournaments, you need lots of other qualities.\"\n\nSouthgate is likely to stand down when his contract expires in December - or perhaps before - but he thinks a battle-hardened squad can continue to challenge after he's gone.\n\nHe added: \"It is that resilience, it is that ability to stay composed when you go behind in games, or when momentum's against you, we won three penalty shoot-outs out of four, all those little bits build character, build belief.\n\n\"Given the age of the squad and their experiences now, they'll have that belief for a long time, it should put England in a good place, but that's the future - we've got a good week ahead of us.\"", "source": {"uri": "101greatgoals.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "101greatgoals.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jon_fisher@101greatgoals.com", "name": "Jon Fisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Three Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Lampard", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Frank Lampard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Lineker", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gary Lineker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.101greatgoals.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/shutterstock_1126556399-2-2-768x505.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712618", "eventUri": "eng-9712618", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 118, "relevance": 1}

England's run to the Euro 2024 semi-final certainly hasn't been one of those classic cases of a team finding itself as a tournament goes on. So much around Southgate's side still doesn't make sense, bar their own iron will, as was all illustrated so chaotically in that quarter-final victory over Switzerland.\n\nWhat is maybe most significant is that this doesn't feel as important as it did even a week ago, whatever about three weeks ago. England very much don't start like they'll finish, and this doesn't seem to matter that much. By contrast, the eventual changes seem to result in the winning of ties.\n\nThat doesn't actually mean Southgate has stumbled on what works, though, in another way that can happen in such games.\n\nIt's more that England do what is required in the moment, only to revert to type and retreat. They were again hanging on against the Swiss, who wasted a series of openings. It isn't really the same as the kind of dependable rigour England showed in previous Southgate campaigns.\n\nA tournament team have become a moments team, that are characterised by a more ad hoc quality. It's just as well Southgate has so many individual match-winners.\n\nThe manager, for his part, might say this was what he always meant by \"finishers\". This was a concept that Southgate took from his ample research into other sports, particularly rugby. The idea was to encourage the squad to think more collectively, and that there shouldn't be the same hang-up about starting games. Given the number of subs now possible, and the intensity of modern football, many players are going to get more opportunities.\n\nSouthgate made a point of stressing this in his very first comment to media after the game.\n\n\"So many bits of behind-the-scenes work that have played a part in tonight, like Luke [Shaw] getting back on the pitch, medical team, physical performance team, as well as Luke, penalties, so many people involved in that, different departments, preparation for the game, tactical plan.\n\n\"We've got such good staff, I'm so fortunate to have that support, the players are showing such amazing togetherness, camaraderie, their involvement from the bench when they're coming into the game is huge, and it's great so many of them are getting these little moments where they shine, because they are all playing a part, they don't all get the headlines but, tonight, you could write a story about any number of them, really.\"\n\nIvan Toney, previously a player at this tournament used almost exclusively to replicate opposition forwards at training, has become a fine example in how he's been influential to two huge moments. He set up Harry Kane's winner against Slovakia and then scored maybe the pick of the penalties against Switzerland.\n\nThe nonchalant manner with which he spoke about it was almost what it put above the rest. \"I wouldn't say pressure. I just do what I always do... step up and roll it into the net.\n\n\"I never look at the ball. People might think it's strange but it's my routine.\"\n\nIt's all so relaxed, which is perhaps why Southgate seems to take a similar attitude to bigger questions about his team. It is why there doesn't need to be the same frenzy about the first XI for any given match.\n\nIt is why he evidently isn't going to obsess about what has become the biggest question, that Toney's contribution touches on. That is what to do with Kane.\n\nIt has got to the point where, rather than just not impacting games, the captain and star striker is actively slowing England down.\n\nSouthgate would never properly address such doubts about a player he considers one of his best lieutenants, mostly out of loyalty, but he was at least more expansive on Kane's performance.\n\n\"All of the games have been slightly different, I thought he did a super job for the team in terms of defensively, his positioning, his understanding of where he needed to be, he's perhaps not flowing as he's arriving in those deeper areas as sometimes he looks with his passing and stuff, but he's still playing an immense part for the group.\"\n\nThis is the message now.\n\nThat still doesn't mean it's the optimum way to go about trying to win this tournament, or beating Netherlands. Southgate still has so much to solve, and the danger of trying to do so mid-match is that it leaves a team so much more hostage to fortune. There were only centimetres between Xherdan Shaqiri hitting the bar from a corner and hitting the net, and a similar moment could easily go the other way against the Dutch if England persist in being so chaotic.\n\nThe return of Shaw will help. Southgate might now be able to play the 4-2-3-1 he always planned. That is worth a chance.\n\nIt will likely mean the manager is more inclined to keep the same team - with Kane at the top. The striker's low number of touches have already drawn comparisons with Cristiano Ronaldo, although it isn't really the same thing. Southgate does want to use him in a different way. The question may be whether a faster striker is better suited to the latter stages, when a game is stretched. In other words, a finisher.\n\nToney may come in then. It would show how England's campaign has come on. As with games, they may indeed finish the tournament in a very different manner to how they started.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southgate,_London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southgate, London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southgate, London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Toney", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ivan Toney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Football pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rugby football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovakia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xherdan_Shaqiri", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xherdan Shaqiri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Formation (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristiano_Ronaldo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cristiano Ronaldo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/07/16/GettyImages-2160912870.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712618", "eventUri": "eng-9712618", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-04-02", "dateEnd": "-03-01", "textStart": 4956, "textEnd": 4963}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 118, "relevance": 1}

Gareth Southgate has already bristled at the idea in press conferences, so it's easy to imagine the attitude with the squad.\n\nPlayers being players, though, one or two can't help talking about how they would rather not have faced Spain or France yet. That isn't to disrespect Netherlands, but Ronald Koeman's team clearly aren't comparable to the great Dutch sides of the past, nor the other semi-finalists.\n\nGary Neville made the attitude clear - as well as how players actually speak - when comparing the draws his teams faced against those of Southgate's era.\n\n\"The position we're in, to play Switzerland in a quarter final and... this Holland team in a semi, I'd be going 'what a chance' . And I'm not creating a yesteryear story about 'we were unlucky' and all that because we made our own luck and didn't make our own luck. We never got a team like this in the quarter-finals... We got Portugals and Argentinas.\"\n\nIt does put a different perspective on Southgate's historic record of three semi-finals in four tournaments, let alone one managerial tenure. England previously had to wait gaps of 28 years and 22 years, which is remarkable for one of the best-resourced football countries in the game.\n\nA lingering debate underneath this, and almost undercutting it, has been whether the scale of the achievement is in part because of the modesty of opposition.\n\nThere was an awkward moment in the press conference after the elimination of Switzerland when one German journalist put this to Southgate and methodically listed every tournament opponent he's faced. In terms of knock-out wins alone, that's been Colombia, Sweden, a supposedly poor Germany, Ukraine, Denmark, Senegal, Slovakia, Switzerland and now a supposedly moderate Dutch team.\n\nIt is why this perception has grown that Southgate's team have lost to the first elite side he's played.\n\nThe manager responded to this one by asking whether the reporter was actually English, having previously answered another with an acerbic quip about \"English entitlement\". While it is true that former internationals, supporters and many in the media have raised this question, it does go quite far beyond England, too. The nationality of the questioner proves it, and it has even been said around other squads. Some within the German camp are known to lament that finishing first in their group gave them such a tough run.\n\nOne immediate argument back from Southgate was that the Euro 2020 Germany side had \"eight Champions League winners\", with the abruptness of his response indicating he had been thinking about this.\n\nHe was right, of course, but it was arguably the wrong counter-argument.\n\nThe reality has indeed been that England's opposition haven't been at the elite end of the competitions, including that transitional Germany in 2021. There's no shame in admitting that. That's because there's the considerable caveat that you could say the exact same about many actual champions since Neville's time. They include Brazil 2002, Italy 2006, Portugal 2016, Argentina 2022 and even Germany 2014. All had runs where you could now point to obvious flaws and easier matches.\n\nGermany 2006 were on the rise but flawed for Italy. Brazil 2014 were a disaster waiting to happen for Germany themselves. As for the England 2002 that Ronaldo's Brazil faced, well, there are bigger arguments about their failures than just the opposition they played.\n\nThis is where Southgate could have made an argument with even more merit. His England created their own reality.\n\nThey have always finished top of their group, for one. That is more than can be said for Neville's teams.\n\nOne reason that England faced Argentina in 1998 was because they finished second in their group. The Romanian team that beat them were accomplished, but not at the elite end of a competition, either. England then faced Portugal in 2004 because they finished second in that group, too. That was admittedly behind a France with Zinedine Zidane and Thierry Henry, which points to another reality.\n\nThe Euros' expansion to 24 teams has meant it doesn't have the same concentration of quality. Groups are less exacting. The last-16 stage can allow these more forgiving paths, as two second-placed teams have to meet each other. This is what England have benefitted from this summer, and Southgate's team now may not even meet a group winner until the final, if they get there.\n\nWhen you look at Spain's run from the 2010 World Cup, Portugal and Germany stand out, but every single one of their players is adamant that the quarter-final against Paraguay was by far the most gruelling match. The same is true for Germany's last-16 tie against Algeria in 2014. It was so much more demanding than the 7-1 win over Brazil.\n\nBy the same token, Colombia were a hugely testing tie for England in 2018, all the more so because the national team hadn't actually won a knock-out game in 12 years. There was a lot of historical psychological baggage. Senegal in 2022 were similarly seen as a very different challenge.\n\nSwitzerland last Saturday, lest it be forgotten, had drawn with Germany and eviscerated Italy. They took England very close, too.\n\nSouthgate's side got through it, and got through penalties. The latter was in part by banishing thoughts like \"lottery\" and \"luck\" when it comes to shootouts but that in itself points to something wider here. When people talk about \"luck\" evening out they usually think in terms of the same game, or tournament. The pure maths of how that actually works means that actually happens over a much longer time period.\n\nMaybe that's what we're seeing now. Maybe this is just the bigger scale of international football, since it otherwise mostly takes place in intense periods over single summers. In the same way that the same stories eventually come around again, and there are chances of redemption for figures like Stuart Pearce six years after missing a penalty, perhaps this is the inevitable flip side of some genuine bad luck in previous big moments.\n\nSouthgate is now getting the luck the national team has missed in the past.\n\nThe Euros may now be expanded but Neville's side were still unfortunate to get Portugal in 2004, say, rather than another group winner like Sweden. There was bad luck in some genuinely epic tournament games, too, where England did take the elite sides to the wire. They had a spell over the turn of the millennium when they were frequently involved in some of the best games of tournaments, including Euro 96, 1998 and Euro 2004. There were only centimetres in Paul Gascoigne's miss against Germany, or disallowed goals against both Argentina and Portugal.\n\nNone of that is to take away from Southgate's era. He had to set so much right, and he himself knows how so much of tournaments hinge on luck. All any manager can do in response is minimise its effects. That is what he has done, and that extends to the draw.\n\nThe questions will persist until England do actually win that trophy.

Oranje vs. the Three Lions is Wednesday's offering and will provide an intriguing final pairing with La Roja very much favorites after seeing off Les Bleus' previously rock solid back line in Munich. Lamine Yamal's stunning goal made the headlines, but Dani Olmo's was also a brilliant effort and that after the French had done what had become unthinkable -- score from open play. James Benge summed it up best when writing about the Barcelona star's special night at Allianz Arena.\n\nBenge: \"Receiving the ball up 30 yards out, matched up against Adrien Rabiot, the man who had the temerity to question his qualities in the build-up, Yamal opened his chest wide, shaping to move right with an exaggerated drag from his left boot. In an instant, he chopped back, forging a yard of space that four defenders might have been in position to snuff out. Behind Rabiot, all William Saliba could do was zag left and right, distance making it no easier for Euro 2024's best defender to get a read on what Yamal was about to do. Once the goal was in sight, Yamal swung. Starting over Dayot Upamecano's right shoulder, the ball arced tantalizingly towards the outstretched left glove of Mike Maignan.\n\n\"The 6-foot-2 goalkeeper had sprung well, his technique looked spot on. He wasn't getting close. In off the post. Checkmate. Fifteen yards away, Kylian Mbappe had had the best view in the house. His shrug said it all. He'd set the bar high in the first 20 minutes. Yamal had flown over it. These are the sorts of moments that end up immortalized in the footballing annals. This is not an ecosystem anything like the days when players would arrive at a World Cup or European Championships unknown beyond their nation and depart a global great. Yamal's Euro 2024 is the best you're going to get.\"\n\nNetherlands vs. England\n\nThese two meet in Dortmund with the Dutch arguably the underdogs to win this Euro now, but they did see off an underrated Turkiye side to get here. The English edged out Switzerland en route to BVB Stadion, but Gareth Southgate's men are still waiting for that convincing win to finally silence the critics. Jude Bellingham and Harry Kane have been on and off over the course of the tournament while Bukayo Saka was the hero against the Swiss, but they now go up against an in-form Cody Gakpo who will be keen to add to his tally against this England back line.\n\nHarry Kane's goal struggles\n\nUp against the performing Gakpo is ineffectual Bayern Munich talisman Harry Kane who continues to struggle to not only find the back of the net but to even influence many of England's games as captain. A goal against Slovakia in the round of 16 was arguably expected but the quarterfinals vs. Switzerland was the latest part of a larger tournament which has asked more questions than provided answers. Like Bellingham, Kane has come up big when needed against Slovakia, but he was not on the field as the Swiss were beaten. Many are questioning how crucial he really is and this semifinal could put those debates to bed with a strong performance from the below-par star.\n\nBenge: \"Barring a remarkable chain of events, Southgate is not going to drop his captain, one of the great through lines in the run to three semifinals in the last four major tournaments. For all his difficulties over the last few weeks, that is an understandable attitude to have. If the ball is dropping to any England player in the box, you would want it to be Harry Kane. The issue is whether he is going to be in the box when required. Kane has never been the sort of sprinter who can transition from one end of the pitch to the other in the blink of an eye. He is not going to become that at 30 years of age, at the back end of an international tournament, coming off the back of a grueling season that ended early due to an ongoing back issue. Already it is being said that England's captain is his nation's Cristiano Ronaldo.\"\n\nCody Gakpo's hot form\n\nDenied his fourth Euro goal in the 2-1 win over Turkiye in the final four, the Liverpool man is one of four players on three goals for the tournament and he will be keen to that against this English side. Gakpo is based in England for the Premier League giants and the Oranje star is enjoying a breakout moment internationally even if it was also a decent 2022 World Cup that earned him his Anfield switch. How the 25-year-old rises to the challenge of being the main source of Dutch goals against a Three Lions side seemingly waiting to truly find their stride will be intriguing. Ronald Koeman's men are growing into this edition in a way that England are struggling to do so under Gareth Southgate so far.\n\nSponsored by Paramount+\ud83d\udd17 Midfield Link Play\ud83c\udf0d Argentina reach Copa America final\n\nDefending Copa America champions Argentina will have the chance to successfully defend their title this weekend after seeing off Canada 2-0 in the semifinals on Tuesday. Julian Alvarez and Lionel Messi did the damage, which was the first time that the Inter Miami man has scored in this tournament and even that finish required VAR verification. The Albiceleste were billed as favorites pre-tournament and they have lived up to that despite a cagey opening against Jesse Marsch's unexpected final four outfit. The Canadians struggled to keep up their frantic opening pace, though, and eventually lost out to goals in either half. Next up for Lionel Scaloni's men will be the winner of Colombia vs. Uruguay at Hard Rock Stadium come Sunday.\n\nColombia vs. Uruguay\n\nThe Colombians, now unbeaten in 28 games, will face a tough test against Marcelo Bielsa's impressive Uruguayans with Liverpool pair Luis Diaz and Darwin Nunez on opposite sides in this final four encounter. Ronald Araujo is a doubt and Nahitan Nandez is suspended, which will challenge Bielsa's nous, but the form book says that the last three meetings between these sides have all been draws. Uruguay are rampant in attack while Colombia are more efficient and boast a refocused James Rodriguez who has three assists from set pieces. Whoever gets to face Argentina this weekend, it will have been well-earned over what promises to be a final of sorts before the actual final.\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Top Stories\n\n\ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddf7 France's Euro 2024 exit: Didier Deschamps' goal shy French side got sent home after falling short against an impressive Lamine Yamal-led Spain in the semifinals.\n\n\ud83c\udff4\udb40\udc67\udb40\udc62\udb40\udc65\udb40\udc6e\udb40\udc67\udb40\udc7f England at Euro 2024: Why Phil Foden and captain Harry Kane are struggling with the Three Lions while Luke Shaw aims to go 90 minutes against the Dutch.\n\n\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 US Open Cup shock: MLS outfit Atlanta United are stunned by USL side Indy Eleven in the quarterfinals despite only coughing up one chance.\n\n\ud83d\udc40 Teenage dreaming: Guillem Balague joins Golazo Network to wax poetic about Spain's super-young superstar after he led the team to victory.\n\n\ud83d\udce3 Motivational speaking: Giorgio Chiellini has a message for American soccer fans after covering Euro 2024.\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 The Back Line\ud83d\udcb5 Best betCopa America: Uruguay vs. Colombia, Wednesday, 8 p.m. ET\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 THE PICK: Uruguay to win and both to score (+600) -- Into the final four for the third time in the last four editions, the Colombians will not want to fall on the wrong side of history -- again. Los Cafeteros have only gone to two finals with one being their 2001 success but their current unbeaten run of 27 games with 21 of those victories gives them hope. However, standing in their way is Marcelo Bielsa who is looking to end Uruguay's wait for a final given that their last semifinal outing was in 2011 when La Celeste won. If they get to Sunday's showdown with Argentina, it will decide which of them overtakes the other in terms of their shared record of 15 titles apiece. Expect a lively one, but a Uruguayan win over this strong Colombia side could return nicely. \ud83d\udcfa What's on CBS Sports Golazo Network\n\n\u2600\ufe0f Morning Footy (Weekdays 8-10 a.m.): Hosts Susannah Collins, Charlie Davies, Nico Cantor and Alexis Guerreros help fans get their day started on the network's flagship morning show with highlights, interviews and the biggest soccer storylines.

Meanwhile, the Netherlands, under the guidance of Ronald Koeman, have experienced their own highs and lows.\n\nInitially casting doubts with a third-place finish in the group stage, they swiftly rebounded with a convincing victory over Romania in the round of 16. Their quarter-final clash against Turkiye also demanded an extreme spirited comeback.\n\nRead Also: Euro 2024: France vs Spain Semi-Final Match Preview and Prediction\n\nThe Dutch have been on fire lately, finding the net nine times in five matches and boasting impressive scoring statistics. In contrast, England's pragmatic style has enabled them to secure victories through astute game management and crucial interventions when needed.\n\nThis marks the fourth encounter between England and the Netherlands at a major tournament. The Oranje triumphed 3-1 at Euro 88, courtesy of a memorable Van Basten hat-trick. This was followed by a goalless draw at the 1990 World Cup and a decisive 4-1 victory for England at Euro 96.\n\nThe clash tonight is not just about securing a place in the final, but also about proving what they are made of on the grand stage of European football.\n\nFor England, the goal is simple: to harness their potential and deliver a performance that secures passage to the final.\n\nFor the Dutch, it's about capitalizing on their momentum and seizing the opportunity to reclaim their status among Europe's elite.\n\n\"For the whole nation, it's something special. We are a small nation and we're in the semi-finals with England, France and Spain. We are really proud. We had to suffer but it's a great success to get the opportunity to play in a semi-final,\" stated coach Koeman to UEFA.\n\nTonight's encounter is set to be a spectacle of skill, determination, and raw emotion -- a fitting crescendo to what has already been a thrilling Euro 2024 tournament.\n\nAs the clock ticks down to kick-off, one question looms large: who will take that final step to Berlin?\n\n\u00a9 Morocco World News.

It was predominantly blue for Italy and France's group games there, while it became white for Germany's dramatic last-16 victory over Denmark. Indeed, the stadium has become something of a fortress for the Germans down the years.\n\nThe fortunes of other teams whose fans have colonised the southern stand at Euro 2024 have been decidedly mixed. Turkey lost against Portugal there before beating Georgia, Italy struggled to see off Albania, and France were held 1-1 by Poland.\n\nHow big a part any Orange Wall will play on Wednesday, therefore,

England are also winning in spite of him. Go figure.\n\n#AppointMarkToo\n\nEngland need to go back to a 4-4-2 set up with Toney and Watkins up front, Gordon and Saka on wings, Bellingham and Mainoo center. In the defence, Arnold at right-back, Gomez left-back and the rest the same as the current team. As it stands the midfield is just non-existent and you always need 2 up front.\n\nMark\n\nNursing a semi\n\nI'm excited. Spain. France. Holland. England. If four supercars in varying nick with varying attributes lined up for a day at the track, you might believe that not pushing excessively hard, staying out of the marbles and taking your laps safely and assuredly could be enough to clock the fastest time of the day. Gareth is absolutely the kind of dude that would be looking for an eco-mode toggle in a Bugatti, he might just bring this thing home you know.\n\nEric, Los Angeles CA (Also looking forward to Colombia vs Uruguay but that would be less a supercar matchup than guys on dirt bikes maybe.)\n\nREAD NEXT: France will obviously bounce Spain out of Euro 2024 because life and the universe are just that cruel\n\nChrist, the redeemer?\n\nOne of the things that really got on my nerves this weekend was this idea spread by commentators that Saka had \"redeemed\" himself by scoring a penalty.\n\nSaka didn't \"redeem\" himself any more than Pearce did in 1996 as there is nothing to forgive.\n\nWe're in the semis so stop moaning - and kudos to Konsa - what a player!\n\nGraham Simons, Gooner, Norf London\n\nIceberg ahoy?\n\nIt's a results business and Southgate now has a World Cup semi-final and quarter- final, and a Euros Final and (at least) semi-final to his name. The question remains as to whether this is because of Southgate or despite him. These are signs I suppose that he has made us \"tournament savvy\", but personally I'm still in the latter camp. I think we could and should have gone at least one step further in each of those competitions, and a better coach might have seen us do that.\n\nThat said, \"style of play\" criticisms, are perhaps a little unfair. When you look back at previous tournaments over the last 50 years or so, how often has the winning team \"won it in style\", having played like Brazil 1970, or anywhere near it? Not that many, especially since the turn of the century, Winners seem to have mostly ground their way through the tournament winning mini-wars of attrition , achieving marginal gains via favourable refereeing decisions, making fewer mistakes than their opponents, being better at penalties, and dumb luck. Or in the case of Spain, passing opponents to death until they surrender out of sheer boredom.\n\nIn my previous email I, among myriad others, said a back 3 plus wing backs was the way to get some attacking width. Well Gareth went for it, kind of, but ultimately his only change in personnel was the enforced one of Konsa for Guehi. So he basically just shuffled the dysfunctional deckchairs he'd used previously, still keeping Trippier on the wrong side and denying us any kind of left side width - yet somehow managing to avoid the iceberg. It was slightly better but only because Saka had the beating of his man down the right. The \"tried and trusted\" full backs continued to be largely awful. Whether playing as a conventional RB or in a back 3, Walker still seems unable to kick a ball in a straight line to one of his own team-mates, or even their general vicinity.\n\nSaka, who I previously criticised as predictable, was finally able to use his go-to \"cut in onto his left and cross/shoot\" move to good effect. It might have had something to do with him having finally gone down the outside on his right most times before that. The double markers were probably expecting him to do that again, which allowed him a bit of space when he surprised them by reverting to type. I guess that's what mixing it up a bit can do.\n\nI've been a big fan of Kane but he looks old and tired in this tournament. Nowhere to be seen when Saka played a cross into a dangerous area, but then neither were Foden or Bellingham. I can't see Gareth dropping any of his stalwarts though. I expect a similar 11 for the semi, and a similar grinding out of whatever result we get. Oh well.\n\nCredit though to Gareth and the players for practising the and keeping their nerve. Awful way to decide top level games though.\n\nKevin Villa (were you watching Glenn Hoddle?)\n\nMORE ON ENGLAND AT EURO 2024\n\n\ud83d\udc49 No Kane or Foden in England teams picked to play the Netherlands\n\n\ud83d\udc49 The ten greatest England players in European Championship and World Cup history features Southgate pair\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Why England and Southgate must drop Harry Kane at Euro 2024: his record in semis and finals is shocking\n\nGreat news on a personal level. Well done you, Cant imagine how tough it is not to be 'well'\n\nGood luck in your continued health (and seeming hatred of all things..)\n\nEngland are through to yet another semi. Gareths record is unarguable. This is as good as we have ever had it. All this is true\n\nBut .. and I hate using a 'But'... You cant help agree (because of the actual eye test) at least a little that that this does seem to be despite some or all of Southgate's decisions (or lack thereof)\n\nI would 100% rather be lucky than good. I would 100% rather be England than Germany or Portugal (both touted as 'definite possible' winners playing great football as a team only a game ago)\n\nThe argument if we had lost on pens would have been 'see - the 1st decent team we played we lost'. But Gareth has installed that level of trust in each other and calm and confidence in these players. Before him we lose that shootout (unproveable Jonny I get ya..) but history is proof enough if you are using the same arguments!\n\nWe still might go out to the Dutch.. and they might then be the '1st good team we play' or it might be France / Spain.. or we might win the whole thing\n\nEither way... Im not sure Wokeness or Knuckle Dragging Imperialism or Politics will have anything to do with it one way or another!\n\nComon Gareth Lad, Comon England - My Car flags are getting battered to hell but lets keep them on for another week!\n\nAl - LFC and England\n\n\"Not alpha enough. Too liberal, wet and ghastly. They have to ignore the facts to sustain the anger, because it suggests being mild-mannered and empathetic is successful. God forbid being nice beats nasty. Nasty gets very angry at that. If only we were more nasty. That's what we need. His neck just isn't thick enough like a real man's.\"\n\nNobody is saying any of this. John Nicolson is so desperate to flaunt his progressive credentials he's making things up and putting words into the mouths of people who he disagrees with. Perhaps he thinks everyone who is critical of Gareth Southgate is some kind of swivel eyed Daily Mail reading gammon. But since Football 365 themselves have been critical of Southgate that's clearly not the case.\n\nAnd as for the part about Hitler, that had absolutely nothing to do with anything. Certainly not football, or anything to do with the criticism of Southgate's team selections and tactics. Is John Nicholson now labelling anyone who criticises Southgate as a fascist?\n\nIt seems Football 365 have gone back to being the Southgate fan club and have forgotten about him once picking a player who played his club football in a country with a very dodgy record on LGBT rights. Until we lose the semi-final or the final and they'll remember that again and be back in the Southgate out club.\n\nDan, London\n\nGoofy Gareth is just a big act\n\nIts simple. The bulk of England's players are too thick to learn tactics. So Gareth decides they have to stick with one basic structure for the duration of the tournament, and build that based on facing the best team in the final - an all or nothing approach. But, it doesn't really matter who that is because we know it will be a team better than us. So, he sets us up to kill the game, play sideways and backwards, try not to give away a goal and be ready to nick it on pens. If we get it wrong and go out before the final, it doesn't matter because we're there to win. It's only the final that matters.\n\nTo back this up, he creates a smokescreen suggesting the team isn't playing that well, and hoping it gets better. But he knows he won't change it. They are playing exactly as he wants them to. Everyone sees it as dull. He sees it as honing the approach. If there's no time to drill the team in training, drill them during the real games. He hopes to get pelters because that takes the heat off the team. But in reality, he finds everyone is actually being quite reasonable, so he has to pretend he's deeply hurt by it all and poke the public - who then become angry at being attacked, the criticism becomes real and truly does take the heat from the players.\n\nGareth, you are a genius. An honorable and gallant man, and I salute you. Although for purposes of perpetuating the myth you surround yourself with, you're a complete and utter ball-less f***wit donkey, with the coaching skills of a tambourine.\n\nAlly, London\n\nAt this point, I truly believe it is an utter irrelevance as to who Southgate selects or what formation he chooses.\n\nEngland's name is already on the trophy. From the moment Southgate was named England manager they have had nothing but glorious luck on their side and have still been unable to get over the line. I fear this occasion may well be the occasion they finally manage to do it. A dour tournament where sides seem absolutely determined to play the most boring brand of football will be won by an England side who have benefitted from one of the most jaw droppingly easy draws I can remember seeing.\n\nThey have managed to make the semi final after managing one win in regulation time against Serbia. Then having to get past the might of Slovakia and Switzerland in the knockout stages. The Netherlands are not the force they once were and will be easily dispatched. Then there's the winner of Spain v France in the final. Whichever side prevails from that game will be knackered as a result of having had to play against actual opposition. Plus France's best player is clearly not fit and unable to see properly.\n\nEngland will win it, the media will make out it's the greatest tournament victory of all time and we will never hear the end of it!\n\nWorld-class Gaz\n\nWith people desperate to credit Southgate as a resounding success because of his amazing record while managing one of the most talented squads of players (currently ranked 5th, only France left above us at the Euros). The key thing seems to be comparison with previous managers. And while it's apropos to consider this list includes luminaries such as McClaren, Allardyce, the Turnip and Hodgson - along with Sven whose only club successes came while bankrupting Lazio - it's also reasonable to consider how he ranks against actually good managers. I look world-class at dancing if you compare me to Ed Balls.\n\nLet's start with that, at \u00a34.9m per year, he is by far the highest paid at the Euros and I believe the most of any International manager. Incidentally, Xabi Alonso gets paid \u00a34m pa.\n\nWhen you take account for it being basically a part-time job (100 games over 8 years is an average of 12.5 per year, vs 45-60 for a top-end club manager), his approx \u00a3286k per game puts him well within the \"salary per game\" range of Emery: \u00a3100k; Arne Slot: \u00a3128k per game; Ancelotti: \u00a3160k; Arteta: \u00a3183k; Klopp: \u00a3250k; and even Pep: \u00a3333k.\n\nPlease tell me again that Southgate is of that calibre and that we should all be eternally grateful.\n\nBadwolf", "source": {"uri": "football365.com",

game.\n\nEngland is -138 to move forward despite some uneven play in the tournament.\n\nJude Bellingham is the one to thank for English fans, with the British advancing this far thanks to his unbelievable bicycle kick goal in the 94th minute against Switzerland as hope had begun to dwindle.\n\nBellingham's rescue of the English national team leaves the Netherlands with a tough matchup Wednesday afternoon, as the stakes could not be higher.\n\n(3 p.m. ET, FOX)\n\nEngland was the favorite coming into the tournament, but some uneven performances have downgraded the prevailing sentiment surrounding the squad.\n\nIs this a situation where the cream will rise to the top, though?\n\nEngland is undoubtedly more talented than the Dutch, but there's questions about England's ability to hold the ball and control the pace.\n\nThe Netherlands played France to a 0-0 draw and lost to Austria in group play but have had a comfy route to the semifinal this year.\n\nThey soundly defeated Romania and Turkey to get here.\n\nThe team they face Wednesday is a different animal.\n\nEngland and manager Gareth Southgate have been a bit too comfortable playing on thin margins in this tournament, but this is a match for which they could easily be -200 favorites.\n\nGiven the thin margins we mentioned, namely the genuinely frightening match against Switzerland, it's difficult to say they will win in regulation.\n\nBut thanks to some late heroics, it's a fair assessment to expect the English to prevail Wednesday and get through to the championship in what will be a scintillating

impressive tournament record under this current manager.\n\nAlthough Southgate continues to divide opinion, it's clear that his long spell in charge of the national team and his strong record at going far in the big competitions means he surely has to be a serious contender to be knighted at some point, and the Telegraph state that that's now looking likely for him even if his side go out tonight and don't win the Euros.\n\nEngland fans will no doubt be hoping the team pulls something out of the bag tonight in this huge game, with a potential final against Spain awaiting Southgate's men if they can continue to ride their luck a little and get another result.\n\nStill, whatever happens, there surely aren't too many who'd begrudge Southgate some recognition for the job he's done, even if there are also arguments that he's not quite making the most of this talented generation of young players.\n\nThe likes of Jude Bellingham, Bukayo Saka, Phil Foden, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Cole Palmer should be capable of producing more attractive football than we've seen at these European Championships so far, but if things can finally click into gear for this big test with the Dutch national team then fans will no doubt forgive and forget the other lacklustre performances in this tournament pretty quickly.\n\nSpain beat France in last night's other semi-final, and they'll surely

England have played 120 minutes twice, and the manager opted against making the sixth change available to him in the added 30 minutes on both occasions.\n\nFollowing the last-eight shootout win, he spoke about several players including Harry Kane and Jude Bellingham being out on their feet and, given the high temperatures in Dortmund ahead of the semi-final encounter, fatigue may be an increased concern for England this time around.\n\nBut changes for changes' sake aren't on the agenda, nor a specifically early change - with Southgate insisting only the flow of the match would decide for him when subs were needed.\n\n\"There are different reasons for making changes, we were happy with the way the team was playing in those knockout games,\" he said. \"We made a sub at half time, too [in the groups against Slovenia], so we don't have a preconditioned way of operating. You look at physical freshness and how they operate individually and collectively, and if they will improve us or not.\n\n\"It's a strange thing that in the biggest games you get less time to recover; we haven't been able to get on the training pitch, and it's been more having meetings. So there's a different physical aspect now, but the players are well recovered and over the next 24 hours we will keep assessing, and the game direction will make those decisions for us.\"\n\nSouthgate further praised the collectiveness of the group and reiterated his belief they would come together to overcome whatever challenges arise, in this game and beyond, should England progress.\n\nAdded to the options - from the start or as sub - is now Luke Shaw, and Southgate all but confirmed he has a part to play against the Dutch, though Kieran Trippier also remains well in the frame.\n\n\"I'm very fortunate to have a fabulous group of players, and we've always worked as a team. When we talk about games we've done, it's always reviewed as how the players and ourselves as staff can do better.\n\n\"This time, it's [noteworthy] how the group has bonded. We've had 21 who have been on the pitch and none have been dead rubbers or unimportant [appearances].\n\n\"Luke has been injured for four months, so it wasn't a possibility to play earlier, but [against Switzerland] he made a good contribution. He gives us balance with the team, but Kieran has done a fantastic job. [Trippier has] played in big nights for us over seven or eight years, and he's been so important in those occasions and around the squad and staff.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Three Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovakia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kieran_Trippier", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kieran Trippier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Shaw", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luke Shaw"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Craps", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Craps", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/5bcc57894996388a30176e07e39fecb5", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712618", "eventUri": "eng-9712618", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 115, "relevance": 1}

He's a family man, with children and a wife, and I think that's what sometimes people don't understand.\n\n\"This is a guy at the cutting edge and I'm sure Gareth would be the first to say there are certain elements that are not to his liking. But he's in the semi-finals of the Euros and in terms of that, I think he's done an incredible job.\n\n\"This is a man who has come into an England set-up and changed the culture and changed the environment.

He says Southgate has ended all that and made playing for England enjoyable again.\n\n\"I was in a generation where it probably wasn't like that, and that's been well documented by many players, senior players, who have said sometimes the way of England was very fractious in certain moments,\" he said. \"It was different units in those times.\n\n\"I think it's very different now, and like I said, I think that's absolutely full credit to Gareth and his skill set. He's obviously got a huge skill set and that's not easy. He's brought England teams to semis and finals. He's done a brilliant job for me.\"\n\nParker insists England can beat the Netherlands and reach their first overseas final. \"Yeah definitely I fancy them,\" he said.\n\n\"I thought the last game we played, I thought we played very well against Switzerland. I thought that would be the case. In the group stages, I thought we were up against very disciplined, strong teams in terms of their defending.\n\n\"Switzerland, I felt they showed real quality and I think that will be the same with Holland. They are a modern, expansive team, who like to attack and I certainly think we've got the players to attack too.

So, I really hope that Netherlands use that possession constructively, to make sure we move it well, quickly and through the lines, asking questions of England.\n\n\"Every team that has gone more on the front foot and moved to press England, they ended up making them give the ball up easily and quickly, allowing the opposition all the opportunity to create chances.

Lively,\" Meulensteen, now assistant at Australia's men's team, says in his assessment of his nation's star man. \"He's a little bit of what we had with Arjen Robben so many years ago, coming in on the left foot and putting it in the top corner. Cody is the exact same coming off the right.\n\n\"The only problem is the Turkish team dealt with that really well by doubling up on him, so every time he came inside there was another player to stop that space, so he never had a chance to shoot.\n\n\"You need to counterattack that by having overlapping runs, so he has an option to play somebody in with a reverse pass.

England went on to clinically dispatch all five of their penalties and Jordan Pickford saved from Manuel Akanji, so for the second round running, Southgate's side squeezed through.\n\nHaving previously limped through the group phase, then required Jude Bellingham's stunning strike to spark a fightback against Slovakia, it has been a far from convincing journey to this point - but results are all that matter in knockout football.\n\nSouthgate's 101st game in charge will see England try to become just the sixth team to make consecutive European Championship finals, and a familiar foe stands between them and a place in Sunday's showpiece in Berlin.\n\nHEAD-TO-HEAD\n\nThe Three Lions now face a fourth major-tournament meeting with the Netherlands: the Oranje won 3-1 en route to glory at Euro '88, thanks to a Marco van Basten hat-trick, then a forgettable goalless draw at the 1990 World Cup was followed by a famous 4-1 England win in 1996.\n\nHowever, having won just one of the nations' last nine meetings in all competitions, precedent is not on the side of an English team packed with attacking talent but yet to find rhythm or inspire confidence among their fans.\n\nThe most recent of those nine encounters also came in a semi-final, with the Netherlands winning 3-1 after extra time in the UEFA Nations League - both Southgate and Ronald Koeman were in the dugouts on that occasion too.\n\nKOEMAN'S MEN\n\nSeeking their second European title, after lifting the Henri Delaunay trophy in Germany 36 summers ago, Koeman's men are making their way through the so-called 'weaker' half of the draw, having only emerged from Group D in third place.\n\nFollowing victory over Poland, a draw with France, and an eventful defeat to Austria, the Oranje were handed a relatively kind last-16 tie against Romania, in which they ultimately ran out 3-0 winners.\n\nHowever, a squad led by captain Virgil van Dijk will attempt to win just a second European Championship semi-final tie for the Netherlands; and with a dismal record of four losses from the previous five, the burden of history weighs heavily on their shoulders.\n\nPREDICTION\n\nWhile each game sees a fresh page written, England's history against their Dutch counterparts has been littered with defeats: of all nations they have faced more than 20 times to date, only versus Brazil do they have a lower win-rate (27%).\n\nThat trend could continue in the Euro 2024 semi-finals, as the Oranje's talented attackers are starting to click and will surely punish another tame Three Lions performance.

There's still some frailties but they do look a better team in attack.\n\nThe Netherlands have got better as the tournament's progressed which is obviously what you're looking for but they do give up opportunities to the opposition.\n\nThey give up too many chances. Virgil van Dijk and Micky van de Ven are good players but I don't fancy them as a team defensively. They've conceded five in five which is the most of any team left in it which probably tells you quite a lot.\n\nThey just seem to be easier to get at than you'd expect with the quality of the players they have. The three boys up top are interchangeable and they're good but England will overcome them one way or another.\n\nThe Netherlands have come back in two games so far so they've got something about them but it all feels a bit risky. I wonder if they've got the mentality to get past England.\n\nEngland can seriously change a game with the bench they have. People will say, 'Why don't you start with Cole Palmer and Ebere Eze?' It's not Gareth Southgate's way and, as we saw, bringing that lot on can make a huge difference.\n\nIt's actually really clever to keep them up your sleeve\n\nHe's happy to be solid and then mix it up when he absolutely has to. All you can do is win and that's what he's done. As well as you're playing, if players like that come on it does make you worried as an opposition.\n\nThe Netherlands don't have that same firepower off the bench. In terms of England's line up Marc Guehi will definitely play and Luke Shaw looked quite good when he came on, especially as he hasn't played for ages.\n\nIt gave England a much-better balance and I don't see any reason why England don't continue with the back three in this game. Shaw can start as wing back or on the left of the back line. It's a problem, but a nice one.\n\nEngland are going to win in the end but I'm not sure it will be from open play in the 90 minutes somehow.

Some of its fans won't credit manager Gareth Southgate.\n\nAfter beating Switzerland on penalties in the European Championship quarterfinals on Saturday, Southgate celebrated in front of a stand packed with England fans, his players dancing in a line behind him.\n\nIt felt like an answer to his detractors, some of whom even threw plastic beer cups in his direction less than two weeks ago.\n\nSouthgate admitted the criticism he's faced over England's pragmatic, cautious style -- he says his team is \"streetwise\" -- has stung.\n\n\"Every now and then you think, Surely there has to be some enjoyment in this job?' So if I can't enjoy that moment, then I think it's a waste of time. I love the players, I love being in that moment with them,\" Southgate said.\n\n\"I can't deny that when it's as personal as it's been in the last few weeks, on a human level it's quite difficult, but we're fighting. We're not going to stop fighting.\"\n\nEngland has been to the semifinals in three out of four major tournaments during Southgate's eight-year tenure.\n\nNo other England manager in history has achieved that kind of consistent success -- though the team hasn't won a title.\n\nIncreasingly, fans have showed their unhappiness with Southgate's cautious instincts and the fact that the team has rarely played an entertaining style, especially at Euro 2024. Of England's five games, Southgate's team won only once in 90 minutes, the 1-0 opener over Serbia.\n\nAll too often in the past, England started well but couldn't finish off games, Southgate argued. \"We weren't savvy, we weren't tournament-wise,\" he said.\n\nThat's something he's tried to change since taking charge in 2016, when England had just gone out of the European Championship to Iceland under Roy Hodgson.\n\n\"The games that we've ultimately gone out (of tournaments), people can always look back and highlight things. But in general, we've shown the resilience that the teams that win tournaments have had for years and years. Italy, France, Spain,\" he added.\n\n\"It's not all pure football. It's other attributes that they've had, and we're showing a little bit more of that streetwise nature.\"", "source": {"uri": "telegraphindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@telegraphindia.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coach_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coach (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southgate,_London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southgate, London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southgate, London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Hodgson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roy Hodgson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iceland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iceland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://assets.telegraphindia.com/telegraph/2024/Jul/1720141045_southgate.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712618", "eventUri": "eng-9712618", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 114, "relevance": 1}

I can't say I was excited by the quarter-final performance as some, but I thought we played well and Switzerland were a good side.\n\nWe moved the ball quicker in this game and the three-at-the-back set-up definitely worked. We looked much more balanced when Luke Shaw came on. Kobbie Mainoo played really well and Bukayo Saka was unplayable. Ezri Konsa did so well too, so there were some good performances there.\n\nAnd our penalties were magnificent! I don't think I've seen five better, they were so calm and collected. I even said watching the shoot-out before Ivan Toney took his that it's a bit different taking them in a Euros quarter-final than at Brentford - but, oh my God, he was better than ever!\n\nStill, you really want to see this England side come out all guns blazing, it just doesn't seem to be the manager's way.\n\nThere has always been that little bit of caution throughout Southgate's reign. I know the players have said it's not coming from the manager, but there's undoubtedly an air of it around the team.\n\nThey're playing within themselves - we saw how dangerous they looked when they needed to score.\n\nBut you have to say it's working quite well at major tournaments when you look at Southgate's record. It might be stating the obvious, but these competitions are quite difficult to win!\n\nNavigating your way through to a semi-final has to be respected, at times I just wish we were more on the front-foot.\n\nEngland to Qualify\n\nThis will be the biggest test so far against the Netherlands though.\n\nThey've had teams over the years that would just scare the living daylights out of you. This side isn't one of those.\n\nBut there is cohesion about them, and they have players that can hurt you. Look at how Cody Gakpo's been playing in this tournament.\n\nAnd the character they've shown has impressed me. They've had difficult moments but have managed to get through them.\n\nThey have pace too, which can hurt teams.\n\nIt ll be very tight again in the semi-final. Holland will score in my view and I can see us scraping through again to the final.\n\nI wouldn't mind another penalty shoot-out to be honest, the way our boys took those penalties the other day. I don't fear it anymore, even after just one shoot-out win.\n\nBut I think we'll get it done. It might be an extra-time job, but I'm backing England to qualify for the final in the end.\n\nHarry Kane to Score\n\nHarry Kane hasn't looked himself in the tournament. He's been so good for England over the years, and even this last season at Munich he's scored 40-odd goals, but he's been anonymous at times in this competition.\n\nYou do just feel with someone like that that they're a killer in the box - if you get one chance, you still want it to fall to him.\n\nI mean, he's Harry Kane! If create that one moment, he will score it.\n\nSometimes I feel like there is a lack of respect for what he's done. He's England record goalscorer of all-time. And it's not like he's off playing in Saudi Arabia like Ronaldo, for example - he's just scored a load of goals for one of the biggest clubs in the world last season.\n\nI know he didn't win the league, but f***ing hell, come on! He's class act.\n\nI'm not going to get away from the fact that he's been pretty anonymous in some of the games and he's not played as well as others, but I'd still stick with him and I think he'll score on Wednesday night.\n\nHe had a great game against Switzerland, got a goal and has been England main source of creativity in the tournament.

Quite possibly, with Terry Venables' side ripping apart a strong Dutch line-up in the group stage of Euro 96.\n\nRoared on by a partisan Wembley crowd, England claimed the lead midway through the first half when Danny Blind felled Paul Ince in the area, enabling Alan Shearer to step up to score from the spot.\n\nEngland were rampant after the break, scoring three goals in the space of 11 minutes either side of the hour mark to establish a four-goal lead. Teddy Sheringham scored two, with Shearer claiming the other, as England's slick passing ripped the Dutch defence apart.\n\nThe pick of the goals was Shearer's second, with the number nine firing home after Sheringham slid him the ball sideways to round off a superb passing move that had the mercurial Paul Gascoigne at its core.\n\nPatrick Kluivert claimed a Dutch consolation with 12 minutes remaining, but England's dominance was pronounced as they headed into the knockout stages of a competition that would eventually see them suffer penalty heartbreak at the hands of West Germany in the semi-finals.\n\n\"We took on Holland at total football and beat them,\" said Shearer recently. \"It was a performance I don't think England have bettered in my living memory.\"\n\nEngland: Seaman; Neville, Adams, Southgate, Pearce; Anderton, Ince, Gascoigne, McManaman; Sheringham, Shearer.\n\nDo I not like orange? The game that heralded the demise of Graham Taylor is remembered for all the wrong reasons by England fans, with one of the most controversial refereeing decisions in the history of the national team sealing their side's fate.\n\nEngland needed a draw in Rotterdam to reach the 1994 World Cup finals in the United States, and when David Platt broke onto Andy Sinton's long ball on the hour mark, they looked certain to take the lead, only for Ronald Koeman to tug the midfielder to the ground.\n\nThe referee, Karl-Josef Assenmacher, initially pointed to the penalty spot and looked certain to send Koeman off, only for the defender's protestations to see him reverse his decision and award a free-kick on the edge of the box. Koeman was then booked rather than sent off.\n\n\"What are they being instructed,\" raged Taylor, in footage subsequently shown on the documentary, 'An Impossible Job'. \"What sort of thing is happening here? Absolutely disgraceful.\"\n\nTo make matters worse, not only did Koeman remain on the field, but the current manager of the Netherlands went on to open the scoring five minutes later with a direct free-kick, with Dennis Bergkamp adding a second goal soon after.\n\n\"It was a clear foul,\" Koeman has said subsequently. \"Nowadays, it would have been a red card for sure, but I was very happy that the referee said it was a free-kick and not a penalty.\"\n\nEngland: Seaman; Parker, Adams, Pallister, Dorigo; Merson, Ince, Palmer (Sinton 46), Sharpe; Merson (Wright 69); Shearer.\n\nThe last time the European Championships were held in Germany (then West Germany), England met the Netherlands in a group game in Dusseldorf.\n\nSir Bobby Robson's side were already in deep trouble after losing to the Republic of Ireland in their opening group game, and things were to get worse against the Marco van Basten-inspired Dutch.\n\nEngland were actually the better team in the opening stages of the game, with Gary Lineker and Glenn Hoddle both hitting the post, but they fell behind just before half-time when Ruud Gullit dispossessed Gary Stevens and crossed for van Basten to swivel away from Tony Adams and shoot past Peter Shilton.\n\nBryan Robson equalised for England in the early stages of the second half, but the Dutch were in the groove and after Gullit laid on another inch-perfect pass for van Basten, the striker spun away from Adams once again before firing home.\n\nVan Basten completed his hat-trick with 15 minutes remaining, connecting with a flick-on from a corner, and England went on to also lose their final group game against the Soviet Union to complete a miserable campaign.\n\nEngland: Shilton; Stevens, Wright, Adams, Sansom; Steven, Robson, Hoddle, Barnes; Beardsley, Lineker.\n\nNovember 1946 - England 8 Netherlands 2\n\nThe first meeting between England and the Netherlands came in 1935 and saw England scrape home via the only goal of the game. The second game between the two nations, however, was rather more one-sided.\n\nEngland hosted the Dutch in a friendly played at Huddersfield's Leeds Road ground in 1946 and scored eight goals, six of which came before the interval.\n\nTommy Lawton scored four for Walter Winterbottom's side, with his tally including an 11-minute hat-trick scored between the 24th and 35th minutes.\n\nThere was a strong North-East look to the scoresheet, with Wearsider Raich Carter, famously of Sunderland but by then playing with Derby County, scoring twice and Middlesbrough-born Wilf Mannion, still then playing for his hometown club, also finding the net before the break.\n\nMannion's fellow Teessider, George Hardwick, who was captaining the side, missed a penalty just before the interval, but England added a further second-half goal through Tom Finney.\n\nThe Netherlands' goals were scored by Ko Bergman and Kick Smit, but England were able to reflect on a job well done, having also seen off Wales, thanks to two more Mannion goals, earlier in the month.\n\nEngland: Swift; Scott, Hardwick; Wright, Franklin, Johnston; Finney, Carter, Lawton, Mannion, Langton.", "source": {"uri":

My prediction is that we will win 2-1, but the match will be in extra time.'\n\nAcross the street from her home, businessman Raymond Stegers, 63, had installed flags and bunting in orange as well as a giant Dutch flag.\n\nMr Stegers, who wore an orange hat and scarf in support of Holland, said: 'It is going to be a tough match for both sides.\n\n'England have great fans, but so does the Dutch team.

We will make a lot of noise and sing for our team.'\n\nLocal publican Wilco Leuven said: 'There are many people from Aalten going to the match with England to Dortumnd. But my bar will be full because many will come to watch it on the TV.\n\nA thumbs-up for the Dutch team from this resident of Aalten, which has a population of 27,000\n\n'It is going to be a very busy night in the bar.

I hope Netherlands are the victors.'\n\nIt is reported that upwards of 50,000 Dutch supporters will be inside the BVB Stadion Dortmund, which has an 81,000 capacity, for the match - outnumbering England fans who have been allocated just 6,500 tickets.\n\nThat means around 35,000 ticketless Dutch fans are set to mix with thousands of England supporters without tickets on the streets of Dortmund.\n\nMany of the Dutch fans are planning to gather before kick off, with some travelling from Aalten\n\nThe build-up to the match has seen tickets, accommodation and airline prices surge amid increased demand, with many people facing paying thousands for their journey.\n\nRead More 'Killjoy' London mayor Sadiq Khan blasted over lack of England fan zones\n\nPrime seats - those situated by the halfway line - have been listed for as much as \u00a317,000, while the cheapest seats up in the gods, which usually go for around \u00a370, are barely available for less than \u00a3600, an increase of nearly 1,000 per cent.\n\nFor many of the Netherlands' matches during the tournament, the host city has been packed with Dutch supporters filling up fan zones in their iconic orange livery.\n\nMany of the Dutch fans are planning to gather before kick off and proceed on an 'orange march' to the stadium, letting off flares and singing for their team.\n\nWest Ham fan Barry Hunt, 24, from Dagenham, who has been to three of England's matches and arrived in Dortmund last night said: 'It looks like Holland fans will have it their way on Wednesday.\n\n'A lot of my mates have to work on Wednesday or have run out of money on the first games. My granddad gave me \u00a3500 so I could come to this match.\n\n'I don't have a ticket and I am trying to buy one, but I want to be here singing with the England fans and drinking the beer.

They played incredible football, in the finals of two World Cups, winning the European Championship, outstanding individual players. I loved watching the Dutch teams.\n\n\"In actual fact Ronald Koeman as a player was somebody I admired very much. We didn't really see centre-backs stepping out of the ball and spraying passes around the pitch in that way. I know we see that more in the English game now but that was unique when I was growing up.\n\n\"The first thing for us now is we've got one game ahead of us and we've got to get that right. So we always want to play as well as we can. The tournament, there's 13 goals fewer than the last Euros. A lot of teams have been really well organised. We've played three teams that play a back five.\n\n\"But we want to make this a memorable night. One of those enjoyable nights when everyone comes together and enjoys themselves. So, without a doubt, we want it to be another one of those.\"\n\nSouthgate has also admitted fatigue could be an issue for England ahead of their semi-final showdown. England have had back-to-back knock-out games of 120 minutes with a penalty shootout needed to beat Switzerland while Holland have won both theirs inside 90 minutes.\n\nSouthgate has been reluctant to make changes in this tournament and is likely to resist again with Marc Guehi pushing to replace Ezri Konsa in defence. Three Lions boss Southgate said: \"It's always a consideration on picking the team, managing the squad. Recovery strategies now are outstanding. There's so much science involved in recovering players.\n\n\"But things will happen over the next five-six days for all of the teams involved where people might start games and get an early injury because you're not able to train as fully as you might to assess all the players.\n\n\"Squads are going to be important, all of the games of the latter stages are quick turnarounds and we've learned from going the distance in two tournaments already the physical demands on these tournaments are really high.\n\n\"It's been factored into all our operations for the last few years. For not just managing the day to day but the weeks we've been away. Managing staff energy, managing players' energy.\n\n\"We cover all of those things. Because all of the staff need to be fresh as well. They need to make big decisions, they've got to work long hours. The travel is a factor. We're covering all of those basis.\"\n\nJoin our new WhatsApp communityand receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

They needed penalty kicks to get past Switzerland in the quarterfinal and were rescued by Jude Bellingham five minutes into stoppage time the round before.\n\nOn the other side is the Netherlands, which has +440 odds to win the competition. They've scored more goals than any of their remaining opponents, but haven't looked solid in defense either. Luckily, they face a Three Lions club that appears more than willing to play a cagey affair.\n\nEuro 2024 semifinal England vs. Netherlands predictions: Regulation Draw (+190 or better), Under 2.5 goals (-210 or better)\n\nSimilar to France, England has not been anywhere near one of the four best teams at this tournament. Their reluctance to attack, questionable substitutions and dependence on late-game miracles have been extremely frustrating for arguably the most talented team at the tournament.\n\nThe Netherlands team doesn't mind leaving itself stretched at the back if it means it can commit more bodies to the attack. They scored five goals in two knockout matches and regularly both score and concede lots of goals. That sets up an interesting stylistic showdown between an England team which is often hesitant to come out of its shell.\n\nEngland manager Gareth Southgate will not play on the front foot unless he is coerced into doing so. The Netherlands' commitment to sending bodies forward but also to leaving itself vulnerable in defense leads us to believe that this will be a back-and-forth match that is ultimately decided on penalties.\n\nThere are multiple ways to bet such a situation, beginning with looking for value with a draw at a strong +190 price. If you want to play it somewhat safer in this low-scoring affair, you can go under 2.5 goals but be prepared to pay a hefty price for it at around -190.\n\nYou must be over 21 to play.

'You're always going to face the best teams at some point in the competition.\n\n'England's route so far has been pretty favourable. This is a step-up but you'd expect that in a semi-final.'\n\nPressed for his prediction, Neville added: 'Do you know something? Honestly, I think there's an element of what's happening in this tournament that makes you think it's written in the stars.\n\n'Something is happening. Everything that could fall for us is. We've won one game in 90 minutes out of five and yet we're in the semis so you think something is happening for us.'\n\nFellow ex-England defender Joleon Lescott, meanwhile, said: 'I'm confident.

However, Oranje did enough to make it through to the knockout stages and are now in the semi-finals.\n\nSo, who could Netherlands face in Europe's biggest international football tournament?\n\nLast 16: 3-0 vs Romania - The Netherlands produced an excellent all-round performance, especially after Cody Gakpo gave them the lead halfway through the first half. Two Donyell Malen goals put some well-deserved gloss on the scoreline as Romania rarely threatened to come back into the game.\n\nQuarter-finals: 2-1 vs Turkey - Unlike the previous round, this game showcased the Netherlands' powers of recovery as they came from a goal behind to seal a first European Championship semi-final appearance in 20 years.\n\nSemi-finals: Netherlands will face Group C winners England -- having avoided Gareth Southgate's men in the round of 16.\n\nFinal: Awaiting in Berlin will be the winner of the first semi-final between Spain and France. The former would be a repeat of the 2010 World Cup final, which Netherlands lost; the latter, of course, a replay of the group stage match in June.\n\n2-1 vs Poland - Netherlands had to come from behind to beat a stubborn Poland side but they showed the grit and perseverance needed to win. The Oranje ended the game with 20 shots and there was certainly some promise but their deficiencies were also on show, conceding seven shots on goal and being overrun in midfield at times.\n\n0-0 vs France - In recent history France had been a dominant force against Netherlands, winning seven of their last eight showdowns. They even won two contests 4-0, including on Koeman's first game back in charge. This time we got the first 0-0 in 51 European Championship games. Xavi Simons could have scored the winner, had the referee not disallowed his late strike in a contentious VAR decision.\n\n2-3 vs Austria - Netherlands went into this game top of the group, knowing their destiny was in their hands. But they went behind three times, and failed to comeback the third and final time to fall to a 3-2 defeat. It saw Netherlands drop to third, which was unthinkable at the start of the tournament.\n\nOranje faced an existential crisis not long ago, failing to qualify for back-to-back tournaments. The dearth of talent and a lost generation were cited for this sharp decline on the international stage. Under Koeman's initial leadership, the ship had turned, and now qualification is no longer taken for granted. He can call upon an exciting crop of emerging stars and credible veterans who are mainstays at Europe's biggest clubs.\n\nHowever, recent championship performances have seen the Dutch fall below expectations, and their exit from Qatar 2022 -- losing to eventual winners Argentina on penalties after staging a remarkable turnaround -- still hurts. But, again, the calibre of players at Koeman's disposal can be described as an embarrassment of riches; there are match-winners capable of changing games from seemingly nowhere.\n\nIt is said that a fish rots from the head down. There are doubts about Koeman's ability to lead this generation of players, and questions about his tactical prowess remain. Since his re-appointment, the process hasn't been smooth, with a few uninspiring performances and questionable team selections.\n\nFurthermore, they have struggled with the long-standing issue of players not being able to replicate their club form at the international level, with some high-profile players being singled out. This is where Oranje could unravel. Koeman's pragmatism has frequently stifled any Dutch creativity, and if he goes into this competition with a defensive mindset, then Netherlands progression could be limited.\n\nWhile the talent pool is not in question, the one pulling the strings determines whether they can recreate the summer of 1988 or endure another frustrating tournament campaign.\n\nDuring the qualifying campaign, Koeman experimented with different formations, starting with a 4-3-3 variant before switching to a back-three, which for a while seemed likely how Oranje would play this summer. But he's reverted to the back four at Euro 2024.\n\nNathan Ake shifts over to the left, with Virgil van Dijk and Stefan de Vrij the centre-backs. This allows Netherlands to transition to a back three if the game dictates at times. Denzel Dumfries provides attacking threat from the right.\n\nFrenkie de Jong was guaranteed to start in the heart of the Netherlands midfield but has been ruled out through injury, meaning PSV duo Jerdy Schouten and Joey Veerman occupy the central midfield positions alongside Tijjani Reijnders.\n\nHowever, after his brutal substitution against Austria, there could be limited time for Veerman going forward, which opens the likelihood of Xavi Simons moving into a No.10 role with Jeremie Frimpong or Donyell Malen occupying the vacant right flank.\n\nDespite Netherlands' impressive footballing history, fans often have high expectations for their national team in tournaments. While the team has won one major trophy and appeared in three finals, expecting them to perform at the same level as Europe's top teams is unrealistic.\n\nMany observers now recognize this fact, and even though fan support remains strong, there is a growing sense of realism. However, missteps will be scrutinised and overanalysed, especially since the Dutch will field a squad of talented players.\n\nIf the team clicks and goes on a successful run, expect enthusiastic support that could rival Max Verstappen's popularity.\n\nNetherlands finished second in Group B to qualify for Euro 2024, losing twice to eventual winners France.", "source": {"uri":

Doubts over the attack after only scoring twice in three group stage games, although England did only concede once (a 1-1 draw).\n\nA young attacking midfielder who seemed to carry the responsibility for acting as the antidote to the tactical conservatism and yet still played with freedom. A scratchy last-16 victory after extra-time against unfancied European opposition. Progress that required a late comeback in the quarter-final, albeit against a team that had beaten the defending champions earlier in the tournament.\n\nHave you got the joke by now? Yes, all the above refers to Italia '90, that cultural cornerstone when everyone fell back in love with the England national team despite pre-tournament protestations that it had lost its way. That, it seems, is the point at which 1990 and 2024 differ. World Cup 1990 brought us all closer together; Euro 2024 has been set upon dividing us, or allowing us to divide ourselves.\n\nTo an extent, this is merely a question of timing. Back when Sir Bobby Robson was doing his touchline jig, England's public were waiting for something to love. The domestic game was in a state of great flux and two-way authoritarian mistrust. The lack of English teams in Uefa competition post-Heysel had created a knowledge vacuum of how English football was played.\n\nNow, simple supply-and-demand economics. Football is a capitalist orgy and a 24-7 event. The domestic game has reached its peak of omnipotence and the Premier League is king of the fiefdom.\n\nEvery punter has all the excitement they want all of the time and, thus, if the England team doesn't excite, it will gain and keep few friends. Add to this: nobody just ignores anything anymore; you must moan about \"having to watch\".\n\nThe weirdest aspect of this anger is how even facts become debated. Gareth Southgate is the first England manager in the post-truth era. He's never beaten a decent team (he has). Beating Germany didn't count because they weren't good enough. He's only reached three semi-finals in four tournaments by technicality (England's most consistent run ever). He's only faced bad teams and England always beat those at major tournaments, didn't they? (No).\n\nAs England prepare to play only the third semi-final in their entire history on foreign soil, I wonder whether we might look back on this period and agree that people spent too much of it being angry.\n\nHindsight may give this all a golden tinge. We had a squad full of likeable, talented players who went deep into tournaments and we spent the whole time griping, booing and throwing beer cups at the manager. Odd little country, in many ways.\n\nThat is clearly what England's players think. During time spent with them over the last fortnight, each individual has displayed a mystification at the treatment and criticism of Southgate. They all say he has given them their belief and that he created an environment in which playing for England is an honour more than a chore; it wasn't always that way.\n\nThey're asking for a little more faith in them and him and with good reason. Much has been written about how World Cup 2018 brought the nation closer to the England team, but this was a miracle of symbiosis: the team looked more happy because they felt the love, the team played better because they looked more happy and the team got more love because they played better.\n\nSo we have to ask: what good does this negative focus do? If, on a basic level, we all want this team to go as far as it can in every tournament, is it not worth temporarily parking all reservations? I know you're desperate to tell everyone online that you fell asleep watching England pass the ball around, but maybe save the 38th rendition of the anecdote for another time.\n\nHistory rarely feels as if it is being made in the present. Only seldom do you feel the significance of an occasion in real time. The rest is constructed and shaped by hindsight. In 1968, when England travelled to Florence for their first Euros semi-final outside England, nobody thought that it would be their last for 56 years.\n\nWe are the lucky ones, with three semi-finals in six years: World Cup 2018, Euro 2020, and now this. Nights such as these should never be taken for granted for we can never know how many of them we shall get. These are the pillars of our football lives, holding up the roof during fallow decades and stopping the rain rendering the whole place condemned.\n\nSo try to come together - if it goes well, you will always remember who you were with and where. Try to park your doubts about tactical conservatism.\n\nTry to focus on the positives. Try not to scowl for too long when the ball is passed backwards. Try to remember that it wasn't like this for too long and try to remember the strength of your desperation and despair back then.\n\nTry to save the worst of your opprobrium for when England are actually eliminated. Try to have faith that they have faith in themselves. Try to...enjoy it? Sorry, I've gone too far now.", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "inews.co.uk"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daniel_storey@inews.co.uk", "name": "Daniel Storey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_identity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National identity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Robson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bobby Robson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Booing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Capitalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fief", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supply and demand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Authoritarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Football in England"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florence"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florence"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://wp.inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SEI_212109586.jpg?crop=195px%2C0px%2C1846px%2C1040px&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712618", "eventUri": "eng-9712618", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 109, "relevance": 1}

Then, in the quarterfinals against Turkiye, the Oranje rallied in the second half with a goal from Stefan de Vrij, before an own goal by the Turks gave them a 2-1 win, sending the Netherlands to the Euro semis for the first time in 20 years.\n\nThe Three Lions are hoping to punch their ticket to the championship match for the second consecutive tournament, while the Dutch have not made it to the final since winning it all in 1988.\n\nThe Netherlands is 7-9-6 against England, including a win in their last meeting in the semifinals of the 2018-19 UEFA Nations League season.", "source": {"uri": "mlive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mlive"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA European Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dortmund", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovakia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_de_Vrij", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stefan de Vrij"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Nations_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Nations League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_Football_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Turkish Football Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Own_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Own goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Romania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Romania"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.mlive.com/resizer/v2/XE3NRJ7Y3JH7RBJH2PGKX3SCU4.jpg?auth=f0e1a5b9a9fbbeb483d07b6954f6a9dfe26604ea16e198ec2456b1a97d0bc787&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712618", "eventUri": "eng-9712618", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dortmund"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4980392156862745, "wgt": 108, "relevance": 1}

In the knockout rounds, the former Manchester United, Barcelona and Atletico Madrid man has also been heavily involved in the final third, with four shots against both Romania and Turkey.\n\nEngland will be well aware of the threat Depay poses but it would still not be a surprise to see him managing at least two shots on Wednesday.\n\nBet 3: Over 5.5 corners in the match for both teams combined\n\nThe final leg of the Bet Builder is for there to be at least six corners in the match as both sides look to carve out chances from attacking set-pieces.\n\nEngland's corner count was rising steadily earlier in the tournament with the Three Lions going from winning just one against Serbia, to four versus Denmark and then six against Slovenia in the group stage.\n\nThey then were awarded nine corners in the last-16 tie against Slovakia before posting a disappointing total of just four on Saturday in the quarter-final against Switzerland.\n\nThe Netherlands won 13 corners in their 3-0 last-16 win over Romania but saw that figure drop to just three on Saturday when they came from behind to beat Turkey 2-1.\n\nIn what might well be a cagey semi-final, there may not be an abundance of corners in Dortmund but both England and the Dutch are more than capable of winning at least three each on the night.\n\nBack Bellingham to score, Depay to have over 1.5 shots and over 5.5 corners in the match at 17/2 with LiveScore Bet.\n\nWin up to \u00a3250,000 with LiveScore 6!", "source": {"uri": "livescore.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "livescore.com"}, "authors": [],

Shorn of their two best midfielders - Frenkie de Jong and Teun Koopmeiners - through injury, the Oranje have battled and stumbled on through a combination of Dutch pragmatism, splattered with moments of genius and last-ditch defending.\n\nIt has been mildly amusing to hear Dutch commentators reckoning they've got a chance because England have been so bad and it is hard to disagree with the consensus that England have better players, but the Netherlands have been tactically better.\n\nIt's been far from totaalvoetbal, but the mixing up of long and short passes has worked and they were the only team to win their quarter-final in 90 minutes.\n\nIndeed, coach Ronald Koeman is a divisive figure in the dugout despite being such a great player and member of the 1988 European Championship winners.\n\nThe only man to have played for and managed all of the Eredivisie's big three clubs of Ajax, Feyenoord, and PSV Eindhoven has got some calls wrong, but most of them have been right.\n\nThe main one he got correct was in goal. Bart Verbruggen was given the No 1 shirt despite not even firmly cementing his status as Brighton & Hove Albion's starting shot-stopper last season.\n\nBut he has made stunning saves in every game and showed he deserved the nod over Brentford's Mark Flekken - who can hopefully give him some tips if Ivan Toney has to take a penalty - and Feyenoord's Justin Bijlow.\n\nThis, though, has been Cody Gakpo's tournament. Wherever he has gone, the Dutch have gone. Poor in the first half of the 2-1 quarter-final win over Turkey, normal service resumed after the break and the Liverpool forward played a huge part in the winner to go with his three goals. And he's strong.\n\nThe moment of Euro 2024 for the Netherlands has probably when Gakpo outmuscled Radu Dragusin down the byline to set up Donyell Malen in the 3-0 last-16 win over Romania.\n\nThe midfield has been OK. Tijjani Reijnders, the AC Milan man who subjected Dundee United to the biggest thrashing handed to a Scottish team in Europe playing for AZ Alkmaar a couple of years ago, has been inconsistent, but serviceable.\n\nAnd Jerdy Schouten has been a star. He's no Koeman, despite the blond locks, but - unlike England's midfield - will pass the ball forwards. It was the PSV Eindhoven man who sparked the move that brought the Oranje's tournament to life. His raked pass to Xavi Simons, led to Simons finding Gakpo, whose near-post finish put the Dutch 1-0 up against Romania.\n\nUp front, Memphis Depay remains a conundrum. The Netherlands' second all-time leading scorer has spurned chances with a lack of composure in front of goal. But there may be a place for him out wide on the right, from where he crossed for Stefan de Vrij's equaliser against Turkey.\n\nThe defence, thought to be a strength, has been a bit dodgy. But there is depth there. De Vrij, Denzel Dumfries, Nathan Ake and Micky van de Ven have had their moments, but they are vulnerable if England are willing to have a go.\n\nBut let us all hope that doesn't happen and Koeman's jongens evoke the spirit of the song \"Hup Holland Hup\": don't put slippers on the beast, don't let the (Dutch) lion stand in his undershirt, because the lion in football boots can take on the world!\n\nOn Wednesday for one night only Borussia Dortmund's iconic Yellow Wall will become the Netherlands' Oranje Wall.\n\nThe iconic single-tiered stand that escapes into the sky and looms formidably over the pitch below will be filled with buoyant, bouncing Dutch fans for their country's Euro 2024 semi-final against England.\n\nIt is a fitting stage for a fanatical fanbase. Major tournaments are made more colourful by the Netherlands' presence; fans are not expected to wear orange, they are practically obligated to do so.\n\nHenk van Beek will be one of the supporters in attendance. He is the president of the iconic double-decker \"Oranjebus\" which has led the Dutch fans throughout Germany's host cities towards stadiums, just as it has done for every senior men's tournament since Euro 2004 and every senior women's tournament, bar the 2023 World Cup in Australia and New Zealand, since 2017.\n\n\"That stand has such a special name. Like in Liverpool, you have the Kop, in Dortmund, you have the Yellow Wall,\" Van Beek tells.\n\n\"It's awesome that we're there. I'm very lucky to be there and really looking forward to it. The players in England are used to [intimidation] from fans but we'll do our best! But always in a positive way.\"\n\nThe Dutch party will begin long before the match gets underway, though. The Oranjebus will set off for the Signal Iduna Park over four hours before kick-off and Van Beek has an important part to play in getting the celebrations started: he has a secondary role as the Oranjebus resident DJ and is responsible for blaring out Dutch dance classics during the strolls to the stadiums.\n\nOne of the songs that has become synonymous with the Netherlands' tournament is Links Rechts by Snollebollekes. You've seen the videos of fans dancing along to it by now, bouncing energetically from side to side as one giant, vibrant mass like bubbles from an upturned Fanta bottle.\n\n\"I live in a small village in Holland and we had a big party and the act who was doing the song, Snollebollekes, were performing,\" he recalls.\n\n\"They were not at all big at the time but I thought it was a nice song and a year later we played away in Sweden in 2016 and we had a little fan walk to the stadium. I thought to myself let's give it a try and see what happens and the people started to dance from the left to the right.\n\n\"That was basically the first time. It's not like what you see now but they loved it and in 2017 we had the Women's Euros in our country and won the tournament and every time I played the song the Dutch fans went crazy! That's when it started to grow and now it has become something unbelievable. I guess Snollebollekes are quite happy with us!\"\n\nFootage of the Dutch fans bopping to Van Beek's beat have been used by the Dutch Football Association's official social media channels and turned the Oranjebus into a viral phenomenon. Before Euro 2024 began, the Oranjebus' official page on Instagram had just under 2,500 followers; now it is closing in on 60,000.\n\n\"I remember before the tournament we had a video that had 5,000 people watching and we were like \"woah! that's huge\" and now we have movies with like three million views. We're just football fans who have a bus like this and are doing everything we can to keep it rolling!\"\n\nThe fan marches have been an integral part of the Dutch football fan experience. According to Van Beek it started at the 1998 World Cup in France and has snowballed into something they couldn't have dreamed of. The Dutch FA helps to co-ordinate them by liaising with city councils and police forces to ensure a smooth and safe journey for all.\n\nTomorrow's march stands to be the biggest one yet. Dutch fans would have travelled in their tens of thousands anywhere around the continent to give their backing to Koeman's squad, but the proximity to Germany has tempted even more to make the trip.\n\nVan Beek estimates that between 110,000 and 120,000 fans could descend on Dortmund to soak up the atmosphere ahead of their Dutch men's team's first semi-final at a major tournament in a decade.\n\nExpectations before the tournament were relatively low, particularly after Koeman's first-choice midfield pairing of De Jong and Koopmeiners were both ruled out through injury on the eve of their opening game.\n\nConfidence didn't particularly grow during or after the group stage either when the Dutch squeezed into the last-16 after finishing as one of the best third-placed teams.\n\nHowever, belief is beginning to accelerate ahead of the England showdown with Gareth Southgate's side yet to live up to their tag as pre-tournament favourites.\n\n\"I think that both teams, are not playing very good at this tournament,\" Van Beek says. \"It's absolutely a 50-50 game and we'll have to see what happens.\"\n\nOne thing's for sure, the Dutch fans are not ready to return home just yet. Van Beek and the rest will hope that the bus has one more trip to put into its Sat Nav: to Berlin's Olympiastadion for the final on Sunday.", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news",

But can they take it a step further? Bookies don't think so. As per the Netherlands vs. England odds, Gareth Southgate's men are more likely to advance to the final. But given that the Three Lions have been everything but impressive since coming to Germany, Ronald Koeman's boys have every right to feel optimistic.\n\nThey finished third in their group, which, at the time, was seen as a failure. However, by finishing in that place, they were able to avoid playing against real heavyweights early on in the knockouts. In fact, in the round of 16, they played against Romania, while in the quarterfinal, their opponent was Turkey.\n\nNow, they're facing their toughest rival so far. The good news for Koeman and his men is that they've shown some signs of improvement since the start of the knockout phase. In the game against Romania, their defense looked solid, keeping the opposition from scoring. These guys did great offensively in that game, as well, scoring three goals.\n\nIt was a bit different against the Turks, who had a 1:0 lead at one point, but when the Dutch exploded, they turned into real world-beaters. They eventually won the game 2:1, but it could've been even more.\n\nEngland got to the semis after beating Switzerland on penalties. It was the third time that they won a penalty shootout in the Gareth Southgate era. Before that, they did it only three times in more than 50 years.\n\nAnother thing suggesting that Southgate's strategy is to go for the penalties is that his men looked really good during the shootout. They scored each of their five penalties, practically giving no chance to the opposition keeper to save it.\n\nOur prediction is that they're gonna go for another shootout in Wednesday's game. It's not just because they've been obviously working hard to polish their penalty-shooting skills; it's also because beating the Dutch looks like a very hard task.\n\nThis goes especially given that England haven't been playing great soccer since coming to Germany. They finished the group stage with one win and two draws, then went on to beat Slovakia in extra time and the Swiss on penalties.\n\nOur prediction is that Wednesday's game is going to end in a draw after 90 minutes. We suspect not much will change in the extra time, after which, we'll see a penalty shootout. And that's where Southgate's men should have the edge.", "source": {"uri": "gamblingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GamblingNews"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jessie_carter@gamblingnews.com", "name": "Jessie Carter", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Koeman", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Koeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Romania"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Romania"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovakia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovakia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Game_Studies/Articles", "label": "dmoz/Games/Game Studies/Articles", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Farkle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.gamblingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/netherlands-england.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712618", "eventUri": "eng-9712618", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 106, "relevance": 1}

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nIt all started horribly in Munich. But if Scotland's fans thought they were hitting rock bottom on opening night at Euro 2024, then they had better start bracing themselves for something even more nightmarish.\n\nTomorrow night in Dortmund England's march towards the holy grail will continue when Gareth Southgate's side takes on the Netherlands for a place in this summer's final. Well, perhaps 'march' is stretching it a bit. Truth is they've been staggering and stumbling around all over Germany and yet here they are now, still standing, in spite of their own shoddy efforts.\n\nIt's starting to induce cold sweats and flashbacks to Portugal 20 years ago, when Greece managed to bore their way to the title by sending the rest of Europe to sleep on their way to glory in Lisbon. Yet it can be argued that Southgate and his sleep-inducing squad are causing even more of an affront to the game, given the abject manner in which they have been going about their business over the last four weeks.\n\nYes, the Greeks may have stunk the place out in 2004 but they were punching so far above their weight that it was still possible to marvel at the sheer bloody-mindedness and tactical stuffiness of it all. That side was welded into a team which proved capable of rebuffing all comers. They beat Portugal - including prime Cristiano Ronaldo - in the opening match, before drawing with Spain and sending Raul and Co back across the border in the group stages.\n\nThey took down Zinedine Zidane's French side in the quarter-finals and in doing so became the first nation in history to defeat both the hosts and the defending champions in the same tournament. And they brought a rampaging Czech Republic's four-game tournament winning streak to a shuddering halt in the semis by grinding out another 1-0 win.\n\nIt was the same scoreline in the Final when Ronaldo was deprived of his crowning, second-coming-of-Christ moment on home soil. The Dutch, meanwhile, were sent packing in the semi-finals which is just another reason to suspect that history might be in the process of repeating.\n\nBecause if Southgate can somehow scramble past the Dutch tomorrow night this whole busted bandwagon will trundle on towards Berlin, where only France or Spain will be able to take its buckled wheels clean off before it reaches the finishing line. Perhaps it would be possible to be more admiring of England 's efforts if only Southgate was swimming in the same kind of shallow talent pool that Greece boss Otto Rehhagel took with him to Portugal two decades ago.\n\nBut that is blatantly not the case. On the contrary, Southgate is drowning in star quality and his team has advanced this far despite his inability to weld them into a properly functioning team - or even just a side that wouldn't get football stopped.\n\nBecause, regardless of what Rio Ferdinand, Frank Lampard and Micah Richards might try to convince you from their seats in the BBC studio at the Brandenburg Gate, England's level of performance remains pitifully low. It actually beggared belief the other night when the three of them began love-bombing Southgate at half-time in the win over Switzerland which sealed a place in the final four.\n\n\"This is the England we've been waiting for,\" was the suspiciously coordinated message, even though they had just watched their team fail to register a single first-half shot on target. They took it in turns to gush about Southgate's tactical tweaks even though the manager's reshuffled panic resulted in nothing much more than same s***, different toilet.\n\nBukayo Saka aside, England's forward play and passing was every bit as ponderous and laboured as it has been since the tournament began. And the longer it went on the duller and more difficult to watch it became. So much so that Alan Shearer had to be reprimanded on co-comms for coming across as \"indignant\" after savaging Jordan Pickford for shelling an umpteenth aimless long ball in the general direction of Harry Kane.\n\nLet's not forget, even Scotland needed only 13 minutes to breach the Swiss defence in the group stages so it's no wonder Shearer's patience was being exhausted. That his colleagues back in Berlin then tried to claim that black was white was an insult to the intelligence and smacked of a three-line whip being passed down from the bosses above, who may or may not have been spooked by the petted-lipped whimpering from inside Southgate's camp.\n\nThe manager believes he has been unfairly treated - and he's been publicly backed by poster boy Jude Bellingham - but the unspoken subtext to all of it is simple and perhaps even a little bit sinister. It goes something along the lines of, if you're English and you don't feel like fawning over Southgate and the performances of his players, then your patriotism ought to be called into question.\n\nThat's a dangerous and disingenuous rabbit hole to disappear down but Southgate appears to have willingly thrown himself into it head first, even though he must know his decision-making has been all over the place. It could even be argued that England might have had two European titles and maybe even a World Cup in the bag by now if a genuine, top-class manager had been in charge.\n\nAnd yet they are still there, still in with a shot at bringing it home. That's almost entirely down to the quality of the individuals Southgate is still able to send out on to the pitch. And it's why there was little doubt of the outcome when that quarter-final against Switzerland went down to the wire of a penalty shootout.\n\nThe technical ability of the five players who stepped forward rendered the result almost inevitable from the moment Pickford saved Manual Akanji's effort low at his left-hand post. It was the same story in the last 16 when Bellingham's hitch-kick stopped Slovenia from knocking England out with seconds to spare.\n\nThere was only going to be one winner after the Real Madrid man's dramatic intervention. And it feels for all the world as if something similar could be on the cards tomorrow against a Dutch side that has also been in fairly underwhelming form since the tournament began, albeit not to the same extent.\n\nFor as long as Southgate manages to stay afloat, England will remain heavily armed and highly dangerous. So if you thought this competition got off to a bad start back on June 14, then the coup de grace could be the real kick in Scotland's balls.", "source": {"uri": "dailyrecord.co.uk", "dataType":

England previously had to wait gaps of 28 years and 22 years, which is remarkable for one of the best-resourced football countries in the game.\n\nA lingering debate underneath this, and almost undercutting it, has been whether the scale of the achievement is in part because of the modesty of opposition.\n\nThere was an awkward moment in the press conference after the elimination of Switzerland when one German journalist put this to Southgate and methodically listed every tournament opponent he's faced. In terms of knock-out wins alone, that's been Colombia, Sweden, a supposedly poor Germany, Ukraine, Denmark, Senegal, Slovakia, Switzerland and now a supposedly moderate Dutch team.\n\nIt is why this perception has grown that Southgate's team have lost to the first elite side he's played.\n\nThe manager responded to this one by asking whether the reporter was actually English, having previously answered another with an acerbic quip about \"English entitlement\". While it is true that former internationals, supporters and many in the media have raised this question, it does go quite far beyond England, too. The nationality of the questioner proves it, and it has even been said around other squads. Some within the German camp are known to lament that finishing first in their group gave them such a tough run.\n\nOne immediate argument back from Southgate was that the Euro 2020 Germany side had \"eight Champions League winners\", with the abruptness of his response indicating he had been thinking about this.\n\nHe was right, of course, but it was arguably the wrong counter-argument.\n\nThe reality has indeed been that England's opposition haven't been at the elite end of the competitions, including that transitional Germany in 2021. There's no shame in admitting that. That's because there's the considerable caveat that you could say the exact same about many actual champions since Neville's time. They include Brazil 2002, Italy 2006, Portugal 2016, Argentina 2022 and even Germany 2014. All had runs where you could now point to obvious flaws and easier matches.\n\nGermany 2006 were on the rise but flawed for Italy. Brazil 2014 were a disaster waiting to happen for Germany themselves. As for the England 2002 that Ronaldo's Brazil faced, well, there are bigger arguments about their failures than just the opposition they played.\n\nThis is where Southgate could have made an argument with even more merit. His England created their own reality.\n\nThey have always finished top of their group, for one. That is more than can be said for Neville's teams.\n\nOne reason that England faced Argentina in 1998 was because they finished second in their group. The Romanian team that beat them were accomplished, but not at the elite end of a competition, either. England then faced Portugal in 2004 because they finished second in that group, too. That was admittedly behind a France with Zinedine Zidane and Thierry Henry, which points to another reality.\n\nThe Euros' expansion to 24 teams has meant it doesn't have the same concentration of quality. Groups are less exacting. The last-16 stage can allow these more forgiving paths, as two second-placed teams have to meet each other. This is what England have benefitted from this summer, and Southgate's team now may not even meet a group winner until the final, if they get there.\n\nWhen you look at Spain's run from the 2010 World Cup, Portugal and Germany stand out, but every single one of their players is adamant that the quarter-final against Paraguay was by far the most gruelling match. The same is true for Germany's last-16 tie against Algeria in 2014. It was so much more demanding than the 7-1 win over Brazil.\n\nBy the same token, Colombia were a hugely testing tie for England in 2018, all the more so because the national team hadn't actually won a knock-out game in 12 years. There was a lot of historical psychological baggage. Senegal in 2022 were similarly seen as a very different challenge.\n\nSwitzerland last Saturday, lest it be forgotten, had drawn with Germany and eviscerated Italy. They took England very close, too.\n\nSouthgate's side got through it, and got through penalties. The latter was in part by banishing thoughts like \"lottery\" and \"luck\" when it comes to shootouts but that in itself points to something wider here. When people talk about \"luck\" evening out they usually think in terms of the same game, or tournament. The pure maths of how that actually works means that actually happens over a much longer time period.\n\nMaybe that's what we're seeing now. Maybe this is just the bigger scale of international football, since it otherwise mostly takes place in intense periods over single summers. In the same way that the same stories eventually come around again, and there are chances of redemption for figures like Stuart Pearce six years after missing a penalty, perhaps this is the inevitable flip side of some genuine bad luck in previous big moments.\n\nSouthgate is now getting the luck the national team has missed in the past.\n\nThe Euros may now be expanded but Neville's side were still unfortunate to get Portugal in 2004, say, rather than another group winner like Sweden. There was bad luck in some genuinely epic tournament games, too, where England did take the elite sides to the wire. They had a spell over the turn of the millennium when they were frequently involved in some of the best games of tournaments, including Euro 96, 1998 and Euro 2004. There were only centimetres in Paul Gascoigne's miss against Germany, or disallowed goals against both Argentina and Portugal.\n\nNone of that is to take away from Southgate's era. He had to set so much right, and he himself knows how so much of tournaments hinge on luck. All any manager can do in response is minimise its effects. That is what he has done, and that extends to the draw.\n\nThe questions will persist until England do actually win that trophy. That, however, is something that doesn't change no matter the draw.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Savage's thoughts on the game, Gareth Southgate's managerial prowess, and his predictions offer a compelling narrative for fans eagerly anticipating this high-stakes encounter.\n\nRobbie Savage has firmly stated his preference for Luke Shaw to start over Kieran Trippier on the left flank for England. \"I'd start Shaw on the left over Kieran Trippier because he's got minutes under his belt now and he's been training,\" Savage told Planet Sport Bet. He believes Shaw's presence can effectively counteract the attacking threat of Denzel Dumfries. \"If Shaw plays against the Netherlands he can push Denzel Dumfries back, because we know Dumfries likes to attack. I thought the 3-4-2-1 formation worked for England against Switzerland, I'd stick with that.\"\n\nShaw's ability to balance defensive duties with forward thrusts provides a strategic edge, especially against a team known for its attacking prowess. This move could limit Dumfries' influence on the game and allow England to control the tempo.\n\nSavage is optimistic about England's chances, predicting a hard-fought 2-1 victory over the Netherlands, possibly extending into extra time. \"It is going to be a tough test against the Netherlands but I think England will win 2-1, potentially after extra time. Even if it goes to penalties, I'd fancy England to win it because of the quality of their penalty takers,\" he remarked. Savage's confidence in England's depth and penalty-taking abilities is notable, especially recalling their shootout success against Switzerland without their star Harry Kane.\n\n\"Even if it went to the sixth or seventh penalty, England have great strength in depth when it comes to spot kicks,\" Savage added, underscoring the robustness of Southgate's squad in pressure situations.\n\nGareth Southgate has faced his share of criticism during the tournament, yet Savage believes the England manager deserves substantial credit for guiding the team to another semi-final. \"Gareth Southgate has come under some criticism but he continues to find a way,\" Savage said. \"He always finds a way to win games in tournament football, whether that be in extra time or on penalties.\"\n\nSouthgate's ability to adapt and make crucial decisions at pivotal moments has been pivotal. Savage defends Southgate's often-criticised substitution timing, emphasising that the results speak for themselves. \"Southgate and his management team have clearly made the right decisions because they're in the semi-finals. Whether or not those decisions have come when people wanted them to or later, whatever they've done so far has taken them to the semis. He knows what he's doing and his changes have paid off.\"\n\nShould England overcome the Netherlands, Savage believes they stand a real chance of clinching the Euros. \"He deserves huge credit for getting England to another semi-final and I think he'll take them to the final. If they do get there then it's a one-off game, and I think that gives them a real possibility of winning the Euros. It would be a remarkable achievement.\"\n\nThe optimism surrounding England's campaign is tempered by the recognition of the challenges ahead. However, with Southgate's strategic nous and the squad's depth, Savage's belief in a potential historic triumph resonates strongly.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Shaw", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Luke Shaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robbie_Savage", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robbie Savage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denzel_Dumfries", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denzel Dumfries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kieran_Trippier", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kieran Trippier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumfries", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dumfries"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dumfries"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil/Tic-Tac-Toe", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/GDpfe5MSyfiBoTzP7rTPNA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/epl_index_articles_253/1c3c16fc1085b06943f6ade97524b836", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712618", "eventUri": "eng-9712618", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-03-04", "dateEnd": "-02-01", "textStart": 984, "textEnd": 991}], "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 106, "relevance": 1}

Here was a kick against an orthodoxy that has guided Gareth Southgate's dysfunctional England to the semis. From the point they stepped off the gas after 30 minutes against Serbia this was supposed to be the tourney where you didn't have to play well to progress. Having mostly played like a pick-up band on heavy Mandrax, it feels fair to say this England has not captured the nation in quite the way Southgate's team did in 2018, Euro Not-2020 and even at the Human Rights World Cup in 2022. Frank Skinner, David Baddiel and Ian Broudie's expected royalties must be down. That song has often been conspicuous by its absence. Pubs and houses decked in the flag of St George? Not so much. Perhaps only that shootout against the Swiss was a shared national moment.\n\nBlame it on the weatherman, to conjure B*Witched? The summer climate has not been conducive to Boxpark pint-chucking or beer-garden carousing. Flares up random orifices are likely to sputter in the rain. There's been an election, too, though even Jacob Rees-Mogg and Liz Truss getting tinned didn't cause wild celebrations. Those were expected outcomes. Dear Rishi needed to be as delusional as Scottish fans booking accommodation for the final in Berlin to think he could win.\n\nPerhaps that's the problem with Southgate's England. Reaching semi-finals has become par, what with all the talent The Best League in the World \u2122 produces. The manager himself - a bit prickly these days - is the victim of his own success, in that he's gone closer to winning than anyone since Sir Alf Ramsey was trying not to drop his aitches. Within that, there's a danger of becoming Tim Henman, a nearly-man with a determined fist pump but lacking the tools to win the top prizes.\n\nAlready, any England fan winces at the idea of Kieran Trippier against Lamine Yamal, 17 on Saturday, who makes Luke Littler look like John Lowe. Perhaps Luke Shaw can play there instead but ... ah ... yes, the semi, Dortmund and the Dutch. This one's for Graham Taylor. Big Ron Koeman, having tugged back David Platt in Rotterdam in 1993 then flipped one, flipped one, flipped one past David Seaman, is owed one. He leads a team almost as enigmatic as the English. \"What sort of thing is happening here?,\" to invoke Taylor. Have Virgil van Dijk's legs gone or is he just too cool to tackle? Memphis Depay: the lad who played for United? Cody Gakpo: him from Liverpool? Wout Weghorst: still on Burnley's books? That can't be Daley Blind? What inside info can Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink supply?\n\nWhatever the answers there, it probably requires England to actually play well to decide whether Berlin or the end of the Southgate era is what follows next.\n\nJoin Rob Smyth from 8pm BST for hot Euro 2024 semi-final coverage of Netherlands 1-0 England.\n\nWe saw a touch of genius from a footballer who we all need to take care of\" - Spain manager Luis de la Fuente speaks for all of us after witnessing 16-year-old Lamine Yamal score that goal against France.\n\nThe Football Daily pod squad discuss France v Spain and more.\n\nTo the story that has lifted Euro 24: Lamine Yamal's so-called 'wonder goal' against France. I would simply point to Bukayo Saka, who has been smashing in similar goals for Arsenal and England (in their last match against Switzerland, for example) for the last few seasons. Lamal's left-footed curler was wonderful and has diverted attention away from some of the dross that has stunk this tournament out, but lads, lads - it's football!\" - Frank Landamore.\n\nWhile I suppose England fans will be discussing tactics and the like before the match - across the pond, all fans will be talking about whether to listen to Landon Donovan or just hitting the mute button for the entire match\" - Dedric Helgert.\n\nSo Cody Gakpo thinks that having the quickest player in the Premier League gives the Dutch the advantage over England.

It is so difficult for us because any element of surprise you might have with the opponent is gone three days before the game. It is quite incredible, really.\"\n\nIt wasn't the longest comment Southgate has ever uttered, but there were a lot of layers to it, and it appeared to speak to concerns both past and present.\n\nOn its surface, he was talking about the decision to switch to a back three from a four-man defense for the quarterfinal victory over Switzerland on penalty kicks following a 1-1 draw after extra-time.\n\nIt turned out to be a good plan, but most English newspapers carried articles that Southgate was leaning toward that decision as early as Wednesday evening of last week.\n\nSwiss head coach Murat Yakin is an astute tactician and may have guessed what Southgate was going to do anyway, but it is not hard to see how he may have gained a small edge by seeming to receive early confirmation of it.\n\nThere are multiple ways such things can emerge into the public sphere. Portions of training sessions are open to the cameras, so any line up or players grouped together in a certain way can give hints to journalists familiar with the team over a number of years.\n\nEven things like which player is put up for media interview -- someone not going to feature in a game is unlikely to be put forward -- can be an indicator.\n\nAnd then there are just real-life human factors. Players are people who are away from home for weeks at a time and, naturally, with access to multiple forms of communication. They talk to their families, who may not always be discreet. They talk to their agents, some of whom may already have an established relationship with reporters and may see currency in trading such information for future benefit.\n\nWhen former England international Stan Collymore was scooping everyone and revealing the starters for each game of the 2010 World Cup, it was believed he was being fed the info by a person in the camp who was a personal friend.\n\nThings have gone a bit further this week in regard to England's approach to penalty kicks. As evidenced by the quarterfinal result, England has a way of doing things, from Jordan Pickford's water bottle to player selection, mental approach and much more.\n\n[Related: Jordan Pickford's wild water bottle is just the start of England's penalty preparation]\n\nThat's the bit from the first part of Southgate's answer, and that has mostly come from former members of the staff being more open in hindsight than the coach would have liked.\n\n\"Everybody else who used to work for the (Football Association) seems to have done that over a period of years,\" he said when asked to talk about his methods. \"We'll keep our counsel and prepare as thoroughly as we always do.\"\n\nFormer England FA \"game insights\" specialist Chris Markham was interviewed recently for a book about penalties, and spoke of how he had tried to increase the players' \"level of personal control.\"\n\nThe desire for secrecy has led to team media officials blocking journalists from asking certain questions. Guehi, Konsa, and Pickford have all been asked questions by reporters that were shut down before an answer could be given.\n\n[Related: 'We can change our lives forever': England's shot at history still alive]\n\nEngland has its quickest turnaround for this semifinal game and by Monday afternoon, just over 48 hours from kickoff, there had been a lot of speculation about what England might do, but no apparent leaks.\n\nThe discussions this time revolved around the role of captain Harry Kane, who has struggled during the tournament thus far and recorded only 27 touches of the ball in the last game, does not seem fully fit after a late-season back injury.\n\nWith Guehi available once again, there is a defensive decision too, another wrinkle being that Luke Shaw played his first soccer for five months after coming on as a sub on Saturday.\n\nBack three, back four, a new forward, a new captain, back to an old combination or forward to a fresh one?

Even in a country known for speaking its mind, this man-management method raised eyebrows.\n\nIt feels apt to reuse the phrase. The Netherlands finished third in their group. They faced Romania and Turkey en route to the last four. Standing in their way of a first European Championship final since 1988 is an England side who have been similarly muddled.\n\nThere was apathy when Koeman was initially reappointed coach in April 2022, and the 61-year-old has faced intense criticism throughout the tournament -- particularly after an ugly 3-2 defeat to Austria in their final Group C game. Just like their coach, the Dutch media have a reputation for speaking their mind.\n\n\"No adventure, too predictable and no ambition,\" one former Netherlands international texts during the group stages. \"It has to change drastically if we want to reach the semi-finals.\"\n\nKoeman stuck to his principles. There were no drastic changes. And after Saturday's quarter-final win over Turkey, this is the furthest that the Netherlands have gone in a Euros in 20 years, and their first major tournament semi-final in a decade.\n\nHere is another Dutch idiom that Koeman might feel obliged to use -- 'De beste stuurlui staan aan wal'. The best captains are those standing on land.\n\nOnly Germany's Berti Vogts has won the Euros as a coach and a player -- and after his triumph in 1988, Koeman is just two matches away from doing the same.\n\nBut just like England, their opponent in Wednesday's semi-final, the Netherlands have a coach who has been criticised throughout the tournament. The question remains: is the Netherlands' success because of him or despite him?\n\nThere were low expectations in the Netherlands before the Euros. Though their squad was defensively strong -- they have likely the best group of centre-backs at the tournament -- it is a transitional group in terms of age profile and lacks an attacking star.\n\nSome of this was down to Koeman. Though he had done well in his first spell in charge between 2018 and 2020 -- taking the Netherlands to the final of the 2019 Nations League as well as helping them qualify for their first major tournament since 2014 -- there was some mistrust after the way he had suddenly left for Barcelona.\n\n\"Sometimes you have to be a bit selfish in football,\" the coach said in Forca Koeman, a documentary that followed his return to the Camp Nou.\n\nBut some of the Dutch public's reticence was also down to his playing style -- a perceived tactical conservatism, heightened by his inability to produce a system at Barcelona that made the most of a highly talented group of players. Since Johan Cruyff and Rinus Michels' totaalvoetbal, the Netherlands coach does not just face the pressure of winning, but the pressure of winning well.\n\n\"My whole football life is pressure,\" Koeman said while managing Everton in 2017. \"If I don't get pressure from outside I put pressure on myself.\"\n\nSome of that self-induced pressure has not always been positive. He can be blunt, developing a habit of criticising players publicly. Players know where they stand -- but others have their confidence destabilised.\n\nAs well as Gravenberch, Koeman harshly criticised Brian Brobbey for his poor finishing when the Ajax forward was already in bad form, saying that \"his approach and the way he finished (in Netherlands training) was not good,\" and also attacked the goalscoring record of 23-year-old Bologna striker and Manchester United target Joshua Zirkzee.\n\nHaving not picked Zirkzee in his initial squad, Koeman was forced to row back when he called him up as an injury replacement less than a week before the tournament.\n\nThese injuries, in Koeman's defence, have been significant. Barcelona midfielder Frenkie de Jong was ruled out just before the start after failing to overcome an ankle injury. It was probably the most significant pre-tournament injury from any of the 24 sides -- De Jong was the Dutch midfield, with his elite press resistance making him one of the best No 6s in the world.\n\nTeun Koopmeiners, his possible replacement, was then ruled out with a muscle injury suffered in the warm-up before the Netherlands' final friendly game before the tournament.\n\nElsewhere, likely first-choice left-back Quilindschy Hartman suffered a torn ACL in March, with Nathan Ake moving over from centre-back to cover, while another centre-back, Arsenal's Jurrien Timber, was deemed to have not sufficiently recovered from his own torn knee ligament.\n\nStill, this was a squad that had the raw bones to potentially make a deep run at the tournament -- as they have. Defensive solidity has historically been the most important factor at the Euros, with Virgil van Dijk leading a first-choice back four featuring the experience of Ake and Stefan de Vrij, and the attacking ambition of Denzel Dumfries. In Jeremie Frimpong, Matthijs de Ligt and Micky van de Ven, the Netherlands also have a wealth of talent on the bench.\n\nThe attack was more of a work in progress -- with Memphis Depay and Cody Gakpo struggling for club minutes, and Xavi Simons never having worn the mantle of creator-in-chief at international level -- but there was enough stardust to score.\n\nIn the first two games, Koeman's side did enough -- recovering well from an early deficit to beat Poland 2-1, and possibly having the better of the chances against tournament favourites France. Back home, however, there were murmurings of concern over a negative style which sought to shut the game down rather than explode it open.\n\nThe main debate was over Depay's place in the side -- and whether he would be better replaced by 6ft 5in cult hero Wout Weghorst, who scored the winner against Poland within minutes of coming on. Told pre-tournament that his role would be as a bench option, Weghorst said during the warm-up games that it was \"disappointing\", \"annoying\", and \"sucks\".\n\nThen came the Netherlands' final group game -- and the mood totally changed. The Dutch may have only lost to Austria 3-2, but context is everything. They were swarmed by their opponents, who could and should have won by more. Before their first goal, Austria had completed 54 passes to the Netherlands' two.\n\nTactical conservatism is one thing -- but at least that usually comes with the trade-off of increased defensive solidity. Here, however, the Netherlands defence fell to pieces, with their tracking of midfield runners non-existent and Van Dijk enduring a desperately poor game.\n\n\"We have spoken a lot in the last 48 hours and some harsh words have been spoken,\" Van Dijk said. \"That is of course necessary, because some things have certainly happened.\"\n\nThe most visible issues came in Koeman's cobbled-together midfield. The manager had opted to replace De Jong with PSV Eindhoven's pairing of Jerdy Schouten and Joey Veerman, who had helped the club stroll to the 2023-24 Eredivisie title. Both are highly technical players but struggle in large spaces and when rushed into decisions.\n\nAustria's midfield of Florian Grillitsch and Nico Seiwald pressed them relentlessly, while the Netherlands' nervous back four sat deep, increasing the space they had to cover. After De Jong was ruled out, one tongue-in-cheek observation in the Netherlands was: 'What can Toni Kroos do which Joey Veerman can't?'\n\nQuite a lot, it turns out -- Veerman was substituted after 34 minutes, leaving the pitch in tears, after losing possession with 55 per cent of his touches, and finishing with a passing accuracy of just 47 per cent.\n\nWhen it was pointed out that Veerman was supposed to be good on the ball, Koeman replied in a manner that bordered on the cruel.\n\n\"Yes, why are you telling me this?\" he shot back. \"You have to ask him about this. I saw him tripping over the ball, giving the ball away. I can't explain it.\"\n\nDuring his playing career under Cruyff, Koeman, a former centre-back, received far worse both in private and in public but the timing of the outburst, after Veerman was clearly devastated by events, flew counter to comments given by Cruyff in his final public interview.\n\n\"Don't pull somebody out when they're bad,\" Cruyff said at a youth development convention in December 2015. \"Help him, which means that if somebody's down, get them up. If somebody's too up, get them down.\"\n\nThe Netherlands are only ever one game away from a full-blown inquest -- something Ake and Van de Ven wryly referenced in a press conference before the England game -- but this loss condemned them to third in the group. Before the reconfiguration of the group stages, this would have been an embarrassing exit.\n\nKoeman was criticised for his style of play and was asked whether Cruyff, his mentor, would have been proud of the performance against Austria.\n\n\"I know he liked attacking football very much, but I was a part of his team (for) a long time and we had worse matches than we did against Austria,\" he replied calmly.\n\nTwo days later, at a terse press conference with Ake and Van Dijk, one journalist asked: \"I got one (question) for the press officer: why is Koeman not sitting here? So he is going to be hiding for six days? A lot has happened. He is the leader.\"\n\nAt times, it can feel like this is only about Koeman, and not about the players themselves, some of whom have underperformed at times. But ultimately, many of the Netherlands' issues come down to the style of play that Koeman has fostered, or decisions he has resolutely stuck with.\n\nHere is another Dutch idiom -- 'Wie zijn billen brandt, moet op de blaren zitten'. He who burns his bottom must sit on the blisters.\n\nKoeman unashamedly has favourites. Before selecting his squad, he said that he would not wait for players who were struggling with their fitness, dropping Timber and Mats Wieffer for this reason, but that he had two exceptions -- De Jong and Depay.\n\nFrom the outset, it has been clear that Depay is a non-negotiable starter, despite having had a poor season for Atletico Madrid, scoring just five times in 23 La Liga appearances. His struggles have continued here, and possibly cost the Netherlands a win over France.\n\nA little like Southgate, Koeman tends to favour experience over form. He was criticised during the group stages for his persisted selection of Georginio Wijnaldum off the bench, who looked off the pace whenever he came on. Wijnaldum has not appeared in the knockouts.\n\nKoeman's decisions at centre-back have also been interesting -- opting for De Vrij over De Ligt for tactical reasons. Though the Inter defender has had a solid tournament, scoring the equaliser against Turkey, De Ligt is a higher-ceiling defender, whose front-foot style more suits the Netherlands' play.\n\nDe Vrij's passivity, however, is seen by Koeman as a better stylistic fit with Van Dijk -- but against Austria, where the depth of the Netherlands' defensive line was a major issue, the potential implications of this decision became evident.\n\nYet Koeman deserves credit for applying balm to those blisters. The Koeman who appeared after the Austria defeat resembled the irascible figure during his final days at Barcelona -- yet unlike at the Camp Nou, the coach has managed to find solutions.\n\nAgainst Romania, the introduction of Steven Bergwijn, who had not appeared for a single minute all tournament, was inspired. Bergwijn's drift infield, forming either a two-pronged striker partnership with Depay, or a pair of dual No 10s with Xavi Simons, left the Romania defence scrambling -- with the Netherlands always manufacturing an extra man in midfield.\n\nCody Gakpo's form on the left (he is the tournament's joint-top scorer) is largely down to him profiting from spaces created by interplay on the right -- but Koeman still has him playing with the confidence to exploit the one-vs-ones the Dutch system has created. At some moments, Koeman's characteristic bluntness has even had its benefits.\n\n\"After Austria, the atmosphere didn't go too sour,\" Gakpo said. \"It was good because we told each other the truth.\"\n\nIn that sense, though Koeman treated Veerman harshly, the decision to drop him has left the Netherlands far more balanced in midfield. Tijjani Reijnders has been pulled back from No 10 to partner Schouten in the double pivot -- which also allows Simons to play his preferred central role -- which has helped their press-resistance.\n\nAnd unlike Southgate, one area where Koeman has excelled is mid-game adaptation. Against Poland, they rebounded from 1-0 down to win 2-1. They had the best of the late chances to beat France. They may have lost to Austria, but Koeman's changes still allowed them to equalise twice. Two late goals secured the win over Romania. Another late comeback over Turkey, the key being playing Weghorst and Depay together, saw them into the semi-finals.\n\nThis tournament, England have not shown that trait -- yet ultimately there are more similarities between these coaches than differences.\n\nBoth are former defenders, who would rather hold on to what they have than plummet while over-reaching.\n\nEngland are cautious but prepared; they are generally in control of what they can control. The Netherlands are blunt, willing to counterpunch, and dance to their own drum.\n\nAnd undeniably, both have been hugely fortunate with their draws -- England facing Slovakia and Switzerland, the Netherlands facing Romania and Turkey.\n\nIn another world, the Netherlands were dumped out in the group stages, after failing to beat Poland. But in another still, the Netherlands drew with Austria, managed to top their group, and were knocked out by Belgium in the round of 16.\n\nKoeman has navigated his own pathway and made errors as he went. This side is made in his image -- and they are further along that road than any Dutch side has been for a decade.\n\nSometimes, they have fallen on their faces rather than their feet -- but a little butter has just helped grease the way.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jacob_whitehead@nytimes.com", "name": "Jacob

Since their memorable victory in 1988, the Netherlands have lost three out of three Euros semi-finals and this is their first final four berth since 2004.\n\nKoeman has seemingly stumbled upon a preferred system with his side impressing in the knockouts, although this Dutch team has hardly set the world alight in Germany.\n\nHere is how the Netherlands could line up against England in Wednesday's Euro 2024 semi-final.\n\nGK: Bart Verbruggen - There have been questions surrounding the Brighton goalkeeper this summer but, after notching his first clean sheet of the tournament in the last 16, Verbruggen was on hand to preserve his country's lead late on against Turkey.\n\nRB: Denzel Dumfries - Dumfries plays a key role in Koeman's system, operating as an auxiliary winger. He's performed well in Germany and has linked up to good effect with Cody Gakpo on the opposite flank.\n\nCB: Stefan de Vrij - He's no Micky van de Ven in terms of recovery running but De Vrij, formerly a stellar performer for Antonio Conte's Inter during their title-winning 2020/21 season, has garnered the trust of Koeman and found the back of the net against Turkey.\n\nCB: Virgil van Dijk - Van Dijk enjoyed an excellent 2023/24 season with Liverpool but has been ruffled a few times at Euro 2024. Still, Harry Kane will have to improve markedly to get any change out of the giant Dutchman.\n\nLB: Nathan Ake - The Manchester City star continues to impress for the national team. Ake plays a key balancing role in the Netherlands' backline, allowing Dumfries to advance down the opposite flank. He's previously enjoyed his duels with Bukayo Saka.\n\nCM: Tijjani Reijnders - Having started the tournament in a more advanced role, Netherlands' initial midfield issues have seen the Milan maestro drop into a deeper position. Reijnders is a classy customer who can do it all in the middle of the park.\n\nCM: Jerdy Schouten - Despite all their key absences and Joey Veerman's struggles in the group stage, the Dutch have got a nice balance in midfield. Schouten has a tremendous passing range but will also aim to limit Phil Foden and Jude Bellingham between the lines.\n\nRW: Donyell Malen - An unused substitute against Turkey, Malen's pace could strike some fear into England's backline. The Borussia Dortmund star is awfully inconsistent in the final third but scored twice during the Dutch's 3-0 victory over Romania in the last 16.\n\nAM: Xavi Simons - Simons has undoubtedly flashed his talent in Germany this summer but a statement performance is yet to arrive.\n\nLW: Cody Gakpo - Gakpo loves the big stage with the national team and the Dutch will aim to exploit Kyle Walker's issues at defending the back post on Wednesday. Gakpo has three goals at Euro 2024 and is competing for Golden Boot honours. He also played a major role in the winner against Turkey.\n\nST: Memphis Depay - Koeman is set to resist Dutch clamours back home for Wout Weghorst in order to start Depay up top again. While Depay is closing in on his country's all-time scoring record, his form has been infuriatingly patchy this summer. Weghorst will have a role to play.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Koeman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Koeman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denzel_Dumfries", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Denzel Dumfries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_de_Vrij", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stefan de Vrij"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil_van_Dijk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virgil van Dijk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton_&_Hove_Albion_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brighton & Hove Albion F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berlin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micky_van_de_Ven", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Micky van de Ven"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tijjani_Reijnders", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tijjani Reijnders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cody_Gakpo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cody Gakpo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Harry Kane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Conte", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antonio Conte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Italy national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inter Milan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavi_Simons", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xavi Simons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Bellingham", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jude Bellingham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joey_Veerman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joey Veerman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukayo_Saka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bukayo Saka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donyell_Malen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donyell Malen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_Football_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Romanian Football Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wout_Weghorst", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wout Weghorst"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis_Depay", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Memphis Depay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Walker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Substitute (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borussia_Dortmund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Borussia Dortmund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C._Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "A.C.

An estimated 80,000 Dutch fans are expected to cross the border from the Netherlands into Germany and while they won't all fit in the stadium, filling 'Yellow Wall' end will be a huge boost for the team.\n\nThe Sudtribune - or south stand - can house up to 25,000 supporters and is one of European football's most intimidating sights when in full flow.\n\nWhile Koeman's men will be able to draw on the noise of some of the most passionate fans at the tournament, the Dutch boss will also look to use history to help inspire his men.\n\nThe iconic Dutch team of the 1970s played three times at the stadium in the 1974 World Cup, creating football history in the process.\n\nTheir first match there was a goalless draw with Sweden in the first group stage that saw the first documented use of the iconic 'Cruyff turn', as the Dutch legend Johan Cruyff flummoxed Swedish defender Jan Olsson in the 22nd minute of a goalless draw. A Johan Neeskens brace inspired a 4-1 thrashing of Bulgaria at the same venue before a 2-0 win over Brazil (which was refereed by a German - just like Wednesday's match will be) in Dortmund booked their place in the World Cup final.\n\nSo if England are finally to deliver on ending 58 years of hurt this summer, they will need to silence an 'Oranje Wall' and then rewrite Dutch football

In 2024, it is edging closer to repeating history but this time faces England in the semifinal and if it gets past the Three Lions, the unbeaten Spain awaits in the grand finale on July 14.\n\nThe Dutch are being led by coach Ronald Koeman, who was part of the Euro-winning side, and will attempt to go down in history books as only the second man to win the Euros both as a player and a coach - the first being Beri Vogts of Germany.\n\nThe Netherlands has been playing an attractive and aggressive brand of football so far and has scored the third-highest number of goals (9) in the tournament behind Spain and Germany.\n\nCody Gakpo is the joint-leading goalscorer with three goals as the Liverpool attacker has been a menace for the Dutch on the left flank.\n\nAlthough the Netherlands is relying on its ultra-attacking approach which is working for it, this has come at the cost of its poor showing at the back.\n\nHolland has conceded five goals so far, the most out of the four semifinalists, and its overall defensive performance has been below par compared to the other big teams of the tournament.\n\nAttack - the best form of defense?\n\nWhen it comes to attacking stats, the Netherlands is ranking high in Euro 2024. It is averaging an xG (expected goals) per 90 minutes of 1.49, the second-highest among the final four teams behind Spain.\n\nIt has taken 20 shots on target and has a conversion rate of 16.4 per cent. It has made 105 progressive carries and 230 passes into the final third, which is less than France. The difference is the Dutch have converted those forward forays into goalscoring opportunities unlike France which scored once from open play.\n\nHowever, their defensive stats have been on the other end of the spectrum.\n\nThey have conceded 21 shots on target and have only won 48.6 per cent of its defensive duels - 10th worst out of the 24 teams playing in the tournament. They also have just 28 interceptions and 14 blocks made in five matches but even with these poor numbers, they still stand with a realistic shot at the title.\n\nThis is because it is almost as if the Netherlands is ready to risk conceding goals and not playing safe due to its attacking approach. It pushes up in numbers and maintains a high backline indicating that it aims to outscore its opponents.\n\nAnalysis of Netherlands' defensive tactics\n\nThe Netherlands plays with a 4-3-3 formation with two central midfielders and one attacking midfielder in the form of Xavi Simons.\n\nThe back-four consists of the centre-back pairing of Virgil Van Dijk and Stefan De Vrij, Nathan Ake on the left, Denzel Dumfries on the right.\n\nWhen out of possession, Netherlands tries to maintain its back-four however, as soon as it gets the ball, Dumfries is relieved from his defensive duty. He joins the attack by either pushing high up on the right wing, giving an overlapping option on the final third or cutting in as an inverted full-back to add body in central midfield.\n\nDenzel Dumfires (22) joins the attack and plays a pass into the box for Memphis Depay against Romania during the round of 16 of Euro 2024. | Photo Credit: SonyLIV screengrab\n\nDenzel Dumfires (22) joins the attack and plays a pass into the box for Memphis Depay against Romania during the round of 16 of Euro 2024. | Photo Credit: SonyLIV screengrab\n\nThis converts its backline from a back-four to a three-man defence with Ake moving central. This gives the Netherlands an extra player in attack with the backline pressing extremely high, crossing the halfway line to apply pressure on the opposing team.\n\nThe high backline and narrow defensive setup make the Netherlands highly susceptible to counterattacks. Although Dumfries is a quick player and can fall back, he can often be caught out of position against the opponent's winger.\n\nMarcel Sabitzer making a run behind on the left flank as Denzel Dumfries fails to mark him.

Sabitzer scored the winner against Netherlands with this move in the group stage of Euro 2024. | Photo Credit: SonyLIV screengrab\n\nHence, most of the attacks it fends off are on the right wing making it the strongest area for Netherlands.\n\nOut of the five goals its has conceded, one has been off of a corner, while the other four have been from the left flanks\n\nThe way to score against the Netherlands is to make most of the counterattacks, stretch its defense by utilising the wings and attack from the left flank with overlapping runs by wide players.\n\nCan Netherlands win Euro 2024?\n\nThe attacking build-up has been on point, however, and it needs to be more clinical in front of goal. Its centre-forward Memphis Depay has only scored once so far and Koeman is yet to figure out a permanent player on the right wing since he has been switching between Donyell Malen and Steven Bergwijn.\n\nAgainst England, which has a tight defensive shape, playing a deep backline which is a problem for the Netherlands since it will be difficult to find space in the final third and hence chances are expected to be scarce.\n\nBut, on the other hand, England is predicted to continue playing narrow with two attacking midfielders in Jude Bellingham and Phil Foden. With only one player on each flank, England will find it difficult to stretch the Dutch defence. Additionally, Bukayo Saka is on the right wing, opposite of Dumfries, hence either Luke Shaw or Kieran Trippier (depending on who starts) will have to play a pivotal role on the left in England's attacks.\n\nIf Netherlands goes through the semifinal, it faces Spain in what would be a repeat of the 2010 FIFA World Cup final. Spain's backline is a bit slower and ageing, which is perfect for the dynamic Dutch attackers to play around and find goals. However, its wingers Lamine Yamal and Nico Williams are in terrific form and will be able to exploit the gaps in the Dutch defence.\n\nLatest on SportstarEURO 2024: Netherlands' ultra-attacking brand

Reflecting on the scrutiny he faces, Southgate said: \"I can't deny that some of the personal nature, you know ... ,\" adding, \"This is a job where you get ridiculed, and your professional capability is questioned beyond belief, and I don't think it's normal to have beer thrown at you either.\"\n\nEngland manager Gareth Southgate has spoken about the resilience he's built throughout his life, which fuels his determination to lead the team to greater heights. \"But I'm fortunate that my life's taken me through a lot of resilience-building and it's made me more determined and I'm just using it as fuel. I know where I want to take the team to. The team need to see me strong in those moments as well, otherwise that messaging that you're giving them on what they need to be, it doesn't ring true.\", reports Birmingham Live.\n\nHe also emphasised a shift in mentality within the squad, highlighting their ambition to go beyond just reaching quarter-finals. \"The difference is we arrive in a quarter-final, we're not satisfied with that, so there is definitely a mindset shift in what we feel is acceptable as a team,\" Southgate remarked.\n\n\"Within that it's knockout football. The margins are so fine. That can easily tip the other way and it's a different story but those teams that have won consistently, they have that mindset, they're not just satisfied with being in quarter-finals, they're pushing on and that's what we have to continue.

It isn't normal to have beer thrown at you, something that the giddy masses packed in front of the nation's various big screens on Saturday would have done well to remember when Trent Alexander-Arnold whipped home the winning penalty against Switzerland.\n\nAnd yet, in the aftermath of that shootout triumph, Southgate's need to defend his record to those who \"ridicule\" him was telling of the feeling that has clouded England's whole Euro 2024 campaign.\n\nWe shouldn't sugar coat it. Considering the talent at his disposal, even the most fervent Southgate defenders would struggle to argue that the Three Lions have performed anywhere close to their potential over the past three weeks. The lack of chance creation has been genuinely staggering, players all over the field are massively underperforming and the tactics are about as enthralling as a Harry Kane post-match interview.\n\nDespite this, England are now just two victories away from securing their first men's major tournament triumph in nearly 60 years. And, as difficult as it might be for those who like their football slightly less miserable, it's surely time for a nation that lives to moan to fully get behind their slightly dull national team.\n\nIf that concept seems difficult to accept, you are likely not alone.

The manager spoke about how it's not \"normal to have beer thrown at you\" or to have \"your professional capability\" questioned \"beyond belief\", but that this served in setting an example about resolve. Southgate spoke proudly about the \"resilience\" his players showed, stating that is as important as performance in \"navigating tournaments.\n\nEngland again walked a fine line in a gruelling penalty shoot-out Euro 2024 quarter-final victory over Switzerland in a 1-1 draw, but it resulted in Southgate making it three semi-finals out of four major tournaments. That has come despite a more intense debate than usual about his capability for the job, which culminated in fans throwing beer cups at him after the 0-0 draw with Slovenia. Southgate was asked whether he has been hardened to all of this, after eliminating the Swiss.\n\n\"Look, I can't deny that some of the personal nature, you know... this is a job where you get ridiculed, and your professional capability is questioned beyond belief, and I don't think it's normal to have beer thrown at you either,\" Southgate said, albeit plaintively smiling.\n\n\"But, I'm fortunate that my life's taken me through a lot of resilience-building and it's made me more determined and I'm just using it as fuel. I know where I want to take the team to, and, yeah, the team need to see me strong in those moments as well, otherwise that messaging that you're giving them on what they need to be, it doesn't ring true.\"\n\nWhatever about other fair criticisms of England, it is undeniably true they have developed a similar resolve. Southgate had been asked about the pride in reaching yet another semi-final given England's previous poor record in getting that far, but insisted there are now higher aims, in part due to the team's resilience.\n\n\"I guess, this isn't where we want it to end, you know, you don't necessarily want to speak about that too much. It is an unusual achievement for even the most successful nations but these guys, they've shown more than being able to just play. And, navigating tournaments, you need lots of other qualities.\n\n\"It is that resilience, it is that ability to stay composed when you go behind in games, or when momentum's against you, we won three penalty shoot-outs out of four, all those little bits build character, build belief, and yeah, hopefully it's not just... there's this tournament, but given the age of the squad and their experiences now, they'll have that belief for a long time, it should put England in a good place, but that's the future - we've got a good week ahead of us.\"\n\nSouthgate said there had been a definite transformation in the team's own expectation and what they think is acceptable.\n\n\"Well, I think the difference is, you know, we arrive in a quarter-final, we're not satisfied with that, so there is definitely a mindset shift in what we feel is acceptable as a team, where we want to end up, now within that it's knock-out football, the margins are so fine as we've seen again tonight, that can easily tip the other way and it's a different story but those teams that have won consistently, they have that mindset, they're not just satisfied with being in quarter-finals, they're pushing in and that's what we have to continue.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southgate,_London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southgate, London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southgate, London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/7b11fd662d830da513c0523cf850553a", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712618", "eventUri": "eng-9712618", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 96, "relevance": 1}

The manager spoke about how it's not \"normal to have beer thrown at you\" or to have \"your professional capability\" questioned \"beyond belief\", but that this served in setting an example about resolve. Southgate spoke proudly about the \"resilience\" his players showed, stating that is as important as performance in \"navigating tournaments.\n\nEngland again walked a fine line in a gruelling penalty shoot-out Euro 2024 quarter-final victory over Switzerland in a 1-1 draw, but it resulted in Southgate making it three semi-finals out of four major tournaments. That has come despite a more intense debate than usual about his capability for the job, which culminated in fans throwing beer cups at him after the 0-0 draw with Slovenia. Southgate was asked whether he has been hardened to all of this, after eliminating the Swiss.\n\n\"Look, I can't deny that some of the personal nature, you know... this is a job where you get ridiculed, and your professional capability is questioned beyond belief, and I don't think it's normal to have beer thrown at you either,\" Southgate said, albeit plaintively smiling.\n\n\"But, I'm fortunate that my life's taken me through a lot of resilience-building and it's made me more determined and I'm just using it as fuel. I know where I want to take the team to, and, yeah, the team need to see me strong in those moments as well, otherwise that messaging that you're giving them on what they need to be, it doesn't ring true.\"\n\nWhatever about other fair criticisms of England, it is undeniably true they have developed a similar resolve. Southgate had been asked about the pride in reaching yet another semi-final given England's previous poor record in getting that far, but insisted there are now higher aims, in part due to the team's resilience.\n\n\"I guess, this isn't where we want it to end, you know, you don't necessarily want to speak about that too much. It is an unusual achievement for even the most successful nations but these guys, they've shown more than being able to just play. And, navigating tournaments, you need lots of other qualities.\n\n\"It is that resilience, it is that ability to stay composed when you go behind in games, or when momentum's against you, we won three penalty shoot-outs out of four, all those little bits build character, build belief, and yeah, hopefully it's not just... there's this tournament, but given the age of the squad and their experiences now, they'll have that belief for a long time, it should put England in a good place, but that's the future - we've got a good week ahead of us.\"\n\nSouthgate said there had been a definite transformation in the team's own expectation and what they think is acceptable.\n\n\"Well, I think the difference is, you know, we arrive in a quarter-final, we're not satisfied with that, so there is definitely a mindset shift in what we feel is acceptable as a team, where we want to end up, now within that it's knock-out football, the margins are so fine as we've seen again tonight, that can easily tip the other way and it's a different story but those teams that have won consistently, they have that mindset, they're not just satisfied with being in quarter-finals, they're pushing in and that's what we have to continue.\"", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southgate,_London", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Southgate, London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southgate, London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gareth_Southgate", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gareth Southgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovenia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Slovenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/07/10/SEI211833265.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9712618", "eventUri": "eng-9712618", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 94, "relevance": 1}

Here are four of them.\n\nThis is not the England side of 2018 who were a danger from any and all dead-ball opportunities -- but the Netherlands have struggled throughout the tournament.\n\nIn Virgil van Dijk, Stefan de Vrij, and Ake, the Dutch have three dominant aerial ball-winners. The issue is when any of these three are not the primary defender.\n\nNeither of the central midfielders, Jerdy Schouten and Tijjani Reijnders, are particularly strong in these duels, while with Memphis Depay as the starting forward, the Netherlands do not have the luxury of being able to drop back a physical striker for defensive corners.\n\nThis cost them against Turkey. They had already been fortunate that Abdulkerim Bardakci had volleyed over Hakan Calhanoglu's free-kick from 10 yards out, but another set piece 10 minutes later put them 1-0 down.\n\nFor this corner, the Netherlands placed some of their weaker defenders on the near post, with De Vrij, Van Dijk, and Ake defending the centre of the goal. This is relatively standard practice.\n\nHowever, with the initial corner defended by Van Dijk, and knocked towards the far edge of the pitch, what was the near post became the far post.\n\nCalhanoglu is one of the best dead-ball specialists in the world, and with this much time, could effectively pick his spot -- identifying a mismatch between his own centre-back, Samet Akaydin, and Dutch defenders Reijnders and Steven Bergwijn. Akaydin easily headed home from less than six yards.\n\nEngland, with strong aerial attackers -- including Harry Kane, John Stones, Marc Guehi and Jude Bellingham -- as well as a proven ability to innovate at corners, could take advantage.\n\nThis was not the first corner that the Netherlands have conceded this tournament -- with Adam Buksa scoring Poland's opener this way. Here, Joey Veerman fails to nudge him off his run, giving the striker a clear run at Van Dijk and Denzel Dumfries. While technically Dumfries' man, who cannot match Buksa's leap, Van Dijk is also caught flat-footed, and Poland went ahead against the run of play.\n\nOne thing to note here is that the Netherlands tend to improve as the game goes on -- they usually put 6ft 5in (196cm) striker Wout Weghorst on midway through the second half, which adds a fourth aerially dominant ball-winner to the side.\n\nThe organisation of their press is one area where England have a clear advantage over the Netherlands. While England are much more proactive defensively, the Netherlands will settle into a mid-block more quickly, after an initial, cursory attempt at pressure.\n\nHowever, that initial desire to win the ball is often poorly executed, putting undue pressure on the defence. Take this example against Turkey, where the Netherlands are in their 4-2-3-1 defensive shape.\n\nRight-winger Cody Gakpo presses Kaan Ayhan, who cuts inside to avoid him. Depay is not cutting that off. The issue is that Schouten and Reijnders have slightly switched off, and jogged upfield -- putting four Dutch defenders into a tiny area of the pitch.\n\nWith one turn, Ayhan has time and space -- and can play an incredibly simple ball into Ferdi Kadioglu, who drives upfield. The Netherlands were fortunate that the left wing-back keeps the ball himself and was dispossessed, rather than finding another one of the multiple options on offer to him.\n\nHere is another example from the same game. The Netherlands are protecting their 2-1 lead, but are disorganised. Weghorst presses -- but is totally alone, and is easily evaded by Bardakci. While Weghorst is pressing, Schouten is dropping deep to maintain his connection with Reijnders, while Xavi Simons is pushing to his right to cover the left wing-back.\n\nThis creates a large pocket in space -- which, in the final five minutes of a tight match, the Turkey centre-back can simply wander into. He puts Kerem Akturkoglu in behind -- with only a last-gasp block from Micky van de Ven preventing Zeki Celik from converting the cross.\n\nIn Stones, England have one of the best centre-backs in the world at exploiting a sloppy press, moving into midfield, and playing a dangerous ball.\n\nTo an extent, this leads on from the problem above. The 3-2 loss to Austria in the group stage is a good place to start -- with all three goals linked to this issue.\n\nThe Eredivisie has a slower pace of play than international football, meaning that the starters in this game, PSV Eindhoven midfield pairing Schouten and Veerman, could be put under pressure.\n\nBoth lack top-end pace, and while Schouten's game intelligence means he excels at intercepting the ball in patterned play, both midfielders struggle to help out their defence in transitional moments.\n\nTake the opening goal, where, again, the midfield pairing has pushed too high amidst a disorganised one-man press led by Depay. This is a position they can only adopt if they have the pace to recover. They don't.\n\nOne ball through the lines to Marko Arnautovic leaves Schouten and Veerman unable to recover. Right-winger Donyell Malen busts a gut to get back -- and in sliding in, is unfortunate to score an own goal.\n\nAustria's winner is the clearest example. Marcel Sabitzer gallops into a huge space between the lines, and despite appearing to have the angle on him, Schouten cannot influence play for 40 yards.\n\nSabitzer eventually lays the ball off to Stefan Posch, but when the ball goes to Christoph Baumgartner, Schouten has switched off again. He is caught ball-watching, and cannot cover Sabitzer's run -- who smashes in Austria's winner.\n\nThe Austria defeat was probably the Netherlands' worst performance under Koeman, and changes were made -- with Veerman dropped and Reijnders pulled back from No 10 into the double-pivot.\n\nThis has helped somewhat with the athleticism issues -- but the more offensively-minded Reijnders has his own positional issues when out of possession, and can struggle to pick up runners.\n\nBellingham's ability to box-crash means that he is the ideal player to exploit this weakness -- while this advantage can be further drawn out if Gareth Southgate selects wingers who run in behind, and are dangerous in transition. More on this below.\n\nOne of the Netherlands' biggest strengths in attack is their use of Dumfries. The right wing-back is outstanding at maintaining his width and providing an overlapping option, with the notional right winger (usually either Bergwijn or Simons) dropping inside to create an overload in midfield.\n\nBut with this being their main attacking weapon, it is natural that Dumfries can be overexuberant -- and this can be exploited.\n\nThe Romania game is a good example of this, where Romania's relative lack of width meant that Dumfries was rampant. Yet here, when a ricochet in midfield led to a surprise change of possession, look at the awkward shape that the Netherlands find themselves in.\n\nThey are fortunate that the bounce of the ball means that Denis Dragus cannot hit Ianis Hagi in stride -- and Dumfries' recovery pace limits the attack to a shot from distance. This was a let-off.\n\nHere is an even better example, where Dumfries justifiably sprints up the right wing -- look at the space if Depay can find him. However, when Tottenham's Radu Dragusin clears the ball onto the Dutch defence's left side, Dumfries is far too committed to get back into play. Dennis Man squares the ball, which quickly finds its way to Nicolae Stanciu.\n\nOne potential soft spot of the Dutch system is that the right-sided centre-back is De Vrij, the slowest of their defensive options, yet the player who is asked to cover for Dumfries' bursts. Stanciu was easily able to get on his outside and take a shot on goal.\n\nThis is the key area which England need to consider. Bukayo Saka has been England's most dangerous attacker in Germany -- yet will be marked by Ake, who has been the Netherlands' most consistent player.\n\nEngland need to move away from their right-side dominant attack -- and with the ability to counterpunch on the left, choosing players who are defensively sound while being able to burst into that space is pivotal.\n\nIf fully fit, this could mean restoring Luke Shaw to the left-back role -- whose natural left-footedness would allow England to break quickly, or selecting a player like Anthony Gordon, whose willingness to run in behind is the best way to exploit the space outside De Vrij. For this specific role, Phil Foden is not the best option.\n\nThe Netherlands' right-hand side is both their strength and a potential Achilles' heel -- will England simply attempt to shut it down, or make changes in order to exploit it?", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jacob_whitehead@nytimes.com", "name": "Jacob

The Licensing Act 2003, gives the Home Secretary the power to relax licensing hours on occasions of \"exceptional national significance\".\n\nBack in May, outgoing Tory Minister James Cleverly said: \"Over the coming weeks we will all be getting ready to support our home nations. It will be a busy summer of sport and a proud moment for Britain and we have listened to the public through our consultation.\n\n\"We will be extending pub licensing hours should England or Scotland reach the semi-finals or final of Euro 2024.

I know where I want to take the team to. The team need to see me strong in those moments as well, otherwise that messaging that you're giving them on what they need to be, it doesn't ring true.\"\n\n\"The difference is we arrive in a quarter-final, we're not satisfied with that, so there is definitely a mindset shift in what we feel is acceptable as a team,\" Southgate said. \"Within that it's knockout football. The margins are so fine. That can easily tip the other way and it's a different story but those teams that have won consistently, they have that mindset, they're not just satisfied with being in quarter-finals, they're pushing on and that's what we have to continue.

Only Germany and Spain have scored more in the tournament.\n\nCody Gakpo has three and was denied a fourth, which would have eased him clear in the race for the Golden Boot, when the winner against Turkey was ruled an own goal by Mert Muldur.\n\n'It went in, I'm OK with it,' said Gakpo. 'Most important is to win. It's all that matters at the end. You can play good football but if you don't win, you're out. Every country can play a little bit better but if you continue winning that's good.'\n\nDEFENSIVE PILLARS\n\nRonald Koeman began his second spell in charge in 2023 with a promise to return to the classic 4-3-3 system upon which Cruyffian football philosophies were established.\n\nThe defence in front of Brighton goalkeeper Bart Verbruggen is fairly settled. Nathan Ake at left back offsets Denzel Dumfries who has licence to rampage forward on the right, so the team shape shifts into a back three when in possession, as is the fashion.\n\nThe chemistry between captain Virgil van Dijk and De Vrij in the heart of defence means there is no place for Manchester United target Matthijs de Ligt or Tottenham favourite Micky van de Ven.\n\nThey may lack panache going forward but there's a wealth of options at the back and their hard-to-beat mentality has drawn praise, as if the Dutch might be breaking free from the chains of expectancy to play a certain brand of football.\n\nIRREPLACEABLE FRENKIE\n\nThe loss of Barcelona midfielder Frenkie de Jong on the eve of the tournament robbed Koeman of his playmaker. Without him, Koeman has been searching for a midfield balance. Again with parallels to England.\n\nHe has flipped around various players and settled on Jerdy Schouten and Tijjani Reijnders deep with Xavi Simons further forward against Turkey.\n\nThere is a knock-on effect up front. With well-drilled defences sitting deep in the Euros and no De Jong on the ball, directing play and threading passes, Memphis Depay has been less effective as a central striker, scoring just once, in the Dutch's 3-2 defeat by Austria in their final group game.\n\nThey have looked more dangerous from crosses, and the Dumfries to Gakpo connection is strong from their time together at PSV Eindhoven.\n\nWOUT AND ABOUT\n\nThere is a lobby for Wout Weghorst to start against England. He came on to score the winner against Poland and turned the quarter-final against Turkey after coming off the bench, providing a focal point for Koeman's free attacking spirits.\n\n'He's a nightmare to play against,' said Ake. 'Strong and a nuisance in the box. He fights for everything, runs off everything. For us he's a great asset. He gave us great presence.\n\n'You can put more crosses in earlier. You get second balls and a little bit more scrimmage in the box and you create a little bit more chaos and they have to defend more.'\n\nIf Weghorst comes in, he will likely be flanked by Depay and Gakpo with Simons in support.\n\nFEELING FRESH\n\nThe Dutch have not been taken to extra time. They cruised past Romania 3-0 in the last 16 and protected their 2-1 lead against Turkey with last-ditch defending and good saves by Verbruggen.\n\nReijnders has covered the most distance for the Netherlands with 49.4km in 408 minutes played, 14.5km fewer than Declan Rice who has covered more ground than any player at Euro 2024 in his 510 minutes.\n\nIn total, seven England players have covered more ground than Reijnders, with just three days to recover before Wednesday's semi-final in Dortmund.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast

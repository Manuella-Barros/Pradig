The Caley Jags board announced on Friday they had reached an agreement to relocate to the home of Kelty Hearts from pre-season. The club believes moving its training base will help them overcome the geographical challenge of attracting players to the Highlands as it bids to win promotion back to the Scottish Championship. But Robertson fears the links forged with the local community will be lost as a result of relocation. Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland, Robertson said: \u201cI was stunned when I read (the statement). It\u2019s a strange one. \u201cIn terms of recruitment will it make it easier to sign players? Yes, but that\u2019s not Inverness. \u201cPlayers will come up at 1pm and leave at 6pm on a Saturday and not know any of the staff, the groundsman and have no affiliation to the city, region, club or supporters other than wearing the jersey of the club. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why they have to move the club why they have to move down there at all. I genuinely don\u2019t believe it. It\u2019s a shame. \u201cThe thing about coming to Inverness is you integrate. I see myself now as an Invernessian as I\u2019ve been here for 20-odd years. I\u2019m an Edinburgh boy but I love the city and the people. \u201cThe fans are hugely loyal to their team and want to see their young players coming through. \u201cI did everything I could to help the club in both spells, I\u2019m still a huge fan of the club and the people are so friendly and passionate. \u201cIt\u2019s a lovely place to come and play football, and the amount of players who have come and stayed up here.\u201d \u2018Attracting players north is not impossible\u2019 Caley Thistle fans have reacted with dismay to the announcement and Robertson, who guided the club to promotion to the SPL in 2004 in his first spell in charge, is saddened by the decision. He knows the challenge of luring players to the Highland is a significant challenge but not one which cannot be met. He said: \u201cThe location is difficult but is it impossible? No chance. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed. The club will say it is difficult to attract players but if they don\u2019t want to come here then don\u2019t come. I knew as a manager once I signed a player he was committed to the club. \u201cHe was committed to coming up here and I knew the lad would give everything for the club. \u201cThere were players who said \u2018no, I don\u2019t want to come\u2019 and that\u2019s fine. You move on. \u201cIt is difficult and challenging but not impossible. They have proved that over the years. \u201cWhen I came up here 22 years ago I came in and found out what the DNA was. \u201cIt was local players coming through and bringing what we\u2019d call broken players, gems from other parts of the country, up here and developing them before moving them on. \u201cTwenty years ago this year we got to the Premier League for the first time and built on it. \u201cBut we have always had a strong group of local players. We brought the young lads through, training them with the first team.\u201d Link between youths and first-team could suffer Robertson also questioned what relocation means for the younger players at the club. The former Caley Jags boss believes the same geographical challenge which the club has in attracting players north could become an issue for youth team players. He said: \u201cWhat happens to the 17-year-olds who have got contracts? Will they will have to move to train with the first team? \u201cThe under-18s will train Monday, Tuesday and Thursday evenings as they do now but they won\u2019t be interacting with the first team.\u201d", "summary": "Caley Jags' decision to relocate to Fife for training could damage its standing with the Inverness community.", "url": "https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/sport/football/inverness-caledonian-thistle/6482077/former-caley-thistle-boss-fears-club-risks-severing-links-with-the-local-community/", "image": "https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/05/PJ-SMc-230120-04-09_34486808-24ubnub3b.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 16:00:45", "author": "Paul Third", "authors": ["Paul Third"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.038}

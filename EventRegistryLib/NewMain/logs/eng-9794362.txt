What happens if the UK says no to her asylum request?", "body": "Former PM of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina, has sought for asylum in the UK. In the meantime, she remains in India after fleeing Bangladesh and resigning. File image/AP\n\nForty-five minutes. That's all the time now ousted Bangladesh prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, got to pack up and flee the country after resigning. Soon after she fled, a sea of protesters stormed her official residence -- the Ganabhaban -- and ransacked the premises.\n\nAs per reports by Prothom Alo, a Bangladeshi daily, she had wanted to address the nation about her decision, but given the sea of protesters coming her way, authorities told her she had no time, resulting in her and her sister, Rehana, fleeing with a few of their bags.\n\nOn board a C-130 J transport aircraft, accompanied by seven military personnel, Hasina then made her way to India, landing at Ghaziabad's Hindon air base on the evening of Monday (August 5). She met with National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, accompanied by senior officials at the air base and has now moved to a 'safe house'. It is reported that New Delhi carried out a massive exercise -- deploying Rafale jets -- to ensure that Hasina was granted safe passage to the country as part of her plan to travel to London where she will seek asylum.\n\nNow, hours after Hasina landed in India, she has yet to make any movement, with reports saying that she still remains in the 'safe house' designated for her. The question then remains: How long will she stay in India? And what are the challenges of her staying here?\n\nHow long will Hasina stay in India?\n\nAfter Hasina resigned as the prime minister of Bangladesh, she was offered a military helicopter by the Bangladesh army. She flew out of her official residence in Dhaka, ' Ganabhaban', which was stormed by protesters soon after she left.\n\nThe Bangladesh leader headed to an army air base from where she reportedly boarded the C-130J military transport aircraft of the Bangladesh air force. Soon, her flight, 'AJAX1431', became the most-tracked flight on Flightradar24.\n\nAmid all the speculation on where she would land -- initial reports said that she would arrive in Kolkata or Agartala -- her flight made its way to Hindon Airbase around 5.45 pm on Monday (5 August) where she was greeted by National Security Advisor Ajit Doval. The Hindon Airbase, according to many, was the eventual choice because of its proximity to Delhi; it is 30 km from the national capital. It would provide foolproof security to Hasina.\n\nFollowing an hour-long meeting with NSA Doval, she was then taken to a \"safe house\" in Delhi.\n\nHowever, India is only a temporary stop for Hasina. She is reportedly seeking asylum in the UK.\n\nIt remains unclear how much longer she will remain in India, but External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar dropped indicators on Tuesday that the former Bangladeshi PM's stay will continue for a while.\n\nSpeaking to an all-party meeting in Parliament House, where Rahul Gandhi and others were present, S Jaishankar said that the government had spoken to Hasina about her plans for her future. \"The government wants to give Hasina some time to decide her future plan,\" sources quoted Jaishankar as saying.\n\nHe added that it had not even been 24 hours since the former Bangladeshi PM had arrived in India and that she was in a state of shock. Moreover, the government was giving her time to recover before it spoke to her over various issues, including her future plans.\n\nMeanwhile, the plane that ferried her to India has left Hindon Airbase, as per a Hindustan Times report. The aircraft took off around 9:00 am with seven military personnel and was flying towards its base in Bangladesh.\n\nWhat about her UK asylum?\n\nEarly on, when Hasina was en route to India, all reports stated that her stay in India would be temporary, as she is seeking political asylum in London, UK. According to a previous report, London seems to be the best option for Hasina, as the English capital has deep familial connections to her family. Her sister, Rehana, is a British citizen. Moreover, Hasina's niece, Tulip Siddiq, is an MP in the UK House of Commons and Junior Minister in the Keir Starmer government.\n\nHowever, there seems to be a delay in granting her stay. The UK Home Office told CNBCTV18 that British immigration rules do not allow individuals to travel to that country to seek asylum or temporary refuge -- a sign that she may not get to travel to the UK.\n\nMoreover, the UK government also said individuals seeking asylum must do so \"in the first safe country they reach\". \"The UK has a proud record of providing protection for people who need it. However, there is no provision for someone to be allowed to travel to the UK to seek asylum or temporary refuge, said the Home Office.\n\n\"Those who need international protection should claim asylum in the first safe country they reach -- that is the fastest route to safety,\" a UK Home Office spokesperson also told NDTV.\n\nIn the past, the UK has given political asylum to leaders, political agents and even spies from many countries. The UK has given asylum to former Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif, pro-democracy lawmakers from Hong Kong, Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko and more people. However, there is a sizeable group of Bangladeshis in the UK who don't support her.\n\nWhy Hasina's stay in India could be a problem?\n\nIn case, the UK doesn't grant Hasina asylum, India faces the diplomatic dilemma of either allowing Hasina's stay in the nation or making her move.\n\nBut it's not an easy choice. If New Delhi permits the former Bangladesh PM to remain in the country, it gives the appearance that the nation is backing an ousted leader. Moreover, it may complicate relationships with the new government in Bangladesh. India can't afford to alienate or anger Bangladesh -- where an anti-India sentiment already exists -- if it wants to secure its position in the neighbourhood.\n\nHowever, India has long historical ties with Sheikh Hasina and her family. Before she became prime minister, the Indira Gandhi government had given her refuge when her family had been assassinated during the 1975 unrest in Bangladesh. Moreover, in her 15 years of power, she has been a staunch ally of the country, protecting India's security interests. So abandoning her at this point will also not be an easy decision, considering her equations with Delhi.\n\nWhat are Hasina's other options?\n\nIf not India, or the UK, where else could Hasina go next? While there is no official confirmation, CNN-News18 has learned that she is exploring the option of going to Scandinavian countries as well.\n\nAnother option that Hasina has, though very unlikely, is that she makes a return to Bangladesh. Her son, Sajeeb Wazed Joy had indicated the same when he told CNN-News18 that she won't return to Bangladesh.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindon_(UK_Parliament_constituency)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hindon (UK Parliament constituency)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_house", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Safe house"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Right of asylum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajit_Doval", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ajit Doval"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_transport_aircraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Military transport aircraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_residence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Official residence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Advisor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Security Advisor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Jaishankar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S.

She was shifted to an unspecified location under tight security.\n\nHasina planned to leave for London from India to take temporary refuge but the option is not being pursued now. As per reports, she is likely to seek asylum in the UK as her sister, Sheikh Rehana, is a British citizen. Rehana's daughter Tulip Siddiq is a member of the British Parliament and the economic secretary to the Treasury and Labour MP for Hampstead and Highgate.\n\nThe UK government states that to stay in the UK as a refugee, a person must be unable to live safely in any part of their own country because of the fear of persecution. The persecution may be due to a host of reasons: race, religion, nationality, political opinion or anything else that puts a person at risk because of the social, cultural, religious or political situation in their country.\n\nHowever, the rule states that a claim for asylum may not be considered if a person is from a European Union nation, travelled to the UK through a 'safe third country' or have a connection to a safe third country where you could claim asylum.\n\n\"Safe and legal routes are not routes to claim asylum and don't allow anyone to apply out- of-country for asylum in the UK and they do not facilitate the offshore processing by the UK Government of general asylum applications,\" a UK government website stated.\n\nIn the case of Sheikh Hasina, the 'safe third country' clause could be a problem for the former Bangladesh PM as she stays at a safe location near the Hindon airbase.\n\nIn 2023, the UK government included India in a list of \"safe states,\" making it ineligible for individuals arriving illegally from these nations to be admitted to the UK asylum system.\n\nUK Home Office has said that the British immigration rules do not allow individuals to travel to that country to seek asylum or temporary refuge.\n\nThe UK government said that the individuals seeking asylum must do so \"in the first safe country they reach\".\n\n\"The UK has a proud record of providing protection for people who need it.

It is also learnt that Hasina has family members in Finland as well and that is why she also contemplated leaving for the northern European country.\n\nWhile saying that Hasina's travel plans have hit

Here's how Delhi is readying for it", "body": "It's been two days since Bangladesh's ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled Dhaka and came to India. Her stay was expected to be a stopover. The plan to seek asylum in the United Kingdom has hit a roadblock. While Hasina explores other options, it is expected that she will stay in India.\n\nNew Delhi, say media reports, is preparing to accommodate the Bangladesh leader for a bit. While External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said on Tuesday (August 6) that Hasina \"requested approval to come for the moment to India\", he also said that the government was giving her \"time to recover\" before it speaks to her about her future plans.\n\nWhy has Hasina's stay in India been extended?\n\nWhen Hasina landed in India on Monday (5 August), reports said she would soon take a flight to London. The UK is where she was reportedly seeking asylum. The Bangladesh leader's sister Rehana, who escaped from Dhaka with her, is a citizen of the UK. Rehana's daughter Tulip Siddiq is a member of the British Parliament. Hence Britain was the first option.\n\nHowever, Hasina's plans to travel to the UK have hit a \"technical roadblock\".\n\nThe UK immigration rules have no provision for someone to be allowed to travel to the country to seek asylum or temporary refuge. Applying for asylum from outside the UK is not a possibility, according to a report in The Indian Express.\n\nA person can seek asylum once they are in the country. But Hasina cannot enter the UK, as she no longer holds a diplomatic passport and doesn't have a valid visa.\n\nThe UK government said individuals seeking asylum must do so \"in the first safe country they reach\". \"The UK has a proud record of providing protection for people who need it. However, there is no provision for someone to be allowed to travel to the UK to seek asylum or temporary refuge,\" it said, according to NDTV.\n\nIn a statement on Monday, British Foreign Secretary David Lammy spoke about the \"unprecedented levels of violence and tragic loss of life\" in Bangladesh. \"The people of Bangladesh deserve a full and independent UN-led investigation into the events of the past few weeks. The UK wants to see action taken to ensure Bangladesh a peaceful and democratic future. The UK and Bangladesh have deep people-to-people links and shared Commonwealth values,\" he said.\n\nLammy did not mention Hasina or granting her asylum, making the country's position clear.\n\nThe UK is seemingly no longer an option and her visa to the United States is reportedly revoked. Hasina will have to evaluate where she would heat next. Until then she is expected to remain in India.\n\nHow is India planning to accommodate Hasina?\n\nWhile India does not have an asylum policy, Hasina is \"safe\" in the country, which has been her trusted ally.\n\nIndia is preparing for the possibility of hosting the ousted Bangladesh PM for a \"while\". Security agencies are readying for a longer-than-expected stay, according to an India Today report.\n\nNational Security Advisor Ajit Doval is closely monitoring the situation and regularly updates Prime Minister Narendra Modi about the developments.\n\nDoval received Hasina when she landed at Hindon Airbase in Ghaziabad. She was then moved to a \"safe house\" nearby. However, plans are afoot to relocate her to a more spacious and secure accommodation, reports India Today.\n\nIt is not clear yet if Hasina will be moved to another \"safe house\" managed by Indian intelligence or another place in the Capital with high security. Top officials of the External Affairs Ministry, Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Defence and intelligence establishment are all part of these high-level discussions, according to a report by The Indian Express.\n\nGarud commandoes of the Indian Air Force have secured the Hindon airbase, where the C-130J military transport aircraft in which Hasina arrived is parked. The elite National Security Guard commandoes have been deployed for her security.\n\nHasina has been a trusted ally of India and New Delhi has no plans to pressure her to leave yet. All protocols befitting a head of state are reportedly being extended to her.\n\nThis is the second time Hasina has turned to India in a time of crisis. When her father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was assassinated in 1975 along with her mother, brother and other family members, Hasina and Rehana escaped as they were in Germany. They later came to India, where they stayed in exile for six years. Hasina was accompanied by her husband and two children, a son and a daughter.\n\nNow Delhi is once ready to host Hasina. \"This is her second home,\" a source told The Indian Express.\n\nWhat hosting Hasina means for India\n\nWhile India is giving Hasina time to decide her next move, it poses a diplomatic challenge for the country.\n\nNew Delhi cannot afford to abandon the Bangladesh leader, who has been cracking down on anti-India groups. She has proved to be a reliable and strategic partner.\n\nHowever, giving asylum to Hasina would indicate that India is picking sides in the Bangladesh crisis. It would not go down well with the current dispensation. It could also create tensions along India's 4,096 km border.\n\nThe anti-India sentiment is high among the public in Bangladesh. While New Delhi has been a friend of Hasina's, it will also have to establish ties with a new government which will take over Bangladesh.\n\nSo once again India has to play a balancing act. Sheikh Hasina will stay in the country for now. But New Delhi might not like her to be a permanent guest.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Right of asylum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Jaishankar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S.

These protests escalated into violent unrest, resulting in over 440 deaths in recent weeks. Shortly after her resignation, protesters stormed her residence, causing widespread vandalism.\n\nUpon her arrival in India on Monday, Hasina was greeted by National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and senior military officials, who assured her of complete security. The Indian Air Force monitored her flight, deploying Rafale fighter jets to ensure her safe passage. The situation in Bangladesh remains volatile, with the military announcing the formation of an interim government led by Nobel laureate Dr. Muhammad Yunus.\n\nOn Tuesday, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar informed Parliament that Hasina had reached out to India for safe passage following her sudden resignation. In a suo motu statement in the Rajya Sabha, Jaishankar mentioned that Hasina was granted approval to travel to India on \"very short notice.\"\n\n\"On August 5th, demonstrators gathered in Dhaka despite the curfew.

There is, however, no provision for someone to be allowed to travel to the UK to seek asylum or temporary refuge,' the report quoted a UK home office spokesperson.\n\n'Those who need international protection should claim asylum in the first safe country they reach - that is the fastest route to safety,' the NDTV reported.\n\nNevertheless, the report said that a formal asylum request was being processed in the UK.\n\nThe NDTV reported that the events in Bangladesh presented a problem for India, particularly if the UK turns down Sheikh Hasina's asylum request.\n\nIndia also does not want to be seen as overtly backing the ousted leader because that may complicate the country's relationship with the new government in Bangladesh, whatever it may be, the NDTV said.\n\nIndian media reported that Hasina travelled to the country with plans to move to the UK from there but the plan faced a hurdle because of the UK immigration policies.\n\nThe Hindu reported that 24 hours after ousted Bangladesh prime minister Sheikh Hasina fled Dhaka and landed at Delhi's Hindon base, it was still unclear where her final destination would be, as sources confirmed that the United Kingdom was 'unlikely' to accept her request for asylum.\n\nThe Hindu reported that Hasina was also studying her options with other countries like the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, including those where her immediate family resides: US, Finland and India.\n\nIn Europe, Ms Hasina's next option would be to travel to Helsinki where her nephew Radwan Mujib Siddiq Bobby lives, and married a Finnish national, The Hindu reported.\n\nThe Finnish President Alexander Stubb's office, however, did not respond to a request for comment on a possible request from Ms Hasina.\n\nHasina's son Sajeeb Wazed \"Joy\" lives in the US's state of Virginia along with his wife, an American lawyer.\n\nUS officials said that they weren't aware if Ms Hasina had applied for a US visa after fleeing Bangladesh, but confirmed that her present visa on her official passport would be 'no longer valid' as she had resigned from her post, the Hindu reported.\n\nThe Hindu reported that India would find it difficult to explain Hasina's presence, especially if the interim government or a new dispensation demands her extradition to stand charges in Bangladesh.\n\nFor similar reasons, the Hindu said that the Modi government did not accept requests from former Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, or senior members of the Ashraf Ghani government when they fled their respective countries.\n\nWhen asked whether Hasina's visa was revoked, a US Embassy spokesperson in Bangladesh replied that visa records were confidential under the US law which also prevents discussing the details of individual visa cases.", "source": {"uri": "newagebd.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "New Age | The Most Popular Outspoken English Daily in Bangladesh"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is considering Belarus, some Middle Eastern countries and Finland to seek asylum after she resigned and fled her country, India's Free Press Journal reported, citing sources.\n\nAccording to the report, Sheikh Hasina no longer plans to ask London for asylum as the British government indicated that the former Bangladeshi prime minister would possibly not receive legal protection from any future investigation into mass protests in her country.\n\nSo Sheikh Hasina, sources said, is considering several other options, including Belarus, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Finland. According to the sources, the former Bangladeshi prime minister is unlikely to leave India, where he is currently staying, in the next few days.\n\nSheikh Hasina resigned on Monday amid anti-government protests and flew to India in a Bangladesh Air Force plane. According to Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, she sought permission to come to India temporarily on very short notice. The Indian government decided to give her time to decide on her next course of action.\n\nFollowing Sheikh Hasina's arrival in New Delhi, news reports said that she was seeking asylum in the UK. The former prime minister was expected to fly to London on Tuesday night, but this did not happen.\n\nA British Home Office spokesman, when asked to confirm that Sheikh Hasina had sought asylum in the UK, replied that people in need of international protection should seek asylum in the first safe country they reach.

Hasina, who landed at the Hindon airbase on Monday and was later moved to a secure location, faces uncertainty as the British government has hinted she might not receive the expected legal protection in the UK against potential investigations, ToI reported.\n\nReports indicated that Hasina's initial intention was to travel to London from India. However, the suggestion from the UK about limited legal protection has reportedly prompted her to reconsider her plans and explore other options, which include the US and Finland. British Foreign Secretary David Lammy said there is the need for a \"full and independent UN-led investigation into the events\" that recently transpired in Bangladesh, complicating her asylum prospects in the UK.\n\nAdding further to the complexity, sources from the UK Home Office told ToI, \"It is not possible to apply for asylum from outside UK. The UK has a proud record of providing protection for people who need it. However, there is no provision within our immigration rules for someone to be allowed to travel to UK to seek asylum or temporary refuge. Those who need international protection should claim asylum in the first safe country they reach, that is the fastest route to safety.\"\n\nAlso Read: Bangladesh: Will India have another Pakistan on its border?\n\nThe source strongly hinted Hasina may need to consider seeking asylum in India, where she currently is. \"Each asylum claim is carefully considered on its individual merits on a case-by-case basis,\" the source told ToI.\n\nSheikh Hasina's son, Sajeeb Wazed, said that while London remains Hasina's primary choice for asylum, she hasn't officially approached the authorities. ToI reported citing Wazed that they are also considering the US and the UK because she has extended family in both places.\n\nIndia, however, has not disclosed the length of time it will permit Hasina to stay. India's External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar highlighted in an all-party meeting that Hasina is in a state of shock, and the Indian government is giving her time to recover before discussing various issues with her, including her future plans, sources told PTI.\n\nJaishankar also mentioned on Tuesday that Sheikh Hasina sought \"urgent approval\" to stay in India for a short term. India remains cautious about her opponents in Bangladesh potentially using her extended stay to cast doubts on India's intentions. Despite Hasina's exit, the Indian government aims for its missions in Bangladesh to function normally once law and order are restored.\n\nSpeaking in Parliament, Jaishankar reiterated that India is closely monitoring the situation in Bangladesh.\n\nAlso Read: Sheikh Hasina sought approval to come to India for short term, says EAM Jaishankar\n\nHasina, age 76, arrived with her younger sister Sheikh Rehana, age 68, at the Hindon air base in Ghaziabad on a C-130 military plane On August 5 and was subsequently moved to Delhi. Rehana already has political asylum in the UK and holds British citizenship, having taken refuge there after the assassination of their father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, in 1975. While the sisters initially planned to move swiftly to London, these plans are now under reconsideration.\n\nAlso Read: Bangladesh's founding father gets the Saddam Hussein treatment\n\nHasina's niece, Tulip Siddiq, who is Rehana's daughter, serves as a Labour MP and is the Economic Secretary to the Treasury in the new Labour government in the UK.\n\n\"The people of Bangladesh deserve a full and independent UN-led investigation into the events of the past few weeks,\" UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said. \"The UK wants to see action taken to ensure a peaceful and democratic future for Bangladesh,\" he added.\n\nIn 2023, Bangladeshi nationals made up the fifth-largest group of main applicants seeking asylum in the UK, numbering 4,300.\n\nWhile the UK can provide various forms of humanitarian protection to individuals who do not meet the criteria for refugee status, Sheikh Hasina could apply for discretionary leave outside the immigration rules or travel to the UK on a visa. However, it would be illegal for her to apply for asylum later on unless she could demonstrate a change in circumstances.\n\n(with ToI inputs)", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Times of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Right of asylum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Secretary", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foreign Secretary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Finland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Finland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Jaishankar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S.

According to sources, Hasina will stay in India for the next 48 hours as uncertainty looms over where she will seek asylum.\n\nSheikh Hasina, whose 15-year reign ended dramatically after violent protests and widespread riots over the controversial quota system, landed at Hindon airbase near Delhi on Monday evening. Initial reports suggested that she might seek asylum in the UK as her sister, Sheikh Rehana, is a British citizen.\n\nHowever, British government sources have indicated that Sheikh Hasina won't be given asylum, citing \"there is no provision within our Immigration Rules for someone to be allowed to travel to the UK to seek asylum or temporary refuge\".\n\nAlso, the UK government says \"those who need international protection should claim asylum in the first safe country they reach - that is the fastest route to safety\".\n\nIf this rule is to be considered, Sheikh Hasina could seek asylum in New Delhi, a familiar territory for the beleaguered Awami League leader.\n\nSHEIKH HASINA's STAY IN NEW DELHI\n\nIn 1975, Sheikh Hasina took refuge in India along with her husband, children, and sister after the massacre of her family, including her father Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. She lived in Delhi's Pandara Road under an assumed identity for six years, from 1975 to 1981.\n\nHowever, the situation is different this time around. When Hasina took shelter in Delhi in 1975, there was goodwill for her and her family in Dhaka after the assassination of her father. People in Bangladesh rooted for the family of their founding father who freed them from Pakistan.\n\nThis time, Sheikh Hasina is at the receiving end of protests. She has been labelled a dictator who curbed free speech and launched a violent crackdown on her opponents and protesters.\n\nThere were no surprises when Sheikh Hasina chose to fly to India after leaving Dhaka. The Indian governments, especially the current Narendra Modi dispensation, have been supportive of Hasina for her secular credentials and pro-India stance -- something for which she has been derided at home as well. Hasina has also been sensitive to India's security concerns and kept the Islamist forces in check.\n\nHowever, India may as well hesitate in giving shelter to Sheikh Hasina if the UK formally declines her asylum. Some reports also suggest that Hasina's visa has been cancelled by the US as well, where her son lives.\n\nCHALLENGES IN GIVING ASYLUM TO SHEIKH HASINA\n\nThere are a number of issues New Delhi will have to consider before considering asylum for Sheikh Hasina or her longer stay in the country.\n\nFirst, it would indicate that India is taking sides in the Bangladesh crisis. The anti-India sentiment is high on the streets of Dhaka due to New Delhi's proximity to Hasina.\n\nConsidering this, the Centre will have to tread a tightrope to ensure talks with the next government in Bangladesh and to emphasise that India's ties are with the people and not with a specific leader.\n\nAlso, backing Sheikh Hasina could also create turmoil along India's eastern border. India shares a 4,096 km border with Bangladesh and security has been heightened in the area amid the unrest in the neighbouring country.\n\nThe Islamist groups in Bangladesh, who have played a shadow role in the ouster of Sheikh Hasina, may project India as a meddler if New Delhi continues giving shelter to the Awami League leader.\n\nIslami Chhatra Shibir, the student wing of Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh, was at the centre of protests against a controversial quota system for government jobs. According to sources, many Islami Chhatra Shibir cadres were admitted to various universities in Bangladesh over the last two years from where they instigated the protests against the Hasina government.\n\nJamaat-e-Islami has also been accused of fanning anti-India in the country. In 2021, strong protests were witnessed in Bangladesh during PM Modi's visit to the country.

However, there is no provision for someone to be allowed to travel to the UK to seek asylum or temporary refuge.\"\n\n\"Those who need international protection should claim asylum in the first safe country they reach - that is the fastest route to safety,\" a UK Home Office spokesperson told NDTV.\n\nNevertheless, sources indicate a formal asylum request is being processed.\n\nMrs Hasina, 76, was forced to resign as Prime Minister Monday evening after weeks-long protests over a jobs quota killed over 300 people. She fled Dhaka in a military aircraft - reportedly after the Bangladesh Army gave her a 45-minute ultimatum - and flew first to an IAF base in Uttar Pradesh.\n\nSources last night told NDTV Mrs Hasina - met on arrival in India by National Security Advisor Ajit Doval - would proceed on to London after her plane was refuelled. Since then, though, there has been confirmation of the former Prime Minister's schedule or, indeed, about her location.\n\nSources have, though, said she is in \"protective custody\" of Indian intelligence services.\n\nShe is accompanied by her younger sister, Sheikh Rehana, who is a UK citizen, which could be useful to claim asylum in that country. Also, her niece, Tulip Siddiq, is a British Labour parliamentarian.\n\nMrs Hasina's daughter, Saima Wazed, is based in Delhi as the regional chief for the World Health Organization. This, though, may not open doors as she works for an international agency.\n\nIndian Government's Position\n\nThis morning Bangladeshi publication Daily Sun cited unconfirmed sources as saying India has granted permission for an \"interim stay\", during which Mrs Hasina will get comprehensive logistical support.\n\nThis is reportedly only temporary and pending relocation to Britain.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi has been briefed on the Bangladesh situation, and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar has spoken to leaders of all major political parties in the country.\n\nAt that meeting Mr Jaishankar spoke of a \"conspiracy\" to topple Mrs Hasina's government. This was in response to a question by Congress MP Rahul Gandhi, who asked if there could be an involvement of foreign powers, specifically Pakistan, in the dramatic developments in Dhaka over the past few weeks.\n\nThe events in Bangladesh present a problem for India, particularly if the UK turns down Sheikh Hasina's asylum request. India also does not want to be seen as overtly backing the ousted leader because that may complicate the country's relationship with the new government in Bangladesh, whatever it may be.\n\nWhat Next For Bangladesh?\n\nA new \"interim government\" - to be advised, most likely, by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus - is believed to be taking shape in the crisis-hit country. This follows the release from jail - ordered by President Mohammed Shahabuddin - of former PM Khaleda Zia, who was convicted of corruption.\n\nIn speculation that has emerged (inevitably so) since Mrs Hasina quit, three key names are at the forefront, two of whom are the Army, which took charge after Mrs Hasina quit, and which may have given her a 45-minute ultimatum; and her nemesis and former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, who was jailed in 2018 on corruption charges and whose release was ordered by the President.", "source": {"uri": "voiceofvienna.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "voiceofvienna.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDTV", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NDTV"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Right of asylum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Home Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide_victory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Landslide victory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saima_Wazed", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saima Wazed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Rehana", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Rehana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajit_Doval", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ajit Doval"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_Siddiq", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tulip Siddiq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Advisor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Security Advisor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uttar Pradesh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Uttar Pradesh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Shahabuddin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed Shahabuddin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Jaishankar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S.

The 76-year-old was forced to resign on Monday (August 5) as the prime minister and flee her country.\n\nHasina has sought refuge in India \"for the moment\" and sought asylum in the UK. However, her request has not been approved yet, as per reports.\n\nNow, some reports say the US has revoked Hasina's official visa.\n\nThe US has \"revoked\" the ousted Bangladesh prime minister Hasina's visa, reported News18.\n\nJournalist David Bergman made a similar claim on X citing sources close to the US State Department. He said it was not clear whether Hasina had plans to travel to the US.\n\nThe embattled leader's son, Sajeeb Wazed \"Joy\", lives in the US state of Virginia with his wife.\n\nHasina's relations with the Joe Biden administration have been tense. The US criticised the January elections in Bangladesh that marked the return of the Awami League leader to power. The opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) had boycotted the polls, accusing Hasina's government of rigging the vote.\n\nIn May, Hasina had accused a \"Western government\" of trying to establish a military base in Bangladesh by force, without naming any country.\n\nAs per The Hindu report, it is not known whether Hasina had applied for a US visa after her ouster. However, officials said her present visa on her official passport would be \"no longer valid\" as she was no longer the PM.\n\nALSO READ: UK, Bangladesh & more: Why you should steer clear of these countries for now\n\nWhy is the UK reluctant to grant her asylum?\n\nThe UK has been non-commital about accepting Hasina's request for asylum. As per the UK's immigration law, \"there is no provision\" for people outside the UK to apply for asylum or temporary refuge, The Hindu reported.\n\nThe UK government has not formally commented on whether Hasina has sought asylum.\n\nOn Monday (August 5), UK foreign secretary David Lammy issued a statement on the situation in Bangladesh. However, he made no comments on Hasina or her request.\n\n\"The last two weeks in Bangladesh have seen unprecedented levels of violence and tragic loss of life. A transitional period has been announced by the Chief of the Army Staff,\" his statement said.\n\n\"All sides now need to work together to end the violence, restore calm, deescalate the situation and prevent any further loss of life. The people of Bangladesh deserve a full and independent UN-led investigation into the events of the past few weeks.\"\n\n\"The UK wants to see action taken to ensure Bangladesh a peaceful and democratic future. The UK and Bangladesh have deep people-to-people links and shared Commonwealth values,\" Lammy added.\n\nHasina's asylum request to the UK comes as her sister Sheikh Rehana, who fled with the ousted Bangladesh PM, holds UK citizenship. Rehana's daughter, Tulip Siddiq, is a minister in the current Labour government.\n\nHasina had formally sought permission to travel to the UK soon after landing near Delhi on Monday, hoping to travel to London on board the Bangladesh Air Force plane that brought her to India, reported The Hindu. However, the UK is yet to green-light her request.\n\nThe UK government sources told PTI that the country has a \"proud record\" of giving protection to people who need it, however, its immigration rules do not allow someone to \"travel to the UK to seek asylum or temporary refuge\".\n\n\"Those who need international protection should claim asylum in the first safe country they reach -- that is the fastest route to safety,\" a UK Home Office spokesperson told NDTV.\n\nSources say that, however, the formal asylum request is being processed.\n\nStrategic experts believe it is not an easy decision for the UK, which had provided refuge to Hasina's late father - Sheikh Mujibur Rahman - in January 1972 after the country's Liberation War.\n\n\"Sheikh Hasina's desire to relocate to the UK, where her sister and niece live, puts the UK government in a dilemma. UK foreign secretary David Lammy has called for a UN-led investigation into the violence of the past few days. If this is held, it will likely hold Sheikh Hasina accountable to some degree and would look bad for the British government if she were then in the UK with the grant of 'political asylum',\" Rahul Roy-Chaudhury, Senior Fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) in London, told PTI.\n\n\"But, at the same time, the UK's long-standing links with Sheikh Hasina's family makes it difficult to ignore her request. A possible solution would be to give Sheikh Hasina leave to enter the UK where she could live in 'self-exile'. But, with Sheikh Hasina's niece being a Labour MP and minister, the optics of this will be challenging,\" he added.\n\nAs per The Hindu, officials said the UK is worried about the pressure from Hasina's rival Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) loyalists in the country. There are also concerns that the former Bangladesh PM's could be accused of human rights violations during her tenure.\n\nIf the UK declines her asylum request, India would unlikely be too keen to extend her stay.

(Credit: Reuters)\n\nNew Delhi: At the back of the current political upheaval in Bangladesh, the Indian government has granted former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina an interim stay following her government's collapse.\n\nAfter a spate of protests in the country, which was followed by a military coup, Bangladesh Army Chief General Waqar-uz-Zaman said Hasina has resigned, with an interim government currently at the helm.\n\nFor Sheikh Hasina though, the problems seem to have only begun. While she has been currently given comprehensive logistical support by India, she awaits asylum in the UK. As of now, there has been no confirmation from the UK government regarding her political asylum.\n\nDifference between Asylum and Exile\n\nAs Sheikh Hasina awaits to be granted asylum from the UK, the concept has again entered popular consciousness. It again points to a confusion that people often have between political asylum and exile. The two concepts are similar, but not the same.\n\nAn exile refers to an often forced state of being barred from one's country, often by the ruling dispensation of the time. An exile then means a forced eviction, often meant as a punishment.\n\nOn the other hand, in case of asylum, an individual lives in another country on the basis of a protection granted consciously by another nation to someone who has left their native country as a political refugee.\n\nSomeone living with an asylum is usually not caught by the home country and its government but rather flees due to their own will. Exile though is when one is voluntarily sent to another country by the ruling authority.\n\nPolitical asylum can occur due to a lot of reasons, mainly when people are too afraid to live in their own country. It is then that they decide to move to another country where they are granted permission to live.\n\nPolitical asylum is one of the human rights affirmed by Article 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and rules of international human rights law. Every country that has agreed to the United Nations Conventions Relating to the Status of Refugees must let in people who qualify. Those who are given political asylum are called refugees.\n\nFrom Leon Trotsky given asylum in Mexico to the 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, being granted one in India, there are many famous examples of people being granted political asylum internationally.\n\nWhen it comes to exile, Irish writer Oscar Wilde after his trial and his term of imprisonment for homosexuality in his home country, was exiled to France. In a more interesting turn of events, Ivan the Terrible once exiled an inanimate object, a bell to Serbia.\n\nHasina was in exile from 1975 onward\n\nAfter her father's assassination in 1975, Hasina along with her family and younger sibling had sough exile in India and were happily accommodated in a house in Delhi's Pandara Road under an assumed identity for six years, from 1975 to 1981. It was the then PM Indira Gandhi extended a helping hand to Hasina.\n\n\"Mrs Indira Gandhi immediately sent information that she wanted to give us security and shelter... We decided to come back here (Delhi) because we had in our mind that if we went to Delhi, from Delhi, we'd be able to go back to our country. And then we'll be able to know how many members of the family are still alive,\" Hasina said in the 2022 interview.\n\nThis makes Sheikh Hasina a figure who has been in both exile and now one who is seeking political asylum. Whether and when it will be granted by the UK remains to be seen, but her political career has seen such upheavals.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"},

The Bangladesh Air Force's Lockheed C-130J Hercules transport jet, with call sign AJAX1431, flew Sheikh Hasina to India soon after her resignation from the post of the Bangladesh Prime Minister. The aircraft returned to Dhaka from the Hindon air base in UP on Tuesday morning, but Hasina was learnt to have remained behind in India.\n\nThe aircraft carried seven military personnel but Sheikh Hasina and her sister Rehana remained behind. Soon after the airport's departure, the Hindon airport buzzed with activity as several VVIP cars were seen entering the facility.\n\nThe development comes on a day when Hasina's arch-rival and Bangladesh National Party chairperson Khaleda Zia, who was serving a 17-year prison sentence was released. Khaleda Zia has served two terms as the Prime Minister of Bangladesh. Both Hasina and Zia have yet to make a public appearance since Monday's developments.\n\nREAD ON ABP LIVE | Khaleda Zia Is Free! Former Bangladesh PM Walks Out Of Jail After Nearly 6 Years\n\nSheikh Hasina was granted safe passage by India following her resignation. According to various reports, she was seeking asylum in the UK. But the request for asylum could get rejected as the UK asylum laws \"discourage\" asylum seekers from nations who could have got safe harbour in countries nearer to them or have a connection to a safe country.\n\nA UK Parliament document explains the asylum law as: \"UK asylum law contains measures to encourage people to do so. For example, people who travel through a safe third country can be treated as inadmissible to the UK asylum system and removed to a third country, or if allowed to stay, be given a less favourable immigration status.\"\n\nALSO READ | Bangladesh Crisis Orchestrated By Foreign Nation?

A Look At Leaders Who Sought Asylum In Country - News18", "body": "After fleeing Dhaka amidst the student protest, Sheikh Hasina has landed in Agartala. Reports suggest that Bangladesh's ex-PM could be seeking refuge in India.\n\nBangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned on Monday as per the Bangladesh High Commission officials in Delhi, and has landed in Agartala, as per sources. She is likely to take a commercial flight to London, the sources added.\n\nIn a televised address to the nation, Bangladesh Army chief Waker-uz-Zaman said the military will form the interim government with the help of political leaders.\n\nHasina and her sister, Sheikh Rehana, fled the country amidst the violent protest march by students to Dhaka in defiance of the nationwide curfew imposed today, as per local dailies.\n\nNearly 300 people have been killed in the violent clashes on Sunday, according to news agency AFP, but no official statement on the casualties have been released so far.\n\nHasina has resigned following weeks of protests over job quota reforms, Bangladesh High Commission officials told Reuters in Delhi. According to Daily Star, Hasina left her official residence, Gono Bhaban, in Dhaka on Monday for a \"safer place\".\n\nReports suggest that Hasina could be seeking asylum in India. Let us first understand what is an asylum and who can seek it.\n\nUnited Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) defines asylum as a form of protection given to people who flee their country because of the fear of being persecuted. Persecution can be harm or threats of harm to individuals. A person can also obtain asylum if he or she has suffered persecution in his or her country in the past.\n\nThey could also be called migrants or refugees. As per the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees is, \"A person who owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence as a result of such events, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it.\"\n\nA migrant is someone who has moved to another country for other reasons, such as to find work.\n\nAt the end of 2021 around 89.3 million people were forcibly displaced across the world. Of these, 27.1 million were refugees, while 53.2 million were internally displaced within their country of origin.\n\nAs per refugeecouncil.org.uk, 72% of the world's refugees are living in countries neighbouring their country of origin, often in developing countries.\n\nIn 2021, more than two-thirds of the refugees across the world came from just five countries: Syria (6.8 million), Venezuela (4.6 million), Afghanistan (2.7 million), South Sudan (2.4 million) and Myanmar (1.2 million).\n\nUnder international law, anyone has the right to apply for asylum in any country that has signed the 1951 Convention and to remain there until the authorities have assessed their claim.\n\nIt is recognised in the 1951 Convention that people fleeing persecution may have to use irregular means in order to escape and claim asylum in another country. The 1951 Refugee Convention guarantees everybody the right to apply for asylum. It has saved millions of lives. No country has ever withdrawn from it.\n\nBy 2022-end, India had about 4,05,000 refugees, which includes 2,13,578 refugees recognised/ registered by the government and housed in various camps; about 31,313 refugees belonging to minority communities from neighbouring countries who had been given long-term visas on the basis of their claims of religious persecution; and about 1,60,085 unregistered refugees.\n\nYes. India granted asylum to the Dalai Lama on March 30, 1959 under the leadership of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru. On April 4, 1959 Nehru publicly stated that India's policy was governed by three factors: the preservation of the security and integrity of India; India's desire to maintain friendly relations with the People's Republic of China; and India's deep sympathy for the people of Tibet.\n\nIndia had provided asylum to Sheikh Hasina. She spent six years of her life in exile, residing in Delhi's Pandara Road with her children under an assumed identity until 1981. It was following the 1975 massacre of her family, in which her father -- legendary statesman Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rehman -- was assassinated. As many as 18 members of her family, including her uncle and 10-year-old younger brother, were killed on August 15, 1975, by senior Army officers that saw Bangladesh's descent to massive political turmoil and resulted in a military establishment running the country for many years.\n\nFormer Maldivian president Mohamed Nasheed had refuge in the Indian High Commission in Male in 2013, where he went immediately after issuance of an arrest warrant against him by a Maldivian court.\n\nFormer Vice President of Maldives Ahmed Adeeb Abdul Ghafoor also sought political asylum in India. He was arrested by Maldives police in 2019 after the Indian authorities sent him back to the island nation. Ghafoor arrived in a cargo vessel in Tamil Nadu along with nine crew members. He was not allowed to disembark from the ship and was questioned on-board by various central agencies.\n\nIceland offered asylum to former chess champion Bobby Fischer who was held in Japan while fighting extradition to the US. A native of New York City was wanted for violating international sanctions in 1992 for playing a chess match in Yugoslavia. A chess prodigy, he won his first of a record eight US Championships at the age of 14.\n\nRussia granted US whistleblower Edward Snowden permanent residency rights in 2020. Snowden, 37, fled the US and was given asylum in Russia after leaking secret files in 2013 that revealed vast domestic and international surveillance operations carried out by the US National Security Agency where he was a contractor. US authorities have for years wanted Snowden returned to the United States to face a criminal trial on espionage charges brought in 2013.\n\nWikiLeaks founder Julian Assange sought asylum in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, UK, in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden on a rape allegation that he denied -- and claimed was a ploy to hand him over to the US.\n\nFormer Peruvian president Alan Garc\u00eda entered the Uruguayan embassy in Lima and filed a request for political asylum. Uruguay is thus acting according to UN principles and other international agreements it has signed, like the Lima Commitment focusing on \"Democratic Governance against Corruption\".\n\nNicola Gruevski, the former Prime Minister of Macedonia, applied for asylum in Hungary after fleeing his home country in what seems to be an attempt to avoid a two-year prison sentence imposed after he was found guilty of corruption.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Hasina was planning to travel to London as her sister Sheikh Rehana's daughter Tulip Siddiq is a member of the British Parliament. Tulip is economic secretary to the Treasury and Labour MP for Hampstead and Highgate.\n\nThe \"technical\" challenge emanates from the UK's Immigration rules which have no provision for someone to be allowed to travel to the UK to seek asylum or temporary refuge.\n\nIt is not possible to apply for asylum from outside the UK.\n\nAnd once an asylum request is made, each asylum claim is carefully considered on its individual merits on a case-by-case basis. Hasina wants to seek asylum or temporary refuge as she wants protection from political persecution. She fears that she will be called in as part of investigations against her by the rivals in the new government in Dhaka.\n\nFor the time being, her best bet is that she stays in India where she is \"safe\".\n\nThis has been the crux of the conversations between Hasina, Delhi and London over the last 24 hours.\n\nNational Security Advisor Ajit Doval, along with top officials in the establishment, had met her at the Hindon Air Force station near Delhi. She is learnt to be staying at a \"safe house\". Doval has briefed Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar has been in touch with relevant officials as well.\n\nThe British position was amply clear when British Foreign Secretary David Lammy came out with his statement on Monday, \"The last two weeks in Bangladesh have seen unprecedented levels of violence and tragic loss of life. A transitional period has been announced by the Chief of the Army Staff. All sides now need to work together to end the violence, restore calm, deescalate the situation and prevent any further loss of life.\"\n\n\"The people of Bangladesh deserve a full and independent UN-led investigation into the events of the past few weeks. The UK wants to see action taken to ensure Bangladesh a peaceful and democratic future. The UK and Bangladesh have deep people-to-people links and shared Commonwealth values,\" he had said Monday.\n\nThere was no mention of the UK considering or granting asylum to Hasina.\n\nShe has been in touch with the British government, and London is learnt to have conveyed the message that those who need international protection should claim asylum in the first safe country they reach - that is the \"fastest\" route to safety.\n\nIn Delhi, while there is no stated asylum policy, there is no ambiguity on how to treat Hasina - despite her current unpopularity in Dhaka. She is seen as someone who helped India to quieten the borders between the two countries as she cracked down against anti-India terror groups. Countering terrorism and religious extremism was her article of faith, and India found a reliable and strategic partner in her.\n\nSources made it clear that there was no question of \"abandoning\" her at this time of crisis.\n\nOfficials point out the history of Sheikh Hasina's family. Her father Sheikh Mujib, and seven members including her mother and brothers as young as 10-year-old Russell, had been assassinated in 1975, and Hasina escaped since she was in Germany at that time, with her sister Sheikh Rehana.\n\nShe came to India and lived here in Delhi's Pandara Road, where the Indian government gave her shelter - with former President Pranab Mukherjee and his family taking care of her.\n\nAt a time when she had to pack her bags and leave in a hurry on Monday - with just some essentials - Delhi is clear that they will offer her refuge. \"This is her second home,\" a source said.\n\nThe fast-paced developments have put South Block in a tight spot, but New Delhi has decided to give her time and space to make up her mind - how long she wants to stay here and her destination.\n\nPlans are being drawn up to house her at an appropriate place, if she chooses to stay, so that she has the highest level of security and there is no threat.\n\nWhile there are \"safe houses\" that the intelligence establishment keeps, a call is yet to be taken whether she will be accommodated in a \"safe house\" for the time being or a place in the Capital's high security areas in full public glare.\n\nAll these are part of ongoing discussions between the top brass in the government - from the Ministries of External Affairs, Home Affairs, Defence and intelligence services.

She was hoping to get asylum in the UK but now after spending almost three days in India as a temporary refuge, she is yet to get asylum in the country of her choice. Both the US and Britain have refused to allow her to stay even temporarily.\n\nAccording to media reports, the US has already cancelled Hasina's visa and has even talked about setting accountability for the atrocities and killings of protesters in Bangladesh. Security establishments say that Hasina was planning to go to Britain, but now she is not getting any response from there either. Britain has also demanded a UN-led probe on humanitarian issues and is not ready to grant her asylum or even temporary asylum. Holed up in a safe house in India for Hasina options for asylum are getting narrower.\n\nOptions for Hasina are limited\n\nIn what can be termed a sad state of affairs for a Prime Minister who ruled her country for 15 years, Hasina seems to have left with no friends it seems. After the UK and US denied her entry, some sources say that Hasina is now considering several other options including the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Belarus, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Finland.\n\nAs Hasina also has family members in Finland therefore she can consider the option of going to the northern European country.\n\nWhy Dubai could be an option for Hasina?\n\nAll eyes are on Muslim countries like Dubai, Saudi, Qatar and UAE as many are hoping that these countries might step forward to help a woman leader of another Muslim country. It may be noted here that despite having relations with other Muslim countries Hasina chose a country like India which is Hindu-dominated when it came to saving her life from protesters in her own country.\n\nFor her United Arab Emirates (UAE), particularly, Dubai could be a viable option to seek asylum as the country has a reputation for being a playground for the rich. Dubai has given asylum to several leaders of Muslim countries, including Pakistan and thus Hasina could be welcomed there. Even Afghanistan's former President Ashraf Ghani took refuge in UAE when he fled the country, so did Pakistan's Parvez Musharraf took refuge in Dubai.\n\nAs of now India safe for Hasina\n\nFor now, her best bet is to stay in India where she is \"safe\". India is however in no mood to grant her permanent asylum like before when Hasina and her husband stayed in India for almost six years. As there is no declared asylum policy in India thus there is no ambiguity on how to deal with Hasina's issue. India found a reliable and strategic partner in Sheikh Hasina and thus India cannot leave Hasina in the lurch when she is facing a crisis.\n\nAs of now till she gets asylum in the country of her desire, India will have to play the role of a good neighbour and let her stay in a safe place.\n\nHow much time will negotiations for a safe country of refuge take is not clear, but till this gets sorted, for Hasina India is the best bet as of now.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kavita_pant@news9live.com", "name": "Kavita Pant", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Right of asylum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dubai"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_world", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Muslim world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Finland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Finland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarus", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Belarus"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belarus"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashraf_Ghani", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ashraf Ghani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pervez_Musharraf", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pervez Musharraf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Cross_Country", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Cross Country", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Derivatives", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Derivatives", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Asia", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Asia", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://images.news9live.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/sheikh-hasina-2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794362", "eventUri": "eng-9794362", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

Hasina is stranded in India and her plans to seek refuge in the UK were thwarted by a \"technical roadblock\".\n\nIndia, meanwhile, is actively exploring asylum options for Hasina in other European countries, but these efforts have hit roadblocks, leaving her temporarily grounded in India. The situation has prompted a heightened security alert, with India's National Security Advisor Ajit Doval closely monitoring the situation and keeping Prime Minister Narendra Modi informed.\n\nHasina, who arrived in India on a C-130J military transport aircraft on August 5th, is now facing a complex situation after the UK and US denied any support to accommodate her. While India has extended the courtesies befitting a Head of State, including protocol drills at Delhi's airports, Hasina's final move to move out of India remains uncertain.\n\nAccording to the sources aware of the situation, security agencies are gearing up to arrange a \"long-term\" stay in India. It also said that the agencies are searching for bigger and safer accommodation for her.\n\nThe crux of the problem lies in the UK's strict immigration rules, which do not allow for asylum seekers to enter the country without a visa. Hasina, stripped of her diplomatic passport, faces a Catch-22: she needs a visa to enter the UK, but cannot apply for asylum without first entering.\n\nInitially, it was speculated that Hasina is eyeing on UK to take asylum as her sister Sheikh Rehana's daughter Tulip Siddiq is a UK citizen.

Nevertheless, there is no clause for an individual to be permitted to journey to the UK to request asylum or short-term shelter.\"\n\nHowever, sources suggest that a formal asylum appeal is being reviewed.\n\nMrs Hasina, 76, was compelled to step down as Prime Minister on Monday night after prolonged demonstrations over a job quota claimed the lives of over 300 individuals. She departed Dhaka in a military plane - allegedly following a 45-minute ultimatum from the Bangladesh Army - and initially flew to an IAF base in Uttar Pradesh.\n\nSources indicate that she is currently under the \"protective care\" of Indian intelligence agencies.\n\nShe is accompanied by her younger sister, Sheikh Rehana, who is a citizen of the UK, a factor that could be advantageous for seeking asylum in that nation. Additionally, her niece, Tulip Siddiq, is a British Labour parliamentarian.\n\nMrs Hasina's daughter, Saima Wazed, is situated in Delhi as the regional head for the World Health Organization.

This response was in reaction to a query by Congress MP Rahul Gandhi, who inquired about the potential involvement of foreign powers, particularly Pakistan, in the recent dramatic events in Dhaka.\n\nThe occurrences in Bangladesh pose a challenge for India, especially if the UK denies Sheikh Hasina's asylum request. India also aims to avoid being perceived as openly supporting the deposed leader as it could complicate the nation's relations with the new Bangladeshi government, whatever it may be.\n\nFuture of Bangladesh\n\nA new \"temporary government\" - possibly to be advised by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus - is reportedly taking form in the crisis-stricken nation. This development follows the release from prison - mandated by President Mohammed Shahabuddin - of former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, who was convicted of corruption.\n\nIn the speculation that has surfaced since Mrs Hasina's resignation, three prominent figures have emerged, including the Army, which assumed control after her departure and potentially issued a 45-minute ultimatum; and her adversary and former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, who was imprisoned in 2018 on corruption charges and whose release was ordered by the President.", "source": {"uri": "pehalnews.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pehal News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narendra_Modi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Narendra Modi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Right of asylum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Labour Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keir_Starmer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Keir Starmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_India", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhaka", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dhaka"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saima_Wazed", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saima Wazed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Rehana", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Rehana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_Siddiq", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tulip Siddiq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uttar Pradesh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Uttar Pradesh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Shahabuddin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed Shahabuddin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Jaishankar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S.

The US, meanwhile, is reported to have revoked her visa.\n\nFinland and the UAE are two other alternatives she is believed to considering for asylum.\n\nA student-led protest led to her resignation in Bangladesh, followed by her escape.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saima_Wazed", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saima Wazed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Welle", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deutsche Welle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_asylum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Right of asylum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Health Organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghaziabad", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ghaziabad"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Air_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indian Air Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southeast Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Rehana", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Rehana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_visa", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Travel visa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_Siddiq", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tulip Siddiq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_nationality_law", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "British nationality law"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Finland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Finland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2024/08/07/1600x900/hasina_1722919217850_1723026428492.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794362", "eventUri": "eng-9794362", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

A several others did not pick up the call. Only two leaders agreed to talk off the record.\n\nThey said Hasina's last moment's decision to leave the country placed them in terrific situation and that they did not get enough time to secure their own safety.\n\n\"We are victims of her whim,\" said a central committee member.\n\nAnother leader alleged Hasina never listened to party leaders and made decisions on her own, isolating herself from the party colleagues.\n\n\"In the January 7 election, many Awami League activists did not vote for the party-nominated candidates. And during the recent protest, she failed to inspire party men to come to the streets,\" he said over the phone so sheepishly that it was difficult to hear.\n\nAsked about the future of the party, he replied, \"I first need to save my life. The thought of the future of the party can wait,\" he said, sounding frustrated.\n\nBoth leaders said Hasina's last efforts to bring partymen on the Streets to resist protesters that killed around 100 people across the country on Sunday to survive was a wrong decision. By making this decision, she set Awami League against the countrymen.\n\nHasina created a circle around her with some opportunists who \"used\" the party and the government for their personal benefits. Their advice has destroyed her own political career, a historical party like Awami League and tens of millions of party leaders and activists.\n\nWhereabouts of the top party leaders and ministers of the immediate past cabinet are also not clear, as many have gone into hiding to save their lives amid violent attacks on ruling party men in different parts of the country.\n\nSome of them, including Junaid Ahmad Palak and Hasan Mahmud, were reportedly caught at airport while trying to fleeing the country yesterday. Several others were also beaten up.\n\nThe Daily Star could not contact them as their phones were switched off.\n\nBangla daily Prothom Alo yesterday reported that Hasina was in favour of using greater force till the last moment, even as security personnel and top police officials declined to continue the bloodshed.\n\nBy Monday noon, tens of millions of people were marching towards the capital and Gono Bhaban with their one-point demand for her to leave office.\n\nAccording to the Bangla daily, on Monday morning Hasina pushed top leaders of different law enforcement agencies and armed forces to take harsher actions against the protesters. She also refused to accept the briefing by the security personnel that the situation was completely out control.\n\nSome of the party leaders and her advisers who were present at that time requested her to resign and hand over power to the armed forces, but Hasina did not pay any heed and asked them to strengthen the curfew instead, according to the report.\n\nHasina also expressed resentment at the top bosses of the armed forces and law enforcement agencies for their failure to tackle the situation and contain the protesters. Later, after consulting with her younger sister Sheikh Rehana, who was at Gono Bhaban with her, and her son Sajeeb Wazed, who is in the US, Hasina decided to step down.\n\nAccording to Prothom Alo, Hasina at the last moment wanted to record a speech addressing the nation, but she was not given the time as there was intel that protesters would occupy Gono Bhaban in 45 minutes.\n\nHasina was given 45 minutes to pack up. She and her sister then left Gono Bhaban for Bangabhaban where she tendered her resignation to the president. Hasina took off in a military aircraft around 2:30pm and landed in India around 5:36pm.\n\n'VERY SHORT NOTICE'\n\nIndian external affairs minister S Jaishankar told an all-party meeting yesterday that Sheikh Hasina requested permission \"at very short notice\" to come to India following her forced resignation.\n\nHe also said Hasina, was in shock at the turn of events, reports Indian news portal NDTV.\n\nHe said the Indian government will give Hasina time to decide her next step.\n\nThere was discussion that Hasina may fly to the UK from India.\n\nHowever, British immigration rules do not allow individuals to travel to that country to seek asylum or temporary refuge, the UK Home Office told NDTV yesterday, amid speculation that Hasina will seek asylum in that country.\n\nThe UK government also said individuals seeking asylum must do so \"in the first safe country they reach\".\n\n\"The UK has a proud record of providing protection for people who need it. However, there is no provision for someone to be allowed to travel to the UK to seek asylum or temporary refuge,\" a UK Home Office spokesperson stated.\n\nAlso, amid growing queries on visa status of Hasina and others, the US said visa records are confidential under the US law, reports UNB.\n\n\"Visa records are confidential under US law; therefore, we do not discuss the details of individual visa cases,\" a spokesperson at the US Embassy in Dhaka told reporters yesterday.", "source": {"uri": "thedailystar.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awami_League", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Awami League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Star_(Bangladesh)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Star (Bangladesh)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Liberation_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh Liberation War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prime minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.bangla", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": ".bangla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prothom_Alo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prothom Alo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S._Jaishankar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "S.

Source: AFP.\n\nAfter the British government rebuffed deposed Bangladeshi leader Sheikh Hasina's request for asylum, she is reported to be considering other options.\n\nThe places in considerations are the ones where her family members are based, according to reports.\n\nWhile Hasina's daughter lives in Delhi, her son lives in the United States and her nephew lives in Finland.\n\nHasina is currently in India, but she is unlikely to settle here. She arrived here on a very short notice and is expected to depart for another country once the government there agrees to grant her refuge.\n\nAfter weeks of mass movement against her rule that climaxed on Sunday when nearly 100 people were killed, Hasina resigned as the premier on Monday and fled Bangladesh for her life and arrived in India. Initially, she was set to leave for London to live out her remaining days in exile, but now she is considering other options as the British government has rebuffed her request.\n\nWill Hasina move to USA or Finland?\n\nHasina's son, Sajeeb Wazed Joy, lives in the United States, but considering how critical the United States had been of her government, she is unlikely to be granted refuge there.\n\nWhile Hasina can attempt to go anywhere as a private citizen, she would need political assurances as she has long been accused of human rights violations and in the liberal West, human rights cases can be opened against her and she may face legal problems. As Hasina would not want that, she is unlikely to go anywhere unless she had political assurances.\n\nThe second option could be Finland where Hasina's nephew, Radwan Mujib Siddiq Bobby, lives, according to The Hindu. He is the son of her sister Sheikh Rehana, who also fled Bangladesh with her and is staying in India for now.\n\nThe newspaper reported that Hasina made a stop-over in Finland in 2021 when she was on a visit to the United States to spend time with Bobby.\n\nHasina could also explore other options\n\nIn addition to places where her family members are based, a report said that Hasina is exploring other options as well.\n\nThe PTI reported that Hasina is reportedly considering 'temporary residence' in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Saudi Arabia, Belarus, or Qatar.\n\nAs none of these countries is a liberal Western democracy, Hasina is unlikely to face any human rights-related hiccups here.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Hasina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Government of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Finland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Finland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belarus", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belarus"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Belarus"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Arab_Emirates", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Arab Emirates"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sajeeb_Wazed", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sajeeb Wazed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Rehana", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sheikh Rehana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberal democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hindu", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Hindu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Women", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Motorcycles/Women", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2024/08/Sheikh-Hasina-2-2024-08-dea59ebc3307d70fa0c0d50581dadfaa-1200x675.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794362", "eventUri": "eng-9794362", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

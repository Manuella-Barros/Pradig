{"id": 237089354, "title": "Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson launches reparations taskforce as Juneteenth nears", "text": "Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has announced the formation of a new taskforce aimed at considering reparations for Black Chicagoans. Noting that Juneteenth was just days away, Johnson issued an executive order for the formation of the taskforce, who will be asked to evaluate the idea of reparations over the course of the next year. The mayor called it a pledge to confront the legacy of inequity in both Chicago and the U.S. \u201cOn behalf of the city of Chicago, I apologize for the historic wrongs committed on Black people in Chicago,\u201d he said. \u201cNow is the time to deliver good on reparations for people of Chicago, in particular Black people.\u201d According to the press release, the taskforce will conduct a study and examination of \u201call policies that have harmed Black Chicagoans,\u201d ranging from slavery to policies that included redlining and other discriminatory acts. The executive order did not specify whether such reparations would include cash payments, but Ald. Jason Ervin says there are myriad ways of righting historical wrongs. \u201cPeople always associate reparations with money, but there are policy changes and other items that can be done to repair the harm that such policies have caused,\u201d he said. The taskforce will have a period of one year to issue its recommendations. \u201cIt\u2019s about dealing with the policies that created the situations we\u2019re dealing with today,\u201d Ervin said. \u201cI think by studying and understanding what policy changes need to be made to make people whole, that\u2019s the whole purpose of this conversation.\u201d Some members of the City Council have said they\u2019d like to see revenues from cannabis sales used toward whatever recommendations are made, but no funding source was explicitly identified. Chicago wouldn\u2019t be the first area city to explore the idea of reparations. Evanston put a plan in place to pay reparations for past housing discrimination, but Judicial Watch, a conservative legal group, has filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the program. \u201cYou can\u2019t just tell someone they\u2019re not eligible for a benefit purely on the basis of race,\u201d the group\u2019s president Tom Fitton said. \u201cIt seems to be rather difficult to say there\u2019s this generalized issue from which I could have suffered consequences, and to get a government benefit based on it.\u201d The program was based on payments of up to $25,000 to Black residents with ties to the community between 1919 and 1969, during which housing policy caused segregation of Black residents in the city. Judicial Watch argues that the reparations plan violates the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment because the program uses race as a basis for eligibility. According to the Chicago Sun-Times, Evanston officials declined comment based on the pending nature of the litigation.", "summary": "<p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has announced the formation of a new taskforce aimed at considering reparations for Black Chicagoans. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Noting that Juneteenth was just days away, Johnson issued an executive order for the formation of the taskforce, who will be asked to evaluate the idea of reparations over the course of the next year.

The U.N. has repeatedly called out Israel\u2019s alleged human rights violations and targeting of civilians in its campaign. The head of U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres\u2019 office informed Israel\u2019s envoy at the U.N., Gilad Erdan, that his country would be added to the list, U.N. spokesperson St\u00e9phane Dujarric told reporters. Erdan reacted with outrage, posting a video on X of his angry monologue over the phone with Guterres\u2019 chief of staff, who was supposedly on the other side of the line. \u201cThe only one who is blacklisted today is the secretary-general whose decisions since the war started and even before are rewarding terrorists and incentivizing them to use children for terror acts,\u201d said Erdan.", "summary": "The U.N. will also call out Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad.", "url": "https://www.politico.eu/article/un-israel-hamas-blacklist-violation-children/", "image": "https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=675,fit=crop,quality=80,onerror=redirect,format=auto/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/08/GettyImages-2105325217-scaled.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 15:18:56", "author": "Gregorio Sorgi", "authors": ["Gregorio Sorgi"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "eu", "sentiment": -0.362}

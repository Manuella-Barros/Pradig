This statistic is notable and highlights a significant gap in the adoption of generative AI technology. Despite the buzz around AI, most people have only used it once or twice. This raises important questions about awareness, accessibility, and the perceived value of AI tools in our daily lives. It's fascinating to see that despite all the hype, only a small fraction of the population actively engages with AI.\n\nThat Reuters report is truly eye-opening and is a must-read for anyone interested in understanding the current state of AI adoption. However, some claim that only the fact that only 7% use ChatGPT, the most widely known generative AI platform, daily isn't surprising.\n\nMajor shifts in technology usage don't happen overnight. It takes time for people to change their behaviors and see the value in a new technology compared to their old ways of doing things.\n\nDebra Williamson said to me that \"Back in 1995, when companies first started building on the web, only 9% of US adults used the internet. One year later, that figure had doubled, and a year after that, it had tripled. This shows that significant technological shifts require time and gradual acceptance. We are likely at a similar juncture with AI\"\n\nA popular sentiment I've seen circulating is the desire for AI to handle mundane tasks, not the creative ones. See the quote in X (twitter) from Joanna Maciejewsko shown throughout social media, that she was interested in \"I want AI to do my laundry and dishes so that I can focus on art and writing, not for AI to do my art and writing so that AI can do my art and writing.\" As of this writing, it had over 2.8M views.\n\nPeople want AI to do their laundry, not their passions. When faced with AI doing art, creative marketing work, and more, many express the desire for AI to tackle the repetitive, boring tasks that we hate, so that we can focus on what we love. However, is AI already eliminating jobs?\n\n81.6% of digital marketers believe content writers will lose jobs because of AI, according to SEO.ai. Per Pam Miller, \"Many of my friends who work in marketing and content writing have seen massive layoffs, especially at startups and software companies. If a company had a staff of 20, they might only need 3 people now because they are leveraging AI to do the job much quicker and better. The same goes for graphic design and programming.\"\n\nTimnit Gebru, Co-founder of the Distributed AI Research Institute (DAIR), emphasizes this point: \"The benefits of AI are undeniable, but we must be cautious about the potential for job displacement and the erosion of human creativity. It's essential that we focus on developing ethical AI frameworks that prioritize human well-being.\"\n\nHeart is what separates us from robots, isn't it? We get to choose what we ask our AIs to do for us. It's time to get more creative and be more patient in building AI solutions that remove drudgery. I don't think we, as creatives, have really experimented with how generative AI can be a creative multiplier yet. These tools, in the hands of people who have built careers on thinking outside the box, have the potential to be truly transformative.\n\nBut is this true that AI is replacing jobs? According to SEO.AI, by May 2023, only 3,900 US job losses were linked directly to AI. 14% of workers have experienced job displacement due to AI, suggesting that the present impact is somewhat more restrained than the anticipation.\n\nMany believe that AI is helping them become more effective. For creatives, AI presents a unique opportunity to enhance work. Maybe instead of fearing AI as a replacement, we should view it as a collaborator that can take on repetitive tasks, allowing us to focus on what truly matters - the creative process itself.\n\nJaron Lanier, Computer Scientist and Composer, captures this sentiment well: \"AI should be a tool that enhances human creativity, not a replacement for it. We need to rethink our approach to AI development to ensure it supports and amplifies our creative endeavors rather than undermining them.\"\n\nWe need to develop AI systems that complement human creativity rather than replace it. AI can handle the repetitive aspects of creative work, such as generating initial drafts or designs, freeing up humans to focus on refining and perfecting those ideas. This collaboration can lead to a new era of creativity, where humans and AI work together to produce innovative and high-quality work.\n\nMoreover, we need to focus on upskilling and reskilling our workforce. As AI continues to evolve, so too must our skills. According to SEO.ai, over 120 million workers are poised to undergo retraining in the next three years as AI reshapes industry demands. By investing in education and training, we can ensure that people are equipped to work alongside AI, leveraging its capabilities to enhance their own work. This approach not only mitigates the risk of job displacement but also empowers individuals to harness the full potential of AI.\n\nGenerative AI was initially touted as a solution for mundane tasks, but its capabilities have expanded far beyond that. While it is indeed being used for data entry, scheduling, and customer service, it is also being employed in more complex and creative fields. This shift raises an important question: where do we go from here?\n\nTo start, we need to address the concerns around job displacement.\n\nAndrew Ng leads AI Fund as the Managing General Partner. Additionally, he is the Founder and CEO of Landing AI, founder of DeepLearning.AI, chairman and co-founder of Coursera, and an adjunct professor at Stanford University. He suggests a way forward: \"AI is transforming industries, but we must ensure that the benefits are broadly distributed. Up-skilling and re-skilling programs are critical to help workers adapt to the changes brought by AI and to harness its potential fully.\"\n\nAs AI becomes more integrated into our lives and work, we must address issues of bias, transparency, and accountability. Developing ethical guidelines and frameworks for AI usage is crucial to ensure that these technologies are used responsibly and for the benefit of all.\n\nIn conclusion, the impact of AI on our lives and work is profound and multifaceted. While only a small percentage of people currently use generative AI daily, its potential is enormous. We must navigate this transition carefully, addressing concerns around job displacement and dependency while also exploring the opportunities for enhanced creativity and collaboration. By doing so, we can harness the power of AI to improve our lives and work in meaningful ways.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Statistic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Accessibility"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timnit_Gebru", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Timnit Gebru"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-being", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Well-being"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_design", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Graphic design"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaron_Lanier", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaron Lanier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coursera", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coursera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Ng", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Ng"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_scientist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computer scientist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Accountability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stanford University"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Creativity", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Creativity", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Natural_Language", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Natural Language", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 50}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/650d6f030135e3d2db5a32e7/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619220", "eventUri": "eng-9619220", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

This shift reflects a forward-thinking approach to harnessing AI's potential to drive innovation, efficiency, and competitive advantage.\n\nTech leaders are prioritizing comprehensive AI training programs to ensure their workforce is well-equipped to leverage the technology. This focus on AI adoption within organizations brings benefits, though it also presents challenges that need to be addressed.\n\nIn a one-on-one interview with Back End News, Atul Harkisanka, head of Growth Markets and country lead for the Philippines at LinkedIn, emphasizes the necessity of AI literacy.\n\n\"AI skills do not always mean that employees need to be programmers or coders. Being AI literate and AI ready is what businesses are looking for,\" Harkisanka explains.\n\nHe noted that the goal is to create a workforce comfortable with AI tools and capable of utilizing them to enhance their roles, regardless of their department.\n\nThe proliferation of AI technologies, especially after the introduction of OpenAI's ChatGPT in November 2022, has led to a surge in interest and sometimes confusion among individuals eager to certify their AI skills.\n\nHowever, Harkisanka highlights that AI's application varies significantly across different functions. For example, chief information officers (CIOs) and chief technology officers (CTOs) focus on advanced AI to prepare their teams, while Human Resources (HR) departments use AI to drive productivity, efficiency, and collaboration.\n\n\"AI is nuanced and there is no one-size-fits-all solution,\" Harkisanka says. He describes AI adoption as a pyramid, with the entire workforce at the base needing basic AI understanding, while specialized teams at the top require advanced skills. This approach ensures that everyone, from HR to finance and sales, can integrate AI into their daily tasks effectively.\n\nDespite the enthusiasm for AI, there is still resistance in many organizations. This hesitation often stems from concerns about data privacy and ethical considerations. Harkisanka suggests that working with reliable partners can help mitigate these concerns and facilitate smoother transitions to AI usage. He also underscores the importance of investing in both technology and talent.\n\nHarkisanka advocates for a phased approach to AI adoption, starting with small, manageable implementations that can demonstrate value and build confidence.\n\n\"AI is here to stay, and organizations that invest in their people and provide access to learning and technology will be more ready for the future,\" he says. The journey to AI adoption is gradual, starting with improving productivity and efficiency before progressing to innovation and new business models.\n\nFrom a user perspective, the appetite for AI tools is evident. In the Philippines, LinkedIn data shows that individuals are investing significant time in learning AI, which is reflected in their profiles. These AI skills, often validated through assessments and quizzes, make employees more attractive to potential employers.\n\nOn the business side, leaders face the challenge of feeling overwhelmed by the rapid pace of AI advancements. AI adoption depends on the specific needs and setup of each company.\n\nHarkisanka also highlights the critical role of communication, collaboration, and people skills in the age of AI.\n\n\"The greatest achievements come from human creativity and collaboration,\" he says. \"Soft skills, such as communication and teamwork, are essential, especially in a remote or hybrid work environment. These skills enable teams to work together effectively, regardless of physical location.\"\n\nThe demand for AI skills is reshaping the workforce. Organizations must invest in both technology and talent, fostering an environment where AI literacy is widespread. By doing so, businesses can unlock AI's full potential, driving innovation and efficiency while ensuring that employees find meaningful work that enhances their productivity and satisfaction.\n\nWith AI literacy becoming a competitive edge, businesses are not merely looking for technical skills but a comprehensive understanding of AI's applications. This distinction is crucial as it enables employees to leverage AI tools to enhance their roles, improve decision-making processes, and innovate within their fields.\n\nLinkedIn's approach to AI training involves categorizing courses into basic, intermediate, and advanced levels. This layered training ensures that all employees, regardless of their department, can benefit from AI tools. Basic AI literacy is deemed essential for all, enabling a foundational understanding that can be built upon with more specialized training as required by specific roles.\n\nThis strategic approach to AI training underscores the importance of tailored learning paths that align with individual and organizational needs. By investing in such comprehensive training programs, organizations can ensure that their workforce is not only AI literate but also proficient in leveraging AI for practical applications.\n\nHarkisanka's emphasis on the human element in AI integration is worth noting. While AI can automate mundane tasks and enhance efficiency, the true value lies in freeing up employees to engage in more meaningful and creative work. This shift allows for deeper human interaction, strategic thinking, and innovation, which are crucial for personal and organizational growth.\n\nThe narrative that AI will replace jobs is gradually being replaced with a more nuanced understanding. AI is seen as a tool that augments human capabilities, enabling employees to focus on higher-value tasks. This perspective is crucial for fostering a positive attitude toward AI adoption and ensuring that employees feel empowered rather than threatened by technological advancements.\n\nAI's rapid evolution needs a culture of continuous learning within organizations. Employees must be encouraged to continually update their skills and stay abreast of the latest AI developments. This commitment to lifelong learning is essential for maintaining a competitive edge in a fast-paced technological landscape.", "source": {"uri": "backendnews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Back End News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "marlet_salazar@backendnews.net", "name": "Marlet Salazar", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Human resources"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_information_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief information officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Literacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LinkedIn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_advantage", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Competitive advantage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Programmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leverage (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Business model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Information privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_work", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Remote work"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teamwork", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Teamwork"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_relationship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interpersonal relationship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_skills", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Soft skills"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Evolution"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Natural_Language", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Natural Language", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://backendnews.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Office-AI.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619220", "eventUri": "eng-9619220", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

Yesterday, one of the most ambitious projects of law-making, the AI Act, which aims to harmonise the protection of citizens from this rapidly evolving technology and to encourage research and industrial capacity in this regard was approved by a vast majority in the European Parliament. This ground-breaking regulation will significantly reshape how businesses and organisations in Europe use AI.\n\nA LONG LEGISLATIVE PROCESS\n\nThe popular buzzword had already caught the attention of lawmakers a few years ago. For several years, the European Commission (EC) had been researching the topic, leading to the first proposal in April 2021, followed by the positions of the Council (December 2022) and Parliament (June 2023). After a political agreement on the text had been reached on 9 December 2023, finally, on 13 March 2024, the European Parliament approved the proposed AI Act.\n\nThe prolonged legislative process for the AI Act is unsurprising, given its ambitious aims. Regulating AI requires careful consideration of ethical, technological, and societal factors. The extended timeline reflects the complexity of crafting effective legislation to address evolving challenges.\n\nIn this article, we delve into the crucial components of the AI Act and its implications for businesses operating within the EU.\n\nAI SYSTEM\n\nThe ambition of the AI Act is to establish a framework that is futureproof. In a world where technology is constantly evolving, defining what constitutes an 'AI System' and thereby determining the scope of application of the AI Act proved one of the most challenging tasks. The European legislator finally opted for a broad and easily understandable definition, that emphasises the autonomy of the system and its ability to adapt.\n\nAn 'AI System' is defined by the AI Act as a machine-based system designed to operate with varying levels of autonomy, that may exhibit adaptiveness after deployment and that, for explicit or implicit objectives, infers, from the input it receives, how to generate outputs such as predictions, content, recommendations, or decisions that can influence physical or virtual environments.\n\nBROAD SCOPE OF APPLICATION\n\nThe obligations foreseen in the AI Act are not only imposed on developers. Instead, the AI Act captures the entire value chain, making providers, distributors and users equally subject to its scope of application. It therefore applies to a wide range of actors, including:\n\nThe scope of application particularly broad given the extraterritorial effect of the AI Act, meaning that actors established in a third country are also subject to the AI Act to the extent the AI systems affect persons located within the EU. Hence, the AI Act is likely to have a similar effect on worldwide AI regulation as the GDPR has had on the worldwide development of data protection regulation.\n\nThe final text of the AI Act lists several exclusions to its scope of application. More in particular, the AI Act shall not apply to:\n\nPROHIBITION OF CERTAIN AI PRACTICES\n\nThe AI Act follows a risk-based approach, identifies different risk categories and establishes obligations for AI systems based on their potential risks and level of impact.\n\nThe AI Act prohibits certain AI practices that are considered a clear threat to the safety, livelihoods, and rights of people, including:\n\nHIGH-RISK AI SYSTEMS\n\nHigh-risk AI systems will be subject to a comprehensive mandatory compliance regime.\n\nAn AI system could be considered high risk when deployed in any of the following areas as described in Annex III:\n\nMoreover, AI Act recognises that AI systems may be an AI system and another form of product at the same time. Where those products are already subject to certain EU regulation, the EU AI Act provides for AI systems constituting such products to be considered 'high-risk' AI systems, as is the case for medical devices, vehicles and planes, toys etc. Similarly, in case of AI systems that can also be used as a safety component of a product that is subject to such EU regulation and are required to undergo a third-party conformity assessment before they are placed on the market or put into service in the EU under that legislation, the AI system safety component for that product will be automatically considered to be a 'high-risk' AI system.\n\nHigh-risk AI systems will be subject to specific obligations, including:\n\nTRANSPARENCY OBLIGATIONS\n\nBesides the specific obligations for high-risk AI systems, the AI Act foresees additional transparency obligations for providers and deployers of certain AI systems towards natural persons:\n\nGENERAL-PURPOSE AI\n\nAI models that display significant generality and are capable of competently performing a wide range of distinct tasks regardless of the way the model is placed on the market and that can be integrated into a variety of downstream systems or applications, so-called general-purpose AI models, must meet certain requirements, including:\n\nAdditionally, for general-purpose AI models with systemic risk, additional requirements are imposed, including:\n\nMEASURES IN SUPPORT OF INNOVATION\n\nInterestingly and in line with the EC's ambition to make the EU a worldwide leader in AI and to support SMEs, while the AI Act aims at laying down a regulatory framework for AI, it also contains measures in support of innovation. Such measures include (i) AI regulatory sandboxing schemes, (ii) measures to reduce the regulatory burden for SMEs and start-ups and (iii) real-world testing.\n\nSANCTIONS\n\nNon-compliance with the rules laid down in the AI Act can give rise to strict enforcement measures, including administrative fines, warnings and non-monetary measures. The penalties provided for must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive and must take into account the interests of SMEs, including start-ups, and their economic viability.\n\nThe fines that could be imposed are even higher than the GDPR, as the administrative fines could be up to EUR 35 000 000 or, in the case of an undertaking, up to 7% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher.\n\nNEXT STEPS\n\nAs there are still some errors in the different language versions, the AI Act will be subject to a corrigendum procedure and will receive a linguistic review.

While there are some mixed opinions on many aspects of this technology and its capabilities, there's no question that in order for AI to meet its full potential, we will need an agile and dynamic policy framework that spurs responsible innovation - a framework that the United States could soon model.\n\nEvery day AI becomes more entrenched in our daily lives and will soon be ubiquitous around the world. Countries need a framework to look to for guidance, a leader. Without a flexible policy framework in place that is broadly accepted, we risk missing out on many of AI's benefits to society. Trust in AI is pivotal for realizing its full potential, yet this trust will be hard-earned. It demands efforts from both private organizations and governments to develop AI in a responsible, ethical manner. Without trust, the promise of AI could remain unfulfilled, its capabilities only partially tapped.\n\nEfforts and innovations must be coordinated across the globe, guided by a responsible pioneer. Lacking some level of synchronization, society could experience a confusing system of disparate AI regulations, rendering the safe advancement of AI initiatives challenging across the board.\n\nWith its flexible governance structure informed by valuable international, public-private input, the U.S. could be a clear choice to lead the world to success in this new age of AI.\n\nCurrently, steps are being undertaken globally to regulate the use of AI, enhance its safety, and foster innovation. It's natural that various jurisdictions have placed different emphases on their priorities, resulting in a diverse range of regulations - some more proscriptive than others. This variation reflects the unique cultural perspectives of different regions, leading to a potential patchwork of AI regulations. As of October 2023, 31 countries have passed AI legislation and 13 more are debating AI laws.\n\nEurope took an early lead in December 2023 by passing the AI Act, the world's first comprehensive AI law focused on categorizing AI in terms of risks to users. The original text of the AI Act was written in 2021 - long before the mainstreaming of GenAI in 2023. In contrast to the EU's approach to AI regulation, the United Kingdom took a more pro-innovation stance and underscored its leadership aspirations by hosting an international AI Safety Summit at Bletchley Park in November 2023.\n\nThe United States played a prominent role at the summit which focused on the importance of global cooperation in addressing the risks posed by AI, alongside fostering innovation. Meanwhile, China mandates state review of algorithms, requiring them to align with core socialist values. In contrast, the U.S. and UK are taking a more collaborative and decentralized approach.\n\nThe U.S. has taken a more proactive approach to asserting its leadership in AI governance, in contrast to its approach to data privacy, where the EU has largely dominated with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). A series of recent federal initiatives, including President Biden's exhaustive AI executive order, signals a commitment to eventually leading global AI governance. The order lays out a blistering pace of regulatory action, mandating detailed reporting and risk assessments by developers and agencies. Notably, many of these requirements and assessments will come into force long before the EU's AI Act is settled and enforced.\n\nIn the absence of strong federal action, states are stepping in. In the 2023 legislative session, at least 25 U.S. states introduced AI bills, while 15 states and Puerto Rico adopted resolutions or enacted legislation around AI. While it is great to see this progress and innovation being made across the world, we must recognize the next steps needed to move forward on the AI front.\n\nWithout harmonizing efforts globally and having a leader to look to for guidance on AI endeavors, we could end up with a complex patchwork of AI regulations, making it difficult for organizations to operate and innovate with AI safely -- throughout the U.S. and globally.\n\nWithout trust, AI will not be fully adopted. The U.S. and like-minded governments can ensure that AI is safe and that it will benefit humanity as a whole. The White House has begun to pave the way with a recent flurry of AI activity, remaining proactive and agile despite evolving demands. To get ahead, Congress is pursuing niche areas within AI that will inform current and future AI regulations. The U.S. can further promote transparency, confidence and safety by collaborating with industry to ensure that the benefits of this evolving technology can be realized, risk concerns do not stifle innovation, and society can trust in AI.\n\nDomestically, the Biden administration has been exceedingly open to input from all sectors, shaping a holistic viewpoint on what is needed for advancement. Abroad, the U.S. prioritizes collaboration with its allies, ensuring best practices are followed and ethical considerations are made. This is a key component needed from a global leader, as regulations must be developed outside of a vacuum for best results. By linking arms with countries around the world to develop standards, conflicting viewpoints can be mitigated to best shape international AI regulations in a way that is most beneficial to society.\n\nFurthermore, by encouraging strong public-private partnerships, the U.S. sets the precedent needed to take responsible AI innovation to the next level. Just like the public sector, private companies must innovate responsibly, accepting the duty to develop AI in a trustworthy manner. By moving forward with cautious enthusiasm, the private sector can considerably bolster efforts to ensure AI reaches its full potential safely, at home and abroad.\n\nOf course, the geopolitical aspect must be considered, as well. By leading in AI standards and regulations, the U.S. can initiate globally accepted norms and protocols to deter an unregulated arms race or other modern warfare catastrophe. Through its technical prowess and dynamic experience, the U.S. is uniquely positioned to lead in the development of a global consensus on responsible AI use.\n\nThe U.S. is just beginning to establish itself as a global leader in AI governance, spearheaded by initiatives such as President Biden's executive order, Office of Management and Budget guidelines, the National Institute of Standards and Technology's AI Risk Management Framework, and widely publicized commitments from AI companies. The U.S. strategy is offering a flexible framework that can swiftly adapt to the rapidly evolving AI landscape. This agility will help keep pace with the quickly changing AI technology landscape.\n\nAs the U.S. continues to quietly refine its approach to AI regulation, its policies will not only have far-reaching impacts on American society and government, but also offer a balanced blueprint for international partners. The onus to innovate with AI responsibility does not fall solely on the public sector. Private companies, too, must bear the burden alongside their public counterparts to optimize results. This balanced approach considering a variety of international, public-private insights is bound to shape the future of AI governance and innovation worldwide.\n\nBill Wright is global head of

But this AI researcher pegs it at 99.9%", "body": "Other AI researchers have said been more moderate in estimates about AI leading to extinction.\n\nPodcaster Lex Fridman said in a recent episode that most AI engineers he speaks with estimate between a one and 20% chance that artificial general intelligence will eventually kill off humans.\n\nThe prediction varies depending on how you ask. For example, a recent study conducted with 2,700 AI researchers indicated there's only a 5% chance that AI will lead to human extinction.\n\nBut Fridman said it's important to talk to people who estimate a much higher likelihood AI could wipe us out -- like AI researcher Roman Yampolskiy, who told the podcaster in an interview released Sunday that he pegs it as 99.9% within the next hundred years.\n\nThe AI researcher teaches computer science at the University of Louisville and just came out with a book called \"AI: Unexplainable, Unpredictable, Uncontrollable.\"\n\nHe discussed the risks of AI for over two hours on Fridman's podcast -- and his predictions were pretty bleak.\n\nHe said the chances that AI will wipe out humanity depend on whether humans can create highly complex software with zero bugs in the next 100 years. Yampolskiy said he finds that unlikely since no AI model has been completely safe from people attempting to get the AI to do something it wasn't designed to do.\n\n\"They already have made mistakes,\" Yampolskiy said. \"We had accidents, they've been jailbroken. I don't think there is a single large language model today, which no one was successful at making do something developers didn't intend it to do.\"\n\nThe first few versions of AI models in the last two years have raised various red flags for potential misuse or misinformation. Deepfakes have created fake pornographic images of female public figures and threatened to influence elections with AI robocalls imitating President Biden.\n\nGoogle AI Overviews, based on Google's Gemini AI model, is the latest product rollout that didn't stick the landing. The new feature on Google Search was meant to provide quick informative overviews for certain inquiries presented at the top of search results. Instead, it went viral for coming up with nonsense answers, like suggesting making pizza with glue or stating that no countries in Africa started with the letter K.\n\nYampolskiy said in order to control AI, there needs to be a perpetual safety machine. Yampolskiy said even if we do a good job with the next few versions of GPT, AI will continue to improve, learn, self-modify, and interact with different players -- and with existential risks, \"you only get one chance.\"\n\nThe CEO of ChatGPT developer OpenAI, Sam Altman, has suggested a \"regulatory sandbox\" where people experiment with AI and regulate it based on what \"went really wrong\" and what went \"really right.\"\n\nAltman once warned -- or maybe he was joking -- back in 2015 that \"AI will probably most likely lead to the end of the world, but in the meantime, there'll be great companies.\"\n\nMore recently, Altman has said that what keeps him up at night is \"all of the sci-fi stuff\" related to AI, including the things that are \"easy to imagine where things really go wrong.\"\n\nSince ChatGPT took the world by storm in November 2022, various predictions have been made about how AI could lead to humanity's downfall in regard to AI.\n\nBut Yampolskiy also cautioned that \"we cannot predict what a smarter system will do.\" He compared humans to squirrels in the context of AGI, or artificial general intelligence, and said AI will come up with something that we don't even know exists yet.\n\nAccording to Yampolskiy, however, there are three realms of outcomes that he predicts. One risk is that everyone will die, another is that everyone will suffer and wish they were dead, and another is that humans have completely lost their purpose.\n\nThe last one refers to a world in which AI systems are more creative than humans and can perform all the jobs. In that reality, it's not clear what humans would do to contribute, Yampolskiy said, echoing some concerns about whether AI will start to take humans' jobs.\n\nMost people in the field acknowledge some level of risk with AI, but they don't think it's as likely that things will end badly. Elon Musk has predicted a 10-20% chance that AI will destroy humanity.\n\nFormer Google CEO Eric Schmidt has said the real dangers of AI, which are cyber and biological attacks, will come in three to five years.

Yesterday, one of the most ambitious projects of law-making, the AI Act, which aims to harmonise the protection of citizens from this rapidly evolving technology and to encourage research and industrial capacity in this regard was approved by a vast majority in the European Parliament. This ground-breaking regulation will significantly reshape how businesses and organisations in Europe use AI.\n\nThe popular buzzword had already caught the attention of lawmakers a few years ago. For several years, the European Commission (EC) had been researching the topic, leading to the first proposal in April 2021, followed by the positions of the Council (December 2022) and Parliament (June 2023). After a political agreement on the text had been reached on 9 December 2023, finally, on 13 March 2024, the European Parliament approved the proposed AI Act.\n\nThe prolonged legislative process for the AI Act is unsurprising, given its ambitious aims. Regulating AI requires careful consideration of ethical, technological, and societal factors. The extended timeline reflects the complexity of crafting effective legislation to address evolving challenges.\n\nIn this article, we delve into the crucial components of the AI Act and its implications for businesses operating within the EU.\n\nThe ambition of the AI Act is to establish a framework that is futureproof. In a world where technology is constantly evolving, defining what constitutes an 'AI System' and thereby determining the scope of application of the AI Act proved one of the most challenging tasks. The European legislator finally opted for a broad and easily understandable definition, that emphasises the autonomy of the system and its ability to adapt.\n\nAn 'AI System' is defined by the AI Act as a machine-based system designed to operate with varying levels of autonomy, that may exhibit adaptiveness after deployment and that, for explicit or implicit objectives, infers, from the input it receives, how to generate outputs such as predictions, content, recommendations, or decisions that can influence physical or virtual environments.\n\nThe obligations foreseen in the AI Act are not only imposed on developers. Instead, the AI Act captures the entire value chain, making providers, distributors and users equally subject to its scope of application. It therefore applies to a wide range of actors, including:\n\nThe scope of application particularly broad given the extraterritorial effect of the AI Act, meaning that actors established in a third country are also subject to the AI Act to the extent the AI systems affect persons located within the EU. Hence, the AI Act is likely to have a similar effect on worldwide AI regulation as the GDPR has had on the worldwide development of data protection regulation.\n\nThe final text of the AI Act lists several exclusions to its scope of application. More in particular, the AI Act shall not apply to:\n\nThe AI Act follows a risk-based approach, identifies different risk categories and establishes obligations for AI systems based on their potential risks and level of impact.\n\nThe AI Act prohibits certain AI practices that are considered a clear threat to the safety, livelihoods, and rights of people, including:\n\nHigh-risk AI systems will be subject to a comprehensive mandatory compliance regime.\n\nAn AI system could be considered high risk when deployed in any of the following areas as described in Annex III:\n\nMoreover, AI Act recognises that AI systems may be an AI system and another form of product at the same time. Where those products are already subject to certain EU regulation, the EU AI Act provides for AI systems constituting such products to be considered 'high-risk' AI systems, as is the case for medical devices, vehicles and planes, toys etc. Similarly, in case of AI systems that can also be used as a safety component of a product that is subject to such EU regulation and are required to undergo a third-party conformity assessment before they are placed on the market or put into service in the EU under that legislation, the AI system safety component for that product will be automatically considered to be a 'high-risk' AI system.\n\nHigh-risk AI systems will be subject to specific obligations, including:\n\nBesides the specific obligations for high-risk AI systems, the AI Act foresees additional transparency obligations for providers and deployers of certain AI systems towards natural persons:\n\nAI models that display significant generality and are capable of competently performing a wide range of distinct tasks regardless of the way the model is placed on the market and that can be integrated into a variety of downstream systems or applications, so-called general-purpose AI models, must meet certain requirements, including:\n\nAdditionally, for general-purpose AI models with systemic risk, additional requirements are imposed, including:\n\nInterestingly and in line with the EC's ambition to make the EU a worldwide leader in AI and to support SMEs, while the AI Act aims at laying down a regulatory framework for AI, it also contains measures in support of innovation. Such measures include (i) AI regulatory sandboxing schemes, (ii) measures to reduce the regulatory burden for SMEs and start-ups and (iii) real-world testing.\n\nNon-compliance with the rules laid down in the AI Act can give rise to strict enforcement measures, including administrative fines, warnings and non-monetary measures. The penalties provided for must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive and must take into account the interests of SMEs, including start-ups, and their economic viability.\n\nThe fines that could be imposed are even higher than the GDPR, as the administrative fines could be up to EUR 35 000 000 or, in the case of an undertaking, up to 7% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher.\n\nAs there are still some errors in the different language versions, the AI Act will be subject to a corrigendum procedure and will receive a linguistic review. It is expected to be finally adopted before the end of the legislature but still needs to be formally endorsed by the Council.\n\nThe AI Act will enter into force twenty (20) days after its publication in the Official Journal. The AI Act will apply depending on the obligations itself, but be fully applicable 24 months after its entry into force. For some topics, the application date will be different (mostly shorter), such as for:", "source": {"uri": "mondaq.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mondaq Business Briefing"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Autonomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "European Parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General Data Protection Regulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_(European_Union)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Regulation (European Union)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virtual reality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Legislator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Information privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_and_medium-sized_enterprises", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Small and medium-sized enterprises"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_risk", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Systemic risk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Natural person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medical device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Linguistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislature", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Legislature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenue", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Revenue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Natural_Language", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Natural Language", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 54}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619220", "eventUri": "eng-9619220", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.419607843137255, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Increasing numbers of businesses use AI to handle routine customer inquiries; craft job postings, emails, reports and PowerPoint presentations; evaluate candidate applications; and automate other tasks once performed by researchers and entry-level employees.\n\nMany workers fear AI, voicing concerns about job displacement, unintended consequences and loss of control. AI fakes, known as deepfakes, prove difficult to distinguish from reality and spread disinformation. A recent report commissioned by the U.S. State Department warns \"time is running out\" for the federal government to avert disaster resulting from the \"catastrophic\" national security risks AI poses. The report describes a worst case in which AI systems could \"pose an extinction-level threat to the human species.\"\n\nMeanwhile, employees seeking a competitive advantage use AI. Between Feb. 15 and March 28, Microsoft and LinkedIn surveyed 31,000 full-time employed or self-employed knowledge workers across 31 countries, sampled an additional 2,800 employees in the U.S. and analyzed trillions of Microsoft 365 productivity signals. Here's what they learned:\n\nThree out of four employees use AI at work. Given that 46% of those who use AI started using it within the last six months, this percentage will grow.\n\nSeveral factors drive the increasing use of AI: 68% of those surveyed say they use AI because they struggle with the pace and volume of work, which has accelerated beyond their ability to keep up. 76% of professionals say they use AI to remain competitive at work and in the job market. Increasing numbers of job candidates, particularly those applying for marketing, writing and designer jobs, include AI skills such as ChatGPT and Copilot on their profiles.\n\nThose who use AI report it saves them time (90%); allows them to focus on their most important work (85%); enables them to be more creative (84%), and results in them enjoying their work more (83%) because it frees them from menial tasks.\n\nEmployees don't always find their employers helping them access AI tools: 78% of AI users bring their own AI tools to work.\n\nMore employees use AI than employers realize. Of those who use AI at work, 52% are reluctant to admit using it for important tasks, fearing that makes them look replaceable.\n\nAttendance at LinkedIn Learning courses designed to build AI aptitude has spiked 160% among non-technical professionals in the last six months, with project managers, architects and administrative assistants among those who most often attend the courses.\n\nThose who \"power-use\" AI report it saves them over 30 minutes daily and liberates them from mind-numbing work. AI can sift through thousands of pages of information in minutes and compile a list of documents that include key phrases. This allows the professionals using AI to focus on the relevant documents instead of spending hours searching them out for themselves.\n\nIncreasingly, professionals find advanced uses for AI. For example, physicians report using AI to leverage large databases and collect past successful treatment plans for patients with similar conditions. Those in the medical field who suffered from documentation burnout appreciate they no longer have to record patient information in medical charts and records. AI can \"listen in\" on patient visits and then update medical records and generate notes the physician can review. This enables physicians to focus directly on the patient instead of inputting information into the computer.\n\nOther professionals use AI tools to draft documents they can edit, freeing them from the initial time-intensive writing. I recently interacted with an attorney who praised the legal brief his AI assistant created. Because the initial draft included citations for relevant case law, the attorney could spend his time analyzing rather than researching.\n\nShould we fear AI? Possibly. Can we use AI? Yes. Can we overuse it?

The European Union's creation of a new AI Office further contributed to this trend of coordinating approaches across country lines.\n\nThe AI Seoul Summit 2024\n\nOn 21 May, the Republic of Korea and the UK co-hosted the AI Seoul Summit 2024. The event, the second in a series launched last year, brought together leaders representing ten governments and the EU to sign the Seoul Declaration for Safe, Innovative, and Inclusive AI. Building on the work of last year's UK AI Safety Summit, summarized in the so-called Bletchley Declaration, government representatives from Australia, Canada, the EU, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the Republic of Singapore, the UK, and the U.S. gathered in Seoul to cement their commitment to intensifying international cooperation on AI regulation. They intend to create, step-by-step and over time, an ever more consistent approach towards AI regulation.\n\nThe Seoul Declaration anchors AI governance and corresponding frameworks in a risk-based approach - so as to maximize the potential benefits and mitigate the remaining risks of AI applications of all kinds. It places a strong emphasis on the need for enhanced international cooperation to advance AI safety, innovation, and inclusivity, to protect and promote democratic values, the rule of law, human rights, and fundamental freedoms, and, above all, to bridge gaps in AI regulation across jurisdictions.\n\nThe OECD AI Papers\n\nAlso this month, the OECD published a report streamlining key definitions in AI and cybersecurity. The underlying rationale is to create a common vocabulary and understanding of all relevant AI and cybersecurity concepts for the purpose of a coherent use in regulation and legislation around the world. The report is to be read as offering conceptual templates of AI and cybersecurity terminology for future legislation to build on. It provides detailed definitions of AI incidents and AI hazards based on the concepts of actual and potential harm. It also outlines useful criteria for how to classify an AI hazard or incident depending on how serious it is. In short, the report outlines a very targeted approach to harmonize legal concepts in the sphere of AI and cybersecurity.\n\nThe AI Act and the Establishment of an AI Office of the European Union\n\nOn 21 May, the Council of the EU gave the greenlight to the AI Act. Following this final approval, the definitive text of the AI Act will be shortly published and will enter into force twenty days thereafter. The first rules of the new AI Act that will become mandatory are those on so-called prohibited applications as they are regarded to establish an unacceptable risk - such as AI-based social scoring as well as certain forms of facial libraries and real time biometric surveillance of people in public places.\n\nAnother immediate consequence of the new AI Act is the establishment of an EU AI Office that has just been set up as announced by the EU Commission. The AI Office will have to perform most of the practical tasks deriving from the AI Act. In line with these tasks, this new office is divided into the following five units:\n\nAlmost simultaneously with the EU AI Act's approval, the Italian Council of Ministers adopted its own national Italian AI Draft Bill. Whilst national legislators of EU member states are not prevented from issuing additional AI regulation, it is fair to say that this is not what the European legislator wanted to encourage. Rather, the EU's AI Act was meant to provide a uniform and conclusive regulatory framework that would not necessitate further rules on a national level, as such regulatory fragmentation is typically seen as an impediment for the successful development and commercialization of AI systems. Should this Italian AI Bill be turned into law, it will apply alongside and in addition to the AI Act for AI-related developments and deployments in Italy.\n\nThe Italian draft bill does try to remain aligned with the principles of the AI Act, including on transparency, proportionality, protection of personal data, accuracy, confidentiality, non-discrimination, and system security. It regulates the research, experimentation, development, adoption, and application of AI systems and models on national territory.", "source": {"uri": "lexology.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

But this AI researcher pegs it at 99.9%", "body": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? Log in.\n\nBut Fridman said it's important to talk to people who estimate a much higher likelihood AI could wipe us out -- like AI researcher Roman Yampolskiy, who told the podcaster in an interview released Sunday that he pegs it as 99.9% within the next hundred years.\n\nThe AI researcher teaches computer science at the University of Louisville and just came out with a book called \"AI: Unexplainable, Unpredictable, Uncontrollable.\"\n\nHe discussed the risks of AI for over two hours on Fridman's podcast -- and his predictions were pretty bleak.\n\nHe said the chances that AI will wipe out humanity depend on whether humans can create highly complex software with zero bugs in the next 100 years. Yampolskiy said he finds that unlikely since no AI model has been completely safe from people attempting to get the AI to do something it wasn't designed to do.\n\n\"They already have made mistakes,\" Yampolskiy said. \"We had accidents, they've been jailbroken. I don't think there is a single large language model today, which no one was successful at making do something developers didn't intend it to do.\"\n\nThe first few versions of AI models in the last two years have raised various red flags for potential misuse or misinformation. Deepfakes have created fake pornographic images of female public figures and threatened to influence elections with AI robocalls imitating President Biden.\n\nGoogle AI Overviews, based on Google's Gemini AI model, is the latest product rollout that didn't stick the landing. The new feature on Google Search was meant to provide quick informative overviews for certain inquiries presented at the top of search results. Instead, it went viral for coming up with nonsense answers, like suggesting making pizza with glue or stating that no countries in Africa started with the letter K.\n\nYampolskiy said in order to control AI, there needs to be a perpetual safety machine. Yampolskiy said even if we do a good job with the next few versions of GPT, AI will continue to improve, learn, self-modify, and interact with different players -- and with existential risks, \"you only get one chance.\"\n\nThe CEO of ChatGPT developer OpenAI, Sam Altman, has suggested a \"regulatory sandbox\" where people experiment with AI and regulate it based on what \"went really wrong\" and what went \"really right.\"\n\nAltman once warned -- or maybe he was joking -- back in 2015 that \"AI will probably most likely lead to the end of the world, but in the meantime, there'll be great companies.\"\n\nMore recently, Altman has said that what keeps him up at night is \"all of the sci-fi stuff\" related to AI, including the things that are \"easy to imagine where things really go wrong.\"\n\nSince ChatGPT took the world by storm in November 2022, various predictions have been made about how AI could lead to humanity's downfall in regard to AI.\n\nBut Yampolskiy also cautioned that \"we cannot predict what a smarter system will do.\" He compared humans to squirrels in the context of AGI, or artificial general intelligence, and said AI will come up with something that we don't even know exists yet.\n\nAccording to Yampolskiy, however, there are three realms of outcomes that he predicts. One risk is that everyone will die, another is that everyone will suffer and wish they were dead, and another is that humans have completely lost their purpose.\n\nThe last one refers to a world in which AI systems are more creative than humans and can perform all the jobs. In that reality, it's not clear what humans would do to contribute, Yampolskiy said, echoing some concerns about whether AI will start to take humans' jobs.\n\nMost people in the field acknowledge some level of risk with AI, but they don't think it's as likely that things will end badly. Elon Musk has predicted a 10-20% chance that AI will destroy humanity.\n\nFormer Google CEO Eric Schmidt has said the real dangers of AI, which are cyber and biological attacks, will come in three to five years.

The event also marked a significant milestone in the global AI landscape.\n\nUnder the theme Leveraging AI to Accelerate 10X Transformation in the Public Sector, the summit hosted over 400 public sector policymakers, industry leaders, and AI experts.\n\nFeaturing an array of thought-provoking sessions and keynotes, the event provided invaluable insight into the future of AI, reinforcing the UAE's position as a regional leader in the space.\n\nAbdulla Al Marzooqi, Director General of the Integrated Transport Centre, Abu Dhabi, on Transforming the Future of Mobility with AI, spotlighted how AI is being used to modernise mobility and the public transport sector, helping people lead more easier, comfortable and safer lives. The Director General also overviewed how the Abu Dhabi Mobility was transforming the future of mobility with AI.\n\nIn another thought-provoking keynote on Data and AI: The New Era in Public Sector, Mohammad Hassan, Executive Director, National Data and Statistics Sector, Federal Competitiveness & Statistics Centre, underscored how AI data held the key to a bright, new era for the public sector.\n\nProf. J\u00fcrgen Schmidhuber, Director of AI Initiative at KAUST, Saudi Arabia, Scientific Director, Swiss AI Lab IDSIA, and Co-founder and Chief Scientist, NNAISENSE, headlined the event. Referred to as the father of modern AI and Deep Learning, Prof J\u00fcrgen offered excellent takeaways in his summary on the future of AI, stating that desktop tasks that took humans possibly a week or more to execute before could now be done in minutes, thanks to AI. However, complex activities in the real, physical world still require human intervention and skill.\n\n\"There is no AI that can play football like a seven-year-old boy, or that can replace a carpenter or a plumber or an electrician,\" says Prof. J\u00fcrgen. No AI-driven robot can do what humans can do with their fingers (which incidentally are incredibly complex objects), in the physical world. But it's not going to stay like that, he says.\n\nAt some point, AI would extend towards all the machinery outside in the physical world, and do everything that today only humans can do. And do it faster.\n\nHigh AI adoption\n\nEric Wan, General Manager, Alibaba Cloud Middle East, Turkey & Africa, is excited about AI advancements in the MEA. \"Countries across the region [are making] significant investments in infrastructure, promoting AI adoption and upskilling their digital talents for the generative AI era. AI is the transformative force that holds the potential to improve social well-being and boost efficiency,'' he says.\n\n\"We're engaged in various initiatives aimed at building AI capacity in the region. For example, we launched the MEA region's Alibaba Cloud Academy Training Center earlier this year in Dubai Internet City to host monthly training and enablement programs covering a wide spectrum of cutting-edge technologies, from AI to database management to elastic computing.''\n\nAccording to Eric, Alibaba Cloud's AI development platform, Model Studio, will soon be available for international customers via its availability zone in Singapore. \"Through providing proven AI solutions and educational initiatives, we aim to unlock the full potential of AI and catalyse digital transformation across the MEA region,\" he says.\n\nSaeed Alajou, Senior Director & General Manager UAE, Unifonic, in an interview on the sidelines of the event, spoke of how his company is utilising AI.\n\n\"We have solutions that could cater to countries like the UAE where we have a lot of cultures [living together]. We have live translation capabilities in AI. Somebody can speak in their native language, and we would have on-the-fly translation capability for the person listening to it, hearing it in their own language and then [be able to] reply in their language.\n\n\"Our approach to AI is to improve the experience for the customers that we're serving,'' he says.\n\nMaged Mahmoud, Sales Director, DataIKU, believes the future is already here. \"The future is now [because] AI adoption is quite high,'' said Maged, on the sidelines of the GovAI.\n\n\"We're very fortunate to be in a region that is very acceptable to AI. The government of the UAE is truly leading, accepting and endorsing the enablement of AI.''\n\nThat said, he admits embracing change may not be easy for some. \"It has to really come from top down, but also from the bottom up. People have to be eager to learn something new, and enhance their careers and do things in a different way... a smarter way. Technology is great. There are so many features out there. But it's all about identifying the right case or cases that can support your business and making sure that whatever you're doing, you are adopting new technology that will impact your business in a positive manner.\"\n\nHuge turnout\n\nAmr Eltawil, AU Presales Engineer & Solutions Architect, Alpha Data LLC, too is delighted to see the massive turnout at the event. \"I think it's a huge testament to the recognition of the power of AI in the UAE [and] across government entities at the Federal level. It's also a testament to the investment that the government entities are willing to make in terms of AI adoption. Clearly, the vision and the commitment is there. That means inevitably AI will [increasingly] become a [regular] part in terms of government entities' functions, and the execution of workflows, and in terms of how we, as consumers, interact with AI. That's beautiful, because at the end of the day, [AI has the potential to add] immense value to our life.\"\n\nThe summit's impressive line-up of speakers included Dr Omar Al Shaiba Al Marri, Acting Executive Director of IT Affairs, Department of Municipalities and Transport, Dr Farida Al Hosani, Executive Director of Infectious Diseases, Abu Dhabi Public Health Center, Rashid Al Hosani, Chief Growth and Strategy Officer, AD Ports Group, Dr Mohamed El Sabbagh, CTO - Chief Technology Officer, Abu Dhabi Chamber, and Filipe Paula Cardoso, Executive Director for Information Technology, Abu Dhabi Department of Finance.\n\nSponsors and partnerships\n\nThe GovAI Summit Abu Dhabi was sponsored by leading companies in the AI and technology sectors, including Core 42, Alibaba Cloud, Juniper, AtkinsRealis, Unifonic, Alpha Data, Alteryx, Dataiku, VAST, and Botminds. Their support was instrumental in the success of the event, providing a platform for high-level discussions and networking opportunities.\n\nFor more information visit www.govaisummitmea.com",

This 420-page Act aims to regulate the deployment and development of AI systems, categorizing them into high-risk and low-risk, and even banning certain types of AI. The Act emphasizes trust, transparency, and accountability in AI usage, promoting the safe integration of AI technologies. This legislation sets a potential global benchmark for AI regulation, although its complexity may pose interpretative and implementation challenges for stakeholders. We set out the key provisions below.\n\nExtra-territorial Scope Affecting a Wide Range of Participants in the AI Value / Supply Chain\n\nThe AI Act regulates \"AI systems\", defined broadly but generally along the lines of the definition in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Principles for Trustworthy AI, as well as \"general-purpose AI models\" (GP AI models), which are defined as models that display significant generality, are capable of competently performing a wide range of distinct tasks and that can be integrated into a variety of downstream systems or applications (including where such an AI model is trained with a large amount of data using self-supervision at scale). GP AI models include the large language or foundation models currently being used by consumers and businesses around the world. AI models which are used for research, development or prototyping activities before they are placed on the market are excluded from the GP AI models definition.\n\nIn terms of territorial scope, the AI Act applies to providers placing on the market AI systems or GP AI models in the EU, or putting into service (i.e., supplying an AI system for own use or for first use to deployers) AI systems in the EU, regardless of where such providers are located or established in the world. Deployers of AI systems that are located or established in the EU are caught by the Act too, as well as providers and deployers of AI systems outside the EU where the output by the AI system is used in the EU. Product manufacturers, importers and distributors are among the other stakeholders subject to the AI Act.\n\nThe Act sets out a few exemptions from its scope, such as AI systems exclusively used for military, defence or national security purposes, or AI systems and AI models specifically developed and put into service for the sole purpose of scientific research and development.\n\nObligations Depend on What Risk an AI System Poses (Other than for GP AI Models)\n\nThe AI Act adopts a risk-based approach to uses of AI systems, outlining four levels of risk; the higher the risk, the stricter the obligations. Businesses are to identify which level (or levels) of risk their AI systems fall into.\n\nUnacceptable risk: prohibited AI practices\n\nAI systems which are particularly harmful, abusive or dangerous, and contradict EU values of respect for human dignity, freedom, equality, democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights (including the right to non-discrimination, to data protection and to privacy), are prohibited. At a high level, these include:\n\nHigh-risk AI systems: data governance, risk management, safety and other obligations, including mandatory registration in a public database\n\nAI systems considered high risk under the Act entail a raft of new obligations for developers, deployers and other stakeholders.\n\nA wide range of AI systems are considered high-risk, including:\n\nDerogations to the classification of high-risk AI systems have been introduced: for example, if an AI system is intended to perform a narrow procedural task, or does not otherwise pose a significant risk to harm to the health, safety or fundamental rights of natural persons, it can be considered not high-risk but the provider has to document an impact assessment and still register the AI system in the EU database.\n\nProviders of high-risk AI systems must ensure they comply with the new requirements and demonstrate such compliance to the regulator, on request. They include obligations regarding quality of the training, validation and testing data sets; transparent operations; design that includes human oversight; achieving appropriate levels of accuracy, robustness and cybersecurity; implementing a risk management system; undergoing a pre-market conformity assessment affixing the \"Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne (CE) marking\" of conformity; and registering the AI system in a public EU database.\n\nDeployers of high-risk AI systems must monitor its operations, ensure the input data is relevant and sufficiently representative, and report certain risks to the developer and the regulator.\n\nIn certain circumstances deployers of high-risk AI systems are to be considered providers. As the Act allocates responsibilities along the AI value / supply chain, it requires that in such cases the initial provider cooperates closely with the new provider and assists with the fulfilment of the relevant obligations.\n\nLimited risk AI systems, including certain general-purpose AI systems: transparency obligations\n\nAI systems that interact with individuals (such as chatbots), emotion recognition and biometric categorisation systems, and other systems such as those generating synthetic content or creating 'deep fakes', are considered to pose limited risk and, as a result, are subject to certain transparency obligations. The providers and deployers of such AI systems will be required to provide further information and disclosures to individuals, unless limited exemptions apply.\n\nMinimal risk: no mandatory requirements but voluntary codes of conduct\n\nAll other AI systems (apart from GP AI models, see below) fall within the category of AI presenting minimal risk and are not subject to mandatory requirements. These include, for example, AI-enabled video games and email spam filters. They are encouraged to adhere to voluntary codes of conduct which would follow some of the high-risk AI systems requirements.\n\nObligations on Providers of GP AI Models, and Stricter Obligations Regarding GP AI Models with Systemic Risk\n\nThe Act regulates all GP AI models and some of them, considered GP AI models with systemic risk, are subject to further requirements.\n\nGP AI models\n\nProviders of all GP AI models are subject to new obligations, including:\n\nBy way of derogation, GP AI models that are released under a free and open licence are exempt from certain of these requirements, unless these models are GP AI models with systemic risk.\n\nGP AI models with systemic risk\n\nGP AI models with systemic risk are those models that have high impact capabilities evaluated on the basis of appropriate technical tools and methodologies, or those that have been determined to have such capabilities by the European Commission (EC) having regard to certain criteria, such as number of parameters of the model, quality or size of the data set, input and output modalities and number of registered users. When the cumulative amount of computation used for the training of a GP AI model, measured in floating points operations, is greater than 10, it is presumed that the GP AI model is with systemic risk. It is envisaged that providers of GP AI models can challenge the decision of the EC to classify the model as one with systemic risk.\n\nProviders of GP AI models with systemic risk must comply with the obligations in respect of GP AI models mentioned above, as well as with additional obligations including performing model evaluation, assess and mitigate possible systemic risks, report serious incidents to the regulators and ensure an adequate level of cybersecurity.\n\nNew Regulators, Penalties and Enforcement\n\nA newly created AI Office at EU level will oversee the implementation and enforcement of the AI Act. The EC has exclusive powers to enforce the provisions relating to GP AI models, and it has entrusted the implementation of that task to the AI Office, which for example may conduct evaluations of the GP AI models. The AI Office may also assist national authorities in relation to market surveillance of high-risk AI systems. In addition, it should facilitate the drawing up of codes of conduct to assist businesses with compliance.\n\nAnother institution created under the Act is the European Artificial Intelligence Board, composed of representatives of the EU member states, which will be responsible for advisory tasks such as issuing opinions and recommendations.\n\nThere will now be a staggered entry into force, with the provisions relating to prohibited AI systems applying from around December 2024 (six months after the publication of the AI Act in the Official Journal, which is expected to occur shortly). The obligations relating to GP AI models will apply from around June/July 2025, and most of the remaining provisions, including as to high-risk AI systems, from June/July 2026.", "source": {"uri": "lexology.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lexology"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(corporate)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stakeholder (corporate)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OECD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmarking", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Benchmarking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_risk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Systemic risk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fundamental rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Risk management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prototype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Accountability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_law", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Procedural law"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data set"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Natural person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dignity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dignity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scientific method"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Commission"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Location_and_Tracking", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Location and Tracking", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://www.lexology.com/images/share/lexology-social-media.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619220", "eventUri": "eng-9619220", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

But, despite its potential, several misconceptions about AI continue to circulate, hindering its adoption and implementation -- here and in everyday life. With the help of Nate Rosier, SVP of consulting at enVista, lets debunk some of the ongoing speculations about what AI can and cannot do.\n\nStrategy. It's always been a need in supply chain, maybe now more than ever. Rosier says AI is incredibly useful in this regard, but it cannot be used by itself. There still needs to be a team in place, he explains, that analyzes the data and the AI output, using that information to make key decisions.\n\nIn the end, AI isn't meant to be a replacement for your infrastructure and technology that is already in place. Rosier says current AI forecasting and planning capabilities are not robust enough to replace a supply and demand planning system but can support the systems already in place to improve their insights.\n\nAnd of course, we can't forget the all-too-common thought that human talent will soon be pushed to the wayside by AI.\n\n\"The most widely heard misplaced fear about AI is that it will edge out the workforce, but this is not the case in supply chain planning. AI can support human talent and free up employees' time, but humans will always be required to oversee and manage the output of AI in the supply chain planning space,\" says Rosier. \"Management cannot 'set and forget' AI or use it to make decisions without any judgement or oversight. AI should be used as a tool with which to make strategic decisions based on insights you may not have had before.\"\n\nThe truth, it seems, is that AI isn't the beginning and the end. It's an answer, but not always THE answer. AI ultimately uses already existing data to improve insights and increase efficiencies across supply chain operations. Rosier explains that if your existing data is inaccurate or inconsistent, AI will not only provide inaccurate insights, but it will compound those inaccuracies throughout your supply chain.\n\n\"Furthermore, AI will not catch inconsistencies or discrepancies in the data it is provided. This is why it is important not only to have good data, but to have one or more employees overseeing the input and output of the AI to ensure accuracy,\" says Rosier.\n\nAI is best when used for its strengths in speed and efficiency to tackle the simple tasks, and optimizing the supporting processes for more complex moving parts where people are, and will always be, needed.

In its nascent stage, if left unchecked, it could lead to catastrophic consequences. The recent controversy involving Scarlett Johansson and OpenAI's uncanny ability to mimic her voice with their virtual assistant \"Sky\" is a stark warning of a future devoid of ethics and regulatory governance.\n\nJohansson, who famously portrayed an AI in \"Her,\" is fuming after the company mysteriously pulled the plug on \"Sky\" just after she declined their offer. The good news is the company has pulled off, but the question arises: Is\" Sky\" the limit, or are we on the cusp of something far more unsettling?\n\nWhile AI, when used appropriately, can be a powerful tool, it also presents a host of challenges, including deepfake, security, privacy, biases, and fairness. However, the true peril lies in its potential for misuse, which could disrupt vital sectors such as healthcare, financial services, education, and justice systems, if left unaddressed.\n\nAll the big techs, especially the Western ones, are competing with each other to be the first to lock in the end user's use of AI as a single product to solve all human tech needs. The blind race to dominate the market is hampering AI's ability to do good for all.\n\nThe recent products announced by Google and Microsoft have the full potential to revolunitize machine and human relations but sadly most of it would be at the cost of our privacy. Feature like \"Recall\" on Microsoft PCs boast photographic memory by constantly taking screenshots of the desktop!\n\nBecause of its fast rollout and easy access, AI's impact is making it hard for even tech giants to understand the danger it presents to the public. Industries are racing to implement AI tools but most of the time need to be more knowledgeable about AI ethics. Everyone is focusing on the supply side of AI and wants to win the race but in the process they are ignoring the challenges like data biases, fairness and in some instances using synthetic data to build a AI model which in the implementation stage can be fatal.\n\nAI holds immense promise and is being harnessed by brilliant minds for our benefit. The recent influx of funds into AI is staggering, yet it's disheartening to see most of it being directed towards commercial applications, rather than investing in task forces to comprehensively understand the potential risks associated with unchecked AI progress.\n\nFor instance, every time a prompt is given to an AI tool, we indirectly affect Climate. The breakneck pace of Generative AI (Gen-AI) is throwing data centers into a power-guzzling frenzy. This insatiable hunger for electricity threatens to derail our net-zero ambitions and stretches data center construction and supply chains to the breaking point. Even with advancements in efficiency, data center energy consumption is on track to explode by 2026, potentially outpacing our ability to generate enough clean power. Experts are worried the actual impact might be even worse, considering the chip shortage and the sluggish pace of data center construction.\n\nSome experts suggest, and rightly so, that the current race among tech companies to launch AI products is not necessarily needed, and neither solving some threat to humankind but contrapositive the advent of AI is leading to new warfare where technologies like facial recognition can start making targeted killing which can be used by mobs and military of rogues nations.\n\nThis is the time for policymakers to take positive steps to address the challenges posed by unchecked AI development. The only need is to put forward regulatory frameworks to make AI is more ethical and responsible and at same time making sure that regulations do not stifle the development of AI for all for good.\n\nOne solution to address the issues of uncharted AI development is to create an AI Ethics governance framework for companies that make AI tools and software. Setting up AI ethics and compliance bodies to advise and evaluate their performance is vital for Responsible AI.\n\nAI as a tool, at least for now (we might have an AGI), has no virtue of its own; the problem is we humans! It's imperative that we make mistakes and hopefully learn from them, but this time, actually, the stakes are very high, as unchecked AI development has the potential to change the course of human civilization.", "source": {"uri": "moderndiplomacy.eu", "dataType": "news", "title": "Modern Diplomacy"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarlett_Johansson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Scarlett Johansson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepfake", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deepfake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Substance abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ethics of artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Desktop computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_relationship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interpersonal relationship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenshot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Screenshot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_impairment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Visual impairment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Personal computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial general intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Imperative programming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_consumption", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Energy consumption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_neutrality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carbon neutrality"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Natural_Language", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Natural Language", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://moderndiplomacy.eu/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/artificial-intelligence.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619220", "eventUri": "eng-9619220", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

For years, the general public has been trying to use generative AI to their creative advantage, while the business world has been scrambling to find a way to monetize it. At an investor's meeting on Thursday, May 30th, the CEO of Sony Pictures Entertainment, Tony Vinciquerra, stated they plan to use AI as an \"efficient\" way to produce films for television and theaters. Let's take a look at what this could mean for the filmmaking industry.\n\nThe first question during a Q&A portion of the Sony investor call was about AI. You can view the entire presentation on Sony's Investor Relations website, and the Q&A portion starts at 2:53:36 with CEO Tony Vinciquerra and CFO Philip Rowley. \"Industry-wide box office overall has improved from the pandemic but still has not fully rebounded to pre-pandemic levels,\" Vinciquerra says in his presentation. So clearly, Sony (as well as other studios) will be grasping at straws in an attempt to make cheaper movies and maximize profits.\n\nWhile no concrete goals or strategies are laid out, it was made clear that AI will be used, going forward, in their approach to making movies. Vinciquerra ends the question by hammering the point, \"We will be looking at ways to use AI to produce both films for theaters and television in a more efficient way using AI primarily.\" While AI can do a great many things, it can not (as of yet) make movies. So, let's see what he may have meant and ways they can use AI to produce more efficient films.\n\n\"Written\" by AI\n\nThe \"G\" in ChatGPT stands for \"Generative.\" It (and other similar models) can \"generate\" material based on data on which it has been trained. So in theory, one could use a text-based generative AI model to come up with movie ideas based on prompts by a user. It could even generate a script because it knows the proper formatting based on data scraped from the internet.\n\nOne of many concerns over the use of AI, and something stipulated in the most recent contract ratified by the WGA, is that studios \"cannot use AI to write scripts or to edit scripts that a writer has already written.\" It was decided that AI was a tool to be used by writers, not as an entity to replace writers. An important distinction.\n\nThis is something specifically referred to by Vinciquerra in his presentation. \"[Creatives] are very sensitive; in fact, we had an 8-month strike over AI last year, both actors and writers. That was one of the primary drivers of that strike.\" He then goes on to say that the agreements from those SAG/WGA contracts, as well as an upcoming negotiation with IATSE, will define what the studios will be able to do with AI.\n\nSo, while a Development Executive or Writer can use AI to assist in the writing of a story or script, it can not be used to write an entire script or rewrite something a writer has already written. But how does using AI to help write make for a more efficient film? What is the benefit for the studio to use AI in producing films in a more efficient way?\n\n\"Executive Produced\" by AI\n\nAnother aspect of Generative AI that may be useful to a production studio is charting successes and failures. Being able to predict successes would be a game-changer for movie studios. Movie studios are, in fact, a business.\n\nFor years, Executives have been chasing what they think audiences want to see. What they think will sell. But now they may have a calculator that can accurately predict (based on available data) what will bring audiences to theaters. What audiences will or will not respond to is something that can be tracked. Doing that monotonous, repetitive research is something that AI excels at and can be done in a fraction of the time it takes a human to do it.\n\nSo, is it a more efficient way of making films to pay Executives less and rely on AI more? It certainly would appear that way, but I don't think I could get any human Executive to agree with me.\n\n\"Art Direction\" by AI\n\nThere has already been controversy around using AI to produce posters and artwork for movies and TV shows. It is one thing generative AI has gotten quite good at. Some pieces of AI-generated art are virtually imperceptible as non-physically photographed or created by a human artist. Posters for Alex Garland's 'Civil War' and Marvel's 'Loki' Season 2 were, at least in part, created using AI.\n\nPerhaps a more efficient way of making films is to cut back on paying artists by using AI to generate promotional materials for movies and series (of course, I am not actually suggesting this, nor am I an advocate of AI taking the jobs of humans; I'm merely speaking rhetorically). Or maybe, with the advent of Stagecraft technology and the LED Volume, you could use AI-generated backgrounds and landscapes in live-action photography. Anything normally created by an Art Department, whether it is Concept Art, Production Design, Props, Costumes, etc., could all theoretically be generated by AI.\n\nThere are image-to-3D model conversions that can be done with AI. So, modelers and VFX artists could even be lumped into this category. But how is that efficient for a movie studio? You still need human interaction and human emotions evoked by creating artwork. And that is something AI will never be able to replicate, no matter how good it gets. It is unique to the human experience and can not be explained, scraped from the internet, or otherwise recreated.\n\n\"Visual Effects Created\" by AI\n\nVideo generation is one of the newer revolutions in generative AI within the past year or so. Open AI's Sora model made waves by showcasing photo-realistic videos created by a singular text prompt. There has been some pushback on a recently released short film called \"Air Head,\" which was touted as being created by Sora's AI. The insinuation that the video was made solely by Sora was soon after debunked when VFX artist Patrick Cederberg revealed that quite a bit of post-production work was done to make the Sora-generated video clips work in the short.\n\nBut Sora is not the only video generation model out there. Google has recently announced Veo, using their Deepmind AI to generate videos from a text prompt. Even Adobe Premiere, an industry-leading video editing software, announced features allowing the user to extend video clips beyond recorded motion using AI or erase unwanted elements from video clips. All of which before seemed impossible without hours of work from a VFX artist.\n\n\"Music Composed\" by AI\n\nWhile video generation is a big step forward for AI, the most recent shocking innovation has been AI music generation. If the picture and video AI revolution is a speeding car, AI-generated music is a rocket ship. I remember sampling Meta's Musicgen a few months ago and getting something that resembled a non-melodic score for an 8-bit video game. But now you can create entire songs, complete with vocal tracks, at the push of a button.\n\nCineD's own Mascha Deikova, inspired by CineD's co-creator Nino Leitner's AI-generated tune, just published an article about the AI music generator revolution and how impressive it is. I would urge you to read her in-depth article outlining the pros, cons, and various models that can generate music based on a single text prompt.\n\nEnd Credits\n\nWhile all of this is fun to research and talk about, I don't think any creatives working in the industry are really concerned about these AI models taking any jobs away from creative individuals. Sure, actors need to safeguard themselves against unauthorized use of AI generating their likenesses, and writers need to make sure Artificial Intelligence can't legally \"write a movie screenplay.\" But when it comes down to it, all of these generative models have the same thing in common: you need a user to input the idea to begin with. You need an individual with years of experience, talent, and creativity to imagine these things before the AI model can do anything at all.\n\nI don't think it's cynical of me to say that the business side of filmmaking will always try to use the latest tech to cut costs, drive up profits, and ensure their bonuses at all costs. And that's all this latest Sony Investor's call really was; Tony Vinciquerra using buzzwords to assure shareholders that they can make movies \"more efficiently\" using the latest technology. Whatever that means.\n\nFinding work in Hollywood in the current climate is harder than ever. But it's not because AI is taking jobs away from creatives. It's because the Hollywood business model has become averse to taking risks. Studios are clinging to franchises and established IPs, wringing every cent they can get out of them. Gone are the days of the Spec Script Boom of the 90's. Gone are the days of the indie arthouse movies of the 2000s. Even the leader of the modern indie film revolution, A24, has started to expand their catalog of movies into the more commercially blockbuster type of films.\n\nAnyone working in movies today will tell you the landscape looks vastly different than it did 5 years ago. And with recent big-budget movies like \"The Fall Guy\" and \"Furiosa\" underperforming at the box office, studios are looking for assurances that they will always be able to make money from their films.", "source": {"uri": "cined.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CineD"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Vinciquerra", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tony Vinciquerra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Pictures", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sony Pictures"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writers_Guild_of_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Writers Guild of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_studio", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Film studio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leverage (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_effects", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Visual effects"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_office", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Box office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Film industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_art", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence art"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loki_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Loki (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Alliance_of_Theatrical_Stage_Employees", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Garland", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alex Garland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stagecraft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stagecraft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_Actors_Guild", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Screen Actors Guild"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Calculator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://www.cined.com/content/uploads/2024/05/TonyVinciquerra_SPE_CEO.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619220", "eventUri": "eng-9619220", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-30", "textStart": 238, "textEnd": 246}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

Organizations are strategizing how they can accelerate and coordinate their adoption of the latest and greatest technology.\n\nThey're considering how AI can be used to drive growth, increase productivity, enhance experiences and accelerate innovation. Some are considering new operation models and data center investments as a result.\n\nHiring for the role of Chief AI Officer (CAIO) has risen to prominence as a way for organizations to balance these considerations, evaluate and lead their AI strategies.\n\nThe United States Office of Management and Budget (OMB) recently issued government-wide policy asking all federal agencies to name a Chief AI Officer, and according to FedScoop, as many as two-thirds of U.S. federal agencies have done so. Dell research found almost 20% of organizations surveyed globally identified a central team or individual to set AI strategy, and a separate report found that the number of \"head\" of AI jobs has tripled over the last five years.\n\nChief AI Officers play a vital role as organizations look to optimize their operations and gain a competitive advantage with AI. For the public sector, the Chief AI Officer can offer structure and guidance to provide better citizen services as well as promote innovation and competition. For private industries, the Chief AI Officer can develop efficiencies within the organization, bringing greater productivity for team members and a better experience for their end customers.\n\nIn the new world of Chief AI Officers, I'm a veteran. I took the role last September after more than 25 years at Dell Technologies when only 30 companies had appointed Chief AI Officers. There are now more than 120 Chief AI Officers across all industries, with more being named by the day.\n\nIn my time as CAIO, many of our customers have sought my guidance on the role and what considerations are necessary within their own organizations. While every organization is different, I will offer a few words of wisdom as other AI leaders look to embrace the technology:\n\nThese principles have helped me define and refine Dell's AI strategy, keeping in mind that my role as Chief AI Officer is to balance the promise of AI while mitigating the risks.

It's going to impact local governmental considerably.\n\nSo, what do we do when faced with displacement by AI and automation? Consider what happened to the Blockbuster video rental chain: They weren't paying attention to big technological shifts, and they were preoccupied with business as usual. Similarly, local governments might be trapped in bureaucracy and wrapped in a feedback loop.\n\nGoldman Sachs projects about one-fourth of current work tasks could be automated by AI in the United States and Europe. Government is not known for its agility, but there is time and opportunity to energize government with a bold mission plan.\n\nHere is a sampling of jobs soon to be disrupted by AI, according to Goldman Sachs:\n\nThese jobs constitute much of what government does: administrative support functions such as managing forms, processing paperwork and administering related processes.\n\nREAD MORE: Local governments can improve customer service with AI.\n\nWhy is planning for AI disruption so important at this moment? It has to do with the velocity of change, which is accelerating faster than ever in 2024.\n\nThere's been a thousandfold increase in AI computer power in the past year alone. As goes compute, so goes the AI model in terms of change and advancement. Change relies on that compute foundation. The rate of change is doubling every 1.8 months, says noted futurist and computer science expert Ray Kurzweil.\n\nWe cannot move fast enough in government -- or any business, for that matter -- to respond to this.\n\nWe have moved from single-prompt AI in 2023 to operating AI special agents with specific skills in the first quarter of 2024. We can now use ChatGPT or open-source AI models to go to the internet and grab data and skills.\n\nWe're entering a state of multiagent AI, and that's where job disruption really comes in. We have multiple AI agents, each defined with its own role. In this model, which we are using today, these agents work together and collaborate as sort of an artificial set of people to solve a problem.\n\nFor single-prompt AI, the success rate for a zero-shot task increased from 48 percent with ChatGPT 3.5 to 67 percent with ChatGPT 4. But with multiple-agent AI, the success rate of ChatGPT 3.5 alone jumps to about a 95 percent for the same task.\n\nThat multiagent workflow achieves better output and better results. This is disruptive to workforce and to jobs -- more so than simply using AI out of the box in the way we do today. This is profound.\n\nLEARN MORE: Cities can use AI to augment public services.\n\nWe will see jobs in the government and in the community being disrupted. There are a lot of people that are for innovation and a lot of people who are against innovation -- both internally within government institutions and externally among citizens.\n\nWe can work with governments and help them craft a message that will persuade people to embrace innovation by doing practical, pragmatic AI interactions. We can run scenario-planning with government officials through our MOAT framework. We can focus on positive results, such as how AI can create jobs, improve education and make life better.\n\nAccording to the 2024 Edelman Trust Barometer, government is seen as far less competent and ethical than business. Government is rated 52 points less competent than business. It therefore might behoove government to go with a trusted partner, and I cannot think of any better partner than a solution integrator.\n\nA solution integrator is the business to trust for competency and ethics. Why? Because people don't trust AI companies either. So, they don't trust AI companies, and they don't trust government. As a solution integrator, we can say that we are here to strike a balance and rightsize the technology to protect people and their jobs.\n\nThe goal is for the local government and the community to own AI so that AI doesn't own them.", "source": {"uri": "statetechmagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "StateTech Magazine"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Local government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Goldman Sachs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_(music)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sampling (music)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bureaucracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Open source model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futurist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Futurist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Kurzweil", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ray Kurzweil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Customer service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Velocity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pragmatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Workflow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_service", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://statetechmagazine.com/sites/statetechmagazine.com/files/styles/cdw_hero/public/articles/%5Bcdw_tech_site%3Afield_site_shortname%5D/202406/GettyImages-2114984318.jpg?itok=N1BWyFNq", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619220", "eventUri": "eng-9619220", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

Stark State College is preparing for jobs of the future", "body": "Lt. Gov. Jon Husted visited Stark State College recently to convene a group of local employers to discuss artificial intelligence (AI) for workforce. Large and small employers, from health care to manufacturing, reported that they are already using AI or plan to do so very soon.\n\nAI is integrated into many facets of life and work. Type a search term in Google. Chat with a customer service representative online. Scroll through the recommendations on your favorite streaming platform. These innovations are all made possible through AI.\n\nEmployers are using AI to make their operations more effective, efficient, safer and more appealing to employees. This is especially important in Ohio and Northeast Ohio in light of talent shortages and supply-chain issues.\n\nFrom data analysis to customer service, AI-powered tools can handle routine functions with speed and accuracy, allowing workers to leverage their unique abilities to solve complex problems and drive strategic initiatives. Manufacturers are using AI, automation and robotics to relieve employees of routine, manual, dirty and sometimes dangerous work so they can focus on higher-value work that requires technical skills, creativity and critical thinking.\n\nThe need for workers with AI skills is on the rise and will continue to grow. Positions in IT and technology, particularly in data science, are among the fastest-growing jobs in our economy. AI jobs are expected to boom outside of the technical sector as well, cutting across a wide range of industries and job functions.\n\nThe World Economic Forum's Future of Jobs 2023 report predicts high demand for skills such as analytic and creative thinking related to AI and big data. Additionally, technological innovation is expected to prompt a 44% shift in workers' core competencies within the next five years.\n\nAI and machine learning are already revolutionizing our workplaces and jobs of the future. It's not just Silicon Valley or the \"coasts\" that need to be ready for this transformation; it's our workforce right here in Ohio. As companies like Intel Corp. make historic investments in high-tech manufacturing in our state, we need to prepare workers who are savvy in automated manufacturing, robotics and AI.\n\nFor 64 years, Stark State College has prepared students for high-demand, rewarding jobs in our region. Recently, we were designated as an AI for Workforce College by Intel. We're among a select group of community colleges across the country focused on accelerating AI for local and regional employers and employees.\n\nThis fall, we are introducing two new AI certificates, developed in conjunction with Intel. These certificates are a way for students to quickly and affordably advance their skills and prepare for jobs that utilize AI. As companies use AI to give themselves a competitive edge in the marketplace, students who have education and training in AI can also gain a competitive advantage when seeking employment in the digital economy.\n\nStark State is proud to be a leader in AI for workforce, providing students with the AI skills needed for high-demand careers in manufacturing, business, IT, health care and other sectors of our economy. The recent AI discussion, led by Lt. Gov. Husted, is the first of many conversations we will continue to have with local and regional employers as we develop more AI courses to meet their needs.\n\nAs we move forward in this new frontier, it's my hope that students, professionals and employers will take advantage of these opportunities and be active participants in the conversation so that our community and state become known as a force in AI adoption and innovation.", "source": {"uri": "eu.cantonrep.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Repository"}, "authors": [{"uri": "canton_repository@eu.cantonrep.com", "name": "Canton Repository", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stark_State_College", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stark State College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Customer service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Husted", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jon Husted"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Northeast Ohio"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Data analysis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robotics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Economic_Forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Economic Forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Critical thinking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_solving", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Problem solving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innovation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Innovation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Analytics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Silicon Valley"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_advantage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Competitive advantage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_college", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Community college"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job_Search", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job Search", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Employment", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2022/07/07/NREP/ea0d5999-90b7-4d9a-afe8-3aad4d01d46f-LT-Gov-Husted-IMG_14_copy.jpg?auto=webp&crop=1999,1125,x0,y101&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619220", "eventUri": "eng-9619220", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

This insight was shared following the 2024 Work Trend Index results, conducted in collaboration with LinkedIn.\n\nAn impressive 86% of knowledge workers in the Philippines integrate AI into their work routines. This figure surpasses both the global average of 75% and the regional average of 83%.\n\nABS-CBN News quoted Microsoft Philippines Peter Maquera saying that Filipino employees are not only leading Asia but also setting the pace globally in using AI to enhance productivity, efficiency, and creativity.\n\nChallenges in corporate AI adoption\n\nDespite the high individual usage of AI, Philippine companies have been slower to integrate this technology. As a result, around 83% of Filipino AI users bring their own AI solutions to work. Microsoft has noted that this trend introduces potential privacy, security, and legal risks for companies. Nevertheless, Maquera expressed optimism about the country's AI adoption rate, noting that major corporations actively seek to integrate AI into their operations.\n\nWhile banks and telecommunications firms have pioneered AI integration in the Philippines, other industries are following suit. Sectors such as retail, manufacturing, airlines, transportation, and logistics are also exploring the deployment of AI technologies.\n\nBalancing AI regulation\n\nMaquera emphasized the importance of government regulation of AI but warned against the risks of over-regulation.\n\nIn response to the growing AI trend, a bill has been introduced in Congress advocating for establishing the Artificial Intelligence Development Authority (AIDA) under House Bill 7396, known as the \"Artificial Intelligence Development and Regulation Act of the Philippines.\"\n\nSeveral government departments, including the Interior, Education, and Justice departments, have expressed their support for the creation of an AI regulatory body.\n\nIn an earlier interview with CoinGeek, Professor Eugene Rex Jalao, Program Coordinator for the Artificial Intelligence Program at the University of the Philippines, said there are gaps in existing laws, particularly concerning intellectual property rights and labor protections related to AI use.\n\nJalao also said that there should be labor law protections from AI wherein companies planning to deploy AI solutions should not be used as a reason to replace our jobs but only to enhance our productivity. He added that the national policy would help fund AI research, AI laboratories, and equipment procurement.\n\nWorldwide trend\n\nAccording to the 2024 Work Trend Index, the use of generative AI among global knowledge workers has nearly doubled in the past six months, reaching 75%. \"2024 is the year AI at work gets real,\" states the latest report by Microsoft and LinkedIn.\n\nMicrosoft and LinkedIn conducted extensive research, surveying 31,000 people across 31 countries and analyzing vast amounts of productivity data from Microsoft 365. The findings offer crucial insights and actionable steps for leaders and professionals to harness AI's potential. \"The data points to insights every leader and professional needs to know,\" the report concludes, providing a roadmap for overcoming AI inertia and driving organizational success.\n\nThe transition from AI experimentation to full-scale business transformation mirrors past tech disruptions, such as the advent of the internet and personal computers. Organizations that successfully leverage AI to drive growth, manage costs, and enhance customer value are poised to outpace their competitors.\n\n\"We've come to the hard part of any tech disruption,\" the report notes, emphasizing the necessity for broad adoption.\n\nAI's impact on the labor market\n\nAI is set to significantly reshape the labor market, yet concerns about job loss are met with a surprising reality: a talent shortage for key roles. \"Leaders report a talent shortage for key roles...

However, challenges including AI talent scarcity and limited collaboration between financial institutions and AI fintech startups.\n\nA study conducted by global consultancy Oliver Wyman in collaboration with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) explores how cities like Singapore can become global hubs for AI in finance, examining the biggest challenges faced by ecosystem stakeholders and stressing the importance of attracting global AI talent, fostering AI investments, and promoting AI collaboration within the financial industry.\n\nThe Oliver Wyman study, which is based on in-depth interviews and surveys involving industry leaders and key players in the financial ecosystem, revealed challenges in sourcing strong AI talents, particularly individuals with five to ten years of industry experience.\n\n56% of the ecosystem stakeholders polled said that Singapore's AI talent pool wasn't large enough, with scarcity extending across various AI-related positions, including principal data engineers, data analysts, lead AI scientists, and more.\n\nThe competition to attract global AI talent is fierce, with organizations from various sectors and locations competing for the same highly sought-after professionals, both locally and internationally.\n\nTo attract AI talent, stakeholders emphasized the availability of cutting-edge projects (98%) and the presence of prominent AI firms (96%) as important factors. These findings reflect the ambitions and drive in today's AI talents, who are looking for high-impact use cases and projects for their career development.\n\nLivability considerations (96%), such as the cost of living and the ease of cultural assimilation, are also one of the top factors which attract global AI talents. This trend is evidenced by many prominent big tech companies and AI research firms offering compelling salary packages to fortify their competitive edge.\n\nBesides attracting AI talents, the study also revealed a lack of successful collaboration between financial institutions and AI fintech startups. For many AI fintech companies offering business-to-business (B2B) solutions, collaboration with financial institutions is essential for achieving innovation and success. However, concerns regarding regulations, security, compliance, and reliability create barriers for financial institutions when considering collaboration with fintech companies.\n\nOne major issue highlighted in the Oliver Wyman report is the lack of understanding of use cases. Financial institutions struggle to openly share their challenges with AI fintech startups, resulting in a disconnect between incumbents and startups. This leads to a shortage of tailored solutions, frustrating financial institutions and hindering deeper collaboration.\n\nFurthermore, data scarcity for model training poses a significant obstacle. Numerous AI solutions require extensive datasets to train, validate, develop, and refine models, and oftentimes, these datasets are subject to regulations and inaccessible. According to Oliver Wyman's survey, 82% of stakeholders said they found accessing data for AI-based solutions challenging.\n\nTo attract and nurture AI fintech companies, Oliver Wyman advocates for the establishment of incubators and accelerators focused on AI in finance to provide startups with mentorship, exposure to investors, and a conducive growth environment.\n\nAdditionally, the implementation of a comprehensive, government-endorsed accreditation framework tailored specifically for AI fintech companies can boost the confidence of financial institutions in AI fintech solutions. This accreditation, if aligned with global standards, could not only enhance credibility for domestic collaboration but also facilitate international expansion. It would also serve as an incentive for overseas AI fintech companies to consider relocating to Singapore.\n\nTo enhance talent quality and accessibility, Oliver Wyman advises stakeholders to implement upskilling programs and build a global network of AI expertise. Regulators can explore the introduction of mentorship or apprenticeship schemes, connecting young AI talents with leading technology firms involved in cutting-edge AI projects, both locally and internationally.\n\nFinancial institutions, meanwhile, should equip their senior leadership with comprehensive AI knowledge and offer specialized courses. These courses could cover essential topics, such as generative AI and other transformative innovations in the field.\n\nFinally, establishing a globally interconnected network of AI expertise and knowledge is crucial for smaller countries to compete with larger AI hubs in terms of local talents and firms. Such collaborations could drive innovative technological advancements, contribute to the growth of AI hubs, and help retain talent, Oliver Wyman says.\n\nAI holds tremendous potential in finance, with McKinsey estimating that AI technologies could deliver up to US$1 trillion of additional value each year for the global banking industry. This would be achieved through increased revenues through personalized services, cost efficiencies, and the uncovering of new and previously unrealized opportunities using data.\n\nIn the AI domain, Singapore is swiftly becoming a major hub for investment, drawing significant venture capital (VC) funding. According to Oliver Wyman, the city-state has attracted about US$3 billion in VC funding so far, making it one of the world's top ten countries in AI investments.

It is here now and is reshaping industries and ways of life in ways previously unimaginable.\n\nFrom education to healthcare, entertainment, finance, retail, and manufacturing, just to name a few, generative AI is leaving its mark on the overall human experience and how businesses and industries operate, innovate, and compete.\n\nAt The Bean Path, we are recognizing May as AI Month. Our goal is to demystify AI by showcasing its transformative power across various sectors and bringing together individuals from all backgrounds to learn, connect, and explore the future of technology.\n\nYou don't have to be a techie to participate or appreciate AI Month. In fact many common- non-tech people are using AI on a daily basis and may not know it. Artificial Intelligence is an integral part of our everyday lives, reshaping how we work, communicate, and interact with the world around us. From virtual assistants to personalized recommendations, AI is revolutionizing the way everyday people experience technology and navigate the complexities of modern life.\n\nHere are a few stats to consider. According to Tech Jury, 97% of mobile users are using AI-powered voice assistants. More than four billion devices already work on AI-powered voice assistants. Think Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri. An article on Color Whistle stated AI spending in the retail industry is expected to reach $20.05 billion by 2026. Many companies are embracing AI to support their customer service. 80% of marketers use chatbots as part of their customer experience strategy.\n\nAlthough groundbreaking, AI technology is not without its challenges. As the Principal Applied Scientist For Amazon Artificial Intelligence, my job focuses on creating fairness and identifying biases in these technologies.\n\n\"Traditional AI\" can be thought of as algorithms that scan previous data from the past in order to create predictions about things in the future. \"Generative AI\" more specifically are algorithms that when given a prompt will create new content (in the form of language/text, images, or video) that is similar to patterns in content from the past. The concern comes when there isn't a wide balance of information that was used to create the algorithms and it's partially discriminatory towards certain groups. Other concerns involve results that contain toxic/discriminatory info, inaccurate information, or infringing upon intellectual property/copyrighted material.\n\nBiases in AI algorithms stem from various sources, including biased training data, flawed algorithms, and human biases encoded in the design process. Training data, collected from real-world sources, may reflect societal biases and perpetuate existing inequalities if not carefully curated and balanced. Moreover, algorithmic biases can emerge from the design choices and assumptions made by developers, leading to skewed outcomes that disproportionately impact certain groups.\n\nHow do we fix this as a community?\n\nWe have to continue to educate ourselves about the potential advantages and limitations of the technology. Understanding the basics of algorithmic bias and its implications helps you recognize biased AI systems and advocate for fairer alternatives.\n\nFollow reputable sources and experts in the field of AI ethics to stay updated on the latest research, discussions, and solutions related to bias in AI.\n\nAdvocate for transparency and accountability. Provide feedback on AI products and services you use, highlighting any biases or unfair outcomes you encounter. User feedback can drive improvements and prompt companies to address biases.\n\nSupport diversity and inclusion. Advocate for greater diversity in tech companies and AI research teams. Diverse teams bring varied perspectives that can help identify and mitigate biases in AI algorithms.\n\nUse ethical AI products. Choose to use products and services from companies that prioritize ethical AI practices and demonstrate a commitment to fairness and inclusivity.\n\nPromote ethical data practices. Be mindful of the data you share online and understand how it may be used to train AI algorithms. Opt for platforms that respect user privacy and ethical data practices.\n\nVolunteer with organizations and initiatives focused on AI ethics, digital rights, and fairness. Your time and skills can contribute to efforts aimed at addressing biases in AI. Collaborate with academic and community groups working on AI fairness projects, providing support and spreading awareness within your community.\n\nAs AI continues to evolve and permeate society, it is essential to recognize its potential to empower individuals, enhance quality of life, and drive positive social change.

I am, however, concerned that in the rush to use this new technology, important security issues may be ignored.\n\nAI has many benefits, such as making tasks easier and saving time. This allows people to focus on more important and creative work. And of course, efficiency translates into cost savings and increased productivity for businesses.\n\nAI also enhances decision-making by taking vast amounts of data at speeds that are beyond purely human capability, and by using its intelligence to analyze data and predict outcomes for decision-making purposes. In finance, AI can help with tasks such as risk assessment and fraud detection, while in health care, it can assist with diagnosing diseases and developing treatment plans.\n\nMoreover, AI fosters innovation by enabling the development of new products and services. Already, AI-powered technologies like virtual assistants and autonomous vehicles are pushing boundaries and shaping the future by driving progress.\n\nAI can make life easier for people with disabilities by creating personalized solutions, improving communication, and enhancing learning for students. This can help bridge gaps in access to resources and make things more inclusive.\n\nAI systems offer these and other advantages, but AI also comes with new security risks. We must address these vulnerabilities, while not ignoring existing cybersecurity threats.\n\nAI technology can create hard-to-detect threats, such as AI-powered phishing attacks. Another concern is that bad actors could mix malware with AI, which could allow the AI to study a company's cyber defenses and identify weaknesses.\n\nPrompt injection attacks are one of the most widely reported weaknesses in large learning models, or AI systems, that are capable of understanding and generating human language by processing vast amounts of text data. In a prompt injection attack, an attacker creates an input designed to make the LLM behave in an unintended way. This could result in making abusive posts, sharing secrets, or causing problems in a system that does not filter input.\n\nData poisoning attacks occur when someone alters the data used to train an AI model. This causes the model to generate undesired outcomes related to security and bias. As people increasingly use LLMs, the risks of attacks will increase.\n\nStrict laws on data privacy regulate the collection, use and processing of sensitive information. This can pose challenges, since AI tools typically collect data from different places, often including sensitive information in the process -- and as threat actors target systems for this information, these data stores are at risk for cyberattacks and data breaches.\n\nFurther, AI technology can analyze large data sets, like private communications and user behavior. This can lead to compliance violations if there is misuse or unauthorized access.\n\nWhen development is moving quickly, like with AI, security is sometimes not the main focus. So, I believe security should be a top priority for AI systems, from development to end-of-life. It is important for people in charge of AI systems, like senior managers, to stay updated on new developments. To make AI products successful, professionals like data scientists, developers, decision-makers, risk owners, and cybersecurity consultants must collaborate.\n\nThey all need to ensure the products work well, are available when needed, and safeguard sensitive data from unauthorized access.

And Erdoes is not the only business leader to see this need. Prompt engineering is emerging as one of the in-demand skills in workplaces where AI is taking over and automating tasks, or acting as an aid to workers -- for example, through chatbots such as OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nIn governments, globally, productivity improvements from generative AI could be worth $1.75tn annually by 2033, according to Marc Warner, co-founder and chief executive of Faculty, a London-based company providing AI software, consulting and services.\n\nBut reaping these benefits will require careful investment in retraining for an AI world.\n\n\"It's not AI that will replace humans, it's humans who can work with it [who] will replace [those] who can't,\" says Khariton Matveev, a tech entrepreneur. His advice is: \"View AI as a co-worker, don't avoid it, but look more for cases of implementation in your field.\"\n\nAccording to one study, nearly a fifth of US workers could have at least 50 per cent of their tasks affected by the introduction of large language models, such as OpenAI's GPT-4. Matveev believes this AI adoption will be more about \"partially replacing some job elements than entirely replacing professions\". He suggests that information-processing jobs -- such as translator, researcher, or designer -- are at higher risk than professions requiring physical strength.\n\nIn preparation for the new technology, he recommends that workers complete a course in prompt engineering, and try to experiment with AI tools by integrating them into their daily lives.\n\nChristian Rebernik, co-chief executive and co-founder of Tomorrow University of Applied Sciences, says there is a more \"urgent need\" to retrain for AI in certain sectors than in others. Sectors where the need is great include healthcare, climate change mitigation, and cyber security -- as cybercriminals are increasingly using AI to carry out sophisticated attacks.\n\nThere are also AI-specific roles that will become increasingly important as the technology is more deeply embedded in our everyday lives, such as data-labeller or annotator -- people who can help to train AI algorithms by, for example, clarifying what a particular image depicts.\n\n\"The rise of Generative AI brings a number of opportunities for retraining -- mapping to the AI pipeline that goes from data collection and labelling, to model creation and training, and finally application and feedback,\" says Dev Nag, chief executive of QueryPal, an AI assistant for businesses. \"Domain experts who can help at the beginning and end of this pipeline -- [advising on] which data to collect, how to label it, and how to apply it -- will continue to add enormous value.\"\n\nTo those most at risk of having their roles replaced, but who remain tech savvy, Matveev says: \"You can secure yourself, if you are a top-tier expert who can help teach AI in your field\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. [you can] earn from training models on data set created by you.\"\n\nBut, with all these changes, the skills required to stay ahead go beyond the purely technical.\n\nTo be most effective as a prompt engineer in a particular sector, for example, will require deep knowledge of that sector. \"Our experience so far suggests\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009that there is a strong correlation between subject matter expertise and the ability to create the best prompts,\" explains James Longster, partner in the technology and commercial transactions department at UK law firm Travers Smith.\n\nHe cites the legal sector: if different staff members are given the task of using AI to extract information from a contract, the experienced lawyers will tend to outperform their non-legal counterparts in creating the prompts that extract the best results.\n\nAnd all employees who work with clients will need to know how to wield AI in ways that retain their clients' trust and confidence. Nag points to the enduring role of financial advisers who must \"balance the risk versus reward judgment for individual investors, so that [AI] algorithms don't push outside of the target risk envelope\".\n\nMatveev agrees. \"As AI takes on more \"hard\" components -- like data, analysis, execution -- the human role will shift to better understanding needs, what do clients really want and what should we do,\" he says.\n\nOthers also mention the importance of interpersonal skills and ethics as AI is adopted in the workplace. \"Skills such as emotional intelligence -- recognising and regulating one's emotions -- and social intelligence -- understanding and influencing the emotions of others in social situations -- will ensure AI integration remains human-centred,\" argues Rebernik.\n\nAbove all, staff will need to be \"flexible and adaptable\", says Stanford University professor and AI specialist Erik Brynjolfsson -- as some skills may quickly become redundant as the technology moves so fast.\n\n\"Prompt-engineering skills were hailed as the important new skill to learn,\" he notes. \"But they are already being eclipsed, as [large language models] learn to write better prompts than humans.\"", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering",

The USD 15-million Fund is a three-year programme to equip Asia's workforce with essential artificial intelligence (AI) knowledge and tools required for the evolving work landscape, thereby ensuring that jobs and roles presented by AI are accessible to more people in the region, specifically those from underserved communities. The Fund will be available through an Open Call to identify and select the non-profit organisations, social enterprises, and workforce associations in Asia-Pacific which meaningfully reach the workers who will be most impacted by the workforce transitions caused by AI. Selected organisations will receive comprehensive support, including guidance, financial support and tailored AI training based on foundational AI courses designed by Google and its external partners.\n\n\"AI presents tremendous opportunities for the Asia-Pacific region, but it's crucial to equip people with the skills needed to thrive. This new AI Opportunity Fund in Asia Pacific will help to empower underserved communities and ensure everyone benefits from the transformative power of AI,\" said Scott Beaumont, President of Google Asia-Pacific.\n\nEmployers in Asia-Pacific are confident in AI's potential to boost productivity. Over the next five years, 93% expect to use generative AI tools, with some even offering salary bumps of up to 44% for workers with AI skills. While AI is perceived positively by employees, 16% of those surveyed by PwC believed AI could replace their jobs. The work uncertainty compounds for those already disadvantaged, where a third of the population does not use the internet and where high job informality persists.\n\nMust Read: What is Experience Management (XM)?\n\nNaina Subberwal Batra, CEO of AVPN, said \"Building an AI-ready workforce is an essential social mandate for businesses and governments, and one that can unlock Asia's full workforce potential, considering this region will have 165 million working-age people by 2030.

As an educator who recently integrated AI into an undergraduate business research course, I have observed both the incredible potential and the intricate challenges associated with AI adoption in higher learning.\n\nWhile generative AI can significantly enhance students' research and writing capabilities, the conversation around AI in education has been dominated by concerns over plagiarism and academic dishonesty. These concerns are valid, but framing AI solely as a tool for deception overlooks a crucial aspect: students need comprehensive support and guidance to use AI responsibly and effectively, with an emphasis on social-emotional learning (SEL).\n\nIntegrating AI in education requires not only well-designed policies and pedagogical approaches but also a keen understanding of the technical, emotional and social factors influencing students' engagement with the technology. Through analyzing students' reflections in my course, it became evident that their willingness and ability to leverage AI meaningfully was shaped by complex perceptions and skills beyond technical proficiency.\n\nSome students expressed guilt and confusion around using AI, perceiving it as \"illegal\" even when I told them to use it with my explicit permission. Others grappled with the fear that any reliance on AI could compromise the integrity and value of their learning, given the prior sentiments they encountered and developed from other courses. Many struggled with the social and communication skills needed to prompt AI tools effectively to obtain relevant outputs. These findings underscore the necessity of cultivating students' social-emotional competencies alongside their technical mastery of AI.\n\nIndeed, educators should foster learning environments that normalize discussions about the benefits, risks and emotional responses surrounding academic uses of AI. We must guide students to be self-aware in monitoring their interactions with AI, enabling them to seek help when needed. We should model and encourage responsible AI usage that focuses on augmenting, rather than replacing, human capabilities. This involves teaching students to maintain autonomy over their learning process, think critically about AI outputs, and make reasoned judgments about when and how to incorporate them.\n\nGet the latest news\n\ndelivered to your inbox Sign up for The Manila Times newsletters By signing up with an email address, I acknowledge that I have read and agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\n\nRealizing the promise of AI in business education requires embracing a human-centered approach, recognizing that AI tools should enhance human intelligence, not subvert it. When grounded in principles of social-emotional learning and authentic engagement, AI can become a powerful partner in pedagogy, enabling students to learn more efficiently, grapple with greater complexity, and develop in-demand skills for the future of work.\n\nHowever, this potential can only be unlocked if we move beyond a fixation on policing AI usage and instead empower students to wield it thoughtfully and ethically. This will require institutional policies coupled with culturally sensitive instruction attuned to the lived experiences and concerns of learners, as well as ongoing research to illuminate the evolving intersections between human and artificial intelligence in education.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMoreover, this will require time and energy from educators to engage in iterative feedback sessions that will allow both the teacher and the students to navigate this new form of learning together.\n\nBy approaching this challenge with intentionality and care, generative AI could usher in a new era of innovation in business education, where technology enhances, rather than replaces, our human capacities. As educators, we have an exciting opportunity to pioneer pedagogies that nurture students' holistic development while equipping them with the AI fluency necessary to thrive in a rapidly transforming business landscape. The future of learning is AI-assisted and human-centered, and it is our responsibility to make it a reality by emphasizing not only technical but, just as important, social-emotional learning in AI-assisted pedagogy.\n\nPatrick Adriel H.

To address potential job displacement, these organizations are retraining their workforces, enabling employees to transition into new roles created by AI advancements.\n\n\"The State of Generative AI in the Enterprise: Now Decides Next,\" is based on a global survey of nearly 2,000 director- to C-suite-level respondents. All respondents are experienced with AI and are piloting or implementing generative AI in their organizations.\n\nAbout 39% of organizations plan to increase their headcount over the next year to support their artificial intelligence initiatives and 38% are keeping their headcount unchanged, the report states. The growth is driven by the need for technical skills to develop and manage AI technologies.\n\nAbout 72% of respondents in the Deloitte report said their trust in AI within their organizations has increased since generative AI emerged in late 2022. Nearly half of respondents, or about 47%, say they are quickly integrating AI into their organizations and about 73% of organizations that already have high AI expertise are integrating AI.\n\nThese leaders still cite lack of trust as a key barrier to implementing large-scale AI adoption. There are concerns about the quality and reliability of generative AI's output, and employees are still resisting using generative AI due to lack of familiarity, potential data inaccuracies, and fear that they will lose their jobs.\n\nThe report did not state how many routine and automated jobs AI will displace. IBM plans to replace 7,800 jobs with AI and Google reportedly plans to eliminate 30,000 employees. These layoffs will affect middle-class positions in HR, finance, and sales rather than tech executives.\n\nThe findings from the Deloitte report support Forbes' reporting that even though 85 million jobs will be displaced globally over the next five years due to AI, about 97 million new jobs will be created during that same time period, according to a World Economic Forum report.\n\nThe AI revolution is already impacting college seniors applying for jobs. Employers plan to hire 5.8% fewer new graduates than they did last year, according to a spring survey of 226 employers by the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE). NACE spokesperson Mimi Collins clarified that the findings are not necessarily attributed to AI. However, it's hard to ignore the focus on reskilling and upskilling for AI-focused roles in the workplace, which likely impacts college seniors who have only had internships.\n\nOverall, the findings from the Deloitte report suggest that generative AI won't necessarily take jobs; it will redefine them and replace them with new ones. Employees need to prepare and level up their skills.\n\nDeloitte did not respond to a request for comment.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deloitte", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Deloitte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association_of_Colleges_and_Employers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Association of Colleges and Employers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_Classification_of_Economic_Activities_in_the_European_Community", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Economic_Forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Economic Forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IBM"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_class", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middle class"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layoff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Layoff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human resources"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job_Search", "label": "dmoz/Business/Employment/Job Search", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment/Employment", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/62fe40baadccff017f1dbcbd/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619220", "eventUri": "eng-9619220", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

Enterprises, however, are realizing that the path to production for AI solutions is not easy, and that building an AI-mature enterprise is a marathon, not a sprint. Our AI study has confirmed this sentiment; it has also highlighted that enterprises feel underprepared to deploy AI solutions at scale as well as to manage the profound shifts in the roles of people and ways of working resulting from such deployments.\"\n\nBusiness leaders are less certain about the path to transformation. Only 4% use AI in a way that has transformed their business and nearly a quarter (24%) haven't even moved beyond the initial exploratory phase. Top barriers to business success include current corporate IT infrastructures and customer expectations. Organizations also recognize the need to move beyond existing metrics to measure the success of AI implementations; nearly three-fourths (72%) say they don't have the right metrics. The survey also highlights the need for businesses to take a strategic approach to AI adoption and develop the right performance indicators to measure the impact of the technology on their business.\n\nSivaraman Ganesan, Head, AI.Cloud Business Unit, TCS, said, \"When calibrated for accuracy and harnessed responsibly, GenAI makes the computational power of the data, cloud, and AI come alive. Add in human ingenuity and organizations can create a new paradigm for the modern marketplace. As a result, today's enterprises will deliver new stakeholder and customer value like never before - incrementally, through assist and augment efforts, and exponentially as transformation initiatives. Our rich heritage in the business domain, engineering, consulting, services, and solutions allows us to take advantage of this new paradigm, offering a unique value proposition to all our customers and partners.\"\n\nTCS was one of the first organizations in the industry to bring together the capabilities of cloud computing and artificial intelligence under the AI.Cloud unit to cater to the emerging needs of customers. The unit drives TCS' multi-layered AI architecture to help strategize AI deployment for customers across their value chains, enable deployment and govern thereafter.\n\nThe TCS Thought Leadership Institute surveyed nearly 1,300 CEOs and other senior executives with P&L responsibilities, across 12 industries and 24 countries.

They've lost sight of a very important prerequisite -- data strategy. Successful AI requires not just lots of data but lots of high-quality data built on a well-executed data strategy.\n\nThe pressure to demonstrate capability with AI is so strong right now. According to new research by MIT Technology Review in partnership with my company, Fivetran, 82% of C-suite leaders say that scaling AI or generative AI use cases to create business value is a top priority this year.\n\nExecutives and boards are frantically looking for fast AI outcomes without considering strategy. As an example, one of our customers went to their board saying they needed some budget to build a data platform. The board said that although they didn't have money for data projects, they had unlimited funds for AI innovation. So the customer changed the proposal title, went back to the board and said, \"I need to build an AI platform.\" Not surprisingly, the board funded his project.\n\nWe can laugh about these types of stories, but they illustrate a difficult truth: many executives don't understand what makes AI work. For years, they've made the mistake of separating AI from data strategy. Executives are quickly learning that a successful data strategy is the foundation for an AI strategy.\n\nFor years, executive teams have funded and supported two different data stacks: one for analytics and one for product. Each stack had its own datasets, methodologies and mission. Typically, the analytics stack was owned by the CIO, and the product stack (which included AI/ML) was owned by the CTO. One used Databricks, and the other used Snowflake, leaving data teams scratching their heads trying to 'make AI happen' across two platforms.\n\nBut AI doesn't operate across organizational silos and independent strategies. It needs governed access to high-quality data from every part of the organization. C-suite execs are now realizing they've needed one platform, not multiple integrated platforms built for unique purposes. In this way, it's important to build around one strategy rather than integrating multiple projects.\n\nEveryone wants the latest and greatest AI/ML tech, but many organizations still struggle with everyday financial reporting. You can't do advanced, industry-leading work if you don't have the basics down.\n\nAI and ML are synergistic results of a well-executed data strategy where governance, lineage, access and data integration all work in harmony. They're not independent strategies that come together at a later date. If you have two different data stacks, you're going to be building governance twice. Using this complicated approach, you'll probably work twice as hard to make it work. Worse, you'll likely need to rebuild it all before you can jump ahead to AI. And if you don't get it right, it can be a major barrier to moving forward.\n\nI recently met with a room full of CIOs, all at different levels of data and tech maturity. I found that the ones who can truly do anything with AI are the ones who've recognized the importance of data readiness -- collecting, classifying, cleaning and making meaning out of an organization's data. Just like for business intelligence (BI) where they say \"bad data in, bad data out,\" it's even more true for AI. If your AI models or LLMs are working on top of bad data, you get bad AI results.\n\nThe less data-mature organizations are still dealing with legacy problems, fixing clunky reporting and not migrating to a modern data stack. Competing on AI capabilities can prove impossible with outdated tech.\n\nThere are no shortcuts. You can't start with AI and work your way back towards a strong data foundation. The result of a strong data foundation is high-quality, governed data. It doesn't happen by accident, nor is it a side effect of a thriving company. It's built on reliable data pipelines, a modern cloud data platform and a collaborative culture in governance.\n\nExecutives need to set the stage for technological excellence and market innovation. The winners won't be those who sidestep the prerequisites but the ones who truly understand that data strategy is a key part of business strategy. Start there and everything else will follow.\n\nForbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives.

It addresses issues of economics, identity, privacy, and the erosion of \"values\" (e.g., human creativity expressed through music). In addition to mirroring the concerns many of us have about AI in other domains and fields, the letter illustrates a flaw in the way we think about AI. In particular, identifying \"responsible\" and \"irresponsible\" uses of AI is unhelpful because it masks an underlying set of trade-offs we are making even when our use of AI is \"responsible.\"\n\nAI will change the world. As it does so, it will have varied effects on all of us. AI will define some new \"normal\" to which all of us will need to adjust. When we define certain uses of AI as irresponsible, we will tend to neglect responsible uses of AI that have negative consequences for various members of the population. Rather than considering \"responsible\" and \"irresponsible\" uses of AI, we need to decide what we are unwilling to give up regardless of the benefits AI promises to provide for some or most of us. AI's benefits are enticing, but every change involves loss. We need to seriously consider that loss.\n\nWhile we often think of technology as a means of progress, without some stable understanding of what it means to be human, we can't be sure whether we are moving forward or backward ... only that we are moving. Progress can't just mean that we have invented some new device that has a specific set of benefits. It also has to mean that we arrange our individual and collective lives to privilege ideas like human creativity (or certain expressions of it), however difficult they may be to define, because we recognize them as valuable to our humanity. So, why might we decide that we care about human creativity?\n\nFirst, we may conclude that humans are not simply consumers. Our relationships are not only transactional but storied. To some degree, we develop a relationship with those who produce the music, art, and literature we enjoy. Music, art, and literature are expressions of those who create them. As such, we encounter another human through the work they produce. We enter an interesting sort of dialogue that familiarizes us with other people who have taken the time to record their thoughts through lyrics, prose, pictures, and other media. While it is possible to enjoy a song, painting, or book without that connection, we can also point to a number of instances in which knowing something about the artist or author or the life setting which gave rise to the art produced enhances our appreciation of it. The final product is important, but the human effort and story behind the product often tie us to that product in a more intimate way (as any parent who has hung their child's drawing on the refrigerator will intuitively understand).\n\nSecond, we may come to certain convictions about what sort of effort we value and why. As someone who did a lot of art in high school and has done a lot of writing since, I tend to believe that the effort involved in such creative realms is valuable in and of itself. Could AI produce art and literature of a similar quality to humans? If it can't now, I assume it will be able to at some point in the future. The product, however, isn't the point. Instead, the point (or perhaps the thesis) is that effort ... the energies we invest, sacrifices we make, and difficulties we suffer ... forms us into a particular sort of people that a life without that effort can't. The \"product\" that AI can't replicate is not the art, literature, or lyric, but the human character forged through success and failure as we engage in our various creative endeavors.\n\nFinally, we may find that chasing our desires and interests through digital technologies has not created a situation in which we are the best version of ourselves. Can we really say that journalism in the digital age is the journalism we want? Can we really say social media has encouraged us to be the sort of people we've always wanted to be? Do we think we can get from our current state to a more desirable state by outsourcing more of ourselves to technology? Do we need to reorient our desires and interests so that the technological \"tail\" is no longer wagging the human \"dog\"? These sorts of questions point us back to something far more crucial than the \"responsible\" and \"irresponsible\" use of technology. They prompt us to question whether our goals and aims have led us to the wrong place. If so, they also prompt us to consider where we want to be and how we intend to get there.\n\nAI governance is, at best, a half-measure because it assumes that AI is inevitable. AI (and any other technology) has to be up for grabs because technology should not determine who we are as human beings. We need to consider what we are unwilling to surrender to AI and why. Human creativity and the efforts associated with its creation are not trivial. It isn't at all clear that replacing human creativity with AI creativity would be beneficial. To assert that AI will be a \"net gain\" for society, we must do more than identify its benefits. We must also account for the losses that may reduce human flourishing.\n\nAI may well serve humanity, but we will never be sure of that until we consider deeply what it means to be human.", "source": {"uri": "christianpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Christian Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_quo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Status quo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Digital audio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade-off", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trade-off"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Age", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Information Age"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Secondary school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outsourcing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Outsourcing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Human_Rights_and_Liberties", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Human Rights and Liberties", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future/Transhumanism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future/Transhumanism", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/original/thumbnail/25/98/259814.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619220", "eventUri": "eng-9619220", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

The rise of artificial intelligence technologies adds a new dimension to the strategic landscape of the South China Sea. With the advancement of AI and its integration in the dynamics of the South China sea, a critical question arises whether it is a boon or a bane for the key actors in this region.\n\nWith the application of artificial intelligence, the system of surveillance and security in the South China Sea has improved to a great extent. The deployment of Zhu Hai Yun, an autonomous drone carrier by China in the region sets an example of how AI can aid in intelligence gathering and improve situational awareness. The drone carrier has the capability to launch several unmanned vehicles. These unmanned systems provide unhindered, real-time data on vessel movements and operations, considerably enhancing the maritime security. AI driven technologies have also proved to be advantageous in monitoring the illegal fishing activities. As per Global Fishing Watch, AI algorithms examining satellite data helped in successful identification and curtailment of the illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing practices. By the benefit of AI, nations are able to safeguard their marine resources more effectively and such developments play a pivotal role in enhancing the regional stability as well. The integration of AI into the defense systems enhances the relative capability of states to better secure their areas of interest. ASEAN states such as Indonesian, Malaysia and Singapore have integrated AI to enhance their capabilities and serve their interests in the South China sea.\n\nWhere AI plays a positive role in dynamics of the South China sea, we cannot turn a blind eye towards the potential risks. AI poses major concerns, particularly in the domain of gray zone tactics. China has taken advantage of AI to improve their strategies in this regard. Making use of coast guard vessels and deployment of AI-driven maritime militia, China tactfully seeks to assert its dominance in the region without resorting to direct military conflict. Scarborough Shoal incident explicitly demonstrated the tactical benefits and potential hazards of AI. In the contested waters, Chinese coast guard vessels, featuring AI driven targeting systems made use of water cannons to block a Philippine resupply ship. This move in turn provoked a diplomatic protest from Manila. The employment of AI-guided systems in cases such as the intimidation of Philippines supply missions emphasizes the potential of AI to increase preexisting tensions erroneously. The uncertainty of gray zone tactics, coupled with AI's autonomous capabilities, may culminate miscalculations and inadvertent escalations in the region. The use of unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) operations demonstrates this vulnerability. Although such vehicles are justified for the peaceful purposes, they do create privacy concerns among states. A Chinese Sea Wing UUV was discovered by Indonesian fisherman in 2020, raising concerns over sovereignty and espionage.\n\nKeeping in view the potential benefits and hazards of AI, it is crucial for the key players in the South China Sea to adopt a balanced approach. AI has the potential to serve as a strategic deterrent in the region. Showcasing AI capabilities, the actors can deter aggression from the adversaries. Although the idea of AI deterrence seems beneficial, without proper precautions it may prove to be perilous. Unregulated utilization of AI in military domain can lead to arms race as well. In the domain of regional diplomacy, AI's role is also pivotal. States are constructing new alliances based on common security concerns and technological benefits as members of the Quad (Quadrilateral Security Dialogue) came together to enhance maritime domain awareness, demonstrating unified stance against coercive actions in the South China Sea. Such demonstrations present the larger geopolitical ramifications of AI. It has the potential to contribute in diplomatic realignments. The incorporation of AI in maritime operations also has substantial economic implications. On one hand it, it can play its part to boost trade in the region pertaining to enhanced security. On the other hand, economic instability may occur in case of weaponization of AI technologies, disrupting the trade routes. Therefore, it is imperative to strike a balance between security benefits and economic implications of AI to ensure regional stability.\n\nThe establishment of international norms for the use of AI in maritime operations is critical to avoid unintended confrontations and ensure cautious deployments. The elements of accountability, transparency and human monitoring cannot be overlooked at any cost. Also, the states should join hands to collaborate with each other in the domain of AI development and research to enhance security and stability in the region. This would also foster trust among the collaborating parties, averting the chances of conflict. With the advancement of AI comes the associated risks. Robust security measures are required to safeguard AI systems from cyberattacks, mitigating the risks of escalating tensions and damage to critical infrastructure. Strict security protocols and regular audits should be implemented to safeguard AI technologies and reduce the chances of disruption. In the complex dynamics of the South China Sea, AI is a mixed bag, neither an unequivocal boon nor a straightforward bane. The integration of AI into broader strategic frameworks determines its potential consequences. It depends largely on the decisive actions of the regional powers to manage its dual edged potential.

It is already a factor in many online industries, such as online gaming. But is AI a good thing for online bettors?\n\nThe growing role of AI in online gambling has many pros and cons. Keep reading to learn more about the advantages and disadvantages of AI's role in online gambling.\n\nPros of AI in Online Gambling\n\nThe potential advantages of AI are seemingly endless. Each advancement brings new possibilities for casinos and players alike. Here are five advantages that already exist because of AI's role in online gambling.\n\nImproved Graphics and Gameplay\n\nGraphics and gameplay features can make or break your experience in online gambling. Both have vastly improved since online gambling first became available in the 1990s. Thanks to AI, the features and graphics of your favorite casino games could take another step forward.\n\nTable games do not rely as heavily on flashy graphics. The latest slot machines, on the other hand, have a lot of competition. Utilizing state-of-the-art graphics can help set the latest games apart from the other options.\n\nFeatures such as a game's return to player (RTP) and payout rate should still be your priority over graphics. However, games with better graphics can be more enjoyable to play. Ai can also be used to improve in-game features, such as bonus rounds.\n\nPersonalized Recommendations\n\nAnother advantage of using AI to improve online gambling options is the potential for personalized recommendations. There are thousands of casino games available online, and it is impossible to try them all. Chances are, you are going to miss out on great games that you would enjoy playing.\n\nThe use of AI could help limit the number of great games that you do not get to play. Casinos can use AI to curate personalized recommendations for players. Analyzing player trends and the tendencies of a specific player can help the casino create more accurate recommendations.\n\nOf course, you will be limited to the games at that casinos. So, it is still important to use the latest slot apps on iPhone and Android devices that have large gaming selections.\n\nPromote Responsible Gaming\n\nOne of the concerns about the increase in the availability of online gambling options is the effect it will have on people with a gambling addiction. When used correctly, AI can help limit the negative impact of the growth of online gambling.\n\nCasinos can use AI software to track and analyze player trends and behaviors. Players who are flagged as high risk can be given access to resources to prevent problem gambling. AI tools can intervene quickly to provide at-risk gamblers with the assistance they need.\n\nIt will still be up to the player in question to accept the help. However, using AI to identify players who are most at-risk can help casinos limit the potential damage of having casino games so widely available.\n\nIncreased Customer Service Options\n\nCasinos can also use improved AI software to help members in other ways. For instance, AI has an increasingly prominent role in customer service options for casinos. AI chatbots are preferred by some users, and they can be available 24/7 to help customers troubleshoot common issues.\n\nNo AI is advanced enough to help customers with every problem they can encounter. However, current AI chatbots can help customers address frequently asked questions. They can also help free up human customer service agents, so they are available when a player has a serious issue.\n\nAs chatbots continue to improve, they will be able to offer even better service to customers. Customer support is an often overlooked factor when choosing a casino, and using AI can help casinos get ahead of their competition.\n\nFraud Detection\n\nA fifth advantage of casinos using AI software is the potential for improved fraud detection. As I mentioned above, AI can track player tendencies and behaviors. It can flag suspicious behaviors and alert the casino to potential fraud.\n\nSimply put, AI can analyze data in real time faster than humans can. It can identify hacking attempts, fraud, and other suspicious activities early. The sooner a casino is aware of these activities, the quicker it can stop them.\n\nPreventing fraud helps to protect the casino and the other customers who use the site. Improved security features that utilize AI will help keep players and the casino safe.\n\nDisadvantages of AI in Online Gambling\n\nAs you can see, the increasing role of AI in online gambling has many potential advantages. Unfortunately, for every pro of AI in online gaming, there is a con. Here are five concerns related to the use of AI in modern online gambling.\n\nPotential to Deceive Bettors\n\nAI can be used to break down player trends and predict the future of the industry. However, there is no guarantee that these predictions will be correct. There is also no way to prevent a casino from using AI to deceive its customers.\n\nSports bettors are especially at risk of being deceived by AI, but casino gamblers need to be aware of this risk as well. An operator cannot manipulate the odds of casino games like they can sports wagers. However, it can used to take advantage of inexperienced or unaware gamblers.\n\nSome casinos have even started using AI to help facilitate their live dealer games. While this can be beneficial, it can also deprive players of the experience of having a human dealer run the game.\n\nNegative Impact of Biased Algorithms\n\nAnother factor to consider is that the algorithms used to operate AI software are not perfect. They are based on data from previous events and can be biased. Biased AI is typically not as helpful to players as AI that uses unbiased algorithms.\n\nA biased AI program can reinforce existing biases and can even inadvertently create new ones. Outdated software can also create problems for gamblers. For instance, a chatbot using outdated or incorrect information can severely impact your customer service experience.\n\nThis issue should be minimized as AI continues to improve. In the meantime, though, players should be aware of AI's limitations and not rely on it too much.\n\nCollection of Player Data and Other Privacy Concerns\n\nCasinos can use AI to collect and analyze player data, trends, and more. On one hand, this can assist the casino in improving the experience it offers to its members. However, there are potential disadvantages to using AI this way.\n\nFirst and foremost, some players may not want their data collected and analyzed. Sadly, this may be happening without your knowledge beforehand.\n\nAnother major concern is the potential for an information leak. AI can collect and analyze data, but hackers could also steal it. Casinos that do not implement proper security measures can risk all of their players' data.\n\nImpact of Targeted Advertisements and Recommendations\n\nAI will likely play a major role in marketing casino games to online players in the future. It can analyze trends and player behaviors to make personalized recommendations. This can be great for most players, but it can also put at-risk players at an even bigger disadvantage.\n\nPlayers who are struggling with problem gambling have enough on their plate already. Personalized recommendations and targeted advertisements will make it that much more challenging to avoid gambling.\n\nIt is only a matter of time before some casinos start to use AI to target vulnerable gamblers. On the bright side, some casinos have programs players can sign up for to limit the amount of gambling they are allowed to do. However, this is not an industry standard, and until it is, players with a gambling addiction are at risk.\n\nEthical Concerns of AI in Online Gambling\n\nLast but not least, a fifth potential con of online casinos using AI is the wide range of ethical issues it presents. As I mentioned above, casinos can use AI software to create ads and promotions tailored to vulnerable gamblers. There are many other ethical issues to consider as well.\n\nFor instance, the lack of oversight for AI in general creates plenty of opportunities for players to be taken advantage of. Until such standards are in place, players need to be cautious of how casinos use their AI software. Other ethical concerns include the potential misuse of collected player data and the lack of transparency with AI software.\n\nIs AI Good for the Future of Online Gambling?\n\nAI has grown by leaps and bounds in recent years, and it is become an increasingly important part of online businesses. Online casinos are no exception, as the gambling industry has already found a variety of uses for AI technology. But is AI good for the future of online gambling?\n\nAs with any technology, there are pros and cons to using AI in online gambling. Check out the list above to learn more about the benefits and drawbacks of the use of AI by casinos. In general, though, the advantages of AI seem to outweigh the risks, and improving AI technology will only help online casinos continue to grow.", "source": {"uri": "technology.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "Technology Org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_casino", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Online casino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Online gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casino", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Casino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Problem gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Online game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slot_machine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slot machine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gameplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gameplay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Casinos", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Casinos", "wgt": 38}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Guides", "wgt": 41}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Equipment", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://www.technology.org/texorgwp/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/casinobot-720x411.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619220", "eventUri": "eng-9619220", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

A robust AI strategy will evaluate the proposed AI technology sources and use cases, and the identity and materiality to the company of the AI output. It is also important that the approach aligns with the company's overall IP objectives. Below are a few key considerations.\n\nTechnology background and building blocks\n\nContrary to what popular culture and mass media in recent years might lead us to conclude, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been a focus of academic interest and research for decades, reaching back to at least 1950 when Alan Turing more formally asked \"Can machines think?\".[1] In 1956, John McCarthy is said to have coined the term \"artificial intelligence\" at a conference or workshop.[2] Over the years that followed, computing power and storage have advanced, becoming more widely available and cost-effective. As a result, commercial and even consumer AI applications are now more common.\n\nAt a high level, it can help to distinguish generative from non-generative AI. Generative AI typically produces new content in response to a user's written query, e.g., outputting an image, music or text resembling a creative work. In contrast, non-generative AI typically produces an answer or insight based on analysis of a query data submission, e.g., whether or not the cells seen in a radiology image are cancerous.\n\nDrilling down into the technology involved in a non-generative AI platform, primary elements often include (i) training data used to create an AI model, (ii) software used to both analyze training data and create the model and later use such model to analyze query data to provide an output, and (iii) the AI model created using such training data and software. Further iterations and additional models are also possible, and data annotation and fine-tuning of software is often required. As a technical matter, each of the three elements above might be internally developed or sourced, obtained from a third party, or a hybrid of the two (e.g., a combination or customization of the foregoing). The following are a few elements to bear in mind in considering such alternatives as part of an overall IP strategy.\n\nPlatform or output use and materiality\n\nIn scenarios where the company intends to distribute or otherwise commercialize or allow third parties to use the AI platform it is implementing or developing, or parts thereof, there are several considerations that may be key while being less central in other scenarios. For example, it is often important in this case to analyze the expected scope of company's ownership, exclusive rights and other proprietary rights relating to the AI software, training data and models. Copyrights in software and potentially in data, database rights, patents and trade secrets may all be implicated. Applicable laws may depend on the locations of the various parties or sources of technology. Of note for companies that are experienced with patents but less so with copyrights, the required contribution to rise to the level of authorship or joint authorship under applicable copyright law can vary and depend on the facts, and is different from that required for inventorship or joint inventorship under patent law. As a result, having appropriate written agreements in place with parties that participate in or otherwise contribute to the company's AI development, implementation or use are often important sources of some certainty as to the company's rights. In addition, the terms and conditions of any licenses, terms of use or other agreements that apply to any third party components of the AI platform can also be material factors in the company's rights.\n\nIn other situations, including where the company will use the AI platform internally and leverage the output as part of its overall R&D activities, the identity and materiality of the specific output in relation to the company's own IP portfolio and proprietary asset development should be considered. As further context, it is worth noting that the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued guidance earlier this year on patentability and inventorship for AI-assisted inventions and the U.S. Copyright Office is expected to issue a report in the coming months analyzing the impact of AI on copyright and making recommendations about legislative or regulatory action in light of its prior position that U.S. copyright protection should not extend to AI-generated works.

There's another side to this coin, however, that is getting less attention: the benefits that AI can bring to both society and the fight against climate change.\n\nAt Salesforce, we're driven by a mission to reduce emissions, accelerate climate solutions and advance a more inclusive world. And we believe that with proper guardrails and ethical development, AI can help us reach those goals. In this article, I'll offer a behind-the-scenes look at how we're navigating more responsible AI and how other technology companies can follow suit.\n\nSustainability is one of our core company values and a guiding principle for how we develop and deploy AI, and it's something all companies should keep in mind. Our approach to reducing the impact of AI is built around three strategies: optimizing models, employing efficient hardware and prioritizing low-carbon data centers.\n\n* Optimizing Models: We believe in the efficacy of smaller, domain-specific models tailored to their intended applications. Our CodeGen 2.5 model, for instance, lets users create code with natural language, working just as well as models twice its size.\n\n* Efficient Hardware: It's important to leverage the most efficient hardware available to reduce AI's emissions.\n\n* Low-Carbon Data Centers: Data center emissions vary based on the local electricity's fossil fuel content. We prioritize deploying AI in low-carbon data center regions while advocating for the installation of new renewable energy.\n\nAs technologists, we must also follow best practices to reduce carbon emissions associated with software development. These include things like identifying and shutting down underused systems, moving storage to more energy-efficient options and developing software code that uses less energy.\n\nLastly, we need to get faster and better at tracking our climate impact, which involves simplifying reporting processes. If you're not investing in an emissions-tracking solution, I'd recommend starting with a clear climate action plan as your first step. This plan should serve as your north star, aligning your goals with sustainability commitments.\n\nNext, conduct a thorough audit of your company's energy usage across all operations to identify areas where efficiencies can be improved. Prioritizing the use of renewable energy sources for operations can significantly reduce carbon emissions.\n\nLastly, collaborating with suppliers to collect emissions data associated with the production and transportation of goods and services can provide a more comprehensive understanding of your company's carbon footprint.\n\nReducing global emissions and limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0 C requires urgent innovation and investment. With private companies adding to public sector investments, AI can be a catalyst to help curtail emissions and enhance resilience.\n\nAt Salesforce, we're investing in innovative companies using AI to help the planet. Take PanoAI, for example, which deploys technology that can scan for and identify new, severe wildfires using next-generation camera hardware and AI-enabled software before they spread. With this AI technology, first responder deployment times can be cut down, allowing them to fight smaller blazes.\n\nIn navigating these partnerships, I've learned the importance of aligning not just on strategic priorities but core values. Foundational to our investments are the scalability and effectiveness of these solutions in addressing specific climate challenges. But on top of that, when it comes to partnerships, you need to ensure that your mission, how you operate and your core values are a match. It's critical to foster transparent communication and collaboration with partners to ensure shared objectives are maximized.\n\nUltimately, by leveraging AI investments thoughtfully and strategically, tech leaders can extend their own mission and drive positive change for people and the planet.\n\nAI can benefit people and the planet, but only if everyone is given the opportunity to participate. We must ensure that the benefits of generative AI are universal for all of society and the planet.\n\nOne practical approach is to make sustainability core to the business. Make it a value, define it in your business plan and allocate resources as you would any other segment of the business. You can take this commitment further with policy advocacy and philanthropic initiatives.\n\nFor instance, we introduced our Sustainable AI Policy Principles, a framework for AI regulation, to help minimize environmental impact and foresting climate innovation. This has guided our support for legislation like the Transformational AI to Modernize the Economy, aimed at promoting the adoption and implementation of AI to better predict and respond to extreme weather.\n\nAdditionally, through philanthropic grants, we are leading initiatives like an accelerator, AI for Impact, which focuses on climate action and education for AI literacy. The accelerator supports purpose-driven organizations in developing AI solutions to address climate change, including mitigation, adaptation and resilience and finance.\n\nAs a technology company, we know that our intentions and actions help shape AI's impact on the world. As we navigate this journey, we are committed to upholding a dual commitment: to our planet and to global communities. Together, we can build a legacy of responsible AI innovation for generations to come.\n\nForbes Business Development Council is an invitation-only community for sales and biz dev executives.

What's more, the rise of powerful open-source AI models has accelerated the deployment of AI to solve tough business and societal challenges.\n\n\"Although there could be concentration risk in the hardware and cloud infrastructure space, as we move into actual use cases, a thousand flowers will bloom,\" he said.\n\nHe said gains from automation must lead to talent redeployment in new areas with new opportunities.\n\n\"We must learn from applying AI to ourselves, be it in creating an AI-first enterprise or in accelerating the massive talent amplification that's now needed,\" he said.\n\nChange will have to be embraced -- not resisted, he added.

However, the country lags behind its Asia-Pacific counterparts in embracing AI for both business and consumer transactions. While challenges such as infrastructure limitations and data privacy concerns persist, the economic benefits that AI can bring cannot be overlooked.\n\nAccording to a recent report by Access Partnership, a global technology public policy firm, the Philippines stands to gain a staggering P2.8 trillion annually in economic benefits by 2030 if businesses in the country adopt AI-powered products and solutions. These benefits include increased revenue through better customer targeting in the retail sector and cost savings in logistics, among other areas. AI has the potential to revolutionize multiple industries, including retail, hospitality, manufacturing, financial services, professional services, and more. (Read the BusinessMirror story -- Report: \"PHL could get P2.8T in economic benefits from AI,\" May 30, 2024).\n\nContrary to popular belief, AI is not solely a threat to jobs. Access Partnership's research highlights that AI can actually help level up the workforce and address digital talent shortages. The key lies in upskilling the existing workforce and providing job skills to individuals who are currently outside the workforce. By equipping our workers with the right digital skills, AI can improve productivity and bridge the digital skills gap. In fact, the report estimates that narrowing this gap through training could add P809 billion to the country's annual GDP in 2030.\n\nAccess Partnership's study examined various sectors in the Philippines, identifying over 60 use cases and more than 200 AI-related technologies that could contribute to the country's economic growth. The research focused specifically on Generative AI, and the estimated economic benefits derived from this subset alone are already substantial. However, it is important to note that this estimate represents only a fraction of the potential impact, as there are many more discoveries to be made and the broader subsector of Machine Learning is expected to yield even greater benefits.\n\nIt is crucial for policymakers to embrace AI technology and address current infrastructure limitations. The potential economic gains are significant, and AI can be a powerful tool to enhance productivity and unleash the country's full potential.\n\nTo fully harness the benefits of AI, collaboration among government, industry, and educational institutions is vital. The government should create an enabling environment by investing in infrastructure development, ensuring data privacy regulations are in place, and promoting digital skills training programs. Industry leaders should embrace AI as a transformative force and invest in research and development to drive innovation. Moreover, educational institutions must adapt their curricula to equip the workforce with the necessary digital skills.\n\nBy embracing AI and addressing the challenges that come with it, the country can unlock substantial economic benefits and create new job opportunities. But this is not just about adopting AI; it's about investing in a future where Filipinos are empowered to thrive in a digitally driven world. The potential is immense, and the Philippines is poised to reap significant economic benefits from the adoption of AI across various sectors.", "source": {"uri": "businessmirror.com.ph", "dataType": "news", "title": "BusinessMirror"}, "authors": [{"uri": "businessmirror_editorial@businessmirror.com.ph", "name": "BusinessMirror Editorial", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Philippines"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_and_medium-sized_enterprises", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Small and medium-sized enterprises"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Public policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia-Pacific", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asia-Pacific"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sustainability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Logistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Information privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BusinessMirror", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BusinessMirror"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Professional services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospitality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hospitality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gross domestic product"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Economic growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_services", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Financial services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Curriculum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Research and development"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Economics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Economics", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Compensation_and_Benefits", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Compensation and Benefits", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://businessmirror.com.ph/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Column-box-Editorial.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619220", "eventUri": "eng-9619220", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

Multinational corporations, like Microsoft, are the vectors, setting up shop in the capital and whipping corporate London into a frenzy over neural networks, natural language processing, and machine learning.\n\nTech execs are racing to roll out AI as fast as possible. But they are trying to run before they can walk. If they don't invest in the required talent and training first, then London's tech sector will haemorrhage capital as rushed transformations, malfunctioning tech, and shaky consumer confidence rock firms.\n\nThis knee-jerk reaction from execs is understandable. Since ChatGPT leapt onto the scene, every tech firm is part of the AI arms race - whether they like it or not. And the pressure to keep up, whether it's from investors, consumers, or the market at large, is acute.\n\nThis AI hype virus is highly infectious and dangerous, and even the most prominent players aren't immune. Google has been under significant pressure from investors and shareholders due to the perception that it lagged behind rivals in the AI race.\n\nLast week, to catch its rivals, Google rolled out its AI search function to millions of users. The result was widespread ridicule as the AI recommended eating at least one small rock per day, adding glue to pizza to help the cheese stick, and using gasoline with Italian spices to create a \"Fiery Fuel Spaghetti\" dish..\n\nThe pressure to compete can cause even the most prominent firms to misstep. So, London's tech execs should proceed with caution. If they want to build a sustainable, long-term AI ecosystem that drives value for their companies and ensures that the city's tech sector stays at the head of the European pack, then they need to lay solid foundations.\n\nThis has to mean investing now in talent and training and then spending on the actual AI technology further down the line.\n\nWithout the right talent behind the technology, firms are setting themselves up for wasted expenditure and PR disasters. These are highly complicated systems, and to avoid high-profile teething errors, execs need to fork out on AI talent and training.\n\nSpecialists can be brought in externally. For firms flush with cash, this is the fastest and most efficient way of keeping up in the race. But the talent crunch for these scientists is white hot, with firms offering million-dollar compensation packages and accelerated stock-vesting schemes.\n\nStartups, unless they're pumped up to the gills with VC cash, will likely be outgunned here. But they don't have to hire leading AI engineers - they can train the top AI talent of tomorrow instead. This is the best way to carve out space in the increasingly saturated AI market.\n\nFirms should employ a skills-first approach instead of assessments based on whether candidates have past AI experience. A candidate's ability to un-learn and re-learn is far more important than their knowledge about today's AI landscape.\n\nA diversity of graduates is also essential - not just those from science and tech backgrounds. For example, graduates with a background in arts and humanities will begin to play a more significant role in digital transformation as they can offer solutions about the ethics of AI implementation, AI governance, and AI business analysis.\n\nIt's far more beneficial to invest in this talent than the latest AI systems. AI is morphing and shifting at a breakneck pace. Today's tech will soon be yesterday's. However, a team with years of comprehensive training behind them will be able to roll with these changes, implementing new technology and adapting to shifting regulatory frameworks.\n\nLondon's tech scene is right to be excited about AI. But leaders need to tread carefully. Swirling media hype and free-flowing VC cash can lead to knee-jerk reactions.

You see thousands of ads every day, making it impossible to focus and pay attention,\" Loktionova aptly observed.\n\nAt the Reflect Festival, where CAPSBOLD served as the creative marketing partner, Loktionova shared insights into how the agency navigated this complex terrain.\n\n\"It was an exciting journey preparing for the event with the Reflect team. We are real doers and love what we do. As we say in CAPSBOLD, be SEEN, be BOLD,\" she said.\n\nLoktionova explained that on average, individuals are exposed to between 6,000 and 10,000 ads daily. The human brain, overwhelmed by such a barrage, often ignores or forgets most of these ads within seconds.\n\nThis phenomenon underscores the importance of the attention economy, where success hinges on one's ability to capture and sustain attention.\n\nAI emerges as a game-changer in this context. According to Forbes, \"Top-performing companies are more than twice as likely to be using AI for marketing.\"\n\nThe digital advertising industry, bolstered by AI, is projected to generate \u20ac175 billion annually by 2032, as per Bloomberg Intelligence. CAPSBOLD's innovative use of AI is a testament to this trend.\n\n\"When we launched CAPSBOLD in Cyprus, we used many contemporary marketing tools. One that stands out is CGI videos or 3D reels, which capture attention and evoke emotions,\" Loktionova explained.\n\nThe concept of hyper-personalisation is at the forefront of AI-driven marketing. Brands like Airbnb and Porsche have successfully employed AI to tailor their messages to individual preferences, significantly boosting engagement. Airbnb, for instance, uses AI to send personalised emails, encouraging customers to complete bookings or profiles. This strategy has markedly increased user interaction and conversions.\n\nIn a similar vein, Porsche has captivated millions on Instagram and TikTok through AI-driven content and virtual influencers. This not only enhances brand visibility but also forges a deeper connection with the audience. In China alone, the industry's sales volume is expected to triple from \u20ac860 million in 2021 to \u20ac2.8 billion in 2023, showcasing the tremendous potential of AI in marketing.\n\nAI also provides invaluable data-driven insights. Nike, for example, uses AI to analyse customer data, creating personalised marketing campaigns that have led to a 23 per cent increase in click-through rates and a 15 per cent increase in conversion rates.\n\nTools like Junbi.ai and Expoze.io are revolutionising content creation and optimisation. Junbi.ai offers real-time insights into YouTube ad performance, while Expoze.io predicts the attention-grabbing potential of creative assets, allowing marketers to make data-informed adjustments.\n\nFurthermore, AI's role in automation cannot be overstated. Loktionova encourages embracing AI, stating, \"We shouldn't be afraid of AI coming into our lives because we are humans, we have our heart and brain, it's our power\".\n\n\"We just need to be on the wave of AI trends, follow them, and try them in our business,\" she added.\n\nThis sentiment reflects a broader industry movement towards integrating AI into everyday marketing practices.\n\nThe future promises even more opportunities with AI. New professions such as AI Trainers, AI Writers, and AI Content Creators are emerging, responding to the growing demand for AI expertise.\n\nConsultancy giant Accenture, for instance, has announced a \u20ac2.7 billion investment in AI, doubling its talent pool from 40,000 to 80,000 to meet this rising demand.\n\nCAPSBOLD exemplifies this innovative spirit. As a global creative marketing agency, they pride themselves on challenging conventional norms and crafting new eras in brand storytelling.\n\nWith over 400 specialists across more than ten time zones, CAPSBOLD offers a wide array of services, including market analysis, competitor research, audience insights, and effective Go-to-Market strategies.\n\nTheir impressive portfolio includes high-profile clients like Reflect Festival and BEONIX, showcasing their capability to deliver impactful marketing campaigns and the unique \"CAPSBOLD effect\" that grabs audience attention and loyalty.\n\nLeveraging AI and modern tools in marketing is essential in today's attention economy. CAPSBOLD's innovative approach, as highlighted by Loktionova, exemplifies how businesses can capture and sustain audience attention through AI.\n\nBy staying ahead of AI trends and integrating these tools into their strategies, businesses can not only attract but also maintain their audience's attention, driving growth and fostering innovation in an increasingly competitive market.", "source":

To Mastercard, the answer is 'both' | Tech...", "body": "Mastercard's operations CTO discusses the company's data principles, global contact center outlay, and its rubric for building vs. buying AI -- and not just the generative kind.\n\nEnterprise IT organizations have so many questions about whether to build or buy AI tools that create content, manage workflows, search and summarize, monitor network activity for security purposes, find sales and marketing opportunities ... the list goes on and on. Calculating the costs of customizing a ready-made tool vs. coding it yourself becomes a difficult, multivariate math problem IT has to solve with the finance team.\n\nGeorge Maddaloni, executive vice president and CTO of operations at Mastercard, is in such a position. Mastercard has built some of its own fintech AI to power its massive global B2B financial transaction network that covers 800 different products in 186 countries and 73 languages; other tech is bought. We discussed with Maddaloni how Mastercard makes these decisions -- and what large enterprise customers like his want to see from their cloud vendors.\n\nTalk about the AI project Mastercard built to support its customer experience.\n\nGeorge Maddaloni: Mastercard is a big network provider. We serve B2B customers, banks, financial institutions. Through those customers, we also serve consumers around the world. So, we deal with tons of calls from end consumers that we handle on behalf of our customers.\n\nThe application of AI in this tool was around routing of these requests -- how we deal with them in the myriad ways they hit us. As they come through various different channels, how do we get them routed to the right places, and therefore make our contact centers much more effective? We built a routing engine, enabled by AI, which would enable us to get things to the right place and eliminate a lot of time that it would take for us to sort through handling inquiries. It gives back time to the customer to get an answer or solve an issue.\n\nSo it's more rules-based and machine learning AI than generative AI.\n\nMaddaloni: Generative AI was incorporated for language interpretation, because we're dealing with emails in some cases -- and we had to deal with multiple languages. There was a rules element, and an AI model that was enabling those rules to be applied. And then mapping all that into a contact center that has both new and legacy components. We actually patented this in terms of the application of both generative AI techniques and [other] AI techniques and applying it into an existing contact center infrastructure.\n\nDescribe the scale of your contact center operations.\n\nMaddaloni: We have part in the United States, and part in Asia. Whenever you have the scale of a Mastercard, technology is going to be in a state of \"modernization as you go.\" So, there are a lot of different components depending on which service and which call center handles it.\n\nWhat did your tech vendors not have that kept you on the build-not-buy path?\n\nMaddaloni: Every business will have its own nuances in terms of what they need to do with technology. We certainly still buy a lot of the capability off the shelf, no doubt. But the types of challenges and the types of inquiries we get are B2C -- in some cases, we get the B2B. Creating something that could interoperate between those really helps route [service] cases.\n\nWe have a certain number of languages we have to support -- and we have this kind of language to the business, in terms of credit cards, debit cards, the kinds of transactions, sometimes loyalty program requests we get.\n\nI would expect when you talk to anyone, they would say, \"Yeah, we'd like to use these technologies and string them together.\"\n\nBut their actual application -- especially when it comes to AI -- we need to have control over ... especially when you're dealing with a customer. You need that context, and there's just no way you're going to buy the context out of the box.\n\nYou patented this process. Is Mastercard going into the software business?\n\nMaddaloni: We do patents around the business all the time to just make sure we're protecting the technology that we currently have. We've had a decades-long history of developing working with technology. Protecting our intellectual property is key. So, we've got a long-standing patent program. We're pleased that we were able to put an application in for this one as well, and we'll see what comes of it.\n\nWhat do AI technology vendors need to develop to help B2B companies solve their customer service cases, which are less straightforward than B2C?\n\nMaddaloni: You're right, about the complexity of what we're trying to solve in the the B2B market. Hence figuring out how to route calls and error requests are key. How do you apply the language of the business into how cases can be handled -- because it becomes less about this customer and their transactional request at the time, and more about how you are handling a case and the complexity associated with that business. And you need that context and information to be able to feed it back into the problem you're solving or the request you're going to fulfill.\n\nWill generative AI make it easier for these more complex B2B questions to be solved with automation?\n\nMaddaloni: I think that generative part of it is really around getting the language piece right, and the applicability -- how do I incorporate that into a product of some kind.\n\nSo we used generative capabilities in a product we launched separately from the contact center called Decision Intelligence Pro, which goes after fraud prevention. Fraud prevention has always been AI-enabled, but we've been able to use generative AI techniques and the neural network to bring down the time it takes for us to detect fraud -- and detect more cases -- we build into the [fraud] scoring service we offer our [banking and financial services] customers.\n\nSo that's an example where we can begin to build products with generative AI techniques and make a service or product more effective.\n\nWhat advice do you have for enterprises evaluating AI right now -- so they don't buy something they will regret later?\n\nMaddaloni: I think the way we've approached technology decisions is to make sure that we keep it in a layered approach. To manage all these calls, you need a contact center platform, you need a case management platform, you need those capabilities. As we thought about the use of AI in that context, we didn't fully lock into one particular AI platform for an extended period of time. We have our data layer, we have our call routing layer, and certainly our AI approach on top of it, so it's really making sure we have this way to approach our architecture in order to avoid kind of an [AI vendor] lock-in that we were not able to move out of very easily.\n\nThe other important thing we've that we've thought about from an AI perspective is using our Data & Tech Responsibility Principles in any new technology that we're bringing forward. One of the key principles is customer data privacy -- rules that we have to adhere to and make sure that we're fulfilling all of those obligations as well as eliminating bias in any of the data that we're consuming. All the data principles are key, especially those two.\n\nIn regard to generative AI, what do you want from tech vendors that you haven't seen yet?\n\nMaddaloni: It's getting better and better over time. We've seen the results where vendors have their AI capabilities scored against benchmark tests and they're improving them over time. So certainly performance is one thing. And No. 2 is controls -- making sure that we've got the ability to apply our data boundaries and data lineage techniques. As we run a global business, that is extremely important.\n\nSo, while we talk to a lot of vendors about what they might want to do with a subscription for a data SaaS model, we really push hard on those data principles we have an obligation to fulfill to our customers. We make sure that they're incorporating them. Most of them are very willing to listen to us and take that on board. And they're getting the same types of requests from other customers as well.\n\nThis Q&A was edited for clarity and brevity.", "source": {"uri": "techtarget.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechTarget"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastercard", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mastercard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_technology_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief technology officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business-to-business", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Business-to-business"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_centre", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Call centre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Patent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maddaloni", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Maddaloni"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maddaloni"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fintech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fintech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Workflow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_transaction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial transaction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_experience", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Customer experience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_institution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial institution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Retail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interoperability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interoperability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Customer_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Customer Management", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Natural_Language", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Natural Language", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/rms/onlineimages/money_g177553082.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619220", "eventUri": "eng-9619220", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

This strategic alliance is revolutionizing the way we work, driving unprecedented efficiency and granting businesses the competitive edge they need to thrive in today's market.\n\nIn a recent survey of global IT professionals we sponsored, business leaders cited artificial intelligence and cloud transformation as two of the main areas deserving of increased spend in 2024. This speaks not only to the potential transformative power of AI, but also the degree to which it is intertwined with the continued evolution of cloud strategies.\n\nAs organizations continue to prioritize AI and cloud, here are some key best practices and trends they should keep in mind:\n\nCloud computing serves as a gateway to AI, enabling companies of all sizes to remotely access sophisticated AI models and scale their computing resources as needed. By offering scalable infrastructure, the cloud allows organizations to seamlessly expand their operations, efficiently manage resources, optimize costs and maintain agility. But effective data management strategies are essential to ensure that the vast datasets that underlie AI are being efficiently stored, accessed, and analyzed.\n\nRelated:How AI is Transforming Cloud Computing\n\nAbsent a comprehensive cloud strategy, companies wishing to realize the full benefits of AI will always fall short. The ability to process large amounts of data in real-time, make informed decisions, and act quickly based on actionable AI insights are all highly cloud dependent. Moreover, the cloud allows companies to experiment with different AI models and rethink or reject projects that are proving infeasible, while accelerating successful initiatives without significant up-front investment.\n\nIn addition to providing a comprehensive environment for building, training, and implementing AI models at scale, the cloud gives organizations the infrastructure necessary to manage projects efficiently, as well as a self-sustaining ecosystem that continuously advances technology. By fostering easier collaboration among teams and geographies, it also allows organizations to tap into a global talent pool and leverage diverse perspectives, which can lead to innovative solutions and improved decision-making.\n\nWithout AI- and cloud-powered process optimization, businesses face rising operational costs and inefficiencies. Failing to invest in AI could also mean missing out on insights and opportunities, ranging from predictive analytics to personalized services to customer behavior insights to new revenue streams.\n\nRelated:Tapping AI to Alleviate Cloud Spend\n\nMoreover, as the regulatory landscape surrounding data usage and AI ethics continues to evolve, it's crucial for companies to stay ahead of emerging regulations and ensure that their AI initiatives are compliant. The cloud plays an important role here, helping organizations maintain a better handle on their data and helping them respond more quickly and efficiently to shifts in the regulatory environment and customer expectations.\n\nFor companies lagging behind in their AI and cloud journeys, there are a few steps they can take immediately to begin to catch up to more nimble peers:\n\nRelated:The AI Skills Gap and How to Address It", "source": {"uri": "informationweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "InformationWeek"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Evolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scalability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethics of artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_analytics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Predictive analytics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mathematical optimization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Natural_Language", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Natural Language", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt69509c9116440be8/blt88330e14376d94c1/6647af479cfdb81a2bd7be34/cloudAI-Chroma_Craft_Media_Group-alamy.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619220", "eventUri": "eng-9619220", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.6549019607843136, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

This decision follows rapid advances in generative AI that have made it possible for anyone with a smartphone to immediately make photorealistic images for free, through Meta's own Meta AI platform.\n\nOver the past few weeks, people on Instagram and Threads have begun to notice images they posted were being tagged as \"Made with AI\". In some cases, they're not happy about it. One viral post on Threads was from photographer Matt Seuss who shared a photo that he took of Utah's spectacular Mesa Arch which had been labelled on Instagram and Threads as made with AI. Acknowledging that he used Adobe Photoshop's generative AI feature to \"remove a small distracting dust flare\", Seuss took umbrage at the label: \"Photo was made with camera and slightly edited with AI -- big difference from made with AI,\" he replied to one user.\n\nMeta's platforms and other online communities like r/Instagram are littered with photographers and other artists who dispute that the label should be added to their work. In some but not all cases, they've used Photoshop's AI tools. Another Reddit thread has users claiming that their 3D product renderings have been tagged, too.\n\nWhile the \"Made with AI\" tag doesn't mean that a post is removed or penalised in Meta's algorithms, some have argued that it undermines their work because it suggests the entire image is AI-generated or fake. \"The AI label undermines the photographer, suggesting they have somehow contrived the image by using a controversial generative AI program like Midjourney,\" wrote online photography publication PetaPixel's Matt Growcoot.\n\nMeta did not answer questions by deadline about how it detects and applies the tag on its platforms. But tests by users and PetaPixel suggest that Meta's systems use an image's metadata, which is the details embedded into a file like a digital equivalent of writing the date on the back of a physical photo. When Photoshop's generative AI tools like generative fill -- which lets users select an area of an image to replace with AI generated graphics using their prompt -- were used, even to a miniscule amount, the file is tagged as \"Made with AI\" when uploaded.\n\nOne of the reasons that applying the \"Made with AI\" tag to these types of images has chafed photographers is because the scheme has significant holes that still allows people to post significantly edited or even AI-generated images without being branded with what one user deemed the \"scarlet letter\".\n\nOther Photoshop features which can significantly edit an image do not trigger the tag, including the \"content aware fill\" which fills in a selected section of an image using an algorithm to match the rest of the image. Nor does uploading images from well-known image generation services including OpenAI's DALL-E and Midjourney, even if they are obviously fake to the eye. In fact, all it takes to avoid the tag is wiping the metadata -- which can be done as easily as screenshotting and uploading an image. Simply put, Meta's AI detection is exceedingly easy to sidestep.\n\nTech creator Tyler Stalman experimented by posting a photo of a streetscape with a sign edited out using Photoshop's generative AI fill, and then the same photo with cartoonish monsters and a burning truck added and the metadata removed. Meta tagged the former as \"made with AI\" and not the latter.\n\nThe confusion and angst over how this label is being rolled out has its roots in thorny questions about the definitions of photographs, AI and reality. The distinction between Photoshop's AI tools and its not-generative-AI but still algorithmic features is a fine and technical one; both tools use automation to edit an image in a photorealistic way. Similarly, modern smartphones use computational photography -- algorithmic changes to the image -- when capturing something.\n\nPlus, while the average person may assume a \"Made with AI\" label suggests the image doesn't reflect reality, it's another question altogether as to whether they would consider a photograph as fake if it had been edited with AI tools to remove a blur or to brighten colours.\n\nRMIT senior lecturer in visual communication and digital media Dr T.J. Thomson is grateful that Meta has taken some steps to improve transparency and context around images, but is worried that Meta's \"one-size-fits-all\" approach may do more harm than good.\n\nHe would like to see more specific labels that might show which parts of an image have been edited or how it was edited. But even this wouldn't solve the problem: \"Machines won't be able to guess intent so whether an edit is innocuous or meant to mislead or deceive will still require critical thinking skills and media literacy knowledge,\" Thomson said in an email.", "source": {"uri": "crikey.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Crikey"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cam_wilson@crikey.com.au", "name": "Cam Wilson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Photoshop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Photography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meta AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photorealism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photorealism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metadata"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graffiti", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graffiti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_phenomenon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viral phenomenon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midjourney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midjourney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_community", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Online community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "3D computer graphics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reddit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DALL-E", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DALL-E"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_literacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Media literacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_communication", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Visual communication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Digital media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Images", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Images", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Methods_and_Techniques/Imaging_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Methods and Techniques/Imaging Science", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.crikey.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/matt-suess-photo.jpg?quality=70", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619220", "eventUri": "eng-9619220", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

Kevin Stitt and a Google executive said the goal is to help Oklahoma's workforce learn how to use AI to be more efficient in their day-to-day tasks, such as drafting emails, creating presentations, brainstorming ideas, and others. They said the Sooner State is one of the first in the nation to be offered the tools without cost.\n\nThe enrollment site for the new program can be found at https://oklahoma.gov/omes/learnai.html.\n\nStitt said the AI initiative aligns with his effort to build a workforce ready for the future.\n\n\"We're always trying to get career techs and we're trying to train and get people reengaged in the workforce, especially when people think that maybe the workforce is passing by with technology,\" he said. \"It's exciting to see Google investing in this type of thing.\"\n\nMore: To drive Oklahoma's economy, leaders must embrace responsible artificial intelligence\n\nStitt said the AI tools would help state agencies be more efficient, create smaller government, help people with their jobs and provide more service to Oklahomans. He said he has had every state agency identify an AI expert to champion the technology across state government. In his weekly presser on Friday, he said he'd talk to the IT team to see if a chief artificial intelligence officer was needed.\n\n\"Technology is truly reshaping every aspect of our lives right now, and our workforce has to adapt to this transition,\" he said.\n\nAndrew Silvestri, head of community engagement for Google, said the growth potential for AI was enormous. He said AI isn't intended to replace jobs, but rather to complement them and make them more efficient and effective on a daily basis.\n\nMore: Oklahoma schools, universities incorporate AI as state grapples with emerging technology\n\nOklahomans also can participate in the Google certificate program, \"Grow with Google,\" established in 2022, said John Suter, Oklahoma's secretary of operations and government efficiency.\n\nThat program offers online self-paced learning and the opportunity to earn a certificate in digital marketing and e-commerce, data analytics, UX design, project management, IT support, cyber security and IT automation with coding program Python. The program also helps with interviews, career counseling and job boards and wraparound support. Adult citizens and state employees are eligible to enroll. State employees simply need supervisor approval to participate, Google officials said.\n\nSuter said more than 16,000 jobs were posted in Oklahoma that require specialized skills such as IT support, cybersecurity and user experience (UX) design. Without rapid reskilling or upskilling, those jobs will continue to go unfilled, he said. So far, 85% of Google certificate graduates in Oklahoma report they secured gainful employment, he added.\n\nSpeaking at the program announcement was a three-time Google Certificate graduate, Tayvon Lewis, a senior analyst at Aetna, part of CVS Health. Lewis said he used the AI skills he learned to become a music producer and developed a website ranked No. 1 by Google for the hottest beats online. He said one of his instrumentals was used in an episode of \"Law and Order.\"\n\n\"This experience highlighted how essential these skills are for the future success of the next generation, and it made me realize these skills could also empower those who are most vulnerable in our communities,\" Lewis said.\n\nAI and Oklahoma's workforce development initiative\n\nBy executive order in 2023, Stitt created a Task Force on Emerging Technologies, which was given three months to study the \"responsible deployment\" of AI and Generative AI.\n\nArtificial intelligence refers to computer programs trained to do complex actions that usually require human brain power, according to Google. It can summarize notes, analyze spreadsheets, create presentations among other tasks.\n\nOne of the task force's directives was determining how to educate, train and teaching current and future workers how to use AI skills, the governor said.\n\nThe 11-person task force produced a report in December that outlined six areas where AI could be beneficial and which industries might be best suited for AI use, including public administration, health care, transportation, environment and energy, public engagement, infrastructure maintenance and economic growth.\n\nIt also outlined responsible use of AI, including respect for human rights, accountability and public participation and oversight, noting that \"agencies that use AI technologies must be able to explain decisions and processes undertaken by AI systems.\"\n\nThe report advised creating a role of chief artificial intelligence officer, who would be responsible for overseeing the state's use of AI, promoting AI innovation and managing risks.\n\nMore: Google all in on AI and Gemini: How it will affect your Google searches\n\nIn January, Stitt announced final recommendations from the task force and said Oklahoma could be the AI capital of the nation if it takes full advantage of the technology.\n\n\"AI also has the potential to help us steward taxpayer dollars in a more responsible way by cutting redundant positions and replacing some positions with AI technology,\" the governor said. \"In Oklahoma, 21% of the workforce is employed by federal, state or local governments while the ideal percentage would be closer to 13%. Artificial intelligence creates possibilities for more efficient employment and government services.\"\n\nBeyond the introductory \"Grow with Google\" program, the company also offers an online course called \"Google Essentials,\" which offers training on conversational AI tools, text-to-image generators, prompt engineering and other productivity improving tools, officials said. The cost of the course is $49 and requires no degree or experience, they said.", "source": {"uri": "eu.oklahoman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Oklahoman"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Stitt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Stitt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_governments_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State governments of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstorming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brainstorming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_support", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Technical support"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CVS_Health", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CVS Health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aetna", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aetna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerging_technologies", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emerging technologies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience_design", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "User experience design"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-commerce", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "E-commerce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "User experience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Python (programming language)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Analytics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Digital marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Project management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-to-image_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Text-to-image model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prompt engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Executive order (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Gemini", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Project Gemini"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Associations", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/05/30/NOKL/73912088007-ai-5.jpg?auto=webp&crop=4755,2676,x0,y247&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619220", "eventUri": "eng-9619220", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-30", "textStart": 273, "textEnd": 279}], "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

What was once a technologic parlour trick is now a strategic imperative, for both larger firms in possession of the necessary resources to support the adoption of AI workflows and smaller firms seeking a competitive edge.\n\nThis resonates with my own observations, as I've witnessed the AI-cautious become committed users, once they realise how AI can bring a level of efficiency and speed to design workflows that unlocks new realms of creative expression.\n\nVisualisation quality is always top of mind at Chaos, so a particularly important finding was that over two-thirds of the survey's respondents expressed satisfaction with the quality of AI-generated renderings compared with traditional methods.\n\nThis resounding affirmation of AI visualisation quality underscores both the meteoric rise in the quality of AI renders and the growing confidence users have in AI's ability to produce visually compelling representations of architectural designs.\n\nAs AI continues to refine its capabilities and algorithms to match the already high visual quality with better fidelity to the designer's intent, architects will increasingly embrace AI as a reliable tool for creating high-quality renders that meet or exceed the standards set by traditional methods.\n\nFurthermore, the survey revealed a significant level of comfort among respondents when it came to incorporating AI-generated design solutions into their own projects.\n\nAn impressive 70% expressed comfort with leveraging AI-generated solutions, indicating a prevailing sense of trust and acceptance of AI in the design process.\n\nThis level of comfort suggests that architects recognise the value and efficiency of AI-driven tools in enhancing design workflows and achieving project objectives.\n\nThese statistics also indicate clients are receptive to paying for work created via AI and comfortable with AI outputs incorporated into the designs themselves.\n\nNavigating the terrain of AI integration is not without its challenges.\n\nAmid the fervour of adoption, a gap is becoming increasingly evident between those with and without formal training in the use of AI.\n\nOnly 60% of respondents shared that they had received any formal training, indicating a critical need for accessible training programmes tailored to the needs of the architectural community.\n\nBridging this knowledge gap for the 40% without training will empower them with the skills and knowledge to harness AI and stay competitive in this technologically dynamic environment.\n\nDespite these challenges, it is impossible not to be swept up in the transformative impact of AI.\n\nAI is already demonstrating it has the power to completely revolutionise the architectural workflow, whether it be generating visuals based on text prompts or enhancing render quality at the click of a button.\n\nThese two examples may seem simple, but they replace hours of labour, offering architectural firms newfound levels of efficiency, which can directly translate to cost savings and more time for design exploration.\n\nInterestingly, the survey reveals a correlation between firm size and comfort level with AI-assisted design.\n\nSmall and large firms - those with fewer than 20 employees, or 100 or more - were found to be more likely to express being \"very comfortable\" with AI-assisted design compared with medium-sized firms with 20-99 employees.\n\nThis correlation suggests that firm size may influence risks and rewards calculus of AI adoption.\n\nSmall firms may feel compelled to embrace AI technology to remain competitive or gain a strategic advantage, while large firms have the resources to research, learn and become comfortable with AI tools over time.\n\nConversely, medium-sized firms exhibit a more risk-averse stance, preferring to maintain existing workflows to meet client expectations and preserve budgetary constraints.\n\nThis cautious approach reflects a broader trend of measured adoption and highlights the diverse attitudes and strategies employed when navigating AI integration.\n\nOne point of contention revolves around concerns over AI's impact on jobs within the AEC sector. The survey reveals a near-even split in sentiment, with 52% of respondents expressing varying degrees of concern and 48% adopting a more neutral stance.\n\nInterestingly, when delving deeper, it becomes apparent that opinions on this topic are nuanced, with only 17% and 18%, respectively expressing that they are \"very\" or \"not at all\" concerned, but within those two cohorts, a majority of each are currently using AI in architectural work, indicating a stark difference in opinion among those who are striving to understand AI's capabilities first-hand, versus those who are not.\n\nThe report's findings paint a compelling picture of AI's pervasiveness both today and tomorrow, with 78% of respondents predicting that AI will strongly or moderately influence architectural design within the next year.\n\nThis collective foresight underscores AI's evolution from novelty to a cornerstone of architectural practice. As an early adopter and advocate for AI integration, I share in this conviction and envision a future where AI is seamlessly woven into the fabric of architectural workflows.\n\nYet, as AI's role expands, ethical considerations loom on the horizon. The concerns about job displacement, intellectual property rights and transparency are all valid and demand our attention.\n\nCollectively, software providers and the architectural community must navigate these uncharted ethical waters with diligence and foresight.\n\nA robust framework of ethical guidelines, as advocated by 74% of respondents, is essential to safeguarding the integrity of our profession.\n\nThe survey findings paint a picture for AI in architecture characterised by both promise and uncertainty. AI's potential to revolutionise architectural practice is undeniable, but the diversity of opinions and concerns captured in the survey underscore the importance of ongoing dialogue, collaboration and ethical reflection.\n\nWith a mindset of openness, inquiry and responsibility, architects and software developers can harness the transformative power of AI while navigating its complexities, ensuring that AI integration enhances - not hinders - the integrity and creativity of architectural practice for generations to come.", "source": {"uri": "pbctoday.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Planning, BIM & Construction Today"}, "authors": [{"uri": "emily_potts@pbctoday.co.uk", "name": "Emily Potts", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chaos theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Workflow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Imperative programming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "3D computer graphics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Correlation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidelity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fidelity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Horizon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Calculus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intellectual property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Loom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Textile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Evolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Architecture/Education", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Architecture/Education", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Architecture/History", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Architecture/History", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://www.pbctoday.co.uk/news/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/architizer-report-image-4-690\u0445380.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619220", "eventUri": "eng-9619220", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

Who's grading the AI?", "body": "Schools nationwide are banning OpenAI's ChatGPT. Here's what experts say about the future of artificial intelligence in education.\n\nA growing number of California kids are having their writing graded by software instead of a teacher.\n\nSchool districts are signing more contracts for artificial intelligence tools, from automated grading in San Diego to chatbots in central California, Los Angeles, and the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nEnglish teachers say AI tools can help them grade papers faster, get students more feedback, and improve their learning experience. But guidelines are vague and adoption by teachers and districts is spotty.\n\nThe California Department of Education can't tell you which schools use AI or how much they pay for it. The state doesn't track AI use by school districts, said Katherine Goyette, computer science coordinator for the California Department of Education.\n\nWhile Goyette said chatbots are the most common form of AI she's encountered in schools, more and more California teachers are using AI tools to help grade student work. That's consistent with surveys that have found teachers use AI as often if not more than students, news that contrasts sharply with headlines about fears of students cheating with AI.\n\nTeachers use AI to do things like personalize reading material, create lesson plans, and other tasks in order to save time and and reduce burnout. A report issued last fall in response to an AI executive order by Gov. Gavin Newsom mentions opportunities to use AI for tutoring, summarization, and personalized content generation, but also labels education a risky use case. Generative AI tools have been known to create convincing but inaccurate answers to questions, and use toxic language or imagery laden with racism or sexism.\n\nCalifornia issued guidance for how educators should use the technology last fall, one of seven states to do so. It encourages critical analysis of text and imagery created by AI models and conversations between teachers and students about what amounts to ethical or appropriate use of AI in the classroom.\n\nBut no specific mention is made of how teachers should treat AI that grades assignments. Additionally, the California education code states that guidance from the state is \"merely exemplary, and that compliance with the guidelines is not mandatory.\"\n\nGoyette said she's waiting to see if the California Legislature passes Senate Bill 1288, which would require state Superintendent Tony Thurmond to create an AI working group to issue further guidance to local school districts on how to safely use AI. Cosponsored by Thurmond, the bill also calls for an assessment of the current state of AI in education and for the identification of forms of AI that can harm students and educators by 2026.\n\nNobody tracks what AI tools school districts are adopting or the policy they use to enforce standards, said Alix Gallagher, head of strategic partnerships at the Policy Analysis for California Education center at Stanford University. Since the state does not track curriculum that school districts adopt or software in use, it would be highly unusual for them to track AI contracts, she said.\n\nAmid AI hype, Gallagher thinks people can lose sight of the fact that the technology is just a tool and it will only be as good or problematic as the decisions of the humans using that tool, which is why she repeatedly urges investments in helping teachers understand AI tools and how to be thoughtful about their use and making space for communities are given voice about how to best meet their kid's needs.\n\n\"Some people will probably make some pretty bad decisions that are not in the best interests of kids, and some other people might find ways to use maybe even the same tools to enrich student experiences,\" she said.\n\nTeachers use AI to grade English papers\n\nLast summer, Jen Roberts, an English teacher at Point Loma High School in San Diego, went to a training session to learn how to use Writable, an AI tool that automates grading writing assignments and gives students feedback powered by OpenAI. For the past school year, Roberts used Writable and other AI tools in the classroom, and she said it's been the best year yet of nearly three decades of teaching. Roberts said it has made her students better writers, not because AI did the writing for them, but because automated feedback can tell her students faster than she can how to improve, which in turn allows her to hand out more writing assignments.\n\n\"At this point last year, a lot of students were still struggling to write a paragraph, let alone an essay with evidence and claims and reasoning and explanation and elaboration and all of that,\" Roberts said. \"This year, they're just getting there faster.\"\n\nRoberts feels Writable is \"very accurate\" when grading her students of average aptitude. But, she said, there's a downside: It sometimes assigns high-performing students lower grades than merited and struggling students higher grades. She said she routinely checks answers when the AI grades assignments, but only checks the feedback it gives students occasionally.\n\n\"In actual practicality, I do not look at the feedback it gives every single student,\" she said. \"That's just not a great use of my time. But I do a lot of spot checking and I see what's going on and if I see a student that I'm worried about get feedback, (I'm like) 'Let me go look at what his feedback is and then go talk to him about that.'\"\n\nAlex Rainey teaches English to fourth graders at Chico Country Day School in northern California. She used GPT-4, a language model made by OpenAI which costs $20 a month, to grade papers and provide feedback. After uploading her grading rubric and examples of her written feedback, she used AI to grade assignments about animal defense mechanisms, allowing GPT-4 to analyze students' grammar and sentence structure while she focused on assessing creativity.\n\n\"I feel like the feedback it gave was very similar to how I grade my kids, like my brain was tapped into it,\" she said.\n\nLike Roberts she found that it saves time, transforming work that took hours into less than an hour, but also found that sometimes GPT-4 is a tougher grader than she is. She agrees that quicker feedback and the ability to dole out more writing assignments produces better writers. A teacher can assign more writing before delivering feedback but \"then kids have nothing to grow from.\"\n\nRainey said her experience grading with GPT-4 left her in agreement with Roberts, that more feedback and writing more often produces better writers. She feels strongly that teachers still need to oversee grading and feedback by AI, \"but I think it's amazing. I couldn't go backwards now.\"\n\nThe cost of using AI in the classroom\n\nContracts involving artificial intelligence can be lucrative.\n\nTo launch a chatbot named Ed, Los Angeles Unified School District signed a $6.2 million contract for two years with the option of renewing for three additional years. Magic School AI is used by educators in Los Angeles and costs $100 per teacher per year.\n\nDespite repeated calls and emails over the span of roughly a month, Writable and the San Diego Unified School District declined to share pricing details with CalMatters. A district spokesperson said teachers got access to Writeable through a contract with Houghton Mifflin Harcourt for English language learners.\n\nQuillBot is an AI-powered writing tool for students in grades 4-12 made by the company Quill. Quill says its tool is currently used at 1,000 schools in California and has more than 13,000 student and educator users in San Diego alone. An annual Quill Premium subscription costs $80 per teacher or $1800 per school.\n\nQuillBot does not generate writing for students like ChatGPT or grade writing assignments, but gives students feedback on their writing. Quill is a nonprofit that's raised $20 million from groups like Google's charitable foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation over the past 10 years.\n\nEven if a teacher or district wants to shell out for an AI tool, guidance for safe and responsible use is still getting worked out.\n\nGovernments are placing high-risk labels on forms of AI with the power to make critical decisions about whether a person gets a job or rents an apartment or receives government benefits. California Federation of Teachers President Jeff Freitas said he hasn't considered whether AI for grading is moderate or high risk, but \"it definitely is a risk to use for grading.\"\n\nThe California Federation of Teachers is a union with 120,000 members. Freitas told CalMatters he's concerned about AI having a number of consequences in the classroom. He's worried administrators may use it to justify increasing classroom sizes or adding to teacher workloads; he's worried about climate change and the amount of energy needed to train and deploy AI models' he's worried about protecting students' privacy, and he's worried about automation bias.\n\nRegulators around the world wrestling with AI praise approaches where it is used to augment human decisionmaking instead of replacing it. But it's difficult for laws to account for automation bias and humans becoming placing too much trust in machines.\n\nThe American Federation of Teachers created an AI working group in October 2023 to propose guidance on how educators should use the technology or talk about it in collective bargaining contract negotiations. Freitas said those guidelines are due out in the coming weeks.\n\n\"We're trying to provide guidelines for educators to not solely rely on (AI), he said. \"It should be used as a tool, and you should not lose your critical analysis of what it's producing for you.\"\n\nState AI guidelines for teachers\n\nGoyette, the computer science coordinator for the education department, helped create state AI guidelines and speaks to county offices of education for in-person training on AI for educators. She also helped create an online AI training series for educators. She said the most popular online course is about workflow and efficiency, which shows teachers how to automate lesson planning and grading.\n\n\"Teachers have an incredibly important and tough job, and what's most important is that they're building relationships with their students,\" she said. \"There's decades of research that speaks to the power of that, so if they can save time on mundane tasks so that they can spend more time with their students, that's a win.\"\n\nAlex Kotran, chief executive of an education nonprofit that's supported by Google and OpenAI, said they found that it's hard to design a language model to predictably match how a teacher grades papers.\n\nHe spoke with teachers willing to accept a model that's accurate 80% of the time in order to reap the reward of time saved, but he thinks it's probably safe to say that a student or parent would want to make sure an AI model used for grading is even more accurate.\n\nKotran of the AI Education Project thinks it makes sense for school districts to adopt a policy that says teachers should be wary any time they use AI tools that can have disparate effects on student's lives.\n\nEven with such a policy, teachers can still fall victim to trusting AI without question. And even if the state kept track of AI used by school districts, there's still the possibility that teachers will purchase technology for use on their personal computers.\n\nKotran said he routinely speaks with educators across the U.S. and is not aware of any systematic studies to verify the effectiveness and consistency of AI for grading English papers.\n\nWhen teachers can't tell if they're cheating\n\nRoberts, the Point Loma High School teacher, describes herself as pro technology.\n\nShe regularly writes and speaks about AI. Her experiences have led her to the opinion that grading with AI is what's best for her students, but she didn't arrive at that conclusion easily.\n\nAt first she questioned whether using AI for grading and feedback could hurt her understanding of her students. Today she views using AI like the cross-country coach who rides alongside student athletes in a golf cart, like an aid that helps her assist her students better.\n\nRoberts says the average high school English teacher in her district has roughly 180 students. Grading and feedback can take between five to 10 minutes per assignment she says, so between teaching, meetings, and other duties, it can take two to three weeks to get feedback back into the hands of students unless a teacher decides to give up large chunks of their weekends. With AI, it takes Roberts a day or two.\n\nUltimately she concluded that \"if my students are growing as writers, then I don't think I'm cheating.\" She says AI reduces her fatigue, giving her more time to focus on struggling students and giving them more detailed feedback.\n\n\"My job is to make sure you grow, and that you're a healthy, happy, literate adult by the time you graduate from high school, and I will use any tool that helps me do that, and I'm not going to get hung up on the moral aspects of that,\" she said. \"My job is not to spend every Saturday reading essays. Way too many English teachers work way too many hours a week because they are grading students the old-fashioned way.\"\n\nRoberts also thinks AI might be a less biased grader in some instances than human teachers who can adjust their grading for students sometimes to give them the benefit of the doubt or be punitive if they were particularly annoying in class recently.\n\nShe isn't worried about students cheating with AI, a concern she characterizes as a moral panic. She points to a Stanford University study released last fall which found that students cheated just as much before the advent of ChatGPT as they did a year after the release of the AI.\n\nGoyette said she understands why students question whether some AI use by teachers is like cheating. Education department AI guidelines encourage teachers and students to use the technology more. What's essential, Goyette said, is that teachers discuss what ethical use of AI looks like in their classroom, and convey that -- like using a calculator in math class -- using AI is accepted or encouraged for some assignments and not others.\n\nFor the last assignment of the year, Robers has one final experiment to run: Edit an essay written entirely by AI. But they must change at least 50% of the text, make it 25% longer, write their own thesis, and add quotes from classroom reading material. The idea, she said, is to prepare them for a future where AI writes the first draft and humans edit the results to fit their needs.\n\n\"It used to be you weren't allowed to bring a calculator into the SATs and now you're supposed to bring your calculator so things change,\" she said. \"It's just moral panic. Things change and people freak out and that's what's happening.\"", "source": {"uri": "desertsun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Desert Sun"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

She said she routinely checks answers when the AI grades assignments, but only checks the feedback it gives students occasionally.\n\n\"In actual practicality, I do not look at the feedback it gives every single student,\" she said. \"That's just not a great use of my time. But I do a lot of spot checking and I see what's going on and if I see a student that I'm worried about get feedback, (I'm like) 'Let me go look at what his feedback is and then go talk to him about that.'\"\n\nAlex Rainey teaches English to fourth graders at Chico Country Day School in northern California. She used GPT-4, a language model made by OpenAI which costs $20 a month, to grade papers and provide feedback. After uploading her grading rubric and examples of her written feedback, she used AI to grade assignments about animal defense mechanisms, allowing GPT-4 to analyze students' grammar and sentence structure while she focused on assessing creativity.\n\n\"I feel like the feedback it gave was very similar to how I grade my kids, like my brain was tapped into it,\" she said.\n\nLike Roberts she found that it saves time, transforming work that took hours into less than an hour, but also found that sometimes GPT-4 is a tougher grader than she is. She agrees that quicker feedback and the ability to dole out more writing assignments produces better writers. A teacher can assign more writing before delivering feedback but \"then kids have nothing to grow from.\"\n\nRainey said her experience grading with GPT-4 left her in agreement with Roberts, that more feedback and writing more often produces better writers. She feels strongly that teachers still need to oversee grading and feedback by AI, \"but I think it's amazing. I couldn't go backwards now.\"\n\nContracts involving artificial intelligence can be lucrative.\n\nTo launch a chatbot named Ed, Los Angeles Unified School District signed a $6.2 million contract for two years with the option of renewing for three additional years. Magic School AI is used by educators in Los Angeles and costs $100 per teacher per year.\n\nDespite repeated calls and emails over the span of roughly a month, Writable and the San Diego Unified School District declined to share pricing details with CalMatters. A district spokesperson said teachers got access to Writeable through a contract with Houghton Mifflin Harcourt for English language learners.\n\nQuillBot is an AI-powered writing tool for students in grades 4-12 made by the company Quill. Quill says its tool is currently used at 1,000 schools in California and has more than 13,000 student and educator users in San Diego alone. An annual Quill Premium subscription costs $80 per teacher or $1800 per school.\n\nQuillBot does not generate writing for students like ChatGPT or grade writing assignments, but gives students feedback on their writing. Quill is a nonprofit that's raised $20 million from groups like Google's charitable foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation over the past 10 years.\n\nEven if a teacher or district wants to shell out for an AI tool, guidance for safe and responsible use is still getting worked out.\n\nGovernments are placing high-risk labels on forms of AI with the power to make critical decisions about whether a person gets a job or rents an apartment or receives government benefits. California Federation of Teachers President Jeff Freitas said he hasn't considered whether AI for grading is moderate or high risk, but \"it definitely is a risk to use for grading.\"\n\nThe California Federation of Teachers is a union with 120,000 members. Freitas told CalMatters he's concerned about AI having a number of consequences in the classroom. He's worried administrators may use it to justify increasing classroom sizes or adding to teacher workloads; he's worried about climate change and the amount of energy needed to train and deploy AI models' he's worried about protecting students' privacy, and he's worried about automation bias.\n\nRegulators around the world wrestling with AI praise approaches where it is used to augment human decisionmaking instead of replacing it. But it's difficult for laws to account for automation bias and humans becoming placing too much trust in machines.\n\nThe American Federation of Teachers created an AI working group in October 2023 to propose guidance on how educators should use the technology or talk about it in collective bargaining contract negotiations. Freitas said those guidelines are due out in the coming weeks.\n\n\"We're trying to provide guidelines for educators to not solely rely on (AI), he said. \"It should be used as a tool, and you should not lose your critical analysis of what it's producing for you.\"\n\nGoyette, the computer science coordinator for the education department, helped create state AI guidelines and speaks to county offices of education for in-person training on AI for educators. She also helped create an online AI training series for educators. She said the most popular online course is about workflow and efficiency, which shows teachers how to automate lesson planning and grading.\n\n\"Teachers have an incredibly important and tough job, and what's most important is that they're building relationships with their students,\" she said. \"There's decades of research that speaks to the power of that, so if they can save time on mundane tasks so that they can spend more time with their students, that's a win.\"\n\nAlex Kotran, chief executive of an education nonprofit that's supported by Google and OpenAI, said they found that it's hard to design a language model to predictably match how a teacher grades papers.\n\nHe spoke with teachers willing to accept a model that's accurate 80% of the time in order to reap the reward of time saved, but he thinks it's probably safe to say that a student or parent would want to make sure an AI model used for grading is even more accurate.\n\nKotran of the AI Education Project thinks it makes sense for school districts to adopt a policy that says teachers should be wary any time they use AI tools that can have disparate effects on student's lives.\n\nEven with such a policy, teachers can still fall victim to trusting AI without question. And even if the state kept track of AI used by school districts, there's still the possibi\n\nlity that teachers will purchase technology for use on their personal computers.\n\nKotran said he routinely speaks with educators across the U.S. and is not aware of any systematic studies to verify the effectiveness and consistency of AI for grading English papers.\n\nWhen teachers can't tell if they're cheating\n\nRoberts, the Point Loma High School teacher, describes herself as pro technology.\n\nShe regularly writes and speaks about AI. Her experiences have led her to the opinion that grading with AI is what's best for her students, but she didn't arrive at that conclusion easily.\n\nAt first she questioned whether using AI for grading and feedback could hurt her understanding of her students. Today she views using AI like the cross-country coach who rides alongside student athletes in a golf cart, like an aid that helps her assist her students better.\n\nRoberts says the average high school English teacher in her district has roughly 180 students. Grading and feedback can take between five to 10 minutes per assignment she says, so between teaching, meetings, and other duties, it can take two to three weeks to get feedback back into the hands of students unless a teacher decides to give up large chunks of their weekends. With AI, it takes Roberts a day or two.\n\nUltimately she concluded that \"if my students are growing as writers, then I don't think I'm cheating.\" She says AI reduces her fatigue, giving her more time to focus on struggling students and giving them more detailed feedback.\n\n\"My job is to make sure you grow, and that you're a healthy, happy, literate adult by the time you graduate from high school, and I will use any tool that helps me do that, and I'm not going to get hung up on the moral aspects of that,\" she said. \"My job is not to spend every Saturday reading essays. Way too many English teachers work way too many hours a week because they are grading students the old-fashioned way.\"\n\nRoberts also thinks AI might be a less biased grader in some instances than human teachers who can adjust their grading for students sometimes to give them the benefit of the doubt or be punitive if they were particularly annoying in class recently.\n\nShe isn't worried about students cheating with AI, a concern she characterizes as a moral panic. She points to a Stanford University study released last fall which found that students cheated just as much before the advent of ChatGPT as they did a year after the release of the AI.\n\nGoyette said she understands why students question whether some AI use by teachers is like cheating. Education department AI guidelines encourage teachers and students to use the technology more. What's essential, Goyette said, is that teachers discuss what ethical use of AI looks like in their classroom, and convey that -- like using a calculator in math class -- using AI is accepted or encouraged for some assignments and not others.\n\nFor the last assignment of the year, Robers has one final experiment to run: Edit an essay written entirely by AI. But they must change at least 50% of the text, make it 25% longer, write their own thesis, and add quotes from classroom reading material. The idea, she said, is to prepare them for a future where AI writes the first draft and humans edit the results to fit their needs.\n\n\"It used to be you weren't allowed to bring a calculator into the SATs and now you're supposed to bring your calculator so things change,\" she said. \"It's just moral panic. Things change and people freak out and that's what's happening.\"", "source": {"uri": "laist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LAist"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

CEOs of leading companies are now talking about it like it's full-speed-ahead. How it's going to change our world. So, which is it? I believe, like AI has always been, the answer is both.\n\nTo better understand the growth potential of artificial intelligence, we must pull the camera back to get a wider and deeper historical view of this ever-changing technology.\n\nAI has been with us for decades. It has grown in peaks and valleys over time. This past year and a half, AI has exploded with growth. Perhaps more than ever.\n\nThat means investors and executives may have thought this triggered growth on a new and higher level.\n\nWhile that could happen, it is also quite possible this past year's growth wave could simply mean more of the same, but at a higher level. Over decades, AI has grown in peaks and valleys, but it has grown.\n\nWhile we never know what is coming next, the truth is AI is here to stay. It will continue to grow moving forward.\n\nToday, AI is stronger and faster and can do more than ever before. That will continue. That being said, we should prepare for the pace of AI growth to continue to fluctuate.\n\nThe real question we should be asking is not whether AI will continue. Of course it will. The real question is, will the current rapid pace of growth continue?\n\nI believe AI is with us to stay. However, I also believe that based on past performance, we can expect hotter times and cooler times ahead.\n\nCompanies should not take their foot off the accelerator, for investment purposes.\n\nThis is what I shared on the T.D. Ameritrade Network and Schwab Network TV show recently.\n\nLet me share an example with you. IBM Watson was introduced to the public a little more than a decade ago on the TV game show Jeopardy. They had been working on it for many years leading up to that point.\n\nIn the years that followed, Watson growth was astounding.\n\nA few years later, around 2016, at the pinnacle of their evolution they held the IBM World of Watson event in Las Vegas. It was huge and impressive event with industry leaders, politicians and more.\n\nLike this past year, we thought IBM Watson was here to stay. It was curious how they didn't really discuss how Watson was AI. I guess they wanted to lead the space with their own brand name.\n\nHowever, over the next few years Watson fell out of synch with the marketplace. IBM ultimately sold off portions to other companies. It looked like Watson was yesterday.\n\nNow, IBM seems to be reviving Watson. We will see what happens next. Will they recapture their past glory or will it continue to struggle.\n\nRemember, AI is an ongoing process that has been with us for decades. Sometimes it grows faster than others, but artificial intelligence keeps moving forward.\n\nThe challenge is staying with the ever changing and always moving growth wave.\n\nEvery company needs to stay with the ever-changing AI growth wave. The choice is either stay with the changing growth curve or create your own.\n\nThe alternative is the wave will move forward leading you behind in the dust.\n\nRules every successful company need to follow to become or remain successful could be as simple as these.\n\nWhile there is much more, I hope you get the point I am making here.\n\nOver the decades, I have been a vocal leader in the ever-changing AI, wireless, telecom and technology space. I have discussed the changing industry. Helped companies with important ideas to be seen and heard.\n\nThat being said, in my opinion, the bottom line to the question asked to start this column is simple. AI growth ebbs and flows over time. And I believe it always will.\n\nThere will be years of explosive growth and excitement like this past year. There will also be other years which are quieter and more stable.\n\nThat's why I am invited to speak at various meetings to bring the audience up to speed on AI and how it will continue to transform everything over time. To advise senior executives how to stay with the current state of change.\n\nThe noise and chaos of the AI industry is loud and ever changing. That is a challenge to every company.\n\nTo be successful in the long run, every company must be seen and heard in this noisy marketplace. They need to break though the noise level. Otherwise, they risk being invisible.\n\nThey must stay with the moving growth curve, even as the industry continues to grow and change.\n\nThere will always be hits and misses. You want to stay on the winning side of the equation.\n\nSome companies will last longer in AI leadership than others. This process will continue.\n\nJust know AI is not going away.

Like eras before it, the AI era has come to change the way people view their environment. It has come to improve the dynamics of different world sectors and provide proper solutions to decades-long problems.\n\nAI is helping entrepreneurs and corporations grow their businesses at an exponential rate. A recent survey showed that 85% of companies believe generative AI has proven effective at improving customer experience, boosting productivity, and growing profits. The survey also highlighted the fact that organizational application of generative AI was up by over 250% from the last decade. As a business manager, this is proof that the adaptation of artificial intelligence is the most innovative means of being competitive in today's business ecosystem.\n\nBenefits Of Integrating Generative AI To Business\n\nHere are some of the benefits of integrating generative AI into your business:\n\nCustomers Experience\n\nMaintaining good customer relations is one of the oldest tricks of building and sustaining a reputable company. Customers are the lifeline of your organization. This is why you must treat them with great respect and ensure that their needs are met to the best of your ability. To achieve these goals, putting in place infrastructures that will facilitate good customer experience is important.\n\nWith the evolving digital landscape of the business space, customers would love online interactions with your business. These interactions need to be personalized, engaging, and easily accessible 24/7. As a business manager, the best way to offer this experience to customers is by integrating chatbot GPT and assistance in your business. If programmed properly, these chatbots will provide tailored answers to basic and complex customer inquiries regarding your business.\n\nData Analytics\n\nFor every organization to grow, the need to understand customers and market dynamics is important. This is because the customers are the metrics that determine the performance and profitability of any business. To understand the customers, business owners need data that shows the behavioral patterns and dynamics of the market. In the eyes of managers, these data are just numbers and words. Reacting to this problem, generative AI was introduced to give a breakdown analysis of any form of data. It has helped in simplifying information for business managers which, in turn, has eased the process of decision making. When a manager uses generative AI, data is broken down and presented in the form of simplified numbers, words, pie charts, bar charts, images, and, in some cases, videos.\n\nMarketing\n\nGenerative AI has become a game changer in the marketing industry. Its impact can be felt in the manner in which the marketing of big and small businesses have become more personalized over time. This personalized advertising has improved the efficiency of marketers in turning prospects into high-end loyal customers. According to business experts, generative AI is the most effective and efficient marketing tool of the 21st century.\n\nAny organization looking to expand beyond its reach must employ this technology in its day-to-day operations. When it comes to designing logos or rebranding, GPT image generator is the best generative AI tool on the market. With this AI image generator, entrepreneurs can design and create logos and brands that tell the story of their business. These logos and designs will form the foundation of their marketing strategy because it's relatable and creates a good first impression for customers.\n\nCost Effective\n\nCutting costs while improving profit margins is the goal of any ambitious organization. This goal has proven difficult to achieve by managers because it's not always easy to know when, how, and where to strike the right balance in the production and supply chain. With the help of AI, managers can effectively strike this balance and improve their company's financial stability and profitability.\n\nThe way generative AI improves financial stability is by removing bureaucratic bottlenecks that hinders the free flow of information within the organizational structure. Time is money and anything within an organization that takes up time be it composing emails, writing receipts, taking inventory, or analyzing data is a threat to profitability. To improve time management and reduce operational costs, its imperative generative AI tools are utilized in every business department. These tools make business management easy and efficient. In the area of production, AI plays a crucial role in ensuring businesses work smarter. With AI being smarter than humans, organizations can increase the involvement of artificial intelligence to improve business productivity.\n\nBusiness Scalability\n\nUsing generative AI tools saves businesses the stress and resources of planning for business expansion from scratch. Whenever new opportunities arise entrepreneurs and business executives can use generative AI to evaluate the potential value of these opportunities. This process is efficient and cost-effective because it requires little resources to collect and analyze new data. AI tools also provide a comprehensive view of the capacity of a business to expand. Note that all businesses are scalable but within certain conditions. Many start-ups today have failed because they miscalculated the scalability factor of their business. This miscalculation led them to expand too soon or too late. However, thanks to artificial intelligence, this mistake is avoidable. Business managers can carefully calculate scalability factors by computing as much financial and social data as possible to avoid mistakes.\n\nQuality Control And Improved Monitoring\n\nImproved integration of generative AI tools like GPT image generator and chatbot GPT can reduce human errors in businesses significantly. This is possible because AIs are programmed to follow orders which makes them less prone to errors. For organizations looking to attain and maintain a certain standard, the use of AI tools has been proven effective. With these innovative tools, be rest assured that all products will be of equal quality and all customers equally respected. Organizations can also use these tools to supervise the performance of various departments within the organization. If a department is not meeting up to standard, you can use this technology to optimize their performance and boost their productivity.\n\nEnhance Data Security\n\nProtecting customers' personal information should be the priority of every business. This is because the internet is filled with cyber criminals and customers would like to feel safe sharing their information with your brand. To guarantee the safety and security of customer information the elimination of third parties is important for business owners. You must ensure all interactions with clients are kept private and inaccessible to third parties. The best way of achieving this high level of data security is by integrating AI into your customer service system. This generative AI tool has end-to-end encryption to prevent unauthorized access and improve consumers' confidence in your business.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe importance of generative AI to the growth and sustainability of any organization cannot be overemphasized. This innovative technology has helped change the business landscape by creating a conducive environment for small businesses to effectively compete. The changes introduced by generative AI have helped improve data security, business marketing, data analytics, quality control, and customer experience at a cost effective rate. Also, note that as technology develops, chatbot GPT will also develop so for the progress of your business it's imperative you keep up with the trend.\n\nRelated Items:AI, chatbot GPT Recommended for you France Aims To Become Global AI Leader Nvidia's Founder Leads Business Leaders Summit On AI's Future The Impact of AI Face Generators on Media and Entertainment", "source": {"uri": "techbullion.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TechBullion"}, "authors": [{"uri": "angela_scott_briggs@techbullion.com", "name": "Angela Scott-Briggs", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "prime_star@techbullion.com", "name": "Prime Star", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "ethan_lee@techbullion.com", "name": "Ethan Lee", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "GUID Partition Table"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Logo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_experience", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Customer experience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Entrepreneurship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scalability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_growth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exponential growth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Customer relationship management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bar chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Time management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing_strategy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marketing strategy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Small_Business", "label": "dmoz/Business/Small Business", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_and_Society", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business and Society", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Small_Business/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Small Business/Consulting", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Small_Business/Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Small Business/Associations", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://techbullion.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WhatsApp-Image-2024-06-03-at-8.45.35-AM.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619220", "eventUri": "eng-9619220", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5215686274509803, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

The treaty establishes stringent standards for the development, deployment, and use of AI technologies, requiring its 46 member countries to implement legal and regulatory measures to ensure AI transparency, accountability, and fairness.\n\nAdditionally, the treaty seeks to prevent AI from undermining democratic processes by combating misinformation and protecting electoral integrity. To safeguard democratic institutions and processes, the treaty requires member countries to adopt measures ensuring that AI systems do not undermine democratic principles, including the separation of powers, judicial independence, and access to justice.\n\nTo achieve these goals, member states must adopt implementing laws. AI operations must be understandable, with mechanisms for challenging decisions. Member states must enforce strict data protection and privacy standards, implement measures to prevent biased outcomes and promote fairness, and educate the public about AI to encourage engagement in AI governance.

Ballistic Ventures previously incubated the company.\n\nAI presents a new set of privacy and compliance challenges like preventing LLM training data from one client from being used to serve a different client, ensuring that employees can't illegally access customer data within a private LLM, or blocking company IP from being shared with a public LLM like ChatGPT. And LLMs create a new attack surface, putting enterprises at risk of data or financial loss. Prompt injection, jailbreaking, and hallucination are a few of the common security risks from LLMs being used today.\n\nWitnessAI addresses these challenges to enable the safe and effective use of AI within the enterprise. And the WitnessAI Secure AI Enablement Platform includes modules for observability of AI use, policy enforcement and governance of AI use, and protection of employees, customers and enterprise data from AI use. The company will start early deployments in June 2024 and is already working with more than 20 design partners across multiple industries.\n\nWitnessAI was deployed as an isolated and cloud-based instance for each customer, encrypted with their own keys to ensure data privacy and regulatory separation. The platform intercepts activity between users and LLMs, applies control policies, and ensures data protection and user safety -- all with millisecond latency and requiring nothing to be installed on users' devices. Achieving this requires an integrated design that blends new techniques in machine learning, offensive and defense security for AI activity, and enterprise-scale web services deployment.\n\nThis funding round will accelerate the development of new AI guardrails and build out a global sales and support organization.\n\nKEY QUOTES:\n\n\"Building a safe AI enablement platform that works at enterprise scale requires a purpose-built team with expertise in AI and ML, red and blue teaming, and web-scale platform deployment. We've built something that works in the most demanding environments, including global organizations and across clouds. The response from CISOs we've spoken with has been tremendous.\"\n\n- Rick Caccia, WitnessAI CEO\n\n\"For most enterprises, the AI journey is just beginning. The need for guardrails around AI use, including visibility and control of that use, will only grow, and GV is excited to partner with the WitnessAI team as they make AI safe for the enterprise.\"\n\n- Karim Faris, General Partner at GV\n\n\"WitnessAI will enable enterprises of any size to use AI safely and effectively. When major technology shifts occur, they create the opportunity for someone to build the next great platform, and WitnessAI is building that new platform for enterprise AI. Ballistic is proud to have incubated the company from its earliest days.\"", "source": {"uri": "pulse2.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pulse 2.0"}, "authors": [{"uri": "amit_chowdhry@pulse2.com", "name": "Amit Chowdhry", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Laws", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Master of Laws"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prompt engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_surface", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attack surface"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privilege_escalation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Privilege escalation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_A_round", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Series A round"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intellectual property"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Information privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latency_(engineering)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Latency (engineering)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millisecond", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Millisecond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_incubator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Business incubator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Encryption"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scalability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Web service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Enterprise_Information_Integration", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Enterprise Information Integration", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://cdn.pulse2.com/cdn/2024/06/WitnessAI-Logo.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619220", "eventUri": "eng-9619220", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

A further 24% of workers say they have used an AI tool in their current role.\n\nHowever, the uptake in the use of AI by employers to evaluate job applications is significantly lower, with only 9% of organisations currently using AI tools to scan CVs or score candidates, for instance. However, close to a third (29%) of organisations expect to increase their use of AI to evaluate job applications in the future.\n\nKeith Mason, directors at Hays, is keen to point out the importance of transparency when it comes to the use of AI in a job application:\n\n\"Whilst a candidate might use AI in an application, it's important that they're also authentic and not over-reliant on the technology. Of course, the job application is only one part of the recruitment process. AI can also be efficiently used by employers in the initial sift if there are multiple applications, as this should overcome any bias and reduce the time taken to screen applicants.\n\n\"However, there's no substitute for an effective interview, conducted with some competency-based questioning. This is, arguably, the best way to truly assess someone's potential and people skills.\"\n\nWhen it comes to transparency, the research shows that most (81%) professionals would prefer to be informed if a hiring organisation uses AI to assess job applications. Across the UK, only 54% of employers currently do this.\n\nMason continues: \"It's positive to see how AI tools might support both candidates during the job application process and professionals in their day-to-day roles.\n\n\"But it could be cause for concern if this becomes the norm as we don't want the next generation to lose the art of good communication and the ability to articulate a balanced written debate. Again, a good interviewer will see beyond this and hire for potential based on the interview.\n\n\"Whilst machine learning is advancing at a rapid pace, in most jobs people will work with other people every day, so soft skills are key. AI will never replace the human element of getting to know someone as part of the recruitment process.

For now, however, you can probably count on one hand the number of vendors cashing in.\n\nThe most obvious one is Nvidia, of course, Nvidia has earned nation-state levels of cash for its GPUs ($26 billion in the first quarter of 2024 alone). Beyond Nvidia are the big cloud vendors and OpenAI. Beyond that cast of five, however, it's pretty hard to find many -- yet.\n\nThat \"yet\" is the key here. We are absolutely in a frothy period for AI, where vendors are selling \"hopium\" and enterprises are buying just enough to fuel proofs of concept, without much production usage. That will change, especially as we move beyond today's amazement. \"Wow, look at how a few lines of text can create a visually impressive but practically useless video!\" We are not yet into real use cases that mainstream enterprises are willing to spend on. It's coming though, and that's one reason vendors keep spending big on AI even though it's not paying off (yet). But for now, someone needs to answer Sequoia's $200 billion question.\n\nSpending AI money to make AI money\n\nAs Sequoia Capital partner David Cahn argues, Nvidia sold roughly $50 billion in GPUs last year (its 10-Q form shows who is buying), which in turn requires $50 billion in energy costs, $100 billion in data center costs, and another $50 billion in margin for those buying them (Tesla, OpenAI, Meta, etc.). All that adds up to $200 billion in revenue the Teslas and Amazons of the world need to make in order to break even on those Nvidia GPUs. However, as Cahn shows, even the most generous math gets us to only $75 billion in industry revenue (of which just $3 billion or so goes to the AI startups, as The Wall Street Journal points out).\n\nCahn asks, \"How much of this capex buildout is linked to true end-customer demand, and how much of it is being built in anticipation of future end-customer demand?\" He doesn't answer directly, but the clear implication is that this immoderate overbuilding of infrastructure may be good for some, but all that AI money right now is sloshing around in the coffers of a small handful of companies, with the real beneficiaries of AI yet to emerge.\n\nBefore that happens, we may well see an AI bust. As The Economist observes, \"If the past is any guide, a bust is coming and the firms carry such weight in the stock market that, should their overexcitement lead to overcapacity, the consequences would be huge.\" That's the glass-half-empty analysis. Cahn, the VC, gives the glass-half-full view, arguing that in past boom cycles, \"overbuilding of infrastructure has often incinerated capital, while at the same time unleashing future innovation by bringing down the marginal cost of new product development.\"\n\nIn other words, the big infrastructure companies' overspending on AI may eventually shred their balance sheets, but it will lead to lower-cost development of real, customer-focused innovation down the line. This is already starting to happen, if slowly.\n\nMeanwhile, back in the real world\n\nI'm starting to see enterprises consider AI for boring workloads, which is perhaps the ultimate sign that AI is about to be real. These aren't the \"Gee whiz! These LLMs are amazing!\" apps that make for great show-and-tell online but have limited real-world applicability. These are instead retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) apps that use corporate data to improve things like search. Think of media companies building tools to allow their journalists to search the totality of their historical coverage, or healthcare providers improving search for patient-related data coming from multiple sources, or law firms vectorizing contact, contract, and other data to improve search.\n\nNone of these would light up social media networks. However, each one helps enterprises run more effectively, and hence they are more likely to get budget approval.\n\nWe've been in a weird wait-and-see moment for AI in the enterprise, but I believe we're nearing the end of that period. Surely the boom-and-bust economics that Cahn highlights will help make AI more cost-effective, but ironically, the bigger driver may be lowered expectations. Once enterprises can get past the wishful thinking that AI will magically transform the way they do everything at some indeterminate future date, and instead find practical ways to put it to work right now, they'll start to invest. No, they're not going to write $200 billion checks, but it should pad the spending they're already doing with their preferred, trusted vendors. The winners will be established vendors that already have solid relationships with customers, not point solution aspirants.\n\nLike others, The Information's Anita Ramaswamy suggests that \"companies [may be] holding off on big software commitments given the possibility that AI will make that software less necessary in the next couple of years.\" This seems unlikely. More probable, as Jamin Ball posits, we're in a murky economic period and AI has yet to turn into a tailwind. That tailwind is coming, but it's starting with a gentle, growing breeze of low-key, unsexy enterprise RAG applications, and not as-seen-on-Twitter LLM demos.\n\nNext read this:\n\nWhy companies are leaving the cloud 5 easy ways to run an LLM locally Coding with AI: Tips and best practices from developers Meet Zig: The modern alternative to C What is generative AI?

Tom Umberg, the legislature's role in regulating artificial intelligence is multi-faceted.\n\nIt's no secret that California is expected to play an outsized role in AI regulation. After all, the state is home to many of the world's largest AI companies, the governor's office boasts.\n\nBut it's a balancing act, Umberg says, of tackling concerns related to bias and transparency in the AI space with encouraging innovation and start-ups.\n\n\"At one point, (the California Legislature) had 55 bills dealing with AI, mostly focused on risks. But we are creating both the regulatory entity that will provide guidance as well as some safety mechanisms to make sure that the risks that are inherent in AI are mitigated,\" said Umberg, a Santa Ana Democrat who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, which hears many AI-related bills.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom, speaking at an AI event in San Francisco last week, also warned against over-regulating AI, Politico reported.\n\n\"I don't want to cede this space to other state or other counties,\" Newsom reportedly said. \"If we over-regulate, if we overindulge, if we chase the shiny object, we could put ourselves in a perilous position.\"\n\nSo what are the bills legislatures are considering this year?\n\nBills still in consideration -- after clearing a major legislative deadline last month -- tackle deepfakes (digitally altered photos or videos that seem realistic but are, in fact, fake and can be extremely harmful), data transparency and election security, among other things.\n\nOne still in play is AB 1856 from Assemblymember Tri Ta, R-Westminster, which creates misdemeanor penalties for someone found to have knowingly distributed pornographic deepfake videos or photos of someone without that person's consent.\n\nThe bill is supported by the California State Sheriffs Association which argues that AI technology has \"exacerbated the prevalence and severity of revenge porn,\" which is commonly used by an ex-partner to embarrass, coerce or otherwise harm someone. But the California Public Defenders Association opposes it, arguing that it could violate First Amendment protections.\n\nAnother, from Assemblymembers Marc Berman, D-Menlo Park, and Gail Pellerin, D-Santa Cruz, is billed as an election integrity bill. It would require large online platforms to block the posting of digitally altered false images, videos or audio recordings that purport to show a candidate saying or doing something they did not actually say or do.\n\nEarlier this year, voters in New Hampshire received a robocall that sounded like the voice of President Joe Biden encouraging them not to participate in the primary elections, according to the state's attorney general.\n\n\"We have entered the age of AI-generated disinformation, which poses a severe risk to our elections and our democracy,\" said Berman. \"Deepfakes are a powerful and dangerous tool in the arsenal of those who want to wage disinformation campaigns, and they have the potential to wreak havoc on our democracy by attributing speech and conduct to a person that is false or that never happened.\"\n\nOther bills include:\n\nData transparency: AB 2013 requires developers of AI systems to publicize information about the data used to create the system or site. From Assemblymember Jacqui Irwin, D-Thousand Oaks, the idea is to enhance consumer protection, according to the bill's analysis, with a greater understanding of how these AI systems and services work.\n\n\"Consumers may use this knowledge to better evaluate if they have confidence in the AI system or service, compare competing systems and services or put into place mitigation measures to address any shortcomings of the particular system or service,\" Irwin said in the analysis.\n\nSafeguards for large-scale systems: If this bill is successful, developers of powerful and large-scale AI models and the technology that trains those models would need to implement certain safeguards related to safety and security.\n\nSB 1047 would also create CalCompute, \"a public AI research cluster that will allow startups, researchers and community groups to participate in the development of large-scale AI systems,\" according to the bill's analysis.\n\n\"By focusing its requirements on the well-resourced developers of the largest and most powerful frontier models, SB 1047 puts sensible guardrails in place against risk while leaving startups free to innovate without any new burdens,\" said Sen. Scott Wiener, D-San Francisco. \"We know this bill is a work in progress, and we're actively meeting with stakeholders and seeking constructive input.\"\n\nCalifornia Artificial Intelligence Research Hub: SB 893 establishes a new entity that would \"facilitate collaboration between government agencies, academic institutions and private sector partners to advance artificial intelligence research and development,\" according to the bill.\n\nThe idea behind the hub from Sen. Steve Padilla, D-San Diego, is to facilitate innovation in AI development; ensure AI technologies are prioritizing fairness and transparency; provide researchers with access to data, training and education; and support AI development through the building of a public computing infrastructure and ensuring access to existing commercial infrastructures, among other things.\n\n\"Emerging AI technologies are costly and energy intensive and require broad-based coordination among institutions and other sectors,\" said Padilla. \"Shared resources will be vital to the continued development of AI technology in California. The creation of the California Artificial Intelligence Research Hub allows us to pool and leverage the state's financial resources and the intellectual firepower of our academic sector to democratize AI and stop it from becoming monopolized by proprietary interests alone -- the tech titans.\"\n\n* Three UCI graduate students -- who were arrested when police removed the Gaza Solidarity Encampment on campus on Wednesday, May 15 -- traveled to Sacramento last week where they met with more than two dozen Assemblymembers and spoke about the UC's \"increasingly concerning efforts to suppress free speech on our campuses and in our workplaces,\" said Mark Gradoni, one of the three arrested grad students, who are also all teaching assistants.\n\nSent by UAW Local 4811 -- a labor union representing UC student employees and academic, graduate student and postdoctoral researchers -- the students presented Assemblymembers with a letter that calls on the UC to \"cease committing further unfair labor practices\" connected to the campus protest when the university called on law enforcement to crack down against members and to \"abide by Californian and federal law on freedom of speech and assembly,\" Gradoni said.\n\n* Actor Danny Glover was at the Capitol last week to advocate for arts funding.\n\n\"What an honor it was to welcome the incomparable Danny Glover to the State Senate today for his advocacy trip,\" said Sen. Anthony Portantino, D-Burbank, on social media. \"As many of you know I've been working on arts funding and support for our nonprofit community theaters.

Who's grading the AI?", "body": "A growing number of California kids are having their writing graded by software instead of a teacher.\n\nSchool districts are signing more contracts for artificial intelligence tools, from automated grading in San Diego to chatbots in central California, Los Angeles, and the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nEnglish teachers say AI tools can help them grade papers faster, get students more feedback, and improve their learning experience. But guidelines are vague and adoption by teachers and districts is spotty.\n\nThe California Department of Education can't tell you which schools use AI or how much they pay for it. The state doesn't track AI use by school districts, said Katherine Goyette, computer science coordinator for the California Department of Education.\n\nWhile Goyette said chatbots are the most common form of AI she's encountered in schools, more and more California teachers are using AI tools to help grade student work. That's consistent with surveys that have found teachers use AI as often if not more than students, news that contrasts sharply with headlines about fears of students cheating with AI.\n\nTeachers use AI to do things like personalize reading material, create lesson plans, and other tasks in order to save time and and reduce burnout. A report issued last fall in response to an AI executive order by Gov. Gavin Newsom mentions opportunities to use AI for tutoring, summarization, and personalized content generation, but also labels education a risky use case. Generative AI tools have been known to create convincing but inaccurate answers to questions, and use toxic language or imagery laden with racism or sexism.\n\nCalifornia issued guidance for how educators should use the technology last fall, one of seven states to do so. It encourages critical analysis of text and imagery created by AI models and conversations between teachers and students about what amounts to ethical or appropriate use of AI in the classroom.\n\nBut no specific mention is made of how teachers should treat AI that grades assignments. Additionally, the California education code states that guidance from the state is \"merely exemplary, and that compliance with the guidelines is not mandatory.\"\n\nGoyette said she's waiting to see if the California Legislature passes Senate Bill 1288, which would require state Superintendent Tony Thurmond to create an AI working group to issue further guidance to local school districts on how to safely use AI. Cosponsored by Thurmond, the bill also calls for an assessment of the current state of AI in education and for the identification of forms of AI that can harm students and educators by 2026.\n\nNobody tracks what AI tools school districts are adopting or the policy they use to enforce standards, said Alix Gallagher, head of strategic partnerships at the Policy Analysis for California Education center at Stanford University. Since the state does not track curriculum that school districts adopt or software in use, it would be highly unusual for them to track AI contracts, she said.\n\nAmid AI hype, Gallagher thinks people can lose sight of the fact that the technology is just a tool and it will only be as good or problematic as the decisions of the humans using that tool, which is why she repeatedly urges investments in helping teachers understand AI tools and how to be thoughtful about their use and making space for communities are given voice about how to best meet their kid's needs.\n\n\"Some people will probably make some pretty bad decisions that are not in the best interests of kids, and some other people might find ways to use maybe even the same tools to enrich student experiences,\" she said.\n\nLast summer, Jen Roberts, an English teacher at Point Loma High School in San Diego, went to a training session to learn how to use Writable, an AI tool that automates grading writing assignments and gives students feedback powered by OpenAI. For the past school year, Roberts used Writable and other AI tools in the classroom, and she said it's been the best year yet of nearly three decades of teaching. Roberts said it has made her students better writers, not because AI did the writing for them, but because automated feedback can tell her students faster than she can how to improve, which in turn allows her to hand out more writing assignments.\n\n\"At this point last year, a lot of students were still struggling to write a paragraph, let alone an essay with evidence and claims and reasoning and explanation and elaboration and all of that,\" Roberts said. \"This year, they're just getting there faster.\"\n\nRoberts feels Writable is \"very accurate\" when grading her students of average aptitude. But, she said, there's a downside: It sometimes assigns high-performing students lower grades than merited and struggling students higher grades. She said she routinely checks answers when the AI grades assignments, but only checks the feedback it gives students occasionally.\n\n\"In actual practicality, I do not look at the feedback it gives every single student,\" she said. \"That's just not a great use of my time. But I do a lot of spot checking and I see what's going on and if I see a student that I'm worried about get feedback, (I'm like) 'Let me go look at what his feedback is and then go talk to him about that.'\"\n\nAlex Rainey teaches English to fourth graders at Chico Country Day School in northern California. She used GPT-4, a language model made by OpenAI which costs $20 a month, to grade papers and provide feedback. After uploading her grading rubric and examples of her written feedback, she used AI to grade assignments about animal defense mechanisms, allowing GPT-4 to analyze students' grammar and sentence structure while she focused on assessing creativity.\n\n\"I feel like the feedback it gave was very similar to how I grade my kids, like my brain was tapped into it,\" she said.\n\nLike Roberts she found that it saves time, transforming work that took hours into less than an hour, but also found that sometimes GPT-4 is a tougher grader than she is. She agrees that quicker feedback and the ability to dole out more writing assignments produces better writers. A teacher can assign more writing before delivering feedback but \"then kids have nothing to grow from.\"\n\nRainey said her experience grading with GPT-4 left her in agreement with Roberts, that more feedback and writing more often produces better writers. She feels strongly that teachers still need to oversee grading and feedback by AI, \"but I think it's amazing. I couldn't go backwards now.\"\n\nContracts involving artificial intelligence can be lucrative.\n\nTo launch a chatbot named Ed, Los Angeles Unified School District signed a $6.2 million contract for two years with the option of renewing for three additional years. Magic School AI is used by educators in Los Angeles and costs $100 per teacher per year.\n\nDespite repeated calls and emails over the span of roughly a month, Writable and the San Diego Unified School District declined to share pricing details with CalMatters. A district spokesperson said teachers got access to Writeable through a contract with Houghton Mifflin Harcourt for English language learners.\n\nQuillBot is an AI-powered writing tool for students in grades 4-12 made by the company Quill. Quill says its tool is currently used at 1,000 schools in California and has more than 13,000 student and educator users in San Diego alone. An annual Quill Premium subscription costs $80 per teacher or $1800 per school.\n\nQuillBot does not generate writing for students like ChatGPT or grade writing assignments, but gives students feedback on their writing. Quill is a nonprofit that's raised $20 million from groups like Google's charitable foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation over the past 10 years.\n\nEven if a teacher or district wants to shell out for an AI tool, guidance for safe and responsible use is still getting worked out.\n\nGovernments are placing high-risk labels on forms of AI with the power to make critical decisions about whether a person gets a job or rents an apartment or receives government benefits. California Federation of Teachers President Jeff Freitas said he hasn't considered whether AI for grading is moderate or high risk, but \"it definitely is a risk to use for grading.\"\n\nThe California Federation of Teachers is a union with 120,000 members. Freitas told CalMatters he's concerned about AI having a number of consequences in the classroom. He's worried administrators may use it to justify increasing classroom sizes or adding to teacher workloads; he's worried about climate change and the amount of energy needed to train and deploy AI models' he's worried about protecting students' privacy, and he's worried about automation bias.\n\nRegulators around the world wrestling with AI praise approaches where it is used to augment human decisionmaking instead of replacing it. But it's difficult for laws to account for automation bias and humans becoming placing too much trust in machines.\n\nThe American Federation of Teachers created an AI working group in October 2023 to propose guidance on how educators should use the technology or talk about it in collective bargaining contract negotiations. Freitas said those guidelines are due out in the coming weeks.\n\n\"We're trying to provide guidelines for educators to not solely rely on (AI), he said. \"It should be used as a tool, and you should not lose your critical analysis of what it's producing for you.\"\n\nGoyette, the computer science coordinator for the education department, helped create state AI guidelines and speaks to county offices of education for in-person training on AI for educators. She also helped create an online AI training series for educators. She said the most popular online course is about workflow and efficiency, which shows teachers how to automate lesson planning and grading.\n\n\"Teachers have an incredibly important and tough job, and what's most important is that they're building relationships with their students,\" she said. \"There's decades of research that speaks to the power of that, so if they can save time on mundane tasks so that they can spend more time with their students, that's a win.\"\n\nAlex Kotran, chief executive of an education nonprofit that's supported by Google and OpenAI, said they found that it's hard to design a language model to predictably match how a teacher grades papers.\n\nHe spoke with teachers willing to accept a model that's accurate 80% of the time in order to reap the reward of time saved, but he thinks it's probably safe to say that a student or parent would want to make sure an AI model used for grading is even more accurate.\n\nKotran of the AI Education Project thinks it makes sense for school districts to adopt a policy that says teachers should be wary any time they use AI tools that can have disparate effects on student's lives.\n\nEven with such a policy, teachers can still fall victim to trusting AI without question. And even if the state kept track of AI used by school districts, there's still the possibility that teachers will purchase technology for use on their personal computers.\n\nKotran said he routinely speaks with educators across the U.S. and is not aware of any systematic studies to verify the effectiveness and consistency of AI for grading English papers.\n\nRoberts, the Point Loma High School teacher, describes herself as pro technology.\n\nShe regularly writes and speaks about AI. Her experiences have led her to the opinion that grading with AI is what's best for her students, but she didn't arrive at that conclusion easily.\n\nAt first she questioned whether using AI for grading and feedback could hurt her understanding of her students. Today she views using AI like the cross-country coach who rides alongside student athletes in a golf cart, like an aid that helps her assist her students better.\n\nRoberts says the average high school English teacher in her district has roughly 180 students. Grading and feedback can take between five to 10 minutes per assignment she says, so between teaching, meetings, and other duties, it can take two to three weeks to get feedback back into the hands of students unless a teacher decides to give up large chunks of their weekends. With AI, it takes Roberts a day or two.\n\nUltimately she concluded that \"if my students are growing as writers, then I don't think I'm cheating.\" She says AI reduces her fatigue, giving her more time to focus on struggling students and giving them more detailed feedback.\n\n\"My job is to make sure you grow, and that you're a healthy, happy, literate adult by the time you graduate from high school, and I will use any tool that helps me do that, and I'm not going to get hung up on the moral aspects of that,\" she said. \"My job is not to spend every Saturday reading essays. Way too many English teachers work way too many hours a week because they are grading students the old-fashioned way.\"\n\nRoberts also thinks AI might be a less biased grader in some instances than human teachers who can adjust their grading for students sometimes to give them the benefit of the doubt or be punitive if they were particularly annoying in class recently.\n\nShe isn't worried about students cheating with AI, a concern she characterizes as a moral panic. She points to a Stanford University study released last fall which found that students cheated just as much before the advent of ChatGPT as they did a year after the release of the AI.\n\nGoyette said she understands why students question whether some AI use by teachers is like cheating. Education department AI guidelines encourage teachers and students to use the technology more. What's essential, Goyette said, is that teachers discuss what ethical use of AI looks like in their classroom, and convey that -- like using a calculator in math class -- using AI is accepted or encouraged for some assignments and not others.\n\nFor the last assignment of the year, Robers has one final experiment to run: Edit an essay written entirely by AI. But they must change at least 50% of the text, make it 25% longer, write their own thesis, and add quotes from classroom reading material. The idea, she said, is to prepare them for a future where AI writes the first draft and humans edit the results to fit their needs.\n\n\"It used to be you weren't allowed to bring a calculator into the SATs and now you're supposed to bring your calculator so things change,\" she said. \"It's just moral panic. Things change and people freak out and that's what's happening.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

If you're not careful, AI can insert inaccuracies into a listing description or make a bad crop on a photo. Worst of all, though, is that a lack of authenticity can damage your credibility as a real estate professional.\n\nIn March, a brokerage in Las Vegas announced it had launched the first AI real estate agent. The \"agent,\" dubbed Luxora, helps people sort through luxury property listings and can even hold a conversation with clients. Luxora's avatar, unfortunately, is about as realistic as a 2010 video game character. That might work for some clients, but most will still want human interaction to help guide them through what is often an emotional and complex transaction.\n\nSavvy buyers and sellers will see right through inauthentic AI, so before you invest in one of the AI tools that can make you more efficient, be sure to vet them closely.\n\nChatGPT is one of the most popular AI tools for listing copy, and it generally does a pretty good job. With a good prompt, ChatGPT can do about 90% of the work on that listing description. Sometimes, though, it will repeat information or fail to emphasize the right details.\n\nThe key is giving ChatGPT a good prompt. If a perfectly landscaped backyard, outdoor kitchen, massive stone fireplace or furnished basement help a property really stand out, then make sure ChatGPT knows that with detailed instructions. Otherwise, a huge selling point for the property could be buried in the listing description.\n\nAn experienced agent knows how a good listing description should read. Think in your head what two or three key details should be highlighted in the description for your listing and write them down. Then, after your AI tool gives you its listing copy, check to see if it met your initial expectations. If not, you might need a revision.\n\nAnd always double-check copy for accuracy. AI often tries to fill in gaps with information it thinks it knows, but it's not perfect. It's up to you to make sure what's there is accurate.\n\nAI for images can help smooth out headshots and make listing images pop. A good AI tool will erase clutter from a living room or perfectly stage an empty bedroom photo with options for decor based on agent preferences.\n\nThe tech in this space has made huge strides, and the best tools make it difficult to impossible to see the difference between an AI image and a real one. But there are still some platforms that sometimes fall short.\n\nIn listing photos, keep an eye out for unnatural colors, decor that seems too perfect, and absent or misplaced shadows. Staging helps buyers imagine the potential for a room or space, but bad tech can be worse than showing an empty room.\n\nAs for headshots or business portrait shots, there are some nightmare outcomes where AI adds or deletes a finger or part of an arm or leg. Don't let that be you.\n\nAI is helping reshape just about every industry in the global economy, and real estate is no different.\n\nOur recent Truth About Agents survey demonstrates how AI is emerging as an industry norm in real estate. The survey taken by hundreds of agents in seven major U.S. markets from coast to coast found that more than half of real estate professionals have experimented with AI in some capacity for their business. And of those, more than 80% were happy with the results.\n\nRoughly one-third of survey respondents said they had yet to use AI but they plan to do so. If you're in that group, the time is now. It's free to experiment with some text-based AI platforms, such as ChatGPT. Start there or by asking the platform to create a response to a common client question. Then build up your AI skillset from there.", "source": {"uri": "southfloridaagentmagazine.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South Florida Agent Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "patrick_regan@southfloridaagentmagazine.com", "name": "Patrick Regan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real estate agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Avatar (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_relationship", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interpersonal relationship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Video game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_norm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social norm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Text-based user interface"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pop music"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Agents", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Agents", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Agents", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Agents", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Life/Agents", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Life/Agents", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://southfloridaagentmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/05/Technically-speakng-ai-Tech-issue-24-4-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619220", "eventUri": "eng-9619220", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

Newsrooms are utilising machine learning to analyse massive data to discover patterns and journalists are creating templates so computers can write stories that are data-based to free them up from routine stories to be able to attend to larger and more complex projects. Also, in other places, newsrooms are using AI to personalise story recommendations to their audience.\n\nResearch has shown that media outlets have adopted AI as a result of factors including the \"recent technological advancements, market pressures partially from the industry's financial challenges, competitive dynamics with a focus on innovation, and the pervasive sense of uncertainty, hype, and hope surrounding AI.\" However, the potential to increase newsroom efficiency has been identified to be the central motivator for the adoption of AI.\n\nThe American computer and cognitive scientist, John McCarthy is credited as the originator of the term \"artificial intelligence\" when he discussed the subject at a conference in 1955. According to him, AI is \"the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs.\" Since then, other scientists have proposed various ways of making machines intelligent like human beings.\n\nHowever, the English mathematician Alan Turing is said to have suggested the notion of AI when he proposed in 1950 \"The Imitation Game\" as the ultimate test of whether a machine was intelligent and could imitate a human being so as to provide answers to questions that are indistinguishable from those of man. The phrase \"The Turing Test\" refers to the proposal made by Turing as a way of dealing with the question whether machines can think.\n\n\"I believe that in about fifty years' time it will be possible to program computers, with a storage capacity of about 10, to make them play the imitation game so well that an average interrogator will not have more than 70 percent chance of making the right identification after five minutes of questioning. ...I believe that at the end of the century the use of words and general educated opinion will have altered so much that one will be able to speak of machine thinking without expecting to be contradicted,\" Turing, referred to as the father of modern computer science, wrote.\n\nIt is clear today that so much has changed since 1950 when Alan Turing proposed the \"Imitation Game\" test. There is currently a flurry of excitement everywhere with the introduction of Open AI's ChatGPT, GPT-3 and GPT-4, which are all AI-powered generative language models developed to encourage learning and conversation. There are generally two distinct classifications under AI - Generative AI and Machine Learning. While the two share a common foundation, applications, methodologies, and outcomes, they are significantly different.\n\nMachine Learning focuses on learning from data to make predictions or decisions. In other words, Machine Learning refers to the changes in systems that perform tasks associated with artificial intelligence. These tasks include recognition, diagnosis, planning, robot control, and prediction, among others. Generative AI, on the other hand, uses algorithms and models that generate new content such as text, photos, code, videos, 3D renderings, music, and more, which mimics human-like creative processes. The major distinction between the two methodologies is that while Generative AI algorithms are designed to create new data, Machine Learning algorithms analyse existing data.\n\nIt is worth noting that an artificial intelligence system learns from experience, uses the learning to reason, recognises images, solves complex problems, understands language and its nuances, and creates perspectives, among others. As evident across the world, every aspect of news production - story discovery, story production, and story distribution, can be affected by machine learning. The adoption of AI in Ghana's news industry will have a wide range of benefits to journalists and media outlets on three primary levels, (a) production of texts, (b) interaction with the audience, and (c) performance of mundane tasks, including the writing of press releases. For instance, in the automatic production of content, AI Algorithms can convert structured data such as sports results and weather forecasts into informative and narrative texts that can lead to the production of stories with or without the intervention of journalists.\n\nThe Paris Charter on AI and Journalism adopted on November 10, 2023, captured the essence of the age when it said: \"AI, spanning from basic automation to analytical and creative systems, introduces a new category of technologies with an unparalleled capacity to intersect with human thought, knowledge, and creativity. It represents a considerable shift in information gathering, truth-seeking, storytelling, and the dissemination of ideas. As such, it will profoundly alter the technical, economic and social conditions of journalism and editorial practice.\"\n\nSimilarly, in the area of fact-checking, AI tools can help Ghanaian fact-checking bodies and media outlets with the detection of trending topics for media and information literacy (MIL) interventions, comments moderation, collection of information, identification of mis-and disinformation, verification of mis-and disinformation content, and the automatic translation of texts and audios. When effectively employed, AI can make Ghanaian journalists and researchers more efficient and give them the space to pursue life-changing stories and interviews that cannot be generated by these AI-powered tools.\n\nThere are concerns that AI will replace news workers or the work they do across the world. At the moment, AI aids journalists but no one can guarantee that this will be the state of affairs in the coming years. What is true is that AI has sufficiently matured to replace the practice described as \"armchair journalism\" whereby journalists obtain news reports from the newsroom without going out to the field to interview the sources. It is these routine tasks such as the writing of press releases and other stories devoid of human emotions that would be faded by AI because these tools have been trained to perform such tasks - even better.\n\nAlthough AI tools can write better stories, some tasks are best suited to humans and this includes situations where complex communication is needed or expert thinking is required. Ghanaian journalists should endeavour to sharpen their skills and learn how the available AI platforms operate by going beyond \"she said,\" and \"he said\" kind of news reporting. Putting the all-important human touch to your reports can distinguish the work of journalists from that of AI tools.\n\nToday, better-resourced media organisations in Europe, America and Asia such as Associated Press and Bloomberg employ AI in their story production steps with automated content generation to improve the quality and speed of both their input and output. However, the majority of media outlets, especially smaller ones, make extensive use of AI products and infrastructure developed by major tech companies like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. The newsrooms in Ghana can equally use third-party solutions from platform companies as a story discovery and reporting tool.\n\nAgain, media outlets, including the New York Times have invested in artificial intelligence by hiring people specialised in artificial intelligence, machine learning, data science and mobile engineering. In a 2016 memo, the Bloomberg Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait, told his staff that: \"automated journalism has the potential to make all our jobs more interesting...The time spent laboriously trying to chase down facts can be spent trying to explain them. We can impose order, transparency and rigour in a field which is something of a wild west at the moment.\" This advice should be considered by Ghanaian journalists who are mindful of the great need to protect democratic structures in the country through the promotion of public accountability and good governance.\n\nWhile encouraging the use of AI in the news production process in Ghana, we need to acknowledge that there is an army of people scheming right now to deploy the same tools to cause havoc around the world - to destabilise peaceful countries, defame political opponents, misinform the public, remove democratically elected governments, twist the arm of voters, and influence opinion in favour of their paymasters. These things should be expected and in the coming years, we will see many of these things around us. Notwithstanding the narrow nature of today's artificial intelligence, there is a need for an ethical framework to guide AI use in journalism. The framework should focus on steps to evaluate quality of data and algorithms, analyse potential bias in models and ensure transparency in the use of AI-based tools.\n\nAlbeit its benefits, there are grave concerns and questions about the quality of the outputs created by these AI tools, the erosion of ethical principles and core values of journalism, and the challenge to the right to information. The Paris Charter on AI and Journalism noted that: \"AI systems have the potential, depending on their design, governance and application, to revolutionise the global information landscape. However, they also present a structural challenge to the right to information. The right to information flows from the freedom to seek, receive and access reliable information. It is rooted in the international legal framework, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the International Partnership for Information and Democracy. This right underpins the fundamental freedoms of opinion and expression.\"\n\nThese ethical concerns can effectively be addressed by programmers of AI tools, Ghanaian media outlets, and policymakers backed by an appropriate legal infrastructure. Ghanaian media outlets need to be deliberate about the way they use platform AI to promote the public good. Additionally, media outlets and journalists need to be transparent to their readers when they use AI to produce or distribute their content - this is important. Media outlets need to draw the line between authentic and synthetic content generated with the help of AI tools. In other words, local media outlets should refrain from using AI-generated content mimicking real-world captures and recordings to mislead the public.\n\nAs part of efforts to develop an ethical framework, the Paris Charter on AI and Journalism has outlined ten core principles which can guide Ghanaian media outlets in their interaction with AI. These include; (a) journalism ethics guide the way media outlets and journalists use technology, (b) media outlets prioritise human agency, (c) AI systems used in journalism undergo prior, independent evaluation, (d) media outlets are always accountable for the content they publish, and (e) media outlets maintain transparency in their use of AI systems, among others. Again, it is suggested that developers of AI tools would need to credit sources of their information, compensate Ghanaian authors of content they use in training their tools and respect the intellectual property rights of holders.\n\nTo effectively participate in this age of AI, Ghanaian media outlets need to invest in artificial intelligence by hiring experts in data science and machine learning, enter into partnerships with tech companies that have developed AI products, build in-house AI products for use in their newsrooms subject to the availability of resources, and train their journalists on the operation of AI platforms developed by third-parties. We need to remember that a functioning democracy requires an informed public and Ghanaian journalists must help their audience to participate fully in public life without fear or favour. As always, quality journalism will be the tool to achieve this objective in the country.\n\nI have no doubts in my mind that AI will enhance the capabilities of Ghanaian journalists, save them time to attend to serious and complex topics, improve their overall efficiency and increase the mass media industry's productivity in the country. However, Ghanaian journalists, media outlets, programmers, and policymakers must play an active role in the governance of AI systems to ensure ethical compliance, respect for copyrights, payment of compensation to authors for their works used in training AI models, rent extraction by platform companies, and the promotion of the public good.\n\n*****", "source": {"uri": "myjoyonline.com",

Known as artificial general intelligence, this would be the point at which humans are no longer the most intelligent things on the planet. Analysts and scientists say within a decade, machines could be making decisions independent of human control. This is a brave new world that has the potential for both positive and negative outcomes.\n\nRegardless of how things shakeout, there's no question that artificial intelligence (AI) will shape our collective future and is fast emerging as the dominant technology of our time. Certain companies are leading the charge and pushing the frontiers of AI, as well as working to infuse AI into all kinds of machines and technologies. Here are AI ambassadors: three stocks bridging the gap between humanity and machine.\n\nAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), the software company behind popular creative products such as Photoshop and Illustrator, is adding AI where it can. In recent months, Adobe has launched AI assistant for both its Reader and Acrobat products. Management has called AI \"the new digital camera.\" The company is leading in terms of finding practical ways for AI to help humans enhance their creativity.\n\nAI has proven to be a bit of a double edged sword for Adobe. ADBE stock has been hurt by news that privately held OpenAI has developed Sora, an AI platform that can generate videos based on written descriptions, similar to some Adobe products. The stock has also been dinged by news that Adobe canceled its planned $20 billion acquisition of design software start-up Figma and had to pay a $1 billion termination fee.\n\nDespite near-term headwinds, Adobe stock should be fine in the long run. Investors might want to take advantage of the fact that ADBE stock is down 23% year to date.\n\nFew companies are doing as much to enable the AI revolution as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (NYSE:TSM). The microchip foundry currently makes about three-quarters (75%) of all the chips and semiconductors used in the world today. Most AI applications and models run on chips that are produced by TSMC, as the company is known. It is a highly specialized business that is red hot right now.\n\nTSMC's services are so in-demand that the U.S. government has given the company $6.60 billion to fund the construction of microchip fabrication plants in Arizona. TSMC is spending $65 billion to build three cutting-edge fabrication plants in Phoenix. The plants are expected to be operational in 2027 and will provide microchips to customers such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL).\n\nAdditionally, Musk has launched xAI, a separate company that aims to use AI to \"...advance our collective understanding of the universe.\" Musk has said that xAI aims to compete with OpenAI and its various chatbots. Given the continued decline in Tesla's sales and market share, switching to focus on AI, super computers, and humanoid robots might be the company's future.\n\nMusk's enthusiasm for electric vehicles appears to be waning along with the public's interest. He seems much more focused on AI. TSLA stock has declined 28% on the year.", "source": {"uri": "investorplace.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "InvestorPlace"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joel_baglole@investorplace.com", "name": "Joel Baglole", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial general intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indie_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indie game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSMC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TSMC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figma_(software)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Figma (software)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Creativity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_camera", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Digital camera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Photoshop", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Photoshop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privately_held_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Privately held company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Integrated circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applications_of_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Applications of artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanoid_robot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Humanoid robot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercomputer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supercomputer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Semiconductor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 46}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://investorplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/artificial-intelligence-purple-ai-symbol-1600.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619220", "eventUri": "eng-9619220", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

But in a 2023 survey conducted for Deloitte, more than 75% of companies polled said they're concerned about legal risks related to intellectual property, such as copyright-infringement claims.\n\nThese are legitimate worries, said Peter Yu, a law and communications professor and the director of the Center for Law and Intellectual Property at Texas A&M University. Executives should be concerned with whether they can protect their creative output and whether using artificial intelligence could open them up to legal liability.\n\nThere are already lawsuits related to these issues, Yu said. For example, the Authors Guild and several high-profile authors, including George R.R. Martin, the writer of the \"Game of Thrones\" books, filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, claiming copyright infringement.\n\nWhile these cases revolve around the use of copyrighted work to train AI models, Yu said they could affect the entire landscape of AI-generated content -- but it's not yet exactly clear how. He said the outcome of the cases would shed more light on how marketers could be affected when using AI to create content.\n\nYu spoke with Business Insider about these issues in more detail and offered some advice for marketers developing their craft in the age of AI.\n\nThe following has been edited for clarity and length.\n\nWhat should marketing executives know about protecting their creative output when using AI?\n\nThe US Copyright Office has taken the view that any work autonomously generated by AI would not be protected under copyright law and has declined to register several works. The federal court has upheld the office's decision.\n\nIt's not that if you use AI, all of a sudden you'll lose copyright protection. The key to getting protection is to demonstrate that there's enough human creative input. At the moment, many marketers actually have a lot of human creative input, even though they're using AI tools.\n\nSo using AI on a work doesn't automatically prohibit someone from registering a claim to copyright?\n\nIf 10% of the work is created by AI, but then you bring in designers to do refinement, and the other 90% is actually done by humans, as long as you claim it properly, you'd still be able to get a copyright registration. But if you just go to an AI platform, type in a single prompt, and use that content, it may not be protectable.\n\nWhy should marketers be concerned about copyright infringement if they're using AI?\n\nA lot of cases that have been filed under copyright infringement are directed toward AI developers. They're suing them for using copyrighted works as training data without authorization. But the way the copyright law is written, there's no reason why the copyright holders cannot sue other users.\n\nWho is most likely to face a lawsuit due to infringement from AI use?\n\nRight now, a lot of users are individuals who are playing with the tools and not using the content for commercial purposes. From a legal standpoint, it doesn't make sense to go after these individuals. But if companies are using the tools to make money, then there's no reason why the copyright holders cannot sue them.\n\nThe use of AI for commercial purposes could open you to legal liability or legal threats of copyright infringement. Even if a company can prove before a court that they're not infringing, having a threat would require them to use a lot of resources to defend themselves.\n\nWhat's one piece of advice that you have for marketers as they use AI for content creation?\n\nOn the intellectual-property side, it's important to make sure to document the human creative input, especially if you're trying to apply for copyright. Even if you don't, it would still be useful to know what part is created by humans and what part is created by AI. It would be important to figure out early on as they integrate AI into their creative process.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authors_Guild", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Authors Guild"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_R._R._Martin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George R.

The companies that build and research AI are looking for experts in various AI and machine learning (ML) subfields. Even companies that don't specialize in AI are creating in-house AI tools for proprietary functions (such as searching in-house databases).\n\nLet's take a look at what some of these new jobs are, what they entail, and what kind of background you need. And maybe one will jump out as your next career choice.\n\nEthics has always played a big part in computers (cookie tracking comes to mind), but AI introduces a giant load of new concerns and worries. Here are some random concerns that companies that build AI need to, well, concern themselves with:\n\nSeveral of these questions also open serious legal issues. Courts are going to rule, and lawyers will need to learn about these new legal precedents; and soon there will likely be lawyers specializing in AI. Downstream, that means tech professionals who focus on AI will also need to learn as much as possible about ethics, and even specialize in \"ethical AI programming.\"\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) are the key to today's AI. In 2017, a research paper titled \"Attention is All You Need\" introduced a new concept called a transformer model, which was the breakthrough that opened up today's AI as we know it. With that came the concept of a Large Language Model, which stores all the words AI has learned, and includes connections between those words based on context within sentences and paragraphs. LLMs are complicated to build and understand, but with the right background you can learn how they work and become an LLM Engineer.\n\nBy LLM engineer, we don't mean writing code that uses LLMs. We mean writing the code that builds and manipulates the LLMs themselves. These people work for companies such as OpenAI, which built ChatGPT. But other companies exist too, and certainly AI startups abound. These companies need LLM engineers to create libraries of code that manipulate LLMs. Where do you begin?\n\nFirst you need to be strong in mathematics. When you think back to learning trig in high school, you'll recall studying how to determine sines and cosines of angles that are flat on the page, which is two dimensions. LLMs use trig to determine how similar human words are to each other; however, the trig calculations operate over hundreds of dimensions, not just two. Further, your math knowledge needs to extend into advanced calculus including partial derivatives. You also need a strong knowledge of probability.\n\nThe required math is indeed complex, but the good news is that if you studied math or computer science or physics in college, then you probably learned much of the required math already; you don't necessarily need to have a master's or PhD in mathematics. Additionally, you'll need to be strong in various programming languages such as Java, Python, and C++.\n\nMachine learning has been around for quite some time, long before the advent of the transformer model mentioned earlier. Amazon has done lots of research into machine learning so that it can make product suggestions based on your purchases and interactions with their website, for example.\n\nML engineers need to know how to gather and analyze enormous amounts of data, and how to \"clean\" the data (meaning spotting and removing errors in the data), and from there build large models (such as LLMs, but they could be other types of models), and train the models appropriately. From there they need to know how to extract new information from the models. In the case of Amazon, this means extracting new information based on Amazon's massive product catalog to generate suggestions.\n\nThese models are likely huge and require cloud-based platforms such as AWS or Google. (In fact, Amazon Web Services was originally built internally by Amazon to support their huge data endeavors; they eventually realized others could benefit from using it.)\n\nML engineering isn't limited to just product suggestions. One example is healthcare, where large models can be used to predict the likelihood of a patient developing a certain disease, as well as developing protocols for helping to prevent the disease through specific lifestyle changes and medications. Another example is in supply chains whereby a machine learning system can predict demand for certain products and in turn order the products or the raw materials to build the products.\n\nHow do you become an ML engineer? A typical path is to start by learning data analytics and data science. Then from there plan to take courses in mathematics similar to those we described for LLM engineer. Plan to learn programming in Java, C++, and Python.\n\nAI companies like OpenAI operate quite differently from traditional software companies. Their primary object is to research and develop new ideas in AI. Building software is often a secondary role.\n\nThis adds a unique wrinkle to the development of the software, because researchers work very differently from software developers. For example, the timelines are more flexible and less predictable. Researchers do a lot of experimenting, sometimes without a clear goal or endpoint in sight. They may need to take many steps back. They might have multiple false starts. This makes managing products that rely on original research significantly more complex. Also, remember that in a lot of cases, software released by research companies are likely byproducts of the research, such as tools to test and validate the research.\n\nChatGPT, for example, has grown into a premium product for OpenAI, but originally it was a proof of concept for the research. In other words, often the research is the actual product for such companies, and the tools they produce are secondary to their research. This means managing the creation of such software requires much more patience and the realization that the tools may take much longer to build, and might need to be scrapped altogether as the research gets modified.\n\nTo become an AI product manager, you'll need all the skills necessary to traditional product management, plus an understanding of how research organizations work. Then a basic understanding of how AI, including LLMs, works would be beneficial.\n\nWhile this is certainly not a new field, today's software developers are being asked more and more to integrate AI into their applications. You're seeing this happen already in apps that you use. For example, Google is rolling out AI assistance on their search page. In order to make this happen, developers need to know how to work with AI software libraries.\n\nIn this particular case, you don't need to become an expert on, say, building LLMs. Instead, you'll want to learn as much as you can about LLMs and machine learning, and then learn how to use libraries that abstract away the hard work of working with such AI systems. That way you can focus your time on building the app you're assigned and integrating AI in without having to become an LLM engineer.\n\nFor example, if you code in Python, you'll want to check out ChromaDB. Many of the popular languages now have similar frameworks. In these cases, you don't need to know how LLMs work but rather how to use them and put them to work.\n\nHow in the world do you test an AI tool? Chatbots like ChatGPT would be especially hard to test. In normal software development, when you write a function, you can expect that the function will give you consistent results when it's fed consistent data. That's not true with AI. When you feed a question such as \"What is the nature of the universe?\" into a generative AI tool, you're not going to be able to verify that it provides an expected and consistent response.\n\nTraditional QA testing skills do still matter, even when testing chatbots. For example, LLMs use mathematical formulas based around trigonometry to determine whether certain words in certain contexts are similar. The results of these calculations will indeed be consistent and predictable for those using a manual QA process. And that's where you would use your QA skills in the context of AI software.\n\nThat means learning everything you can about software testing, but also understanding the bigger picture of how AI tools work, as well as how parts of AI such as LLMs work.", "source": {"uri": "dice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dice Insights"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeff_cogswell@dice.com", "name": "Jeff Cogswell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Laws", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Master of Laws"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mathematics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Engineer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C++", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "C++"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_base", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Knowledge base"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Web Services"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_consequence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Logical consequence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Library (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Workflow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Java (programming language)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Proprietary software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Python (programming language)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Machine_Learning", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Natural_Language", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Natural Language", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.dice.com/binaries/large/content/gallery/dice/insights/2024/04/adobestock_564815950.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619220", "eventUri": "eng-9619220", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

There was a small display of motherboards mounted to walls, some new OLED screens to stare at lovingly, and a smattering of gaming laptops, pushed off in a corner like they hadn't really been invited. All the usual suspects you'd expect from a Gigabyte unveiling.\n\nPlenty to talk about for our speakers then, you would think. And you'd be wrong. Instead, I and the assembled press were treated to a long presentation introducing \"Gigabyte AI TOP\", an \"all around solution\" to \"win advantages ahead of traditional AI training methods\". As for the exciting new hardware? If it wasn't AI related, it very much took a back seat.\n\nFor diligence, let's start out with Gigabyte's AI TOP Utility, essentially a tool and user interface that helps you train your own AI models. Why this was the first focus of the event, and our host was so excited, remains unclear.\n\n\"It's so easy,\" says the presenter, as he demonstrates a complicated sequence of menus, sliders and checkboxes. \"Even a novice can easily adjust parameters and optimise model training with just a few clicks.\"\n\nCarefully dodging the inferred question, of course, of exactly how many people would really need it. If you're somebody familiar with the intricacies of building an AI model, I suppose having a user interface that's something other than damned unintuitive may well be a boon.\n\nBut for a room full of tech journos, surrounded by motherboards, OLED monitors, and gaming laptops that look much more interesting, it went down like a lead balloon. And this was just the beginning. Some 20 minutes later -- as yet more menus were revealed -- our host had definitely lost the crowd.\n\nPeople began to chat among themselves. Sniggers were heard. I saw someone get up for sandwiches and coffee, mid-presentation. Twice. A faux pas at most events when someone is speaking, I think it's fair to say. Here, I empathised.\n\nMy eyelids began to droop. The Taipei jetlag, creeping in.\n\nAI might be the hot new thing, kids. But a GUI to help you build your own that still looks dreadfully complicated and fussy, with the best will in the world, does not make for an exciting reveal.\n\nNor do efficiency claims, despite a single half-hearted \"whoop\" at the reveal of 0.34 tokens created per watt for a Gigabyte AI PC setup. Or something. At this point, I was clinging on to my sanity. At some point, I thought hopefully, we'll talk about some gaming hardware.\n\nAI Top motherboards were shown, \"maximised for AI training possibilities\", with multiple PCIe 5.0 slots, and a dual slot RTX 4070 Ti Super design made to be stacked together in groups for AI processing. An \"AI PSU\", a 1600W unit for \"AI training with a single wall plug\". An \"AI TOP SSD\", by which Gigabyte means, a decently-specced Gen 4 drive with a very high durability rating.\n\nBe still, my beating heart.\n\nBehind us sat the OLED monitors, rear connector motherboards and case designs, like kids dressed up for the school disco, waiting to be asked to dance. The presentation, however, seemed determined to ignore their existence. Not one mention was made.\n\nAs far as Gigabyte's concerned, it seems, AI is the only game in town worth talking about this year. And it's far from the only company leaning in that direction. Those of us focussed on gaming hardware, displays, or really anything else, seem to have been demoted, at least at Gigabyte's event. It's there, but it's the AI stuff that's really exciting. Promise.\n\nStill, it wasn't all bad. We were shown a clip of an AI TOP tutor, which came in the form of a 3D rendered AI model of a lady who, I was told, can \"fulfil all my wishes\" thanks to the power of AI. I still don't know quite what that means, and am more than a little reluctant to find out.\n\nLook, it's day one of my trip. Sure, I'm tired, and maybe a little grouchier than normal. But my goodness, the mood in the room here turned from anticipatory to disinterested, to downright bored within minutes. Shared looks between us, said it all.\n\n\"Gigabyte is an AI company,\" we are told. Shame.

Both objects are experiencing the exact same thing -- intense heat -- but how they respond to their environment couldn't be more different. The cement hardens. The butter melts.\n\nInvesting can be like that too, sometimes. Businesses can lean into the exact same secular tailwinds but experience widely disparate results.\n\nToday, I want to highlight the artificial intelligence (AI) trend, but I don't want to highlight the AI trend for its own sake. Rather, I believe there's a deeper, hidden investing lesson that you can't afford to miss.\n\nAs the chart shows, Nvidia stock has risen nearly 600% over the last three years as the AI trend has gained momentum. Meanwhile, Snowflake stock is down 40%. The disparity between the two is largely due to where these businesses fit into the bigger AI picture.\n\nIt's no secret the AI trend has been kind to Nvidia. In just the last three years, its revenue has nearly quadrupled -- this is what many investors focus on. But an underappreciated development is how the company has improved its gross margin, which nearly hit 80% in its most recent quarter.\n\nIn short, both revenue and gross margin are spiking for the company thanks to its sales of high-end, AI-capable graphics processing units (GPUs), as the chart below shows.\n\nAnd then, there's Snowflake. Its product revenue growth accelerated marginally from 33% in its fiscal 2024 fourth quarter (ended Jan. 31) to 34% the next quarter. New CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy gave a lot of credit to AI for that accelerating growth, saying, \"What is exciting about AI is that it can turbocharge our capabilities and growth.\"\n\nHowever, the company's guidance tells a slightly different story. If the AI trend was truly a turbocharger for the business, one would expect Snowflake's growth to at least hold fast, if not accelerate further. But management's outlook implies a slowdown to just 19% growth for product revenue in the second half of this fiscal year. For perspective, growth has never been that slow for Snowflake since it went public in 2020.\n\nSo it seems AI isn't quite turbocharging Snowflake's growth after all. Moreover, it isn't providing Snowflake with a gross margin boost like it did with Nvidia. In fact, the opposite is true. For fiscal 2025, Snowflake is forecasting a gross margin of 75% for product revenue. That's still quite strong, but it's a decrease from fiscal 2024's 78% margin.\n\nSnowflake's management blames spending on AI infrastructure for that expected dip. But it shows that AI isn't really boosting its business since growth is slowing. And its margins are dipping, in stark contrast to Nvidia's.\n\nIn investing, just recognizing a trend of enormous significance -- such as AI -- isn't enough. Each company's business model and place in the trend must also be considered in your attempt to distinguish which have the most potential to benefit.\n\nIn Nvidia's case, during its long history of making chips to support increasingly processing-hungry video games, it developed top-of-the-line GPUs that could deliver the performance that gamers needed. Over the years, other industries have found use cases for those GPUs beyond gaming. Now, businesses have recognized their potential to power AI applications and are scooping them up at a prodigious pace. The result: Nvidia had a head start in AI hardware before anyone even knew there was a race.\n\nNvidia's GPUs are considered the best, as evidenced by the company's reportedly 80% market share in AI GPUs. Demand is far exceeding supply, which is naturally boosting its revenue and profit margins.\n\nIn other words, Nvidia is directly fueling the AI trend with indispensable hardware. By contrast, AI companies like Snowflake are just trying not to fall behind.\n\nSnowflake's customers do want AI applications to help them sort through masses of data. But at that layer of the trend, AI applications are becoming the industry standard. If you want to compete, you have to spend money to steadily improve your offerings, so you can provide clients with what they need in a changing world. Snowflake's increased AI investments won't necessarily boost growth, but if it fails to upgrade, it risks losing business to competitors.\n\nThis is why investors should always have a sound investment thesis when buying a stock. However, an investment thesis that only considers underlying big-picture trends isn't sufficient -- that's like recognizing the hot summer day in the earlier analogy.

And maybe AMD is going to empower those devs with future features, just like a certain other graphics/AI company.\n\nDespite the Computex 2024 show not really starting until tomorrow, we've already had the opening keynote, where AMD's Dr. Lisa Su introduced us to the next generation of Ryzen 9000-series gaming and Ryzen AI chips. And, while those are separate categories of CPU right now, be in no doubt that AI is coming to the desktop. But what's that going to look like for gamers?\n\nWell, I asked Dr. Su what she thinks AI's place in gaming is. Does she see it as just a creative tool for developers, or is it going to deliver something tangible to us gamers, too?\n\n\"I think you're going to see AI everywhere,\" she tells me, \"and AI for gaming, certainly in developers you'll see that. But I also think that as we go forward game developers will want to use more AI -- not everything has to be rendered.\n\n\"There are some things you can do with partial AI and you're going to see more of that going forward in future development systems.\"\n\nThe most pervasive use of AI that gamers will be aware of right now is precisely that; as something which proves that not everything has to be rendered. But it's being used by the competition, with Nvidia always keen to note that with DLSS and Frame Generation something like only 1/8th of the pixels you see are actually rendered.\n\nAt the moment, however, AMD does not use AI in its upscaling or frame generation, but could this be a hint that maybe that might change in the not too distant future?\n\nNvidia uses the Tensor Cores of its RTX graphics cards to handle the upscaling on its GPUs -- aligned with using per-game training from its AI data centers, too -- and it also uses some AI to manage the Frame Generation feature. The result is that Nvidia's solution is less graphically glitchy than AMD's, though it does require proprietary hardware and implementation, something the red team has been historically reticent to put on gamers.\n\nBut AMD's current non-AI approach does deliver a gaming experience that's almost on par with what Nvidia's tech offers, and so an updated FSR wouldn't need a whole lot more tidying up -- with the right AI -- to bring it level.", "source": {"uri": "pcgamer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "pcgamer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dave_james@pcgamer.com", "name": "Dave James", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AMD"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Su", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lisa Su"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryzen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ryzen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computex", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendering_(computer_graphics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rendering (computer graphics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning_super_sampling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deep learning super sampling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Desktop computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Graphics card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia_RTX", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nvidia RTX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPUOpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "GPUOpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_scaling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Image scaling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Proprietary software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pixel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Games", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 39}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tU3AsmrqJJbEysaXj3fQJD-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619220", "eventUri": "eng-9619220", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

Who's grading the AI?", "body": "California schools are using more chatbots, and teachers are using them to grade papers and give students feedback.\n\nYour children could be some of a growing number of California kids having their writing graded by software instead of a teacher.\n\nCalifornia school districts are signing more contracts for artificial intelligence tools, from automated grading in San Diego to chatbots in central California, Los Angeles, and the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nEnglish teachers say AI tools can help them grade papers faster, get students more feedback, and improve their learning experience. But guidelines are vague and adoption by teachers and districts is spotty.\n\nThe California Department of Education can't tell you which schools use AI or how much they pay for it. The state doesn't track AI use by school districts, said Katherine Goyette, computer science coordinator for the California Department of Education.\n\nWhile Goyette said chatbots are the most common form of AI she's encountered in schools, more and more California teachers are using AI tools to help grade student work. That's consistent with surveys that have found teachers use AI as often if not more than students, news that contrasts sharply with headlines about fears of students cheating with AI.\n\nTeachers use AI to do things like personalize reading material, create lesson plans, and other tasks in order to save time and and reduce burnout. A report issued last fall in response to an AI executive order by Gov. Gavin Newsom mentions opportunities to use AI for tutoring, summarization, and personalized content generation, but also labels education a risky use case. Generative AI tools have been known to create convincing but inaccurate answers to questions, and use toxic language or imagery laden with racism or sexism.\n\nCalifornia issued guidance for how educators should use the technology last fall, one of seven states to do so. It encourages critical analysis of text and imagery created by AI models and conversations between teachers and students about what amounts to ethical or appropriate use of AI in the classroom.\n\nBut no specific mention is made of how teachers should treat AI that grades assignments. Additionally, the California education code states that guidance from the state is \"merely exemplary, and that compliance with the guidelines is not mandatory.\"\n\nGoyette said she's waiting to see if the California Legislature passes Senate Bill 1288, which would require state Superintendent Tony Thurmond to create an AI working group to issue further guidance to local school districts on how to safely use AI. Cosponsored by Thurmond, the bill also calls for an assessment of the current state of AI in education and for the identification of forms of AI that can harm students and educators by 2026.\n\nNobody tracks what AI tools school districts are adopting or the policy they use to enforce standards, said Alix Gallagher, head of strategic partnerships at the Policy Analysis for California Education center at Stanford University. Since the state does not track curriculum that school districts adopt or software in use, it would be highly unusual for them to track AI contracts, she said.\n\nAmid AI hype, Gallagher thinks people can lose sight of the fact that the technology is just a tool and it will only be as good or problematic as the decisions of the humans using that tool, which is why she repeatedly urges investments in helping teachers understand AI tools and how to be thoughtful about their use and making space for communities are given voice about how to best meet their kid's needs.\n\n\"Some people will probably make some pretty bad decisions that are not in the best interests of kids, and some other people might find ways to use maybe even the same tools to enrich student experiences,\" she said.\n\nLast summer, Jen Roberts, an English teacher at Point Loma High School in San Diego, went to a training session to learn how to use Writable, an AI tool that automates grading writing assignments and gives students feedback powered by OpenAI. For the past school year, Roberts used Writable and other AI tools in the classroom, and she said it's been the best year yet of nearly three decades of teaching. Roberts said it has made her students better writers, not because AI did the writing for them, but because automated feedback can tell her students faster than she can how to improve, which in turn allows her to hand out more writing assignments.\n\n\"At this point last year, a lot of students were still struggling to write a paragraph, let alone an essay with evidence and claims and reasoning and explanation and elaboration and all of that,\" Roberts said. \"This year, they're just getting there faster.\"\n\nRoberts feels Writable is \"very accurate\" when grading her students of average aptitude. But, she said, there's a downside: It sometimes assigns high-performing students lower grades than merited and struggling students higher grades. She said she routinely checks answers when the AI grades assignments, but only checks the feedback it gives students occasionally.\n\n\"In actual practicality, I do not look at the feedback it gives every single student,\" she said. \"That's just not a great use of my time. But I do a lot of spot checking and I see what's going on and if I see a student that I'm worried about get feedback, (I'm like) 'Let me go look at what his feedback is and then go talk to him about that.'\"\n\nAlex Rainey teaches English to fourth graders at Chico Country Day School in northern California. She used GPT-4, a language model made by OpenAI which costs $20 a month, to grade papers and provide feedback. After uploading her grading rubric and examples of her written feedback, she used AI to grade assignments about animal defense mechanisms, allowing GPT-4 to analyze students' grammar and sentence structure while she focused on assessing creativity.\n\n\"I feel like the feedback it gave was very similar to how I grade my kids, like my brain was tapped into it,\" she said.\n\nLike Roberts she found that it saves time, transforming work that took hours into less than an hour, but also found that sometimes GPT-4 is a tougher grader than she is. She agrees that quicker feedback and the ability to dole out more writing assignments produces better writers. A teacher can assign more writing before delivering feedback but \"then kids have nothing to grow from.\"\n\nRainey said her experience grading with GPT-4 left her in agreement with Roberts, that more feedback and writing more often produces better writers. She feels strongly that teachers still need to oversee grading and feedback by AI, \"but I think it's amazing. I couldn't go backwards now.\"\n\nContracts involving artificial intelligence can be lucrative.\n\nTo launch a chatbot named Ed, Los Angeles Unified School District signed a $6.2 million contract for two years with the option of renewing for three additional years. Magic School AI is used by educators in Los Angeles and costs $100 per teacher per year.\n\nDespite repeated calls and emails over the span of roughly a month, Writable and the San Diego Unified School District declined to share pricing details with CalMatters. A district spokesperson said teachers got access to Writeable through a contract with Houghton Mifflin Harcourt for English language learners.\n\nQuillBot is an AI-powered writing tool for students in grades 4-12 made by the company Quill. Quill says its tool is currently used at 1,000 schools in California and has more than 13,000 student and educator users in San Diego alone. An annual Quill Premium subscription costs $80 per teacher or $1800 per school.\n\nQuillBot does not generate writing for students like ChatGPT or grade writing assignments, but gives students feedback on their writing. Quill is a nonprofit that's raised $20 million from groups like Google's charitable foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation over the past 10 years.\n\nEven if a teacher or district wants to shell out for an AI tool, guidance for safe and responsible use is still getting worked out.\n\nGovernments are placing high-risk labels on forms of AI with the power to make critical decisions about whether a person gets a job or rents an apartment or receives government benefits. California Federation of Teachers President Jeff Freitas said he hasn't considered whether AI for grading is moderate or high risk, but \"it definitely is a risk to use for grading.\"\n\nThe California Federation of Teachers is a union with 120,000 members. Freitas told CalMatters he's concerned about AI having a number of consequences in the classroom. He's worried administrators may use it to justify increasing classroom sizes or adding to teacher workloads; he's worried about climate change and the amount of energy needed to train and deploy AI models' he's worried about protecting students' privacy, and he's worried about automation bias.\n\nRegulators around the world wrestling with AI praise approaches where it is used to augment human decisionmaking instead of replacing it. But it's difficult for laws to account for automation bias and humans becoming placing too much trust in machines.\n\nThe American Federation of Teachers created an AI working group in October 2023 to propose guidance on how educators should use the technology or talk about it in collective bargaining contract negotiations. Freitas said those guidelines are due out in the coming weeks.\n\n\"We're trying to provide guidelines for educators to not solely rely on (AI), he said. \"It should be used as a tool, and you should not lose your critical analysis of what it's producing for you.\"\n\nGoyette, the computer science coordinator for the education department, helped create state AI guidelines and speaks to county offices of education for in-person training on AI for educators. She also helped create an online AI training series for educators. She said the most popular online course is about workflow and efficiency, which shows teachers how to automate lesson planning and grading.\n\n\"Teachers have an incredibly important and tough job, and what's most important is that they're building relationships with their students,\" she said. \"There's decades of research that speaks to the power of that, so if they can save time on mundane tasks so that they can spend more time with their students, that's a win.\"\n\nAlex Kotran, chief executive of an education nonprofit that's supported by Google and OpenAI, said they found that it's hard to design a language model to predictably match how a teacher grades papers.\n\nHe spoke with teachers willing to accept a model that's accurate 80% of the time in order to reap the reward of time saved, but he thinks it's probably safe to say that a student or parent would want to make sure an AI model used for grading is even more accurate.\n\nKotran of the AI Education Project thinks it makes sense for school districts to adopt a policy that says teachers should be wary any time they use AI tools that can have disparate effects on student's lives.\n\nEven with such a policy, teachers can still fall victim to trusting AI without question. And even if the state kept track of AI used by school districts, there's still the possibility that teachers will purchase technology for use on their personal computers.\n\nKotran said he routinely speaks with educators across the U.S. and is not aware of any systematic studies to verify the effectiveness and consistency of AI for grading English papers.\n\nRoberts, the Point Loma High School teacher, describes herself as pro technology.\n\nShe regularly writes and speaks about AI. Her experiences have led her to the opinion that grading with AI is what's best for her students, but she didn't arrive at that conclusion easily.\n\nAt first she questioned whether using AI for grading and feedback could hurt her understanding of her students. Today she views using AI like the cross-country coach who rides alongside student athletes in a golf cart, like an aid that helps her assist her students better.\n\nRoberts says the average high school English teacher in her district has roughly 180 students. Grading and feedback can take between five to 10 minutes per assignment she says, so between teaching, meetings, and other duties, it can take two to three weeks to get feedback back into the hands of students unless a teacher decides to give up large chunks of their weekends. With AI, it takes Roberts a day or two.\n\nUltimately she concluded that \"if my students are growing as writers, then I don't think I'm cheating.\" She says AI reduces her fatigue, giving her more time to focus on struggling students and giving them more detailed feedback.\n\n\"My job is to make sure you grow, and that you're a healthy, happy, literate adult by the time you graduate from high school, and I will use any tool that helps me do that, and I'm not going to get hung up on the moral aspects of that,\" she said. \"My job is not to spend every Saturday reading essays. Way too many English teachers work way too many hours a week because they are grading students the old-fashioned way.\"\n\nRoberts also thinks AI might be a less biased grader in some instances than human teachers who can adjust their grading for students sometimes to give them the benefit of the doubt or be punitive if they were particularly annoying in class recently.\n\nShe isn't worried about students cheating with AI, a concern she characterizes as a moral panic. She points to a Stanford University study released last fall which found that students cheated just as much before the advent of ChatGPT as they did a year after the release of the AI.\n\nGoyette said she understands why students question whether some AI use by teachers is like cheating. Education department AI guidelines encourage teachers and students to use the technology more. What's essential, Goyette said, is that teachers discuss what ethical use of AI looks like in their classroom, and convey that -- like using a calculator in math class -- using AI is accepted or encouraged for some assignments and not others.\n\nFor the last assignment of the year, Robers has one final experiment to run: Edit an essay written entirely by AI. But they must change at least 50% of the text, make it 25% longer, write their own thesis, and add quotes from classroom reading material. The idea, she said, is to prepare them for a future where AI writes the first draft and humans edit the results to fit their needs.\n\n\"It used to be you weren't allowed to bring a calculator into the SATs and now you're supposed to bring your calculator so things change,\" she said. \"It's just moral panic. Things change and people freak out and that's what's happening.\"", "source": {"uri": "calmatters.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "CalMatters"}, "authors": [{"uri": "khari_johnson@calmatters.org",

In the face of the face of this there must be stronger testing of the outputs to assess their power and acuity.\n\nThere are also concerns at suggestions that the new AI Safety Institute has been unable to access some developers' models to carry out pre-deployment safety testing. The report says the next Government should identify any developers that have refused access, name them and report their reason for refusing.\n\nThe committee concludes that in a world in which some AI developers command vast resources, UK regulators must be equipped to hold them to account. It says the \u00a310 million announced to support the UK's sectoral regulators, particularly Ofcom, as they respond to the growing prevalence of AI in the private and public sectors will be \"clearly insufficient to meet the challenge, particularly when compared to even the UK revenues of leading AI developers\".\n\nRecommendations in the report include that the Government should address the 12 challenges for AI governance that the committee set out in an interim report in January, that it should be ready to introduce new AI-specific legislation, produce quarterly reviews of the effectiveness of regulation, and provide further financial support.\n\nCommittee chair Greg Clark MP said: \"The overarching 'black box' challenge of some AI models means we will need to change the way we think about assessing the technology. Biases may not be detectable in the construction of models, so there will need to be a bigger emphasis on testing the outputs of model to see if they have unacceptable consequences.\n\n\"The Bletchley Park Summit resulted in an agreement that developers would submit new models to the AI Safety Institute. We are calling for the next government to publicly name any AI developers who do not submit their models for pre-deployment safety testing.\n\n\"It is right to work through existing regulators, but the next government should stand ready to legislate quickly if it turns out that any of the many regulators lack the statutory powers to be effective. We are worried that UK regulators are under-resourced compared to the finance that major developers can command.\n\n\"The current Government has been active and forward looking on AI and has amassed a talented group of expert advisers in Whitehall. Important challenges await the next administration and in this, the committee's final substantive report of this Parliament, we set out an agenda that the new Government should follow to attain the transformational benefits of AI while safeguarding hard won public protections.\"", "source": {"uri": "ukauthority.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "UKAuthority"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Black box"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_sector", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public sector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Parliament of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ofcom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ofcom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bletchley_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bletchley Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Clark", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greg Clark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitehall", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Whitehall"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Statute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 19}], "image": "https://www.ukauthority.com/media/12421/istock-black_kira-1345658982.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619220", "eventUri": "eng-9619220", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

The country's history of censorship and surveillance is extending to its approach to AI, writes Business Insider's Linette Lopez.\n\nThe CCP's plan for AI is about shaping reality and enforcing its power, according to internal documents. To that end, the government has final sign-off on large language models and the data they were trained on.\n\nIn short, it's less \"move fast and break things\" and more \"proceed in a government-approved fashion and avoid upsetting the status quo.\"\n\nChina's push to exert control over AI comes at a critical juncture for the country.\n\nAs Linette has previously reported, China's bright economic future has dimmed considerably. And its recovery plan -- China shock 2.0 -- won't come easily or be welcomed by the rest of the world.\n\nSo, as AI chatbots become the new method of receiving information, it's no wonder the CCP is making sure AI is getting its messages across.\n\nHowever, this isn't a call for a libertarian approach to generative AI.\n\nAs we've seen recently, a lack of guardrails comes with its own set of problems. The end results range from funny (don't make your pizza with glue) to infuriating (AI misusing creative work).\n\nAnd in the face of these mishaps, the response from the people in charge rarely exudes the confidence of someone completely in control. Instead, it feels like we're all going along for an AI-led drive and hoping for the best.\n\nSo putting in some types of rules around the tech -- albeit not to the degree the CCP has -- seems like a good idea.\n\nBut that poses another issue. How can we expect lawmakers, who often struggle with the basics of tech, to grasp something people on the cutting edge can barely wrap their heads around?\n\nIn the meantime, China could extend the AI tools of control and surveillance it creates to other regimes with similar ideologies.\n\nIt's a distressing outcome.\n\n\"The digital curtain AI can build in our imaginations will be much more impenetrable than iron, making it impossible for societies to cooperate in a shared future,\" Linette writes.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dan_defrancesco@businessinsider.com", "name": "Dan DeFrancesco", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Communist_Party", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chinese Communist Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Censorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Surveillance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Libertarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ideology"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Natural_Language", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Natural Language", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/665dad9d1cd3b177904269a2?width=1200&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619220", "eventUri": "eng-9619220", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

However, the successful implementation and utilization of AI tools within organizations requires a strategic approach that harmonizes three critical elements: leadership, project management and process management. This triad, which we'll refer to as the \"Transformation Triangle,\" is essential for unlocking the full potential of AI and driving meaningful transformation.\n\nSuccessfully leveraging the Transformation Triangle requires leadership to set the vision, align organizational goals, and foster a culture of innovation. Firm leaders must possess a deep understanding of AI's capabilities and limitations, as well as the foresight to anticipate its impact on their organization. They must communicate a clear and compelling rationale for embracing AI, articulating the benefits it can bring to employees, customers and stakeholders alike.\n\nMoreover, firm leaders play a pivotal role in securing the necessary resources, talent and infrastructure required for successful AI implementation. They must champion data-driven decision-making, encouraging a mindset shift that embraces AI as a strategic enabler, rather than a mere technological tool.\n\nImportantly, leaders must also address the ethical and societal implications of AI, ensuring that its deployment aligns with the organization's values and principles. This includes establishing robust governance frameworks, promoting transparency, and mitigating potential risks associated with AI, such as bias and privacy concerns.\n\nSupporting AI adoption\n\nThe apex of the Transformation Triangle is change management. Change management is a systematic approach to dealing with transformation or transitions within a firm's goals, processes or technologies. The objective of change management is to implement strategies for effecting change, controlling change, and helping people adapt to change. It involves managing the human elements of change to achieve the desired business outcomes, focusing on the ways team members perceive, accept and embrace changes in their current business environment.\n\nEffective change management goes through several phases, including preparing for change by building awareness and gaining support, managing the change with clear communication and resources, and reinforcing change through feedback and corrective actions. By aligning the expectations, communication and integration of the change process, organizations can have smoother transitions and achieve better results.\n\nOrchestrating the AI endeavor\n\nThe second vertex of the Transformation Triangle is project management, which serves as the orchestrator of AI initiatives. Effective project management ensures that AI projects are carefully planned, executed and monitored, aligning with the organization's strategic objectives and resource constraints.\n\nProject managers possessing a deep understanding of AI technologies, data requirements, and the potential challenges that may arise during implementation are extremely helpful. It is most critical that they leverage a project management framework for assembling cross-functional teams with the necessary expertise, fostering collaboration, and managing stakeholder expectations throughout the project life cycle.\n\nRigorous project planning, risk management and change management practices are essential for navigating the complexities of AI implementation. Project managers must anticipate and address potential roadblocks, such as data quality issues, integration challenges, and user adoption barriers, ensuring that projects stay on track and deliver tangible value.\n\nFurthermore, project managers play a crucial role in measuring and communicating the progress and impact of AI initiatives, enabling data-driven decision-making and continuous improvement.\n\nEmbedding AI into operations\n\nThe third vertex of the Transformation Triangle is process management, which focuses on seamlessly integrating AI into an organization's existing processes and workflows. Effective process management ensures that AI tools are not merely bolted onto existing systems but rather woven into the fabric of the organization's operations, enabling genuine transformation.\n\nProcess managers must work closely with subject-matter experts and end users to understand current processes, identify inefficiencies, and pinpoint areas where artificial intelligence can drive optimization and automation. They are responsible for designing and implementing new processes that leverage the capabilities of AI, while also ensuring compliance with industry standards, regulations and best practices.\n\nMoreover, process managers must address the impact of AI on organizational roles and responsibilities, facilitating the upskilling and reskilling of employees to adapt to the changing landscape. They must foster a culture of continuous learning and improvement, encouraging employees to embrace AI as a catalyst for professional growth and development.\n\nEffective process management also involves monitoring and optimizing AI-enabled processes, leveraging data analytics and user feedback to identify areas for further improvement, and ensuring that AI tools are delivering their intended benefits.\n\nThe power of the Triangle\n\nWhile each vertex of the Transformation Triangle -- change management, project management and process management -- plays a distinct and crucial role, it is their synergistic interplay that truly unlocks the transformative potential of AI. Leaders provide the strategic vision and direction, change managers help to ensure individual and organizational readiness, project managers orchestrate the execution, and process managers ensure seamless integration, creating a virtuous cycle of continuous improvement and innovation.\n\nBy embracing the Transformation Triangle, organizations can navigate the complexities of AI implementation, mitigate risks, and drive sustainable value creation.

In a recent interview, Daniel Avancini, Chief Data Officer at Indicium, shared valuable insights on how organizations can successfully adopt AI and ML technologies, the skills professionals should focus on building, and the future of the CDO role.\n\nOne of the organization's most significant challenges when adopting AI and ML is failing to align these initiatives with their strategic goals. Avancini emphasizes the importance of applying a Data Maturity Framework that considers the three pillars of a successful AI and ML initiative: People, Organization, and Data. By ensuring that data platforms are AI-ready, establishing the proper data organization, and investing in data literacy training programs, companies can lay a solid foundation for AI and ML success.\n\nFor developers and engineers looking to start working with AI and ML technologies, Avancini recommends focusing on the fundamentals first. This includes a basic understanding of data engineering, data management, SQL, and Python. A solid grasp of statistics and familiarity with machine learning models such as regression, classification, natural language processing (NLP), and optimization techniques is also essential. Professionals should stay updated on emerging trends like large language models (LLMs) and vector databases as the field evolves.\n\nAs AI and ML become more prevalent in organizations, the role of the Chief Data Officer is set to become even more critical. CDOs will balance large-scale AI/ML adoption demand with risk management and data governance. They will also play a key role in driving data maturity within organizations by ensuring adequate resources and senior leadership support for data foundations and products.\n\nAvancini believes LLMOps (Large Language Model Operations) tools like LangChain and advancements in AI agents are among the most promising emerging AI/ML techniques and applications that developers and architects should keep on their radar.\n\nLLMOps tools, such as LangChain, are designed to streamline the development, deployment, and management of large language models. These tools help developers build applications to understand and generate human-like text, enabling various use cases, from chatbots and content creation to text summarization and sentiment analysis. By simplifying the process of working with LLMs, LLMOps tools make it easier for organizations to harness the power of these advanced AI models.\n\nIn addition to LLMOps, Avancini highlights the growing importance of AI agents. AI agents are autonomous systems that can perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. These agents can be used in various applications, such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, and intelligent virtual assistants. As AI agents become more sophisticated, they have the potential to revolutionize industries and transform the way we interact with technology.\n\nDevelopers and architects should closely monitor these emerging AI/ML techniques and applications, as they are likely to play a significant role in shaping the field's future. By staying informed about the latest advancements in LLMOps, AI agents, and other cutting-edge technologies, professionals can position themselves to take advantage of new opportunities and drive innovation within their organizations.\n\nTo ensure data is AI-ready, Indicium recommends treating data quality and governance as an integral part of the data pipeline rather than solely a technology issue. Investing in methodologies like DataOps and MLOps can help organizations build data platforms with data quality and governance by design.\n\nOrganizations must develop their own AI risk management practices and seek ways to obtain user opt-in and implement use cases that comply with data privacy laws. Avancini suggests focusing on high-value use cases that do not rely on personal or sensitive data as a starting point.\n\nAvancini stresses the importance of starting the modernization process as soon as possible for organizations with legacy data infrastructure. He recommends investing in a well-designed, scalable stack that minimizes lock-in and leverages cutting-edge technologies from the modern data stack. A phased approach, starting small and generating value from the outset, is often the most effective strategy.\n\nIndicium finds open-source tools like dbt, Airflow, and Dagster handy for data science and ML engineering. Avancini also recommends exploring hidden gems like Kedro for MLOps and Meltano for data integration.\n\nIndicium approaches the development of transparent, accountable, and unbiased AI systems by investing in training programs and building in-house frameworks to address potential risks. A transparent MLOps workflow, thorough user testing, and an understanding of how each model is trained and what data is used are vital to mitigating biases and errors.\n\nAs AI and ML continue transforming industries, developers, engineers, and architects must stay ahead of the curve. By aligning initiatives with strategic goals, building essential skills, leveraging the right tools and frameworks, and prioritizing responsible and ethical AI development, organizations can successfully navigate the AI and ML landscape and unlock the full potential of these transformative technologies.", "source": {"uri": "dzone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "dzone.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_engineering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Data engineering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SQL"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Data management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Risk management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Natural language processing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Python (programming language)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_summarization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Automatic summarization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sentiment analysis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_quality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data quality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_robot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Autonomous robot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_governance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data governance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Use case"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robotics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicular_automation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vehicular automation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mathematical optimization"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Databases", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Databases", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Data_Centers", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Data Centers", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Data_Administration", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Data Administration", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://dz2cdn1.dzone.com/storage/article-thumb/17716628-thumb.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619220", "eventUri": "eng-9619220", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4431372549019608, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

Tillement explained how Mila has grown rapidly over the last decade to become one of the world's largest AI research institutions. In a comprehensive discussion, he shared insights into the institute's structure, objectives, and significant contributions to the AI landscape.\n\nMila's primary mission revolves around cultivating new AI talent. Tillement said: \"Our first main goal is to educate these new professionals,\" highlighting the institute's commitment to nurturing the next generation of AI experts. Most of Mila's experts are affiliated with universities across Quebec, including the University of Montreal, and they bring with them approximately 1,300 students. This collaboration fosters a rich learning environment where students and professionals can interact and develop cutting-edge research in machine learning and deep learning.\n\nMila's success is also deeply rooted in its extensive network of industry partnerships. Currently, Mila collaborates with over 130 companies, offering a dynamic exchange of ideas and resources. \"We need them to tell us what is their problematic for the students and professors to work on real-world projects, real-world problems,\" Tillement added. These partnerships not only provide practical challenges for Mila's researchers but also drive innovation in various industries.\n\nA key aspect of these collaborations is the Entrepreneurship Lab, which supports students interested in launching their own startups. Over the past three years, this initiative has led to the creation of more than 30 companies, underscoring Mila's role in fostering entrepreneurial spirit within the AI community. \"We developed an entrepreneurship lab, where we take students with an idea... and we really explain what it is to develop the company.\"\n\nMila's research is divided into two main streams: academic and applied research. The academic research is characterized by its open science approach, where findings are published and shared broadly to advance the field of AI. \"The company needs to think when they work with these people because you permission algorithm when you publish the data set,\" Tillement explained, emphasizing the transparency and collaborative nature of this work.\n\nOn the other hand, applied research involves more direct collaboration with companies, focusing on specific projects that require confidentiality and proprietary developments. \"For the applied research team, it's totally different because they work with the company and only with the company,\" Tillement said. This flexibility allows companies to retain intellectual property rights while benefiting from Mila's expertise.\n\nMila is not just focused on technological advancement but also on leveraging AI for societal good. One of the most compelling aspects of Mila's work is its AI for Humanity initiative, which tackles global challenges such as agriculture, health, and modern slavery. For instance, a project in Rwanda aims to predict agricultural outcomes to improve crop yields, while another project seeks to identify signs of modern slavery in corporate documents. \"Some projects are really looking for interactions,\" Tillement highlighted, indicating a strong emphasis on collaboration for social impact.\n\nRecognizing the importance of responsible AI, Mila has developed programs to ensure that AI technologies are developed ethically. The \"Train\" program, for example, provides certification in responsible AI, teaching developers how to create algorithms with ethical considerations in mind. \"We really have this responsibility by an agency mind,\" Tillement said, emphasizing Mila's commitment to ethical AI practices.\n\nThe physical layout of Mila's facilities is designed to foster interaction and collaboration. With common areas and a single coffee machine for everyone, the institute encourages spontaneous discussions and idea exchanges. \"The keyword is interaction... you have a whiteboard with pens, so we can go and stop to think about the project,\" Tillement described, illustrating the informal yet innovative culture at Mila.\n\nMila, through its strategic partnerships, educational initiatives, and groundbreaking research, continues to shape the future of AI. By fostering a collaborative environment and prioritizing ethical considerations, Mila not only advances technological frontiers but also ensures that AI serves the greater good of humanity.

For example, a common dispute trigger between parties stem from revised drawings which may not be entirely complete, clear or accompanied with change orders. By training the generative AI with more data across different data sets, the underlying algorithm is able to record revisions made and avoid the confusion of records between the parties. This can also be used to track consequential increases (or decreases) in costs.\n\nIn the e-discovery space, generative AI could further the current tools which are used for generic document review. While current machine learning tools in this space are used to identify and prioritise relevant documents, generative AI could take this a step further by producing summary of keys facts which could be helpful for chronology building at the outset. The real advantage of generative AI in this area is its ability to interpret a query to create meaningful outputs. In essence, it could help to produce responses to prompts based on a specific corpus of documents, which could be very useful in the context of a construction claim.\n\nFrom our own experience, while the answers produced by the generative AI tools are typically fluent, they are not always factually accurate. Nonetheless, it is a promising technology, and it is expected that future iterations of these tools will be improved to provide citations referencing specific documents to check factual accuracy. It is however important to bear in mind that current forms of generative AI would still be limited in responding to queries with reference to technical and construction related concepts, as its primary set of knowledge is based on the corpus of documents.\n\nUnlike traditional or conversational AI, which is trained from data sets of human input, generative AI is trained on different sets of data to learn patterns to create content with predictive patterns. Essentially it removes the sole reliance on accurate human input to train the AI model, which means that it could possibly be less subjected to human biases. However, there is still a risk that the data sets used to train generative AI which spans across historic cases, data and records may not be kept up-to-date and be ridden with flaws. This would be a problematic consequence as the predictive patterns produced by generative AI could be inaccurate. This is likely to be an issue in this region given that many of the projects on foot or planned are novel, first-of-their-kind projects.", "source": {"uri": "nortonrosefulbright.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "nortonrosefulbright.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Analytics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Machine_Learning", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Natural_Language", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Natural Language", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://www.nortonrosefulbright.com/-/media/images/nrf/hero/ai12.jpg?revision=&revision=4611686018427387904", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619220", "eventUri": "eng-9619220", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

The introduction of PCs equipped with fancy new AI chips, capable of running as digital assistants in the background and faster computing power, could boost sales that have been sagging since the upgrade cycle boosted by remote workers during Covid peaked in late 2021.\n\nOn Sunday, comments from AI chip leader Nvidia, whose CEO, Jensen Huang, told the audience at the 2024 Taipei International Information Technology Show, better known as Computex, about exciting new deals with two PC makers, Asus and MSI, to include AI chips in desktops and laptops.\n\n\"Your future laptop will be constantly helping you in the background,\" Huang said, adding, \"The PC will run apps that are enhanced by AI, from writing, photo editing, to digital humans that are AIs.\"\n\nAsus and MSI did not provide timelines for when these new laptops will hit e-commerce websites or brick-and-mortar shelves of electronic retailers. But when they do, they're expected to unleash an AI PC upgrade wave, thus boosting sales for technology hardware stocks.\n\nThat's precisely what Goldman analysts believe in a recent note titled \"The Next AI Trade: PC AI Upgrades.\"\n\nAnalysts led by GS' Faris Mourad believe the tech hardware industry, which peaked during the Covid upgrade cycle, is primed for another liftoff.\n\n\"During the pandemic, the tech hardware industry peaked as the majority of work-from-home employees purchased equipment. The space currently has fully unwind this cycle and we notice stocks like HPQ trading at 9x their 2025 earnings estimates.\n\n\"Most PCs purchased during the pandemic are expected to be replaced soon. We expect discernable new features of AI, enhanced security, and stronger computational power in upcoming PC and mobile device models, incentivizing the US consumer to spend more on newer equipment than historically, creating an unusually stronger cycle.\"\n\nMourad revealed that GS clients can capitalize on the AI PC upgrade cycle through the new PC & Mobile Device AI Upgrades basket (GSXUPCAI).\n\n\"The basket is composed of technology hardware stocks that may benefit from PC and mobile device renovations that could include AI features. The basket can trade up to $250m in one day with no name exceeding 10% of ADV,\" the analyst said.\n\nGSXUPCAI is catching up to the AI Software & Hardware index (GSTMTAIP).\n\nValuations for this sector remain the lowest compared to NDX and AI software and hardware, but the gap is narrowing.\n\nHere are the individual weightings of the new index:\n\nThis new theme builds on the previous notes \"The Next AI Trade\" and \"The Next AI Trade...

Their charisma, talent, and charm were only savored in movie theaters, a place that allowed the magic of cinema to unfold. The exclusivity of the big screen was seen as paramount even as television gained traction, as the latter was seen as an inferior medium.\n\nHowever, we've seen an exciting shift in this paradigm over the past few decades. Major stars have transcended big screen exclusivity by starring in the golden age of television and eventually opening up real-time and two-way entertainment on social media. Due to the latter, the term \"influencer\" is no longer a secondary status but a sought-after career and can even be parlayed into movie-star status. These barriers to traditional stardom have now disintegrated, making way for more accessible and intimate connections between celebrities and their fans.\n\nWith that said, the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and the world of celebrities prompts a thought-provoking question: Should celebrities use AI techniques to connect better with their audiences?\n\nThe idea of using AI to deepen connections between celebrities and fans has gone from science fiction only a few years ago to nonfiction today. This sentiment was recently shared by Canadian musician and producer Grimes, who sparked a conversation about it on the platform formerly known as Twitter. She proposed that AI could empower artists to expand their reach and scale up their time, a sentiment that I also endorse. By using AI, we can amplify the capabilities of celebrities, enabling them to interact with their fans in previously unimaginable ways.\n\nProducing media with AI's assistant at this speed and scale isn't just about fan interactions, it's about better business. 451 Research forecasts revenue from use cases of generative AI like this will skyrocket from $3.7B in 2023 to $36.4B by 2028. Combine that with another recent study that shows AI video production alone will grow into a $1.5B market by 2028, and it becomes clear why large media and entertainment conglomerates see the writing on the wall.\n\nAI enables unprecedented production speed and a new way for celebrities to deepen their relationships with even more fans by engaging on multiple levels and fostering a more profound understanding of their audience's desires and expectations. For example, most people, let alone celebrities, can't speak every language fluently.\n\nHowever, generative AI has made incredible strides in breaking down language barriers. Even Hollywood directors like Scott Mann are using AI to address these types of issues. Generative AI models can be trained on large multilingual datasets to translate text from one language to another automatically for localizing content. As such, they can handle complex grammatical structures and nuances that might be challenging for traditional rule-based translation systems.\n\nFrom there, the technology can convert spoken language into written text and vice versa, which can then be translated or used for subtitling in different languages making generative AI particularly useful for making content accessible to a global audience.\n\nEven now, celebrities who take advantage of AI-powered duplicates can stay true to their brand and identity while achieving age-defying feats that a human star cannot. One of the most notable examples of this is the de-aging process moviegoers have come to recognize in major Hollywood movies such as Will Smith in Gemini Man, Brad Pitt in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, and Mark Hamill in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. These examples make it clear that generative AI is already a part of mainstream culture and illustrate how celebrities of a finite age can broaden the age demographic they appeal to.\n\nOf course, the primary concern that arises when we talk about AI in the context of stardom is the preservation of an artist's identity. It's become a major stumbling block in the current Hollywood strike as studios and actors negotiate over the ownership of digital avatar likenesses.\n\nThe concern was also explored in a recent and critically acclaimed episode of Black Mirror, highlighting what could happen when streaming platforms take advantage of celebrities' identities. But even in the episode, AI wasn't the villain; the real guilty party was unsavory business practices.\n\nIt should be a given that royalties should compensate celebrities for their identities.\n\nThe primary goal is not to create content that the celebrity wouldn't endorse but to provide them with the tools to amplify their authentic voices and interactions. It's a monumental opportunity for stars to go multiple levels deeper in their interactions with their audiences.\n\nHowever, as with any revolutionary shift, the integration of AI into celebrity culture doesn't come without challenges. There's a learning curve involved, and studios, celebrities, and their audiences need time to understand and adapt to this new reality. But this initial resistance is reminiscent of the initial pushback against social media. And look where we are now -- celebrities across the globe are using social media platforms to connect with their fans daily.\n\nWhen it comes to Hollywood-driven AI techniques, it's not just about better connections or deeper interactions; it's about the future of stardom itself. However, the exact impact will depend on how the industry adopts, integrates, and uses these technologies and techniques. Both actors and writers in Hollywood have some reservations about using AI in their craft. But as we saw with the rise of social media use among celebrities and influencers, AI can also play a similar role in enhancing the stardom of human stars.\n\nNow is the time to embrace the technological evolution of stardom, one AI innovation at a time. Because the future of stardom is rooted in more profound connections, deeper interactions, and a better understanding between celebrities and their fans. It's a future where stars don't just influence but also connect, and fans don't just watch but also interact in real time.\n\nIn the evolving landscape of AI and stardom, it's not just about being a face on the big screen, a voice on a track, or a photo on a magazine cover.

The country's history of censorship and surveillance expands its approach to AIwrites Linette Lopez of Business Insider.\n\nThe CCP's AI plan is to shape reality and strengthen its power, according to internal documents. To this end, the government has final approval of the large language models and the data on which they were trained.\n\nIn short, it's less about \"acting fast and breaking things\" and more about \"proceeding in a government-approved way and avoiding upsetting the status quo.\"\n\nChina's efforts to exert control over AI come at a critical time for the country.\n\nAs Linette has previously reported, China's bright economic future has diminished considerably. And its recovery plan Chinese shock 2.0 will not come easily and will not be well received by the rest of the world.\n\nAs AI chatbots become the new method of receiving information, it is no wonder that the CCP is ensuring that AI It is messages through.\n\nHowever, this is not a call for a libertarian approach to generative AI.\n\nAs we have seen recently, the absence of safeguards brings its share of problems. The end results range from funny (don't make your pizza with glue) to infuriating (AI abuses creative work).\n\nAnd faced with these mishaps, the response of those responsible rarely exudes the confidence of someone who is completely in control. Instead, we all feel like we're jumping into an AI-led journey and hoping for the best.\n\nSo imposing some types of rules around technology, even if not to the extent that the CCP has done, seems like a good idea.\n\nBut this poses another problem. How can we expect legislators, who often struggle with the basics of technologyto grasp something that people on the cutting edge can barely understand?\n\nIn the meantime, China could expand the AI control and surveillance tools it creates to other regimes with similar ideologies.\n\nThis is a painful result.\n\n\"The digital curtain that AI can construct in our imagination will be far more impenetrable than iron, making it impossible for societies to cooperate in a common future,\" writes Linette.\n\nThe Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, associate editor and presenter, in New York.

However, according to a World Economic Forum analysis, nearly a quarter of all jobs globally will still record changes in the next five years as they are likely more susceptible to AI-driven change.\n\nIt predicted that AI would bring three significant changes to the finance division: job cuts, job creation, and increased efficiency.\n\nIn its report, Citi GPS highlighted that banks already rely on tech-driven solutions. It noted that the headcount in tech roles has increased in the past few decades as focus has been placed on digitisation and digital transformation.\n\nIt argued, \"Despite the 2010s tech revolution, financial jobs as a percentage of total employment remained stable at around 5.5 percent.\n\n\"Similarly, the introduction of Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) from the late 1960s onwards did not lead to a drop in the number of human tellers employed by banks in the US. In fact, from the 1970s onwards until the mid-2000s, the number of human tellers employed in physical bank branches exploded as the U.S. economy and financial sector both grew rapidly in size.\"\n\nThe thought leadership product stated that AI will introduce new roles, providing ample time for people to move on to more important tasks.\n\n\"New roles will emerge in AI governance, model training, and output monitoring. Also, existing human staff, in coding or other roles, will have more time to focus on other value-added tasks,\" it said.\n\nFor companies, the report added that firms that empower their staff to execute technological change and transformation will have their market shares and/or profit margins impacted mainly at the expense of slower competitors.\n\n\"The main beneficiaries will likely be firms with a comprehensive AI strategy and a clear future target operating model that considers how to attract the right talent, solve for legacy technology, and deal with unstructured data sets across the organisation before putting AI to work,\" it added.\n\nRecently, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase warned that the financial industry must invest in AI infrastructure to remain competitive.\n\nIn a recent post, FSDH Merchant Bank highlighted how AI will help Nigerian banks improve their efficiency.

That's why incorporating AI startups and scaleups in these conversations is so important.\"\n\nNoting the commitments of AI safety institutes to collaborate with AI developers, as well as the amount of talent these bodies are looking to hire from industry, Adam Cantwell-Corn, head of campaigns and policy at Connected by Data, said there is an education-to-employment pipeline in the tech sector that allows only a narrow set of ideas through.\n\nDescribing this as an \"insidious and pervasive form of [regulatory] capture that needs to be grappled with\", he said tech firms play a huge role in shaping academic research agendas on AI via funding and access to compute that only they have.\n\n\"The companies largely determine what happens in academic circles and therefore the people that actually get to that level of expertise, their intellectual and knowledge set has been shaped by quite a limited and narrow set of perspectives and interests,\" he said, adding that this leads to \"technical and technocratic\" approaches being favoured over \"socio-technical\" approaches that take into account the wider societal effects of AI systems in the specific contexts they're deployed.\n\nHe added there needs to be a plurality of voices and perspective when considering questions about if and how to introduce new AI: \"That includes civil society, it includes affected communities, it includes workers who are going to be implementing it, but also workers who are going to be on the sharp end of it.\"\n\nTo get around these issues, Cantwell-Corn said governments need to foster independent expertise that isn't reliant on funding or sponsorship from the companies. \"We've got a risk of creating groupthink here, [so] we need to galvanise and build the capacity of civil society to contest that,\" he said.\n\nBello largely agreed, noting that while there are many \"amazingly talented people\" in the AI sector who \"would be thrilled to work for the common interest\", the independent funding mechanisms to allow them to do this simply don't exist right now.\n\nShe added that government should therefore be focused on creating \"conditions for their freedom of thought and freedom of manoeuvre\", but noted this would be a process rather than an overnight change.\n\nMatt Davies, the UK public policy lead at the Ada Lovelace Institute, said while the commitments and agreements signed at the summit help set a direction of travel and send signals out about the need for responsible, safe and inclusive AI, the problems at the last summit around the lack of trade union and civil society representation are still very much present.\n\n\"We'd really like to see more civil society and public engagement in these processes. This was a big criticism we and others made of the Bletchley Summit, and it's not necessarily been remedied this time around,\" he said.\n\n\"That also goes for the institutes being set up. So far, there's been relatively limited civil society engagement with the leadership of those institutes, or presence at board level that could help to set priorities and ensure that public concerns really centred.\"\n\nDavies also said there is an urgent need for more socio-technical expertise to be brought to the global network of safety research bodies being set up, which can then work with \"regulators and enforcement agencies on contextual downstream evaluation and how these systems are actually working in society\".\n\nDavies shared his hope that the money put aside by the UK government to fund research into systemic AI risks would be a step towards adopting a more socio-technical approach to AI safety.", "source": {"uri": "computerweekly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Computer Weekly"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Big Tech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldview", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Worldview"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Weekly", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer Weekly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_society", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Civil society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_safety", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AI safety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurality_(voting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plurality (voting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technocracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Technocracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pipeline transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ada Lovelace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Groupthink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_thought", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of thought"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of the United Kingdom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trade union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Economic", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 22}], "image": "https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/visuals/ComputerWeekly/HeroImages/AdobeStock_636816569-gugu-AI-PC.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619220", "eventUri": "eng-9619220", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

Now, an innovation has appeared in the beta version that fits current trends perfectly. This isn't the usual AI promoted by manufacturers and service providers, but a generative image AI.\n\nThis AI doesn't answer questions or edit texts. Instead, it creates images and graphics based on your descriptions. This image AI has now appeared in the beta version of WhatsApp, a pre-release version of the software used by developers to test new ideas with a small group of users.\n\nThe reliable blog WABetaInfo reports this update. A screenshot shows the new \"Imagine\" option in the interface, alongside other options like audio, business cards, and location. This suggests you might soon be able to ask the AI to create and send an image to your contact.\n\nBehind this, according to the blog, is the possibility of creating your own images with the help of the AI. This is based on Meta's own AI and will be rolled out to all users in a later update.\n\nCurrently, only a few beta testers can use the function. However, the blog dampens the anticipation of the new feature. Because so far, Meta's AI is not available in all countries, and therefore the new feature will likely only be available in those countries. It is still uncertain how quickly the image revolution in WhatsApp will come to all users.", "source": {"uri": "nextpit.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AndroidPIT"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Software release life cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voicemail", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Voicemail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videotelephony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Videotelephony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Avatar (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_messaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Text messaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Images", "label": "dmoz/Science/Astronomy/Images", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Beta_Releases", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Beta Releases", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Methods_and_Techniques/Imaging_Science", "label": "dmoz/Science/Methods and Techniques/Imaging Science", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://fscl01.fonpit.de/userfiles/7715851/image/WhatsApp-generic.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619220", "eventUri": "eng-9619220", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

The majority of business and technology leaders using GenAI are focusing on efficiency and cost-effectiveness gains, according to a 2024 Deloitte survey, with 91% of respondents reporting that they \"expect generative AI to improve their organization's productivity.\"\n\nFor software developers, generative AI is a game changer, though I think the term \"artificial intelligence\" can be misleading. It's not actually intelligent; it crunches numbers, recognizes patterns and processes data at a speed beyond human capabilities. It's no replacement for human expertise and execution, but it can take the lead on mundane, repetitive tasks, allowing teams to dedicate more time and energy toward critical thinking, problem-solving and collaboration.\n\nA 2023 McKinsey study showed that generative AI tools can significantly improve software developers' productivity on common tasks: \"Documenting code functionality for maintainability (which considers how easily code can be improved) can be completed in half the time, writing new code in nearly half the time, and optimizing existing code (called code refactoring) in nearly two-thirds the time.\" And GitHub's research found that Copilot, its popular AI development tool, helps developers complete tasks up to 55% more quickly.\n\nBy using GenAI tools on my own development team, I've discovered that they are most valuable in two key applications.\n\n* Code suggestion and autocompletion: AI can analyze developers' code as they work, automatically generating recommendations for code snippets or complete functions based on context and input. Autocompletion reduces manual coding time, especially when there are blocks of repetitive code in a project.\n\n* Code analysis and bug detection: Generative AI can quickly review code to detect errors or bugs early in the development process. AI tools can also learn from historical data and automate code pattern analysis, proposing modifications to improve code blocks.\n\nTo maximize the benefits of AI in software development, I recommend the following four strategies.\n\nExperiment with a variety of AI plugins and platforms to find one that best fits your team's needs. Test each tool on basic tasks, then scale up to bigger projects, such as detailed code creation or bug analysis, to gauge where it offers the maximum benefit.\n\nThe quality of your results depends on the quality of your prompts. Learn how and what to ask GenAI to get the most out of your programming tools. If you don't get the answer you're looking for with your first query, iterate to refine your prompt. Provide additional context and specific requirements to guide AI toward your desired outcomes.\n\nGenAI can greatly improve your efficiency in code creation, but it still needs human oversight. I see AI as just another tool in an experienced developer's toolbox. You can't expect a junior developer to write perfect code with GenAI, in the same way you can't expect a junior marketer to write a flawless article using ChatGPT. You may end up with a solid structure and some sections that work well, but you'll also likely have blocks that need to be debugged or rewritten. Have a senior developer on your team double-check everything AI creates to prevent errors.\n\nBe mindful of data privacy and security considerations when using GenAI for software development. Set clear team policies that prohibit sharing sensitive client data or proprietary information with AI providers that make queries publicly available.\n\nWhile GenAI can significantly enhance your team's productivity, it's not a panacea. It's a valuable tool when trained and used correctly. You can't expect it to work miracles, but you can leverage it to save time and money throughout the development pipeline. Set realistic expectations, and use AI tools strategically and thoughtfully -- in conjunction with human expertise and oversight -- to deliver software solutions more efficiently than ever before.\n\nForbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives.

Think about how navigating and implementing AI can complement your existing professional development pathways or other HR initiatives.\n\nAcknowledging AI's role in your business evolution is just the beginning. Bringing forward options for implementation is a much more pragmatic approach. It starts with simple education: a basic understanding of the tools at your employees' disposal, their most common applications, and their potential risks.\n\nPeople will always remain at the heart of your business - your most important asset and the lifeblood of your organizational culture - but you can enhance their productivity by leaning into certain generative AI. And in doing so, you can free them up to become better people leaders.\n\nDeveloping the next wave of managers is often about enhancing transparency and accountability, and giving people the tools they need to lead every day.\n\nAdoption rates for generative AI will continue to outpace awareness and understanding. The earliest regulations and guardrails are just now emerging, and the fallout is different in certain countries and industries.\n\nIt's incumbent on HR teams to distill and distribute this information in a manner that both informs and insulates. Give leadership the top takeaways, but don't burden them by fear-mongering or poring over tedious details.\n\nFind practical means of upskilling people; seize on ways in which they may already be leveraging AI while adding structure. Give managers the autonomy to encourage upskilling, reskilling, and product mastery where possible, through avenues such as webinars or office hours focused on the many evolving AI use cases.\n\nConsider it a matter of competitive differentiation.\n\nBecause frankly, if you don't... another employer will. Embracing AI doesn't mean adopting it without caution. It means acknowledging its emergence and elevating how it enhances employee efficiency (as opposed to eliminating it).\n\nProfessional development plans are often fluid. If you're approaching them accordingly, then AI is just another variable to consider, no different from past advances like video conferencing or cloud computing.\n\nYou can lay the groundwork for an AI upskilling track by:\n\nTo take it a step further, do some research - and gather employee feedback - on the sorts of certifications they can already learn from and apply to their day-to-day work.\n\nThe generative AI landscape is shifting daily, so it's not realistic to expect one HR rep, or even one HR team, to keep up with all the latest developments and options. Use your people as a resource, and think about how AI can bolster human-to-human interactions, such as through meeting management software, or by enhancing feedback loops.\n\nThe more you incorporate its known capabilities and benefits into your talent development roadmaps, the better equipped you'll be to answer employee questions and adjust to future developments.", "source": {"uri": "hrdive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HR Dive"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_resources", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Human resources"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pragmatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pragmatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Professional development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizational_culture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Organizational culture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Evolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Autonomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Accountability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videotelephony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Videotelephony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_conferencing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Web conferencing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Human_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Human Resources", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://www.hrdive.com/imgproxy/qRIWRUmQUEdDIEx18jIJ3wgt23179N0m-Sn0AlsD7sU/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/bG9jYWw6Ly8vZGl2ZWltYWdlL0dldHR5SW1hZ2VzLTE0ODQzMTY5OTYuanBn.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619220", "eventUri": "eng-9619220", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 118, "relevance": 1}

Among the world's best-known system integrators are Accenture (NYSE:ACN) and India's Wipro (NYSE:WIT). Many companies around the world are looking to utilize AI. Indeed, according to a recent survey by Gartner, 46% of chief information officers globally are seeking to implement AI systems, but only 4% have experience with launching AI. As a result, many if not most of the companies which decide to utilize AI on a wide scale for the first time are likely to hire system integrators. For investors who want to exploit this trend, here are the three best AI systems integrator stocks to buy now.\n\nOn May 29, C3.ai reported very impressive Q4 results as its revenue jumped 20% versus the same period a year earlier to $86.6 million. Moreover, its net cash used in operating activities dropped to $62.36 million from $115.69 million in Q1 of 2023.\n\nBooz Allen Hamilton (NYSE:BAH) specializes in carrying out system integration on behalf of federal agencies. AI is becoming a major revenue generator for the company. Indeed, it estimates about 5.6% of its revenue, or about $600 million, during fiscal year 2023 was related to AI. The firm is looking to nearly double that number to $1 billion in the next couple of years.\n\nSince the Biden Administration recently ordered federal agencies to step up their use of AI, I believe that Booz Allen can meet its goal, greatly boosting its financial results and BAH stock in the process.\n\nThe company reported strong overall Q4 2023 results as its top line climbed 14% year-over-year to $2.77 billion. Meanwhile, its operating income nearly doubled to $254 million versus $138.8 million YOY.\n\nBooz Allen's high leverage to the federal government which is poised to rapidly implement AI make Booz one of the best AI system integrator stocks.\n\nIn recent weeks, IBM (NYSE:IBM) has made several key deals that should enable it to meaningfully expand its AI integration business.\n\nOn May 8, the company disclosed that it would partner with European software giant SAP (NYSE:SAP) to create new generative AI and cloud solutions. Specifically, IBM will add AI functionality to SAP's offerings. The agreement should lead to IBM getting many new deals to help SAP's many customers learn how to effectively integrate and utilize these new capabilities. Indeed, the companies noted that IBM's consultants will \"transform the way they deliver SAP solutions to boost productivity and mitigate risk by leveraging generative AI.\"\n\nOn May 15, IBM announced that its consultants would begin integrating Palo Alto's (NASDAQ:PANW) AI-powered security products to customers. Given the high popularity of Palo Alto's IT security tools, the deal should be a positive needle mover for IBM.\n\nFinally, IBM recently said that it would buy software maker HashiCorp (NASDAQ:HCP). According to Bank of America, the deal will make IBM's software for private clouds more appealing. As a result, IBM will likely get more cloud migration deals, many of which c0uld also include AI integration opportunities, going forward.", "source": {"uri": "investorplace.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "InvestorPlace"}, "authors": [{"uri": "larry_ramer@investorplace.com", "name": "Larry Ramer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_integrator", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Systems integrator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wipro", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wipro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accenture", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Accenture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gartner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_information_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief information officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IBM"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Booz_Allen_Hamilton", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Booz Allen Hamilton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAP", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "SAP"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_integration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "System integration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fiscal year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_migration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human migration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palo_Alto,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Palo Alto, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Palo Alto, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/ERP", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/ERP", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Enterprise_Application_Integration", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Enterprise Application Integration", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://investorplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/magnificent-7-mnm-ai1600.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619220", "eventUri": "eng-9619220", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-29", "textStart": 720, "textEnd": 726}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-08", "textStart": 2039, "textEnd": 2044}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-15", "textStart": 2579, "textEnd": 2585}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 117, "relevance": 1}

But in a 2023 survey conducted for Deloitte, more than 75% of companies polled said they're concerned about legal risks related to intellectual property, such as copyright-infringement claims.\n\nThese are legitimate worries, said Peter Yu, a law and communications professor and the director of the Center for Law and Intellectual Property at Texas A&M University. Executives should be concerned with whether they can protect their creative output and whether using artificial intelligence could open them up to legal liability.\n\nThere are already lawsuits related to these issues, Yu said. For example, the Authors Guild and several high-profile authors, including George R.R. Martin, the writer of the \"Game of Thrones\" books, filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, claiming copyright infringement.\n\nWhile these cases revolve around the use of copyrighted work to train AI models, Yu said they could affect the entire landscape of AI-generated content -- but it's not yet exactly clear how. He said the outcome of the cases would shed more light on how marketers could be affected when using AI to create content.\n\nYu spoke with Business Insider about these issues in more detail and offered some advice for marketers developing their craft in the age of AI.\n\nThe following has been edited for clarity and length.\n\nWhat should marketing executives know about protecting their creative output when using AI?\n\nThe US Copyright Office has taken the view that any work autonomously generated by AI would not be protected under copyright law and has declined to register several works. The federal court has upheld the office's decision.\n\nIt's not that if you use AI, all of a sudden you'll lose copyright protection. The key to getting protection is to demonstrate that there's enough human creative input. At the moment, many marketers actually have a lot of human creative input, even though they're using AI tools.\n\nSo using AI on a work doesn't automatically prohibit someone from registering a claim to copyright?\n\nIf 10% of the work is created by AI, but then you bring in designers to do refinement, and the other 90% is actually done by humans, as long as you claim it properly, you'd still be able to get a copyright registration. But if you just go to an AI platform, type in a single prompt, and use that content, it may not be protectable.\n\nWhy should marketers be concerned about copyright infringement if they're using AI?\n\nA lot of cases that have been filed under copyright infringement are directed toward AI developers. They're suing them for using copyrighted works as training data without authorization. But the way the copyright law is written, there's no reason why the copyright holders cannot sue other users.\n\nWho is most likely to face a lawsuit due to infringement from AI use?\n\nRight now, a lot of users are individuals who are playing with the tools and not using the content for commercial purposes. From a legal standpoint, it doesn't make sense to go after these individuals. But if companies are using the tools to make money, then there's no reason why the copyright holders cannot sue them.\n\nThe use of AI for commercial purposes could open you to legal liability or legal threats of copyright infringement. Even if a company can prove before a court that they're not infringing, having a threat would require them to use a lot of resources to defend themselves.\n\nWhat's one piece of advice that you have for marketers as they use AI for content creation?\n\nOn the intellectual-property side, it's important to make sure to document the human creative input, especially if you're trying to apply for copyright. Even if you don't, it would still be useful to know what part is created by humans and what part is created by AI. It would be important to figure out early on as they integrate AI into their creative process.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "erica_sweeney@businessinsider.com", "name": "Erica Sweeney", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authors_Guild", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Authors Guild"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_R._R._Martin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George R.

The primary concern revolves around the ethical implications of using AI in such a critical capacity.\n\nLegal professionals argue that while AI can be a valuable tool for research and drafting, the final responsibility and decision-making should rest with a human lawyer.\n\nProfessor Adewale, a prominent legal scholar, commented, \"The use of AI in the legal profession is inevitable and can be beneficial. However, relying entirely on AI for defense strategies undermines the human elements of judgment, empathy, and ethics that are crucial in legal proceedings.\"\n\nThe Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) has launched an investigation into the incident.\n\nIf the lawyer is found to have breached professional conduct rules, he could face severe repercussions, including suspension or disbarment. This case could set a precedent for how AI tools are regulated and used within the legal profession in Nigeria and potentially worldwide.\n\nThe judiciary has also taken an interest in the matter, with calls for clear guidelines on the use of AI in courtrooms.\n\nJustice Adebayo, who presided over the case, stated, \"While technology can aid in the administration of justice, it is essential to ensure that it does not replace the core responsibilities of a legal practitioner,\" he stated.\n\nThis incident has highlighted the growing tension between technological advancement and traditional professional practices.\n\nWhile AI has the potential to increase efficiency and accuracy in the legal field, it also poses significant challenges regarding accountability, transparency, and ethical standards.\n\nMany law firms globally are already using AI for tasks such as legal research, document review, and due diligence.\n\nHowever, this case underscores the necessity of maintaining a balance between utilizing technology and preserving the integrity and human-centric nature of legal practice.\n\nAs the legal community grapples with these issues, the case serves as a wake-up call for regulatory bodies to establish comprehensive guidelines on the use of AI in legal practices. This includes defining the boundaries of AI assistance and ensuring that lawyers remain the primary decision-makers in legal proceedings.\n\nFor the Nigerian lawyer at the center of this controversy, the future remains uncertain.\n\nHowever, his case has undoubtedly sparked a crucial dialogue on the role of AI in the legal profession, emphasizing the need for careful integration of technology while upholding ethical standards and human oversight.\n\nWhile AI offers promising advancements, this incident in Nigeria serves as a pivotal moment for the legal industry to reassess and clearly define the role of artificial intelligence in legal practice, ensuring that technology serves as an aid rather than a replacement for human expertise.", "source": {"uri": "allafrica.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "allAfrica"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precedent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Precedent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagos", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lagos"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lagos"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uganda"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uganda"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disbarment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disbarment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_(legal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defense (legal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jurist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigerian_Bar_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nigerian Bar Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Judiciary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_research", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Legal research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Practice of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_firm", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law firm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courtroom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Courtroom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Accountability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_diligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Due diligence"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Employment", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://cdn08.allafrica.com/static/images/structure/aa-logo-rgba-no-text-square.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619220", "eventUri": "eng-9619220", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 116, "relevance": 1}

She can provide tips to de-stress, eat right, quit tobacco and e-cigarettes, be safer on the roads as well as give information on several other areas of health.\"\n\nAt first glance, Sarah presents as an innovative use of technology for the greater good - an AI-powered assistant capable of offering tailored advice anytime, anywhere, with the potential to help billions.\n\nBut upon closer inspection, Sarah is arguably as much a product of hype and AI FOMO as it is a tool for positive change.\n\nThe artificial intelligence used to build Sarah, generative AI, brings with it an incredible amount of risk. Bots powered by this technology are known to provide inaccurate, incomplete, biased, and generally bad advice.\n\nA recent and infamous case is the now defunct chatbot, Tessa. Developed for the National Eating Disorders Association, Tessa was meant to replace the organization's long-standing human-powered hotline.\n\nBut just days before going live, Tessa went rogue. The bot started recommending that people with eating disorders restrict their calories, have frequent weigh-ins and set strict weight loss goals. Fortunately, NEDA pulled the plug on Tessa and a crisis was averted - but it does highlight the pressing need for caution and responsibility in the use of such technologies.\n\nThis worrying output emphasizes the unpredictable - and at times dangerous - nature of generative AI. It's a sobering illustration that without stringent safeguards, the potential for harm is immense.\n\nWith this cautionary backdrop in mind, one might expect large public health organizations to proceed with extra caution. Yet, this appears not to be the case with the WHO and its chatbot. Despite being clearly aware of the risks associated with generative AI, it has released Sarah to the public.\n\nThe WHO's disclaimer reads as follows:\n\nWHO Sarah is using Generative AI to deliver health messages based on available data. However, the answers may not always be accurate because they are based on patterns and probabilities in the available data. WHO takes no responsibility for any conversation content created by Generative AI.\n\nFurthermore, the conversation content created by Generative AI in no way represents or comprises the views or beliefs of WHO, and WHO does not warrant or guarantee the accuracy of any conversation content. Please check the WHO website for the most accurate information.\n\nBy using WHO Sarah, you understand and agree that you should not rely on the answers generated as the sole source of truth or factual information, or as a substitute for professional advice.\n\nPut simply, it appears WHO is aware of the possibility that Sarah might disseminate convincing misinformation widely, and this disclaimer is its approach to mitigating the risk. Tucked away at the bottom of the webpage, it essentially communicates: \"Here's our new tool. You shouldn't rely on it entirely. You're better off visiting our website.\"\n\nThat said, the WHO is safeguarding Sarah by implementing heavily restricted responses aimed at reducing the risks of misinformation. However, this approach is not foolproof. Recent findings indicate that the bot doesn't always provide up-to-date information.\n\nMoreover, when the safeguards are effective, they can make the chatbot impractically generic and void of valuable substance, ultimately diminishing its usefulness as a dynamic informational tool.\n\nSo what role does Sarah play? If the WHO explicitly recommends that people visit their website for accurate information, then it appears that Sarah's deployment is driven more by hype than by utility.\n\nObviously, the WHO is an extremely important organization for advancing public health on a global scale. I'm not questioning their immense value. But is this the embodiment of responsible AI? Certainly not! This scenario epitomizes the preference for speed over safety.\n\nIt's an approach that must not become the norm for integrating generative AI into business and society. The stakes are simply too high.\n\nWhat happens if a chatbot from a well-respected institution starts propagating misinformation during a future public health emergency, or it promotes harmful dietary practices similar to the infamous Tessa chatbot mentioned earlier?\n\nConsidering the ambitious rollout of Sarah, one might wonder whether the organization is heeding its own counsel. In May 2023, the WHO published a statement emphasizing the need for safe and ethical AI usage, perhaps a guideline it ought to revisit.\n\nWHO reiterates the importance of applying ethical principles and appropriate governance, as enumerated in the WHO guidance on the ethics and governance of AI for health, when designing, developing, and deploying AI for health.\n\nThe six core principles identified by WHO are: (1) protect autonomy; (2) promote human well-being, human safety, and the public interest; (3) ensure transparency, explainability, and intelligibility; (4) foster responsibility and accountability; (5) ensure inclusiveness and equity; (6) promote AI that is responsive and sustainable.\n\nIt's clear that WHO's own principles for the safe and ethical use of AI should guide its decision-making, but it's not when it comes to Sarah. This raises critical questions about its ability to usher in a responsible AI revolution.\n\nIf the WHO is using this tech in such a way, then what chance is there for the prudent use of AI in contexts where financial incentives might compete with or overshadow the importance of public health and safety?\n\nThe response to this challenge necessitates responsible leadership. We need leaders who prioritize people and ethical considerations above the hype of technological advancement. Only through responsible leadership can we ensure the use of AI in a way that truly serves the public interest and upholds the imperative to do no harm.\n\nBrian R.

DFKI will contribute its research expertise in the technology fields of data analysis, generative AI, image and signal recognition and processing as well as AI-based forecasting. Emblica will share its experience in advising companies in the field of business process optimization through AI-based software solutions and their implementation. The collaboration is complemented by the consulting company Remode ME and their expertise in international business development and venture building.\n\nAI'd Forge aims to support companies in identifying the potential of artificial intelligence in their operations, developing customized AI solutions and implementing them.\n\nEmblica focuses, in particular, on those areas in which AI promises a high return on investment and scaling opportunities. DFKI's broad research spectrum and Emblica's many years of practical experience offer companies a combination of in-depth industry knowledge and the latest research results. The aim is to implement these in such a way that the result is seamless integration into the existing company software.\n\nThe joint program under the name \"AI'd Forge\" was presented for the first time May 30, 2024, at the digital convention \"Noerd\" in Rostock, Germany.\n\nPhilipp Koch, Research Administrative Manager at DFKI's department AI in Medical Image and Signal Processing:\n\n\"We aim to support companies in the best possible way with the use of artificial intelligence through AI'd Forge. In doing so, we rely on the expertise and know-how of the DFKI as well as the experience of Emblica to jointly identify challenges and develop tailored solutions for companies.

We always consider a company's needs and resources, and customize our support accordingly, including knowledge transfer to in-house developers. Together with DFKI's expertise and its broad research spectrum, we can significantly improve the way companies approach the implementation of AI.\"\n\nTo this end, DFKI and Emblica have defined a model process that holistically maps the introduction of AI processes in companies. It describes the entire process chain from knowledge transfer to the possible uses of AI through to implementation. In joint workshops, the AI'd Forge team works with the company to identify the business areas with potential for optimization. The next step is to examine which AI technologies and processes could provide a remedy. Before implementation, AI'd Forge draws up a business case that specifically elaborates the expected benefits. The DFKI and Emblica team then examines what is required to develop an adapted AI solution and estimates the time, personnel and financial costs involved. The roll-out occurs based on a concrete development and implementation plan, which also focuses on the transfer of knowledge to in-house developers.\n\nThanks to the collaboration between a German research partner and a Finnish implementation service provider, AI'd Forge offers companies from both countries access to leading expertise in the field of AI. In the future, AI'd Forge could serve as a model for cross-border and cross-sector collaboration with other European partners.\n\nAbout DFKI\n\nThe German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI) was founded in 1988 as a non-profit public-private partnership (PPP).

How AI Makes It More Possible Than Ever", "body": "Long before AI became mainstream, I knew I wanted to quit my 9-to-5 job and pursue a different career path. I hadn't heard of the \"creator economy,\" and I wasn't sure what was available to me as a Chinese immigrant living in the US.\n\nThe pursuit of entrepreneurship became an even higher priority for me when my father passed away from cancer in 2009. When he was first diagnosed two years prior, I arranged my work schedule to visit him as much as I could, only to find myself working on my laptop outside the ICU because I was worried about his medical expenses. \"What if I could find a way to have more freedom in work and in life?\" I wondered.\n\nTo me, freedom meant the ability to spend quality time with loved ones without the permission of another person or company. What was once a distant dream is now the reality I live in today, and one I feel eternally grateful for.\n\nIf being a creator is something you want to explore someday, AI-powered tools can help you on your journey while still letting you be authentically yourself. Here's how my path unfolded -- and how embracing some of today's AI technologies can help you shorten your learning curve.\n\nSince 2009, and over a decade before AI was a household name, I wanted to launch my podcast. But it wasn't until 2014 that I overcame perfectionism and finally published my first episode.\n\nThere was no strategy, no plan and no more than that first episode when I announced the Feisworld Podcast to the public. It was far from perfect. I sounded like a scared chipmunk with a nervously high-pitched voice. Yet it opened up a world of possibilities within months of releasing the show. I interviewed anyone who inspired me as an unsung hero and self-made artist.\n\nWithout AI, learning how to record, produce and market my podcast was the most challenging part. Each one of these skills takes time to master, and you're often on your own without help when you start.\n\nNew AI-powered audio tools speed this process up. Adobe Podcast is a suite that can enhance poor sound quality, edit audio and incorporate royalty-free music seamlessly. And Descript's Text-to-Speech feature lets you create a realistic AI voice of your own.\n\nIn 2018, I gathered a small team of producers and videographers to shoot a docuseries with some of my show's best-known guests and eventually launched the series on Amazon Prime the following year. The process was lengthy and costly, but connecting in person with other creators like Sarah Cooper, Seth Godin and Chris Voss was invaluable.\n\nToday's AI tools would have made both storyboarding and post-production easier to conceptualize.\n\nAdditionally, music AI tools like Beatoven, Aiva and Suno can make audio production and sound effects more possible, even for low-cost production films.\n\nAfter the docuseries, I still had the video storytelling itch, so I dove into the world of YouTube. It was slow at first; the first dozen videos I published received single-digit views. It was only when a video took off unexpectedly in March 2020 that our channel became monetized and brand deals began rolling in. Our journey, as humble and slow going as it is, was featured in Dorie Clark's bestselling book Entrepreneurial You as well as other news outlets.\n\nNowadays, my team and I use TubeBuddy to help optimize on YouTube. The tool's new AI features include a title generator, suggested Shorts and a thumbnail analyzer to help you create that eye-catching image.\n\nIt's easy to argue that AI tools aren't necessary to become a creator. That's true. I just told you about my journey, which I navigated over several years without any AI tools.\n\nHowever, AI would have saved me not just days or weeks, but months of effort in many aspects of the content creation journey. For example, cutting out the \"ums\" and \"uhs\" in my unedited podcast recordings would take hours of work, and now that cleanup is just one click away. Poor recording quality was another struggle, since it depended on the guest, location and time of day. Yet, AI makes it straightforward to improve audio quality and make it sound like you were recording inside a professional studio.\n\nThis was unthinkable not long ago but available in many accessible and affordable tools today.\n\nIt's no longer about working harder but smarter. Quality content creation is no longer reserved for the rich and established creators; many more of us can join in, make a difference and have our work seen. AI has leveled the playing field.\n\nIt's exciting, but also a little scary. It means that we have to learn the new rules of being a content creator in a world where significantly more people can produce content consistently on multiple platforms, engaging with their audience strategically based on analytics.", "source": {"uri": "cnet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNET"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intensive care unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_curve", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Learning curve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Entrepreneurship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chinese language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Laptop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Voss", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christopher Voss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Prime", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon Prime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_documentary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Television documentary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Godin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Seth Godin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Production music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Videography", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Videography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-production", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Post-production"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_synthesis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speech synthesis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storyboard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Storyboard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_creation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Content creation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sound effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monetization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storytelling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Storytelling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thumbnail", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thumbnail"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Tools", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Tools", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Multimedia", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Tools/Trade_Specific_and_Specialty", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Tools/Trade Specific and Specialty", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/3eaff4e2080a880d9e573fdd690bc663379aab74/hub/2024/05/31/a2ebdc09-11dc-4bcd-a5af-8f564c9e8efd/fei-wu.png?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619220", "eventUri": "eng-9619220", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2020-03-", "textStart": 3014, "textEnd": 3024}], "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 113, "relevance": 1}

As I stood before this international assembly, I kicked things off in my keynote by emphasizing one crucial point: lawyers need the right mindset to show up as partners to AI. It's not just about the tech -- it's about us embracing our roles as innovators.\n\n\"What Is The Biggest Legal Tech Opportunity? -- You!\"\n\nPekka Puolakka's words at the start of the conference, \"What is the biggest legal tech opportunity? -- You!\" really hit home. It's not just about shiny new gadgets or apps. The real opportunity lies within us, lawyers and legal professionals. Consider changing your mindset and culture to leverage these tools effectively and serve clients better.\n\nGlobal Teamwork For Legal Tech Progress\n\nOne of the most exciting aspects of FutureLaw 2024 was the global collaboration.

We're looking at a future where legal rules are part of our everyday lives, with smart AI systems spotting and sorting out legal issues before they even happen, ensuring everyone knows their rights.\n\nActionable insight: Stay ahead of the curve by continuously learning about new AI developments and how they can be integrated into your practice. Offer training sessions for your team on the latest legal tech tools to ensure everyone can effectively leverage these advancements.\n\nInsights From The Front Runners\n\nValentin Feklistov, a leader in legal innovation and organizer of FutureLaw 2024, aptly summarized the conference's ethos: \"We are crafting the tools today that will build the legal landscapes of tomorrow. Our work now lays the foundation for a future where justice is not just a concept, but a tangible, accessible reality for all.\" This vision is a call to action for all legal professionals to contribute to creating a more just and accessible legal system.\n\nAlexander Bitskov, another organizer, echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the synergy between human intelligence and AI: \"The combo of human smarts and AI is taking legal services to new places. It's not about replacing people; it's about making things better and reaching new levels of efficiency and accuracy.\"\n\nWrapping Up\n\nAfter taking in everything from FutureLaw 2024, we're clearly on the brink of a transformative era in law. Integrating diverse perspectives and advanced technology sets the stage for a renaissance in our field. As lawyers, we have the opportunity -- and the responsibility -- to shape this future. By embracing change, collaborating globally, and leveraging AI ethically, we can create a legal landscape that is more efficient, accessible, and just.\n\nSo, let's get to work.

Researchers have long struggled to explain the freewheeling \"thinking\" that goes on behind the scenes, with AI chatbots almost magically and effortlessly reacting to any query that's being thrown at them (lies and gaslighting aside).\n\nBut try as they might, tracing back the output to the original material the AI was trained on has proved extremely difficult. OpenAI, despite the company's own name and origin story, has also kept the data it trains its AIs on extremely tightly to its chest.\n\nA panel of 75 experts recently concluded in a landmark scientific report commissioned by the UK government that AI developers \"understand little about how their systems operate\" and that scientific knowledge is \"very limited.\"\n\n\"Model explanation and interpretability techniques can improve researchers' and developers' understanding of how general-purpose AI systems operate, but this research is nascent,\" the report reads.\n\nOther AI companies are trying to find new ways to \"open the black box\" by mapping the artificial neurons of their algorithms. For instance, OpenAI competitor Anthropic recently took a detailed look at the inner workings of one of its latest LLMs called Claude Sonnet as a first step.\n\n\"Anthropic has made a significant investment in interpretability research since the company's founding, because we believe that understanding models deeply will help us make them safer,\" reads a recent blog post.\n\n\"But the work has really just begun,\" the company admitted. \"The features we found represent a small subset of all the concepts learned by the model during training, and finding a full set of features using our current techniques would be cost-prohibitive.\"\n\n\"Understanding the representations the model uses doesn't tell us how it uses them; even though we have the features, we still need to find the circuits they are involved in,\" Anthropic wrote. \"And we need to show that the safety-relevant features we have begun to find can actually be used to improve safety.\"\n\nAI interpretability is an especially pertinent topic, given the heated debate surrounding AI safety and the risks of having an artificial general intelligence go rogue, which to some experts represents an extinction-level danger for humanity.\n\nAltman himself recently dissolved the company's entire so-called \"Superalignment\" team, which was dedicated to finding ways to \"steer and control AI systems much smarter than us\" -- only to anoint himself as the leader of a replacement \"safety and security committee.\"\n\nGiven the embattled CEO's latest comments, the company has a long way to go before it'd be able to reign in any superintelligent AI.\n\nOf course, it's in Altman's best financial interest to keep reassuring investors that the company is dedicated to safety and security -- despite having no clue how its core products actually work.\n\n\"It does seem to me that the more we can understand what's happening in these models, the better,\" he said during last week's conference. \"I think that can be part of this cohesive package to how we can make and verify safety claims.\"", "source": {"uri": "futurism.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Futurism"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

AI Orders will be offered as part of GrubAssist, GrubMarket's groundbreaking suite of enterprise AI assistants that empower food supply chain businesses with deep insights, intelligent analysis, and smart, automated workflows.\n\nRecommended AI ML Story of the Week: How Generative AI Is Changing Customer Service\n\nIn today's fast-paced business environment, food wholesalers and distributors often struggle with the manual, inefficient, and time-consuming process of intaking customer orders. Many businesses process a high volume of orders that arrive via traditional channels like phone, text message, and email, each with a large number of complex line items expressed in vague and non-standardized language. The process of converting these artifacts into orders in the distributor's ERP system is invariably error-prone, labor-intensive, and tedious, often leading to costly errors and fulfillment delays, negatively impacting both customer satisfaction and revenue generation potential.\n\nGrubMarket AI Orders addresses these challenges by leveraging advanced artificial intelligence to seamlessly and instantaneously convert emails, text messages, and voicemails into integrated digital orders, enhancing operational efficiency and streamlining how food businesses manage their order flow.\n\nAI News: AI Risks Exist, But Who will Manage These is a Bigger Threat!\n\n\"AI Orders represents a significant leap forward in order management automation.By leveraging the power of AI, this new tool not only provides automatic, instantaneous, 24/7 order entry from voicemails, emails, and text messages, but also allows users to create sales orders efficiently without ever needing to touch their ERP system. Speed of entry is a major advantage in this industry. Instead of spending hours each day transcribing voicemail orders and deciphering text messages sprinkled with typos and vague product descriptions, AI Orders empowers food wholesalers and distributors to focus on what they do best - delivering exceptional products and services to their customers. We're incredibly excited to roll out AI Orders to the food supply chain industry and can't wait to help businesses save more time and money,\" said Mike Xu, CEO of GrubMarket.\n\nGrubMarket AI Orders monitors these multi-channel sources 24/7, automatically extracts order details, validates and maps order items against a customer's unique purchasing history, and translates orders into a standardized digital format. It then seamlessly pushes approved orders into the user's ERP system. This novel solution allows businesses to process more orders at a faster rate while significantly reducing labor costs. Furthermore, AI Orders allows sales representatives who interface directly with customers to conveniently engage with an AI assistant to create and enter new sales orders at any time, from anywhere, without having to log into their ERP system. This offers a level of convenience never before seen in the industry, allowing sales representatives to enjoy greater speed, efficiency, and accuracy in performing a repeated task that they must complete countless times per day.", "source": {"uri": "aithority.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AiThority"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wholesaling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wholesaling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_messaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Text messaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voicemail", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Voicemail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Modular programming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Workflow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_resource_planning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Enterprise resource planning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supply chain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Machine learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_satisfaction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Customer satisfaction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_management_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Order management system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_assistant", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Virtual assistant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Digital data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_monitor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Computer monitor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sales", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Customer_Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Customer Management", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Philosophy", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Philosophy", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Chivalric", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Chivalric", "wgt": 42}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 53}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://aithority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/grubmarket.ai_.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619220", "eventUri": "eng-9619220", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 110, "relevance": 1}

Among the world's best-known system integrators are Accenture (NYSE:ACN) and India's Wipro (NYSE:WIT). Many companies around the world are looking to utilize AI. Indeed, according to a recent survey by Gartner, 46% of chief information officers globally are seeking to implement AI systems, but only 4% have experience with launching AI. As a result, many if not most of the companies which decide to utilize AI on a wide scale for the first time are likely to hire system integrators. For investors who want to exploit this trend, here are the three best AI systems integrator stocks to buy now.\n\nOn May 29, C3.ai reported very impressive Q4 results as its revenue jumped 20% versus the same period a year earlier to $86.6 million. Moreover, its net cash used in operating activities dropped to $62.36 million from $115.69 million in Q1 of 2023.\n\nBooz Allen Hamilton (BAH)\n\nBooz Allen Hamilton (NYSE:BAH) specializes in carrying out system integration on behalf of federal agencies. AI is becoming a major revenue generator for the company. Indeed, it estimates about 5.6% of its revenue, or about $600 million, during fiscal year 2023 was related to AI. The firm is looking to nearly double that number to $1 billion in the next couple of years.\n\nSince the Biden Administration recently ordered federal agencies to step up their use of AI, I believe that Booz Allen can meet its goal, greatly boosting its financial results and BAH stock in the process.\n\nThe company reported strong overall Q4 2023 results as its top line climbed 14% year-over-year to $2.77 billion. Meanwhile, its operating income nearly doubled to $254 million versus $138.8 million YOY.\n\nBooz Allen's high leverage to the federal government which is poised to rapidly implement AI make Booz one of the best AI system integrator stocks.\n\nIBM (IBM)\n\nIn recent weeks, IBM (NYSE:IBM) has made several key deals that should enable it to meaningfully expand its AI integration business.\n\nOn May 8, the company disclosed that it would partner with European software giant SAP (NYSE:SAP) to create new generative AI and cloud solutions. Specifically, IBM will add AI functionality to SAP's offerings. The agreement should lead to IBM getting many new deals to help SAP's many customers learn how to effectively integrate and utilize these new capabilities. Indeed, the companies noted that IBM's consultants will \"transform the way they deliver SAP solutions to boost productivity and mitigate risk by leveraging generative AI.\"\n\nOn May 15, IBM announced that its consultants would begin integrating Palo Alto's (NASDAQ:PANW) AI-powered security products to customers. Given the high popularity of Palo Alto's IT security tools, the deal should be a positive needle mover for IBM.\n\nFinally, IBM recently said that it would buy software maker HashiCorp (NASDAQ:HCP). According to Bank of America, the deal will make IBM's software for private clouds more appealing. As a result, IBM will likely get more cloud migration deals, many of which c0uld also include AI integration opportunities, going forward.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

You can sign up for Business Insider's daily newsletter here.\n\nWelcome back! Lifestyle creep can get the best of us, but it can lead to some serious financial stress. A Harvard professor shares tips for nipping it in the bud.\n\nIn today's big story, we're looking at China's strict approach to overseeing its AI development and the threat it poses to the world.\n\nWhat's on deck:\n\nMarkets: How one of the top hedge funds in the world runs its internship program. Tech: Layoffs are back at Google. Business: American Express is Gen Z's newest status symbol.\n\nBut first, AI, but make it in our vision.\n\nIf this was forwarded to you, sign up here.\n\nThe big story ChatCCP\n\nWe've heard about the dangers of AI running wild, but what kind of risks come from the tech being highly regulated and controlled?\n\nFor the Chinese Communist Party, that's the plan. The country's history of censorship and surveillance is extending to its approach to AI, writes Business Insider's Linette Lopez.\n\nThe CCP's plan for AI is about shaping reality and enforcing its power, according to internal documents. To that end, the government has final sign-off on large language models and the data they were trained on.\n\nIn short, it's less \"move fast and break things\" and more \"proceed in a government-approved fashion and avoid upsetting the status quo.\"\n\nChina's push to exert control over AI comes at a critical juncture for the country.\n\nAs Linette has previously reported, China's bright economic future has dimmed considerably. And its recovery plan -- China shock 2.0 -- won't come easily or be welcomed by the rest of the world.\n\nSo, as AI chatbots become the new method of receiving information, it's no wonder the CCP is making sure AI is getting accurate its messages across.\n\nHowever, this isn't a call for a libertarian approach to generative AI.\n\nAs we've seen recently, a lack of guardrails comes with its own set of problems. The end results range from funny (don't make your pizza with glue) to infuriating (AI misusing creative work).\n\nAnd in the face of these mishaps, the response from the people in charge rarely exudes the confidence of someone completely in control. Instead, it feels like we're all going along for an AI-led drive and hoping for the best.\n\nSo putting in some types of rules around the tech -- albeit not to the degree the CCP has -- seems like a good idea.\n\nBut that poses another issue. How can we expect lawmakers, who often struggle with the basics of tech, to grasp something people on the cutting edge can barely wrap their heads around?\n\nIn the meantime, China could extend the AI tools of control and surveillance it creates to other regimes with similar ideologies.\n\nIt's a distressing outcome.\n\n\"The digital curtain AI can build in our imaginations will be much more impenetrable than iron, making it impossible for societies to cooperate in a shared future,\" Linette writes.\n\n3 things in markets Here come the interns.

For example, users were complaining about Neuroflash having too many features.\n\nHow bad can that be?\n\nCan the platform be so good that people have to nitpick? Read on to find out!\n\nNeuroflash entered the AI scene in 2021 and targets marketers looking to simplify the content creation process. Judging by over 800 5-star reviews, it does an excellent job of meeting its users' requirements.\n\nTo make that happen, it offers a suite of AI tools.\n\nThe platform is primarily known for its AI writing tool, which is its flagship product. It uses GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 language models, which enables it to produce human-like content.\n\nBesides the AI writer, you get an image generator, chatbot, and content performance analyzer. It also integrates with third-party apps to provide plagiarism, grammar, and spell checks, plus SEO analysis.\n\nIt's evident that Neuroflash has a lot to offer, so let's examine these tools in more detail.\n\nStarting with content personalization options, the following sections of this Neuroflash review will explore how the platform's tools work and highlight their core functionalities.\n\nNot long ago, it was all about finding an AI tool capable of producing meaningful content. Now, however, there's an emphasis on tools that can adapt to users' writing styles.\n\nNeuroflash does well when it comes to content personalization. It lets you create a brand voice and fine-tune your content using different writing tones.\n\nWe'll start with brand voices. The AI platform lets you easily create one, offering four ways to do that.\n\nOne of the options is to describe your brand voice. While doing so, you have the Optimize feature, which helps better define the voice you want to create.\n\nAnother way to help AI-generated content match your brand's voice is to add a link to your website and let the tool analyze your writing style.\n\nOther ways include writing or copying an existing text and providing information about your company. The second option lets you add data about your company, competitors, industry, target audience, and other company-related information.\n\nWhichever option you choose, the AI will extract core patterns from your writing.\n\nSo, once you create a brand voice, you can generate texts designed to match your writing style.\n\nAnother feature worth mentioning is the option to set content tonality. The platform lets you select two voice tones. You can pick one of the default tones such as witty, casual, and encouraging. You can add a custom tone, too.\n\nOther content customizations include adjusting the length and choosing the number of results you want the AI to retrieve.\n\nAs you can see, Neuroflash offers plenty of ways to help you turn generic AI content into personalized content.\n\nAfter experimenting with the customization features, you can start creating content. For that, Neuroflash has a dedicated writing tool called ContentFlash.\n\nThe Neuroflash AI writing tool is incredibly intuitive. It offers several easy ways to create content.\n\nThe easiest way is to start with the Blog Article template. It doesn't require much input from you. You add a topic and keyword and select the outline and content results you like most.\n\nAnother way to create content is by starting from scratch, i.e., creating a blank page. Pressing the Space button will show you the available options and let you choose one of them:\n\nI asked the AI tool to create an outline of color meanings.\n\nOnce I got the output, I asked the AI to continue writing. In a couple of minutes, I had a quality post.\n\nFrom here, I could use the Neuroflash Magic Pen to improve the generated text. For that, I had the following actions:\n\nAll these actions are called FlashActions and allow you to tailor the content to your taste.\n\nFor example, if you don't like the output, you can ask the AI to rewrite the content. You can use the Summarize option to shorten the content if it's too broad or wordy.\n\nI also like the Optimize action, which rewrites the text to improve its emotional and readability scores. The emotional score is part of the PerformanceFlash tool, which we'll cover later in this Neuroflash review.\n\nThe results vary, and the AI can't always increase both scores.\n\nI took one paragraph from the article about colors, and the AI improved its readability score. While doing so it decreased the emotional score. Even though the latter was lower, the optimized text sounded much more natural.\n\nAnother impressive feature is the text generator's text type library, which features dozens of text templates for creating and editing content.\n\nThese are divided into 13 categories including blog, sales, website, and social media.\n\nFor example, the Blog category has a template for a blog introduction, paragraph, and conclusion. Combining these text types, you can quickly create a blog post.\n\nThe Pros and Cons list drew my attention, so I decided to try this template and see how good the results would be.\n\nI wanted to create a pros and cons list of having long hair. Here's what I got:\n\nBased on my experience with ContentFlash, the AI writer does a great job of creating quality content.\n\nThe Neuroflash chatbot is called ChatFlash and one of the best things about it is that it has over 100 premade prompts.\n\nSo, if you don't have much experience with AI writing tools, you don't have to learn to write good prompts. Instead, you can use one of the templates and learn as you go.\n\nThe prompt library is versatile, containing prompts for creating outlines, Instagram post ideas, book titles, and job descriptions.\n\nFor my Neuroflash review, I tried the Outline for everything prompt. I asked the chatbot to create an outline for different coffee types.\n\nThen, all I had to do was ask the AI to continue writing for me. In a couple of minutes, my article about coffee types was done.\n\nI tried another prompt, which was to summarize the article, and was satisfied with the results I got.\n\nWith this prompt, the chatbot turned a 400-word text into six lines highlighting the text's main point.\n\nOne other thing I like about ChatFlash is that it offers suggestions.\n\nSo, after summarizing the article, the AI chatbot suggested I create a comparison between espresso and filter coffee.\n\nI could also type a prompt in the box below and use the Optimize button to create a better prompt.\n\nUsing the Optimize feature, I prompted the chatbot to summarize the comparison from above in a single sentence.\n\nNeuorflash has done a great job of incorporating the AI chatbot into its content creation suite.\n\nChatFlash performed well in my tests and is quite helpful in brainstorming ideas and generating content.\n\nOnce you create your content, you can test it with the Neuroflash content performance tool - PerformanceFlash.\n\nIt analyzes your content to evaluate how likely your audience is to respond to the content.\n\nTo analyze a text, the AI will first ask you to choose a text type, briefly describe the topic, and list the keywords you want to include.\n\nAfter that, you'll need to set a goal and decide on the content's readability, sentiment, and associated words.\n\nThe AI will create a couple of content examples, and analyze the ones you select.\n\nYou can then see how your text stacks up to the set goals. If you're not happy with the results, you can use the Optimize feature to improve the content score.\n\nI tested this feature and surprisingly my content score decreased after that. Meanwhile, the analysis gave me insight into how each word impacts the text.\n\nAnother important thing to mention is that the content performance analyzer is best for testing different versions of short texts. For instance, you can use it to test email subject lines, article titles, and other similar content.\n\nI took the tool for another spin, but this time, I wanted shorter text and to create a few blog title ideas.\n\nOptimizing the selected title didn't improve my score this time either.\n\nWhat helped me get the highest score was the color-coded analysis of each word in the title. Using these insights, I created my own title, which had the highest score.\n\nSo, in this case, it's not that much about letting the AI do the job for you, but about reading into the data it retrieved.\n\nNeuroflash complements its AI writing tools with its AI image generator, ImageFlash. It uses DALL-E 3, producing good-quality images.\n\nApart from the image quality, I also like that there's a comprehensive guide about getting the best results.\n\nThe tool is easy to use, too. Upon entering a simple explanation of what you want to be in the image, you can use the Optimize prompt feature. Clicking this option will let you select the image style. The available options include:\n\nAfter you choose the image style, the tool will analyze your prompt and alter it to make it more specific.\n\nI asked the AI to create a realistic photograph of an AI image generator. Here's the result I got:\n\nThe result was good, although somewhat strange.\n\nI also wanted to check the results I'd get with a more creative prompt. So, I prompted the tool to create a graphic of a panda eating a green orange. Here's how that turned out.\n\nAs you can see, the results are hit-and-miss.\n\nThese images were created in standard quality, but there's also the option to increase it to premium quality. The AI generator also supports different ratios, ranging from 1:1 to 16:9.\n\nOnce you create an image, you can easily add it to your text content.\n\nThe AI platform lets you invite members of your team to your workspace. Thanks to this functionality, you can assign tasks to your team, which will help you create content faster.\n\nThere are two roles - admin and member. The admin can invite other members, while members can only access the platform's features without the option to manage other users.\n\nWhat I like about the team feature is that you can share the content you create in ContentFlash, as well as brand voices, with your team members.\n\nBesides the tools we've already covered in this Neuroflash review, the platform has something called Brand Hub.\n\nHere, you can create and add brand voices. You can also create custom prompts, and share them with other team members.\n\nAdditionally, you can share information about your company. This information can be anything from an About Us page and SEO keywords to industry and competitor data.\n\nNeuroflash will use all the information you add to your brand hub to help you create content that aligns with your brand.\n\nWe've come to the tutorial part of this Neuroflash review.\n\nTo start using the AI tool, follow these steps:\n\nThat's it! You can now explore the tool further at your own pace.\n\nNeuorflash has four pricing plans, one of which is free.\n\nThe free version of Neuroflash has its limitations, starting with the AI word count. You can generate 2,000 words/month. The good news is that you can earn an additional 5,000 words by completing the tasks from Neuroflash's Get Started guide.\n\nBesides the word count, the free plan also limits the number of AI images (5), brand voices (1), and SEO analyses (5).\n\nThe paid plans include the following:\n\nWith the Standard plan, the word limit is lifted to 30,000 words/month. You can also create 30 AI images in different dimensions.\n\nHowever, to remove the monthly AI word limit, you'll need the Pro plan. It'll also give you access to advanced workflows, which include SEO score, People Also Ask, and link references in your blog article.\n\nBesides this, the Pro plan removes the SEO analysis cap and lets you scan your content for plagiarism without additional costs. You can use the team function and the advanced version of the platform's grammar and spelling checker.\n\nThe Business plan includes three team members, full access to the PerformanceFlash tool, and an unlimited number of brand voices.\n\nIn my opinion, the platform is an excellent choice for anyone looking to create quality content quickly. It has easy-to-use article and social media post workflows, premade text types, an AI chatbot with premade prompts, and an image generator.\n\nOn top of that, you can optimize your content for search engines, check how well your content will perform, and invite others to help you create content.\n\nThe downside is that there are indeed a lot of features. Once you start using the app, it might be overwhelming. However, once you familiarize yourself with the tools, you can streamline content production.", "source": {"uri": "mspoweruser.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MSPoweruser"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_(list)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Outline (list)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_creation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Content creation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_generator", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electric generator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-4", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "GPT-4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "GPT-3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_term", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Index term"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plagiarism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plagiarism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grammar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Search engine optimization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Library"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coffee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_(signal_processing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Filter (signal processing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DALL-E", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "DALL-E"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Writers_Resources/Writing_Exercises", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Writers Resources/Writing Exercises", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Word_Processors", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Word Processors", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://mspoweruser.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/neuroflash-review.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619220", "eventUri": "eng-9619220", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 108, "relevance": 1}

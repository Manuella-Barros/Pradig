{"id": 232061918, "title": "Jewish students navigate rising antisemitism in Colorado, protests on their college campuses", "text": "For college student Ellie Rapoport, finding a place to belong at Metropolitan State University of Denver is inextricably linked to being Jewish. Rapoport, a junior, got involved with the Jewish student group Hillel as a freshman, making the trek to the University of Denver\u2019s campus for events because there wasn\u2019t a chapter at MSU. She felt completely welcome and made fast friends, finding comfort in the familiarity of praying every Friday and connecting with her roots. \u201cOnce I was approached about starting Hillel (at MSU) I was so excited because I could find a community of Jewish people on my campus,\u201d she said. Rapoport and University of Colorado Denver student Lindsay Abramson began a Hillel chapter at the Auraria Higher Education Center \u2014 the downtown campus shared by CU Denver, MSU and the Community College of Denver \u2014 earlier this year. But since Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 attack on Israel and the resulting war, reports of antisemitism in Colorado have spiked while the state\u2019s most visible pro-Palestinian demonstrations centered on colleges, with protesters staging weeks-long encampments at Auraria and the University of Denver. Those campus demonstrations have ended for now, but in interviews with The Denver Post, Jewish college students and community leaders, and pro-Palestinian protesters, described a fundamental difference in how they perceived the spring protests and the attached ideologies \u2014 like whether support for Israel and support for Judaism can be separated. At Auraria, protesters gathered at the Golda Meir House throughout the school year to demonstrate against Israel and in support of Palestine. That location \u2014 a museum and former home of Israel\u2019s first and only female prime minister \u2014 is where the Hillel chapter initially met. Some demonstrators left chalk graffiti on the building and sidewalks with messages like \u201cTear this down\u201d or \u201cGet Zionists off our campus,\u201d Rapoport said. Students started meeting at the Tivoli Student Union instead, until campus officials told the group that a pro-Palestinian student encampment on the adjacent quad was too much of a safety concern, Abramson said. For Jewish students like Abramson and Rapoport, the spring\u2019s campus anti-war protests at Auraria, DU, CU Boulder and elsewhere in Colorado were regular reminders of increased antisemitism and what happens when people don\u2019t distinguish between protesting the Israeli government and discriminating against Jewish people. \u201cJust because I wear a Star of David and I\u2019m Jewish doesn\u2019t mean you know my beliefs about the conflict,\u201d Abramson said. \u201cPeople are putting Jewish individuals in a category that (we) believe this way, and don\u2019t actually hear my opinion.\u201d Hate crimes increase since Oct. 7 Antisemitic hate crimes in Colorado are on track this year to reach their highest level since before 2008, when the Colorado Bureau of Investigation\u2019s online database began tracking the data. The CBI database tracks bias-motivated crimes, which Colorado law defines as acts that injure someone or their property or make them afraid of those things. Hate crimes are intended to intimidate the victim because of their \u201cactual or perceived race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, physical or mental disability, or sexual orientation,\u201d according to state law. Fifteen antisemitic crimes were reported in the first three months of 2024, the highest first-quarter numbers since before 2008, according to the CBI. That mirrors an increase in late 2023, according to state data. Of the 21 antisemitic crimes reported in 2023, 15 occurred in October, November or December, mostly after Hamas launched its Oct. 7 attack on Israel, killing an estimated 1,200 people and taking approximately 250 people hostage. Israel\u2019s responding attacks in Gaza have killed an estimated 36,000 Palestinians over the last eight months, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. Abramson and Rapoport described being on campus and getting dirty looks when wearing a Star of David necklace or hearing a student respond with \u201cYikes\u201d after learning that their classmate is Jewish. Abramson said she saw an Auraria protester holding a sign that read \u201cWhat Hitler was doing was right\u201d and overheard demonstrators calling pro-Israel counterprotesters \u201cdirty Jews.\u201d \u201cAt this point, I\u2019m just a little numb to it,\u201d Abramson said. \u201cIt does hurt a little bit. If it was any other population, I feel like people would be reacting differently to what\u2019s going on.\u201d Jewish students at DU also have experienced increasing antisemitism, freshman Jaiden Skinner said. Skinner is one of a handful of Jewish DU students who formed a community watch group in May after they said university officials ignored their concerns about feeling unsafe on campus. Students are equipped with flashlights and pepper spray for the worst-case scenario but are mostly there to walk each other across campus if someone feels unsafe. Skinner said she\u2019s been told to go back to Nazi Germany and overheard other protesters telling Jewish students that 1938 would look good on them. \u201cI\u2019ve never experienced such hatred toward the Jewish population in my 20 years of existence,\u201d she said. Student organizers at Auraria and DU repeatedly denied any antisemitism among protesters and said pro-Israel counterprotesters made threats against the pro-Palestinian demonstrators. \u201cThere is a difference between being uncomfortable and being in danger,\u201d said DU graduate student Kristina Brunner, one of the organizers with DU for Palestine. \u201cWe are not the ones who yelled rape threats, we are not the ones who have threatened to physically attack (encampments,) we are not the ones who put nails in students\u2019 car tires because they parked too close to a house with Israeli stuff on it.\u201d Criticizing governments, political bodies and \u201cmass slaughter\u201d might make people uncomfortable, Brunner said, but is not inherently unsafe. \u201cI do understand that people are scared, but I also think people are scared that political ideologies are being challenged in ways that the United States has never seen before,\u201d Brunner said. \u201cI think there are ways to honor life and to protest.\u201d Auraria student organizer Harriet Falconetti said she didn\u2019t see or hear anything antisemitic among protesters and that antisemitism is \u201cabsolutely not tolerated,\u201d adding that Jewish students and community members from Jewish Voice for Peace were involved in campus demonstrations. Fundamental differences in opinion But protesters, students and Jewish leaders described a fundamental difference in what they believe is antisemitic. For Falconetti, Brunner and other pro-Palestinian demonstrators, being against Zionism \u2014 the movement by Jewish people to regain and preserve their historic homeland in what is now Israel \u2014 is not the same as being against Judaism. \u201cThat\u2019s something we\u2019ve been very careful to distinguish at the encampment. We do not think Judaism and Zionism are the same thing,\u201d Falconetti said. Statements like that are a nonstarter for community leaders like Rabbi Joe Black of Denver\u2019s Temple Emanuel. \u201cIf you are approaching dialogue from the perspective that my people, my family, my close friends have no right to be in their legitimate state \u2014 that\u2019s no starting point,\u201d Black said. Recent CU Boulder graduate Dave Phillips also closely connects his Jewish identity with Zionism. After starting a chapter of the international campus organization Students Supporting Israel on the Boulder campus last fall, Phillips was offered a job with the organization. \u201cPeople like to say anti-Zionism isn\u2019t antisemitism, and that\u2019s a fine line,\u201d he said. \u201cCriticism of the Israeli government is fine. But once you start criticizing Israel being a nation, (that) is where it turns into antisemitism. When you say Zionism is racism and a genocidal belief, that\u2019s where it turns into antisemitism.\u201d Black said allegations of Israel committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza \u2014 claims brought to the United Nations\u2019 International Court of Justice and rejected by U.S. and Israeli government officials \u2014 are \u201cblatantly false.\u201d \u201cMany of these protests are echoing Hamas, Hezbollah and Iranian talking points that quite frankly want to see the destruction of the Jewish state and the Jewish people,\u201d Black said. But students like Brunner and DU graduate student and organizer Ash Reid said the war and growing death toll among Palestinians are too important to stop talking about \u2014 and protesting against. \u201cThere\u2019s a genocide happening right now and we\u2019re going to center that, because it\u2019s not being centered in so many conversations,\u201d Reid said. Jewish students Rapoport, Abramson and Skinner talked less about the semantics of the Israel-Hamas war and the decades-old conflict and more about wanting to feel safe on their college campuses, for people to recognize antisemitism is a problem and for there to be more conversations and fewer assumptions about what Jewish students think. \u201cThe only way for anything in life to change is if you have conversations,\u201d Skinner said. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to agree with everything someone says, but at least you can develop an understanding of where they\u2019re coming from and what they\u2019re experiencing.\u201d The Associated Press contributed to this report.

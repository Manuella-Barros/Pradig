If Dallas doesn't reach an extension with Prescott, he'll be a free agent next offseason.\n\nCowboys owner Jerry Jones made it a point while addressing the media on Thursday, July 25, that this will not be Prescott's final season in a Dallas uniform.\n\n\"I don't think so,\" Jones said. \"Just to be very specific, I do not think that this will be his last year with the Cowboys at all. ... It's pretty clear, I think, I wouldn't say it if it hadn't been clear, of how much we appreciate what Dak Prescott has meant to this team in a positive way. And that the players do play better when he's out there. He does make his teammates play at a higher level. There's no question about it. So, I'm right there in line with his best fan.\n\n\"But believe it or not, in my life, I've had a lot of things I wanted that I couldn't get because I couldn't afford it. Now, have I learned to live with that in 80-something years? You bet I have, and life does go on. And sometimes when you get a bump like that, you turn around and do better than you would have had you got what you wanted. You'd have never known it had you not had to go get there.\"\n\nPostseason success had eluded Prescott, but he's been among the league's best passers in recent years. Last season, he topped the NFL in completions (410) and touchdown passes (36), amassing 4,516 passing yards. Prescott finished second in MVP voting.\n\nPrescott has maintained that his contract situation is not keeping him up at night. He wants to be with the Cowboys but also isn't concerned if he has to take his talents to another franchise.\n\n\"I'm gonna say it. I want to be here, but when you look up -- all the great QBs I watched played for other teams. That's not something to fear,\" Prescott said on Thursday. \"It may be a reality for me one day. It may not be my decision.\"\n\nIt's an insightful answer from Prescott and pressures Jones and Co. to get a deal done. If Prescott puts up another monster season, he'll surely have suitors in free agency who would be willing to make him among the top-paid passers in the league.\n\nPrescott is not the only player the Cowboys are in contract talks with. Young stars Micah Parsons and CeeDee Lamb are also in line for lucrative contract extensions. Both could potentially reset the bar for non-quarterback contracts.\n\n\"Those guys need to get paid and get their money. I've gotten a contract, and so the last thing I'm going to ask them to do is to take less,\" Prescott said. \"But this is a two-way street when you're talking about contracts. I've gotten older. I've got a decision in this thing, so it's not just one way here. As I said, it's about my agent and Jerry and those guys getting together and talking. They understand where I am. I understand where they are. From there, that'll get handled.\n\n\"But those young guys damn sure need to get taken care of, and if they get the biggest contracts, I'm a fan of it.\"", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dak_Prescott", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dak Prescott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescott,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prescott, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Prescott, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CeeDee_Lamb", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CeeDee Lamb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micah_Parsons", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Micah Parsons"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1915604550-e1721944656245.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760782", "eventUri": "eng-9760782", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-25", "textStart": 581, "textEnd": 588}], "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 219, "relevance": 1}

While talking with media members, Prescott hinted at a potential departure from Dallas.\n\nPrescott made it clear that he wants to remain with the Cowboys for the long haul. But the star quarterback is also being realistic about his contract situation, according to Jett Beachum of CBS Sports. The business aspect of the NFL could ultimately play a role in Dak Prescott's future in the league.\n\n\"I want to be here, but when you look up -- all the great quarterbacks I watched played for other teams... That's not something to fear. It may be a reality for me one day. It may not be my decision.\"\n\nPrescott is due to hit free agency after the 2024 season. That is, if the Cowboys don't sign him to an extension before the free agency period next year. At 30 years old, Dak Prescott can certainly continue playing at a high level for several more years.\n\nWith that said, Jerry Jones and the Cowboys have difficult decisions to make. Prescott isn't the only player on the roster in need of an extension, as CeeDee Lamb and Micah Parsons are due for new contracts as well. Not to mention, head coach Mike McCarthy's contract also ends after the 2024 season as well.\n\nWe'll have to wait and see how it plays out. It's unclear what Jerry Jones and the Cowboys plan to do with Dak Prescott for now. For all we know, he could be hitting the free agency market next offseason. But if he puts on another stellar season, then Dallas may feel it's necessary to re-sign the veteran quarterback.\n\nPrescott has been a relatively consistent quarterback throughout his career. He doesn't turn the ball over much and the Cowboys have been successful with him leading the way. But the franchise is starving for a Super Bowl, as Dallas hasn't won a championship since 1996. Last season, Prescott recorded 4,516 passing yards, 38 total touchdowns, and a 69.5 completion percentage.\n\nTraining camp is just beginning, so the Cowboys have time to offer a contract to Dak Prescott, CeeDee Lamb, and Micah Parsons. But the front office has been patient thus far. So, keep an eye out for any more updates regarding Dallas, their star players, and head coach Mike McCarthy.\n\nRelated: Rich Eisen Turns Heads Naming NFL's Top 5 Sleeper Teams, Surprise Playoff Prediction\n\nRelated: Titans QB Will Levis is Blowing Minds With 'Impressive' Development at Training Camp", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "benedetto_vitale@postandcourier.com", "name": "Benedetto Vitale", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dak_Prescott", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dak Prescott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_McCarthy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike McCarthy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CeeDee_Lamb", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CeeDee Lamb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micah_Parsons", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Micah Parsons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Eisen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rich Eisen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Titans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee Titans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/custom/image/6903687a-a7dc-11e9-896c-0bef6d6c9301.jpg?resize=600%2C314", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760782", "eventUri": "eng-9760782", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 218, "relevance": 1}

However, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones does not seem too worried about losing Prescott and instead envisioning him being on the team for the foreseeable future.\n\nJones opened up Dallas' training camp with a press conference discussing the state of the team as they head into another season with lofty expectations. When asked by The Athletic if this season could potentially be the last for Prescott, he would candidly say that he does not \"think this will be his last year with the Cowboys.\"\n\n\"I don't think so,\" Jones said. \"Just to be very specific. I do not think this will be his last year with the Cowboys, at all. Am I being psychotic relative to my mirror? No, no.\"\n\nLast season, Prescott put up another productive season with Dallas where he finished second in NFL MVP voting as he threw for a league-high 36 touchdowns and nine interceptions to go along with 4,516 yards. Jones would double down on his appreciation for the 30-year old signal-caller saying that when he's on the field, everyone around him plays better.\n\n\"It's pretty clear, I think,\" Jones said. \"I want to say if it hasn't been clear -- of how much we appreciate what Dak Prescott has meant to this team in a positive way.

Since then, the Mississippi State product has made his mark as one of the league's best quarterbacks.\n\nHowever, it remains to be seen if he will stay with the historic franchise given a new contract has not yet been agreed upon, plus Dallas has used up their franchise tags, leaving the decision pretty much up to Prescott. In any sense, even if it is the last season of their marriage, they look to go out with a bang.\n\nThe Cowboys will try to build off their relatively impressive season where they went 12-5 and won the NFC East, but ended their year on a disappointing note where they lost to the Green Bay Packers in the wild card round of the playoffs. They will start the upcoming season on the road against the Cleveland Browns on Sunday, Sept. 8.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zachary_weinberger@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Zachary Weinberger", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dak_Prescott", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dak Prescott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_State_Bulldogs_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mississippi State Bulldogs football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFC_East", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFC East"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Green Bay Packers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Browns"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Hockey/History", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Jerry-Jones-confident-take-on-Dak-Prescotts-Dallas-future.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760782", "eventUri": "eng-9760782", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-08", "textStart": 2629, "textEnd": 2636}], "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 216, "relevance": 1}

Tony Romo was still viewed as the starter but multiple injuries in front of Prescott opened a path to start Week 1 against the New York Giants.\n\nEight years, two playoff wins, and one contract extension later, the Cowboys seemingly find itself at a crossroads.\n\nBoth Jerry and Stephen Jones spoke on the difficulty of working high-level contracts on Thursday. And Dallas as three of them -- Prescott, CeeDee Lamb, and Micah Parsons. Not even head coach Mike McCarthy has security past this year.\n\nLamb has reportedly been labeled the top priority as the wide receiver is currently holding out from training camp. He wants to become the highest-paid non-QB in the NFL, as does Parsons.\n\nCould the lack of playoff success while potentially paying Prescott $60 million be too much for the Jones family to stomach, allowing him to hit the open market? If the answer does wind up being yes, it's safe to assume he will not be a Cowboy moving forward -- something Prescott says to not be afraid of.\n\n\"The contract is a big deal,\" NFL Network's Ian Rapoport said in early July. \"As it stands right now, Dak Prescott heading into the final year of his contract with the kind of leverage that we have rarely seen a quarterback have. the Cowboys cannot trade him, they cannot franchise him. If they don't do a deal with him, he's going to be a free agent.\n\n\"Will he sign with the Cowboys after they let him be a free agent? I guess anything's possible but certainly hard to imagine there.\"", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "griffin_mcveigh@on3.com", "name": "Griffin McVeigh", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescott,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prescott, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Prescott, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dak_Prescott", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dak Prescott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trade (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxnard,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oxnard, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oxnard, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Romo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tony Romo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_McCarthy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike McCarthy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CeeDee_Lamb", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CeeDee Lamb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micah_Parsons", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Micah Parsons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Network", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFL Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2023/12/11214840/jerry-jones-opens-up-about-desire-to-win-super-bowl-with-dak-prescott.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760782", "eventUri": "eng-9760782", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

Dak Prescott, Micah Parsons, and CeeDee Lamb are all nearing the end of their current contracts but none of them have been extended. This has caused some to question whether the Cowboys will push the reset button next offseason if they don't have a strong 2024 season. Don't tell that to Jerry Jones, who is strangely confident that Prescott will stay in Dallas past this year.\n\nAccording to Marcus Mosher, Jerry Jones believes that Dak Prescott will play for the Cowboys beyond the 2024 NFL season.\n\n\"Am I psychotic? No.\" Jones said, clearly mixing up the words \"psychotic\" and \"psychic.\"\n\nThis is a perplexing prediction from Jones, largely because he has basically no leverage in the situation. The Cowboys cannot use the franchise tag on Prescott and his contract features a no-trade clause. Therefore, if Prescott wanted to test free agency, all he would need to do is refuse any potential trade or extension.\n\nMeanwhile, the price tag on Prescott will continue to rise. This offseason has already featured huge long-term contract extensions for Jared Goff and Trevor Lawrence. Jordan Love is also poised to cash in with the Packers as well.\n\nLeSean McCoy labels Cowboys QB Dak Prescott as not \"tough enough\" in recent interview\n\nDak has been the target of criticism plenty of times in the past.\n\nFormer NFL RB LeSean McCoy recently leveled some harsh criticism on Prescott in a recent interview.\n\n\"I don't think he's tough enough,\" McCoy said on the Up & Adams Show with Kay Adams. \"When everybody's playing at an elite level, it's the playoffs, small margin for error, we need our best to be the best. Andy Reid always says in big games, 'I need my best players to out perform their best players' and Dak in the playoffs he doesn't do that, he freezes up. I don't want to say it's lack of heart but sometimes he displays like he doesn't have that dawg in him. Some players do, some players don't.\"\n\nIt is impossible to argue with the vague statement that Prescott doesn't \"have that dawg in him.\" Prescott has overcome plenty of injuries and had solid availability for the Cowboys, so I don't believe it is fair to critique him too much on that.\n\nHowever, McCoy could also be referencing how Prescott never seems to rise to the occasion in hugely important playoff games. After all, this has been one of the biggest things holding the Cowboys back from being a more successful team.\n\nPrescott will have the chance to silence his haters once and for all if he can put together a strong performance in 2024.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_strauss@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Ben Strauss", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dak_Prescott", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dak Prescott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescott,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prescott, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Prescott, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CeeDee_Lamb", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CeeDee Lamb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micah_Parsons", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Micah Parsons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeSean_McCoy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LeSean McCoy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Goff", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jared Goff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franchise_tag", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Franchise tag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trade (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Reid", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andy Reid"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Card_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Card Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/Drills_and_Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse/Drills and Coaching", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Jerry-Jones-puzzling-Dak-Prescott-prediction-for-beyond-2024.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760782", "eventUri": "eng-9760782", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

That's that,\" at his pre-draft press conference at the end of April.\n\nOn Thursday, Jones kicked off the first practice of Cowboys training camp in Oxnard, California, by expressing some confidence that he can get his quarterback, who became the first in Dallas history to lead the NFL outright in touchdown passes in a season (36 in 2023), re-signed on a new, long-term deal.\n\n\"I do not think that this will be his last year with the Cowboys, at all,\" Jones said at the Cowboys' introductory training camp press conference on Thursday.\n\nPrescott's initial remarks when asked about Jones' comments at his own training camp press conference Thursday invoked former Seattle Seahawks Pro Bowl running back Marshawn Lynch.\n\n\"I'm just here so I don't get fined,\" Prescott joked on Thursday, via NFL Media. He then became serious and pragmatically expressed some deeper thoughts on the topic of his contract negotiations. \"I say it's a two-way street. They have wants, I have wants. ... This is a business and obviously I want to be here. Talking about growing up ... this is where I became a man, but at the end of the day, it's a business.\"\n\nAfter pausing for a moment, the quarterback placed some pressure on Jones and the Cowboys, pointing out that plenty of great quarterbacks eventually played for other teams besides the ones they originally established a legacy with.\n\n\"You know, I'm going to say it: I want to be here, but you know when you look up all the great quarterbacks I've watched, they've played for other teams,\" Prescott said. \"So my point in saying that is that that's not something to fear. That may be a reality for me one day. ... \"Be where your feet are, make the most of it. Be confident in yourself, make the team better. I love my teammates. I love that locker room. I love everything about being out here in Oxnard and being a Dallas Cowboy. So that's what allows me to be free and focus.\"\n\nIt makes sense for Jones to strongly desire to ensure Prescott represents the team's stability at the game's most important position for the foreseeable future since he was one of the NFL's best in the first year of coach Mike McCarthy calling the Cowboys' offensive plays.\n\nDak Prescott 2023 season\n\nNFL QB RANKCompletion Pct69.5%2ndPass Yards4,516\n\n3rd\n\nPass Yards/Att\n\n7.7\n\n6th\n\nPass TD\n\n36\n\n1st\n\nTD-INT\n\n36-9\n\n2nd\n\nPasser Rating\n\n105.9\n\n2nd\n\nExpected Points Added/Play0.182nd\n\nHowever, Jones himself did leave room for the reality of Prescott and his front office not coming to terms on a new deal and him leaving for a new team next March since Prescott possesses both a no-franchise tag clause and a no-trade clause.\n\n\"In my life I've had a lot of things I wanted that I couldn't get because I couldn't afford it.\"\n\nPlenty of Cowboys fans are now likely praying for the miracle that Jones gets a move on with a contract that had it been done in March, could've opened up more cap space for the rest of the roster for both this offseason and beyond. Now, Dallas' faithful simply hope Prescott can get signed before the quarterback contract market jumps again like it did with the signings of Jacksonville Jaguars' Trevor Lawrence (five years, $275 million -- $55 million average per year) and Detroit Lions' Jared Goff (four years, $212 million -- $53 million average per year).\n\n\"I know that I have had a lot of mistakes in these years,\" Jones said. \"But the same guys making this decision that has the Cowboys and really got there by the skin of my teeth. It was a miracle that I was able to pull it off. A miracle. But the same imagination, the same risk-taking, the same taking risks but being pragmatic, being inconsistent, sometimes looking like you're a Mississippi riverboat gambler and sometime looking like you're trying to guard the national ball. Those inconstancies are how we got here. Now that is what you're seeing going on right now. And I don't know for sure if it's going to work. But I am giving it everything I've got.\"\n\nHere is all of the messaging we have gotten this offseason, prior to today's latest comments, from both Jones and Prescott himself about how the quarterback's contract negotiations are progressing.\n\nMarch 1 -- \"I'm definitely confident,\" Prescott said when asked about getting a deal done with the Cowboys. \"Obviously, it helps the team. It's important for the (salary cap) numbers. I've heard Jerry say that. That is a process. Both sides understand that. Everything is great. It'll happen.\" April 23 -- \"Who in the world would think that we're not working on it?\" Jones said at his pre-draft press conference. \"I work on it at two in the morning sometimes. What your actual question is why don't you have something done and negotiated and put in the drawer? We'd like to see some more leaves fall. We'd like to see some more action. .... You may give money to somebody that you shouldn't have given it to. ... To say that you're not working on it or going is not the right answer. The difference is the style. It's on your mind. It'd be madness not to know that the contracts are ahead. .... You got trouble with what the timing is around here because I'm not ready to go.\"\n\nApril 23 -- \"You're asking me if I worry about things going up. Not worry, but I probably have as good of feel as anybody living on this earth what the cap is going to be three years from now, four years from now, five years from now. I really do,\" Jones said. \"We've got exceptional insight into where the cap is going to be.\"\n\nApril 23 -- \"I, first of all, respect how Dak handles his business, period, as much as any player or any person that I've been associated with. I think that we should realize that talks, quote \"talks\" ... is not a barometer, of whether you're close to a deal, at all,\" Jones said. \"To be very candid, this is pro football. It has to do with the allocation of your resources, which happens to be cap space.\"\n\nApril 23 -- \"We want Dak Prescott. That's that,\" Jones added. \"There's no question that Mike's (McCarthy) focus, not that he didn't have focus, but how [Prescott] improved last year. I give Mike a lot of credit for that. That improvement demonstrated to me there's more as far as ultimately winning what we're trying to do here. ... We think that there's room for growth. He is absolutely unsurpassed as what he is as an individual with his work ethic, what he brings with his leadership and everything about what you would think about as a quarterback. So he's got that. He's had a few hits, but everybody has that too ... This wouldn't even be my response if we were in a different place relative to the cap. ... That's our challenge and to make it work out. Dak as the quarterback of the Cowboys, I don't even have a blink on that one.\"\n\nMay 22 -- \"Business is business. I'll leave it where it gets handled,\" Prescott said at Cowboys OTAs. \"Right now, it's about being my best for this team right now in this moment. OTAs is helping these guys out and just focused on that and I know my business will take care of itself. Been in it before, experienced (in talks with Jerry and Stephen Jones) and just controlling what I can right now.\"May 22 -- \"I don't play for money,\" Prescott added. \"Never have cared for it to be honest with you. Yeah. Would give it up just to play this game. So I allow that to the business people to say what it's worth what they're supposed to give a quarterback of my play. A person of my play, leader of my play. For me, it's about as I said, control what I can control and handle that part and the rest will take care of itself.\"\n\nJune 5 -- \"I don't mind it. I've been in this position before,\" Prescott said when asked about being in long-winded negotiations. \"I'm a gambling man. Will gamble on myself and my guys. ... Not actually guys,' Prescott said laughing. \"I understand there's been a lot of shit with that. Not that way.\"July 9 -- \"There's been conversations back and forth, but for the most part for me as y'all know, I let my agent (Todd France) do that, especially as we get right here into training camp,\" Prescott said. \"Day 1 of training camp, my mind flips to obviously helping my team and just doing everything I can within the organization and on the football field to make sure that I'm my best and everyone around me is their best. The money and all that will take care of itself as it always has.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "garrett_podell@cbssports.com", "name": "Garrett Podell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dak_Prescott", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dak Prescott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescott,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prescott, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Prescott, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxnard,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Oxnard, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oxnard, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_McCarthy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike McCarthy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshawn_Lynch", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marshawn Lynch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Seahawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Seahawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Goff", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jared Goff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Salary cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passer_rating", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Passer rating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trade (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Jaguars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Education and Training", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Education_and_Training/Business_Development", "label": "dmoz/Business/Education and Training/Business Development", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/r/2024/07/25/e852ea4d-83f6-4ad1-adb5-b4bdbc52f87f/thumbnail/1200x675/3ce020668ae2b741e48849a89f4861e4/dak-jerry-jones-us.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760782", "eventUri": "eng-9760782", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-03-01", "textStart": 4493, "textEnd": 4500}, {"amb": false, "date": "-04-23", "textStart": 4787, "textEnd": 4795, "freq": 4}, {"amb": false, "date": "-05-22", "textStart": 7049, "textEnd": 7055, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-05", "textStart": 7871, "textEnd": 7877}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-09", "textStart": 8171, "textEnd": 8177}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

The Cowboys have never reached the NFC Championship with Prescott at the helm and his overall postseason record is 2-5.\n\nBut Prescott backers will mention that the grass isn't always greener on the other side. It's hard for any NFL team to move on from a QB who has gone 73-41 in the regular season and has made the playoffs in 5 campaigns.\n\nBut while Smith has his take, the reality is that nothing has materialized for the Dallas quarterback.\n\nThe Cowboys' offseason has centered around extensions for three key players: Prescott, WR CeeDee Lamb and LB Micah Parsons. Despite training camp starting, none of those three players have been extended.\n\nAnd in the latest update from NFL media insider Jane Slater, it doesn't appear like a deal is coming for Lamb or Prescott anytime soon.\n\n\"Still 'all quiet' as it relates to Dak Prescott and CeeDee Lamb's contracts per a source informed. #Cowboys,\" Slater wrote on X on July 24.\n\nAccording to Spotrac, Prescott will count as a $55.1 million cap hit in 2024 and the site estimates his market value at $53.1 million per season. While Prescott is coming off one of his best statistical seasons, paying any player that kind of money is a massive commitment.\n\nAnd when considering that Parsons and Lamb need to be paid, the financial puzzle only gets more complicated for the Cowboys.\n\nIn contrast to Spotrac's estimation, an anonymous source tells CowboysCountry's Mike Fisher that the number could be much higher. In a July 23 article, Fisher's source explains that Prescott could become the highest-paid player ever.\n\n\"On the way to Dak seeking a 'highest-paid-player-ever' offer, one NFL source tells CowboysCountry.com that with 'patience,' Prescott's value will hit $70 million annually,\" Fisher wrote.\n\nThat is an eye-watering number, but it makes sense considering how contracts have inflated with expanding salary caps in the NFL. And considering how critical QB play is in the NFL, teams have to pay a premium to keep a player of Prescott's quality around.\n\nFisher himself finds the report \"dubious\" and mentions that Prescott has spoken about taking a \"team-friendly\" contract but the point of the report remains the same: if Prescott holds out and brings on a bidding war for his services, he could very well reach that number.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "evan_reier@heavy.com", "name": "Evan Reier", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_A._Smith", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stephen A.

It's not enough that superstar receiver CeeDee Lamb -- Cowboys aficionados are also sweating over the future of star signal-caller Dak Prescott.\n\nPrescott is a free agent following the 2024 season, and momentum toward a new deal has been slow, with Prescott's side and Cowboys owner Jerry Jones both dug in hard on their respective positions. As Cowboys training camp gets underway in Oxnard, California, Prescott has offered a much-anticipated update on his contract talks -- and depending on your viewpoint, the news might not be positive.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Thursday, Prescott acknowledged the business aspect of the NFL that many often forget. Although he said he \"obviously\" wants to stay in Dallas, Prescott said that there are things behind the scenes that are not in his control.\n\n\"I want to be here, but, when you look up, all the great quarterbacks I watched played for other teams,\" Prescott said about his future. \"My point in saying that is that's not something to fear. That may be a reality for me one day. It may not be my decision. That's the freedom that I have.\"\n\nPrescott isn't wrong -- Tom Brady ended his career with a team other than the New England Patriots, while Joe Montana didn't finish his legendary career with the San Francisco 49ers. Prescott knows his worth, though -- the three-time Pro Bowl selection is seeking one of the richest contracts in the NFL, and despite Jones' confidence in keeping him, there's little to suggest at this point in time that he actually will.\n\n\"I say it's a two-way street. They have wants, I have wants,\" Prescott said. \"This is where I became a man, but at the end of the day, it's a business.\"\n\nIt sounds like Prescott -- who led the NFL in passing touchdowns last season but has come under fire for his 2-5 playoff record -- is preparing to continue his career elsewhere.

Just to be very specific. I do not think that this will be his last year with the Cowboys at all,\" Jones began what turned out to be three minute soliloquy. \"Am I being psychotic relative to my mirror. No, no. It's pretty clear. I think I want to say it if it hadn't been clear of how much we appreciate what Dak Prescott has meant to this team in a positive way. And the players do play better when he's out there. He does make his teammates play at a higher level. There's no question about it. So I'm right there in line with his best with his best fans.\"\n\nThat's when Jones began speaking out of both sides of his mouth.\n\n\"But believe it or not in my life, I've had a lot of things I wanted that I couldn't get because I couldn't afford it,\" Jones continued. \"Now have I learned to live with that in 80 something years? You better have. And sometimes when you get a bump like that you turn around and do better than you would have had you got what you wanted. You would have never known it had you not had to go to get there. There's been some of my life with the Dallas Cowboys that that's reflected. That had gotten what I was sick about and ready to jump that I didn't get. Had I gotten it it wouldn't have turned out as positive as it's turned out. . .The point I'm trying to make is there is nothing new about not having these questions answered that you reflect and we've reflected in this off season. And yes, I have gone in with my wish list fully completed and I've been a part with the Cowboys and been a part of it in the other parts of my life.\"\n\nThe facts are that Jones has never really lost a player in free agency, a franchise player, that he really wanted to keep.\n\nBut he acknowledges the Prescott situation is pretty much out of his control. Prescott has a no-trade clause and no franchise-tag clause in the four-year, $160 million deal he signed in 2021.\n\nHe had a $55.4 million cap hit in 2024, a reason why the Cowboys need to get an extension done, and salary-cap constructing dead cap number in 2025 if he is not on the team.\n\nComplicating matters are the situations with receiver CeeDee Lamb, who is currently holding out of a new deal, and egde rusher Micah Parsons, who will be looking for a new deal next offseason.\n\nBoth have their eyes set on being the highest paid non-quarterback in the NFL.\n\nIf Jones appears to be talking out of both sides of his mouth, its because he is.\n\n\"Exactly, exactly. And Dak very artfully has positioned himself to where he makes the call,\" Jones said. \"And you have to, at the end of the day we'll have to live with that.\"\n\nJones, a veteran of thousands of business deals, is not feeling sorry for himself. It's just the reality of the situation.\n\nIt's also little bit of negotiating in the press.\n\nNow, contrast Prescott's laid-back and care-free demeanor to the situation.\n\nHe knows he is in the catbird's seat.\n\nA photo of him dancing on social media at former teammate Tyron Smith's wedding portrayed as much. He said he was feeling himself as he did the hip-hop Dougie dance and rolled phantom dice in hands.\n\nPrescott has always bet on himself. He did that the first time during a protracted contract situation.\n\nAnd as a player, who has dealt with the death of his mom to cancer, a brother to suicide, and has himself battled depression and criticism. And no, as a new dad, who is coming off the best season of his career, his mind is free.\n\nHe is focused on continuing to get better, improving on last season and helping the Cowboys finally breakthrough in the playoffs this season. He wants to stay with the Cowboys and continuing a childhood dream.\n\n\"Yeah, I'm free. Yeah,\" Prescott said. \"To your point, that that is the freedom in and that's why you have to focus where your feet are. And as I said, it's a two way street that they have and I have once. I think I've deserved that understanding that this is a business and obviously I wouldn't be here talking about growing up. This is this is where I become a man. So that's the freedom that I have is, 'Be Where Your Feet Are,' make the most of it. Be confident in yourself, make your team better.\n\n\"I love my teammates. I love that locker room. I love everything about being out here in Oxnard and being a Dallas Cowboys. So that's what allows me to be free and focus and understand that and time comes who knows what comes. I've been through a lot of adversity personally and that's about being thankful for your hugging and loving on your loved ones and taking it one day at a time and handling the rest when it approaches.\"\n\nBut he also knows that the great quarterbacks of his era have played with other teams, including Tom Brady, Peyton Manning and Cam Newton.\n\nIt's why he can come to camp and let his agent handle the negotiations with the Jones family.\n\n\"I want to be here, but when you look up all the great quarterbacks I watched played for other teams,\" Prescott said. \"So my point in saying that is that that's not something to fear that may be a reality for me one day may not be my decision.\"\n\nPrescott said it's not about the money b,ut he acknowledges he owes it to his family and the other players in the NFL to get the best deal he can get.\n\nThe question is can he talk Prescott into taking less.\n\n\"I don't know that because Dak is looking at well, what if I could go accomplish everything with a team that don't have those two top players on offense and defense, so they will allocate more to me,\" Jones said.\n\n\"Now, I will say to everybody, is because this is not like a boxing match. You got to have a supporting cast around you and nobody knows that more than Dak Prescott. His style causes people do better around him. He is that kind of leader. But same token, when you're sitting out here with all of the Pro Bowlers we got him and the supporting cast that Dak has had during his career, especially. over on the offensively, it has been outstanding by any measuring marks you want to have.\n\n\"You gotta weigh that. Can you do that? Allocate that much money to that few people and still get to the playoffs and get to the end at the end of the day, the Super Bowl. The Super Bowl is bigger than anybody or any player. So we got to always be looking at the Super Bowl.\"\n\nThe Cowboys haven't gotten there with Prescott, though they believe he can led them there.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescott,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prescott, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Prescott, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dak_Prescott", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dak Prescott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CeeDee_Lamb", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CeeDee Lamb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micah_Parsons", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Micah Parsons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyron_Smith", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tyron Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trade (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cam_Newton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cam Newton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peyton_Manning", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peyton Manning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Suicide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boxing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cancer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxnard,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oxnard, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oxnard, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/fort_worth_star_telegram_mcclatchy_952/38401b5e9dd69cad799ec6ca3ff443bb", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760782", "eventUri": "eng-9760782", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

The team needs to be competitive on both sides of the ball. Jones made little effort in free agency and still believes the team to be complete enough to compete with the rest of the NFC.\n\nShould the Cowboys fail to live up to expectations, Prescott might be playing for a new team in 2025.

That means if Prescott waits until after his fellow peers -- Green Bay Packers quarterback Jordan Love and the Miami Dolphins' Tua Tagovailoa -- signs a deal, he will likely set a new mark for quarterbacks in terms of contract money.\n\nWhile that thought isn't so far fetched, this latest one might be. According to Mike Fisher of Cowboys Country, an NFL source tells him that with patience, Prescott's contract value will reach $70 million annually.\n\n\"On the way to Dak seeking a 'highest-paid-player-ever' offer, one NFL source tells CowboysCountry.com that with 'patience,' Prescott's value will hit $70 million annually,\" writes Fisher.\n\nAgain, the \"highest-paid player\" distinction isn't out of the cards. If Prescott waits to sign his new deal with the Cowboys -- assuming the two sides work it out -- or the three-time Pro Bowl quarterback signs a new contract with another team next offseason, he'll likely become the highest-paid player ever. Prescott is easily one of the top quarterbacks in the league and is coming off of a career year after finishing as the top runner-up in MVP voting.\n\nHowever, one has to keep in mind that the highest-paid player on an annual basis is the Cincinnati Bengals' Joe Burrow and the Jacksonville Jaguars' Trevor Lawrence at $55 million.\n\nEven assuming Tagovailoa and Love reset the market with their own deals exceeding that average, $70 million is a bit much. The notion of Prescott earning a $60 million deal on an annual basis next offseason is a more conceivable possibility.\n\nThe Athletic's Dianna Russini offers a more reasonable projection. She writes that the Packers and Love will likely complete a deal early in training camp that will reset the market for quarterbacks. She then suggests that Prescott could become the first $60 million-per-year player in NFL history.\n\n\"However, Love might only hold that title for a few weeks -- that's because the Dallas Cowboys are working hard to get Dak Prescott's deal don,\" writes Russini. \"Prescott could be the first quarterback to break the $60 million-per-year barrier.\"\n\nThe longer the Cowboys wait on a deal for Prescott, the more of a problem it becomes when it comes to their salary cap. That's because they're also dealing with the situation of CeeDee Lamb -- who will hold out of training camp without a new deal -- and star linebacker Micah Parsons, who is also expected to reset the market at his position with his latest contract.\n\n\"Dak Prescott is setting up to become the highest paid QB. WR CeeDee Lamb is holding out to become the league's highest paid non-QB OLB Micah Parsons will then want to become the next, highest paid non-QB,\" writes Spotrac. \"The #Cowboys are literally bidding against themselves to retain their core.\"\n\nFurther complicating matters is that the Cowboys' negotiations with both Prescott and Lamb have been \"quiet\" as training camp begins, according to NFL Network's Jane Slater.\n\nWhile the $70 million per year value for Prescott may be a bit high, don't be surprised at all if the veteran quarterback earns $60 million per year on his next deal.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dj_siddiqi@heavy.com", "name": "Dj Siddiqi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescott,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prescott, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Prescott, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dak_Prescott", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dak Prescott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tua_Tagovailoa", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tua Tagovailoa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Salary cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Dolphins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Dolphins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Green Bay Packers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Burrow", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Burrow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dianna_Russini", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dianna Russini"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Jaguars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Bengals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CeeDee_Lamb", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CeeDee Lamb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micah_Parsons", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Micah Parsons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Network", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFL Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/a_6a9e7d-e1721840043229.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760782", "eventUri": "eng-9760782", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

That's that,\" at his pre-draft press conference at the end of April.\n\nOn Thursday, Jones kicked off the first practice of Cowboys training camp in Oxnard, California, by expressing some confidence that he can get his quarterback, who became the first in Dallas history to lead the NFL outright in touchdown passes in a season (36 in 2023), re-signed on a new, long-term deal.\n\n\"I do not think that this will be his last year with the Cowboys, at all,\" Jones said at the Cowboys' introductory training camp press conference on Thursday.\n\nIt makes sense for Jones to strongly desire to ensure Prescott represents the team's stability at the game's most important position for the foreseeable future since he was one of the NFL's best in the first year of coach Mike McCarthy calling the Cowboys' offensive plays.\n\nDak Prescott 2023 season\n\nNFL QB RANKCompletion Pct69.5%2ndPass Yards4,516\n\n3rd\n\nPass Yards/Att\n\n7.7\n\n6th\n\nPass TD\n\n36\n\n1st\n\nTD-INT\n\n36-9\n\n2nd\n\nPasser Rating\n\n105.9\n\n2nd\n\nExpected Points Added/Play0.182nd\n\nHowever, Jones did leave room for the reality of Prescott and his front office not coming to terms on a new deal and him leaving for a new team next March since Prescott possesses both a no-franchise tag clause and a no-trade clause.\n\n\"In my life I've had a lot of things I wanted that I couldn't get because I couldn't afford it.\"\n\nPlenty of Cowboys fans are now likely praying for the miracle that Jones gets a move on with a contract that had it been done in March, could've opened up more cap space for the rest of the roster for both this offseason and beyond. Now, Dallas' faithful simply hope Prescott can get signed before the quarterback contract market jumps again like it did with the signings of Jacksonville Jaguars' Trevor Lawrence (five years, $275 million -- $55 million average per year) and Detroit Lions' Jared Goff (four years, $212 million -- $53 million average per year).\n\n\"I know that I have had a lot of mistakes in these years,\" Jones said. \"But the same guys making this decision that has the Cowboys and really got there by the skin of my teeth. It was a miracle that I was able to pull it off. A miracle. But the same imagination, the same risk-taking, the same taking risks but being pragmatic, being inconsistent, sometimes looking like you're a Mississippi riverboat gambler and sometime looking like you're trying to guard the national ball. Those inconstancies are how we got here. Now that is what you're seeing going on right now. And I don't know for sure if it's going to work. But I am giving it everything I've got.\"\n\nHere is all of the messaging we have gotten this offseason, prior to today's latest comments, from both Jones and Prescott himself about how the quarterback's contract negotiations are progressing.\n\nMarch 1 -- \"I'm definitely confident,\" Prescott said when asked about getting a deal done with the Cowboys. \"Obviously, it helps the team. It's important for the (salary cap) numbers. I've heard Jerry say that. That is a process. Both sides understand that. Everything is great. It'll happen.\" April 23 -- \"Who in the world would think that we're not working on it?\" Jones said at his pre-draft press conference. \"I work on it at two in the morning sometimes. What your actual question is why don't you have something done and negotiated and put in the drawer? We'd like to see some more leaves fall. We'd like to see some more action. .... You may give money to somebody that you shouldn't have given it to. ... To say that you're not working on it or going is not the right answer. The difference is the style. It's on your mind. It'd be madness not to know that the contracts are ahead. .... You got trouble with what the timing is around here because I'm not ready to go.\"\n\nApril 23 -- \"You're asking me if I worry about things going up. Not worry, but I probably have as good of feel as anybody living on this earth what the cap is going to be three years from now, four years from now, five years from now. I really do,\" Jones said. \"We've got exceptional insight into where the cap is going to be.\"\n\nApril 23 -- \"I, first of all, respect how Dak handles his business, period, as much as any player or any person that I've been associated with. I think that we should realize that talks, quote \"talks\" ... is not a barometer, of whether you're close to a deal, at all,\" Jones said. \"To be very candid, this is pro football. It has to do with the allocation of your resources, which happens to be cap space.\"\n\nApril 23 -- \"We want Dak Prescott. That's that,\" Jones added. \"There's no question that Mike's (McCarthy) focus, not that he didn't have focus, but how [Prescott] improved last year. I give Mike a lot of credit for that. That improvement demonstrated to me there's more as far as ultimately winning what we're trying to do here. ... We think that there's room for growth. He is absolutely unsurpassed as what he is as an individual with his work ethic, what he brings with his leadership and everything about what you would think about as a quarterback. So he's got that. He's had a few hits, but everybody has that too ... This wouldn't even be my response if we were in a different place relative to the cap. ... That's our challenge and to make it work out. Dak as the quarterback of the Cowboys, I don't even have a blink on that one.\"\n\nMay 22 -- \"Business is business. I'll leave it where it gets handled,\" Prescott said at Cowboys OTAs. \"Right now, it's about being my best for this team right now in this moment. OTAs is helping these guys out and just focused on that and I know my business will take care of itself. Been in it before, experienced (in talks with Jerry and Stephen Jones) and just controlling what I can right now.\"May 22 -- \"I don't play for money,\" Prescott added. \"Never have cared for it to be honest with you. Yeah. Would give it up just to play this game. So I allow that to the business people to say what it's worth what they're supposed to give a quarterback of my play. A person of my play, leader of my play. For me, it's about as I said, control what I can control and handle that part and the rest will take care of itself.\"\n\nJune 5 -- \"I don't mind it. I've been in this position before,\" Prescott said when asked about being in long-winded negotiations. \"I'm a gambling man. Will gamble on myself and my guys. ... Not actually guys,' Prescott said laughing. \"I understand there's been a lot of shit with that. Not that way.\"July 9 -- \"There's been conversations back and forth, but for the most part for me as y'all know, I let my agent (Todd France) do that, especially as we get right here into training camp,\" Prescott said. \"Day 1 of training camp, my mind flips to obviously helping my team and just doing everything I can within the organization and on the football field to make sure that I'm my best and everyone around me is their best. The money and all that will take care of itself as it always has.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "garrett_podell@cbssports.com", "name": "Garrett Podell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dak_Prescott", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dak Prescott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescott,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prescott, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Prescott, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_McCarthy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike McCarthy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passer_rating", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Passer rating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trade (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxnard,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oxnard, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oxnard, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Guard (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Goff", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jared Goff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Salary cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Lions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Lions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville_Jaguars", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jacksonville Jaguars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Education_and_Training", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Education and Training", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Education_and_Training/Business_Development", "label": "dmoz/Business/Education and Training/Business Development", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://sportsfly.cbsistatic.com/fly-0750/bundles/sportsmediacss/images/fantasy/default-article-image-large.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760782", "eventUri": "eng-9760782", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-03-01", "textStart": 3003, "textEnd": 3010}, {"amb": false, "date": "-04-23", "textStart": 3297, "textEnd": 3305, "freq": 4}, {"amb": false, "date": "-05-22", "textStart": 5559, "textEnd": 5565, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-05", "textStart": 6381, "textEnd": 6387}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-09", "textStart": 6681, "textEnd": 6687}], "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

Prescott threw two interceptions in the defeat in front of the Cowboys' home fans. This came after consecutive losses to the hated San Francico 49ers in the playoffs.\n\nIn talking to media on Thursday from Cowboys training camp in Southern California, Prescott seemed to put Cowboys fans on blast.\n\nPrescott was asked what he'd tell Cowboys fans who are still frustrated by the loss to Green Bay this past January. His response was something else.\n\n\"Be fans or don't be fans. If you're a fan, you're going to turn the page just as we do, you're gonna move forward, understanding that you have better ahead of you,\" Prescott said, via Jon Machota of The Athletic. \"Sorry, obviously, but it hurt us more than it did them. Obviously, it's on us to get back and to do better, but, yeah, move on.\"\n\nUh. Fans in Big D have a right to be frustrated.

It could potentially lead to a split depending on what happens during the 2024 season.\n\nPrescott also touched on his contract situation in talking to media on Thursday.\n\n\"I'm gonna say it. I want to be here, but when you look up -- all the great QBs I watched played for other teams. That's not something to fear,\" Prescott told reporters. \"It may be a reality for me one day. It may not be my decision.\"\n\nIt's going to be all about what happens this season. Dallas is not considered a top-end title contender in the NFC.

Owner Jerry Jones has played it coy regarding handing out any kind of extension to anyone important to the team as a whole.\n\nMore news: Cowboys Star CeeDee Lamb Won't Attend Training Camp in Search of New Contract\n\nStar wide receiver CeeDee Lamb is currently holding out until he gets a new contract, and head coach Mike McCarthy hired new representation to likely strike a new deal with the Cowboys after the 2024 season. That is also not to mention quarterback Dak Prescott, who is playing in the final year of his four-year, $160 million contract.\n\nJones joined reporters on Thursday to speak on the constant questions about contracts and offered little to no explanation about what the plans are moving forward. Instead, he repeated his \"all in\" gameplan, and seemingly hinted that Prescott is playing on borrowed time.\n\n\"I'm all in. I'm all in. Sometimes being all in means you narrow, you remove the months out here that are in the future. And you narrow it down to where all we are talking about is right now and the next playoff season. And that's it for everybody,\" Jones stated.\n\nJones opens by explaining what his \"all in\" phrase means, which is what he told reporters two days before the 2024 NFL Draft.\n\nJones is also alluding to the fact that he does not want to discuss further contracts and instead wants to focus on the task at hand. That task is ensuring the team returns to the playoffs. The issue with that is what it means for Prescott.\n\n\"Dak's got his year. Contract. Let's focus right here. We all have a lot on the line for that playoff game,\" Jones added.\n\nJones appears to be trying to refocus the team's effort on the here and now, but that might also be a big issue. Prescott is set to become an unrestricted free agent, and if he feels disrespected by Jones and the Cowboys -- he can choose to walk away without any sort of blowback from a contractual standpoint.\n\nJones' indication that everyone has \"a lot on the line\" for the playoff game might just be part of his attempts to inspire the team, but it can also be construed as his pointing to the Cowboys' biggest issue.\n\nThe biggest issue the Cowboys have faced since Prescott came aboard, is they have not been able to make it to the Super Bowl.

Tony Romo was supposed to lead them to the promised land but was unable to do so. There was immense hype around the Cowboys when Dak Prescott came out of nowhere to steal the starting quarterback job after Romo went down with an injury. Yet, Prescott has been unable to get the team over the hump to this point in his career as well.\n\nThe Cowboys haven't made it past the divisional round in more than 20 years, and have developed a reputation as a team that chokes in the postseason. Regardless of whether this narrative is fair or not, it is the narrative surrounding this team. The Cowboys have to turn things around and prove that they can get the job done in the postseason.\n\nOne player has outsized responsibility for the team's overall success, and this player has also developed a personal reputation for coming up short when everything is on the line. Let's take a look at who this player is and why they are under the most pressure this upcoming season.\n\nDak Prescott is a polarizing player\n\nDak Prescott is not a bad quarterback by any means. He burst onto the scene in 2015 and earned the starting quarterback position from Tony Romo on his own merits. The previously unheralded fourth-round draft pick brought an explosive new element to the Cowboys' offense that Romo could not provide.\n\nUnfortunately, for the Cowboys and Prescott, he's been unable to get the team back to the Super Bowl. There are many reasons for the Cowboys' struggles in the playoffs, and to be clear not all of them fall on Dak's shoulders. Yet, when you are starting quarterback, all of the responsibility falls on your shoulders, whether that is fair or not.\n\nIf the team does great, the quarterback gets all the glory. However, if the team struggles the quarterback takes all the blame even if there's nothing he could've realistically done to alter the outcome. That's just the way life goes for starting quarterbacks in the NFL.\n\nPrescott makes too many mistakes under pressure\n\nOne area where Dak has been criticized is his ability to perform in the clutch. He's made a few too many critical mistakes at inopportune times, and the Cowboys have paid dearly for these errors. One of Prescott's biggest flaws is that he'll try to do too much, resulting in ill-advised decisions and forced throws that too often lead to interceptions.\n\nThe former Mississippi State star often also tries to fight for yardage like a running back, but this can lead to a lack of ball security and fumbles that are recovered by the defense. The next step in the Cowboys' quarterback's growth is to learn when to be aggressive and when to take what the defense is allowing.\n\nThis doesn't mean he has to let the defense dictate the flow of the game, though. Prescott can still make an impact while playing a smarter brand of football. This also isn't to say that he can't take any chances. There are times to be aggressive, but part of a quarterback's growth is learning when the situation calls for gunslinging and when the situation calls for playing it safer.\n\nPrescott will need to learn the difference between the two in order to take the next step in his development as a franchise quarterback. The team will be better off for this approach, too. The more that they can unleash the good version of Prescott while limiting the harm caused by the bad version of their quarterback, the better they will be as a team.\n\nDak's growth in decision-making will also open up the team's playbook and allow for more creative playcalling. Offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer will also have a much easier time calling plays when he knows that he can trust his quarterback not to make a costly error.\n\nRight now, it sometimes seems as if the Cowboys are restrained by having to protect their quarterback from his own worst habits. If Dak is able to prove that he can be trusted to make the right decisions, it will open up their playbook and give defenses more to think about.\n\nIn some ways, Prescott's career to date is similar to that of an empty-calorie scorer in the NBA. He's putting up counting stats, but they aren't translating to sustained regular season and postseason success. This is largely because of his inconsistent decision-making and propensity to take unnecessary risks.\n\nPrescott has developed a reputation as a player who comes up short in big moments, and this may be his last chance to turn that narrative around before it consumes his reputation and his career. That is why Dak Prescott faces the most pressure of anybody on the Cowboys this upcoming season.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_rooney@clutchpoints.com", "name": "David Rooney", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dak_Prescott", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dak Prescott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Romo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tony Romo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescott,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prescott, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Prescott, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/America's_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "America's Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_State_Bulldogs_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mississippi State Bulldogs football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Schottenheimer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brian Schottenheimer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fumble", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fumble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Education_and_Training/Team_Building", "label": "dmoz/Business/Education and Training/Team Building", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Cowboys-player-under-most-pressure-in-2024-NFL-season.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760782", "eventUri": "eng-9760782", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Lamb is entering the final year of his rookie deal, and Parsons is eligible for an extension after completing three NFL seasons.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Thursday, Dak Prescott offered some interesting comments that suggest he's fully prepared for the possibility of leaving the Cowboys next year, per Jett Beachum of CBS News Texas:\n\n\"Obviously, I want to be here...but at the end of the day, it's a business...\n\nI'm gonna say it:I want to be here, but when you look up -- all the great quarterbacks I watched played for other teams...That's not something to fear. It may be a reality for me one day. It may not be my decision.\"\n\nAlso Read: VIDEO: Everyone Is Destroying Dallas Cowboys Owner Jerry Jones For His Strange Explanation Of What \"All-In\" Means\n\nCowboys fans who want Dak Prescott here long-term don't want to hear it, but he's telling the cold hard truth. Most of the all-time great quarterbacks (Tom Brady, Peyton Manning, Joe Montana, Steve Young, Brett Favre, Kurt Warner, Joe Namath, Aaron Rodgers, Drew Brees, and so on) played for multiple NFL team.\n\nPer OvertheCap.com, Prescott also has no-trade and no-tag clauses in his contract. So if he decides on his own to leave Dallas in 2025, there's nothing Jerry Jones and company can do about it.\n\nLast season, Prescott threw for 4,516 yards and 36 touchdowns against only nine interceptions. He finished second in MVP voting behind only Lamar Jackson of the Baltimore Ravens.\n\nThe Cowboys will try to kick off the 2024 season on a high note when they visit Myles Garrett and the Cleveland Browns on Sept. 5. Not only does this mark a compelling showdown between two 2023 playoff teams, but it'll serve as Tom Brady's debut as an analyst for the \"NFL on FOX.\"", "source": {"uri": "totalprosports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Total Pro Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_hoegler@totalprosports.com", "name": "Alex Hoegler", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dak_Prescott", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dak Prescott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CeeDee_Lamb", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CeeDee Lamb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micah_Parsons", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Micah Parsons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Rams", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Rams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_NFL", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFL on Fox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myles_Garrett", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Myles Garrett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Warner", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kurt Warner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Namath", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Namath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drew_Brees", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drew Brees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Rodgers", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Rodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Favre", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brett Favre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Montana", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Montana"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Browns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peyton_Manning", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peyton Manning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Young", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Young"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamar_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lamar Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://www.totalprosports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/dakprescottcowboys.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760782", "eventUri": "eng-9760782", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-11", "textStart": 276, "textEnd": 283}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-05", "textStart": 2129, "textEnd": 2136}], "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

(AP) - Owner Jerry Jones knows the situation the Dallas Cowboys find themselves in as training camp started on Thursday.\n\nQuarterback Dak Prescott is going into the last year of his contract. Wide receiver CeeDee Lamb is holding out, seeking a new contract. Linebacker Micah Parsons is also in line for a new deal at some point.\n\n\"Nobody\u00b4s feeling sorry for themselves,\" Jones said. \"As a matter of fact, I want to tell you how blessed we are to get to get up in the morning and have these problems. I wouldn\u00b4t take anything for it. I\u00b4m emboldened, it puts gas in my tank to basically have these problems.\"\n\nDespite the sense of uncertainty surrounding the team, which includes head coach Mike McCarthy entering into the final year of his contract, Jones wasn\u00b4t worried going into their annual training camp in Southern California.\n\nInstead, Jones is focused on what happens at the end of the upcoming season, which he hopes will see the Cowboys win the Super Bowl for the first time since the end of the 1995 season.\n\n\"I\u00b4m more about winning the award for the best way to end the season than I am winning the award for showing up at camp with my house in order,\" he said.\n\nDallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones speaks during a news conference before an NFL football practice Thursday, July 25, 2024, in Oxnard, Calif. (AP Photo/Ryan Sun)\n\nEven with that strong core, success in the playoffs has been elusive since raising the Lombardi Trophy for the third time in four years on Jan. 28, 1996.\n\nDespite making the postseason in each of the past three seasons, the Cowboys have one win in that span and have not reached the NFC championship game. Their most recent playoff thud was a 48-32 home loss to the Green Bay Packers in an NFC wild-card game where Dallas trailed 27-0 in the first half.\n\nStephen Jones described the continued postseason failures as \"the elephant in the room.\" Prescott pointedly bristled at a question about how last season ended.\n\n\"We know that,\" Stephen Jones said. \"Our fans know that. Everybody knows that. These players know it, Mike knows it, his staff knows it. ... We\u00b4ve got to go take the next step. And we haven\u00b4t done that, and until we do it, there\u00b4ll be frustration.\"\n\nThe specter of another playoff exit was treated with more seriousness than the ongoing question of contracts. Stephen Jones said he has been having productive conversations with the agents for Prescott and Lamb.\n\nJerry Jones noted numerous contract disputes all over the league. Players likened Lamb\u00b4s holdout to that of guard Zack Martin last year, when he received a reworked contract after missing three weeks of camp and the preseason opener.\n\nEven Prescott, who led the league with 36 touchdown passes, said he is going into this season with a welcoming sense of relief knowing he will be well compensated wherever he plays next.\n\n\"Obviously I want to be here,\" Prescott said. \"I want to be here, but when you look up all the great quarterbacks I watched played for other teams. My point in saying that is that\u00b4s not something to fear. That may be a reality for me one day. It may not be my decision. So that\u00b4s the freedom that I have.\"\n\nJones was optimistic Prescott\u00b4s ninth season with the Cowboys will not be his last before conceding the uncertainty ahead.\n\n\"Believe it or not, in my life I\u00b4ve had a lot of things I wanted that I couldn\u00b4t get because I couldn\u00b4t afford it,\" Jones said. \"Now have I learned to live with that in 80-something years? You bet I have, and life does go on.\"\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL\n\nDallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott throws a pass to tight end Jake Ferguson during NFL football training camp Thursday, July 25, 2024, in Oxnard, Calif.

In January, his Cowboys were the first No. 2 seed to lose in the wild card round since the NFL expanded to the 14-team playoff format.\n\nNot only did the Cowboys lose to the seventh-seeded Green Bay Packers, they suffered an embarrassing 48-32 home defeat.

Mandatory Credit: Kevin Jairaj-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys' postseason struggles are known far and wide. Dallas won Super Bowl XXX following the 1995-96 NFL season. Since then, Dallas has failed even to reach the NFC Championship Game. It's been nearly thirty years since the team hoisted a Lombardi Trophy. Dak Prescott, the Cowboys' starting quarterback since 2016, unsurprisingly has caught a lot of the flack for their losses.\n\nLike every other Cowboys quarterback since 1995, Prescott has failed to deliver in January. Even though other common denominators are more prominent, as Dallas' quarterback, Prescott will endure criticism. He has, and then some over the past few seasons; some feel it's pretty earned. The more the Cowboys bottom out in January, the more prominent these narratives become.\n\nFormer Philadelphia Eagles star LeSean McCoy, who knows a thing or two about the Dallas-Philly rivalry, talked to Kay Adams on Up & Adams this week about the Cowboys quarterback. It's safe to say that McCoy doesn't think highly of Dak after his comments on the signal-caller.\n\n\"In my opinion... I don't think he's tough enough,\" McCoy said. \"Right? When everybody's playing at an elite level, in the playoffs, small margin for error. We need our best ot be the best. Andy Reid always says, like in big games, 'I need my best players to outperform their best players.' And Dak, in the Playoffs, he doesn't do that,\" he added.\n\nMcCoy thinks Prescott \"doesn't have that dog in him,\" which separates him from the best of the best.", "source": {"uri": "thecomeback.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Comeback"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_novak@thecomeback.com", "name": "Chris Novak", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dak_Prescott", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dak Prescott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXX", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl XXX"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT&T_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AT&T Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFC_Championship_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NFC Championship Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Football Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Green Bay Packers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescott,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prescott, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Prescott, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arlington, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arlington, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeSean_McCoy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LeSean McCoy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vince_Lombardi_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vince Lombardi Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Reid", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andy Reid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Eagles"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://cdn1.thecomeback.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/USATSI_22294167-scaled-e1721931565239.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760782", "eventUri": "eng-9760782", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2014-01-", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 6}], "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

And once again, it appears all the leverage is in the hands of No. 4\n\nDianna Russini of The Athletic said Wednesday morning that she believes Prescott will be the first quarterback to make $60 million per season. Now Adam Schefter joined the conversation and says Dak is going to make more than that.\n\nSchefter stated on ESPN that Prescott will \"reset the quarterback market\" when he signs either in-season or after. He added that he can see this situation dragging on, at which point Prescott will be able to start a bidding war and land \"north of $60 million.\"\n\nIt's hard to argue against Schefter considering the money Jared Goff and Trevor Lawrence made this offseason. His price tag will only increase if other quarterbacks sign deals superior to theirs, which Russini says should happen with Jordan Love and the Green Bay Packers.\n\nPlaying quarterback for America's Team means Dak Prescott will always have detractors. There's truth to some of the criticism, especially when it comes to postseason performance, but that's true of many other quarterbacks who signed big deals.\n\nWhat's more important, at least for Prescott, is the fact that he has all the leverage. As Schefter reminds us, the Cowboys can't use the franchise or transitional tag on Prescott. That means he can decide at any point in the negotiation process to end the discussion and wait until the 2025 offseason.\n\nAt that point, Dallas would have to bid against other teams to secure his services. Considering how rare franchise quarterbacks hit the open market, that bidding could get out of control in a hurry.\n\nFeeling the Frustration:Stephen Jones gets why fans are upset.

Prescott finished last year as an MVP candidate but once again fizzled out in the postseason, putting the pressure on the Cowboys star to finally break through this season, especially as his future contract prospects are currently in some doubt.\n\nPrescott has been a target of heavy criticism from fans, the media, and other players alike, and recently, former NFL Super Bowl Champion LeSean McCoy leveled some harsh words in the former Mississippi State Bulldog's direction.\n\n\"I don't think he's tough enough,\" said McCoy, via the Up & Adams Show with Kay Adams, presented by FanDuel. \"When everybody's playing at an elite level, it's the playoffs, small margin for error, we need our best to be the best. Andy Reid always says in big games, 'I need my best players to out perform their best players' and Dak in the playoffs he doesn't do that, he freezes up. I don't want to say it's lack of heart but sometimes he displays like he doesn't have that dawg in him. Some players do, some players don't.\"\n\n\"Having that dawg\" is obviously a non-quantifiable cliche that is often overused in sports media circles, but there is something to be said about the ability to step up in the game's biggest moments, which Prescott hasn't been able to do very consistently thus far in his career.\n\nCan the Cowboys finally break through?\n\nDespite all of the discourse surrounding both Prescott and the Cowboys as a whole, they should still be well-positioned to at least compete for NFL supremacy this upcoming season. The NFC is still objectively the weaker conference, even if teams like the Philadelphia Eagles are expected to bounce back from rough 2023-24 campaigns.\n\nHowever, there's also a strong chance that the Cowboys themselves could be better, especially considering that star cornerback Trevon Diggs will be back after missing most of last season with an ACL injury sustained vs the Arizona Cardinals.\n\nOf course, at the end of the day, it's all going to come back to Prescott and how well he is able to perform under the bright lights of the NFL playoffs. So far in his career, his playoff output has not lined up with his regular season production, and if that trend continues this year, it's certainly fair to pose the question if it would be in the Cowboys' best interest to move on from him.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jackson_stone@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Jackson Stone", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dak_Prescott", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dak Prescott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescott,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prescott, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Prescott, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeSean_McCoy", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LeSean McCoy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Reid", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andy Reid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_State_Bulldogs_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mississippi State Bulldogs football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevon_Diggs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trevon Diggs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Football Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Eagles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Card_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Card Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Dak-Prescott-labeled-not-%E2%80%98tough-enough-by-former-Super-Bowl-champion.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760782", "eventUri": "eng-9760782", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

(AP) -- Owner Jerry Jones knows the situation the Dallas Cowboys find themselves in as training camp started on Thursday.\n\nQuarterback Dak Prescott is going into the last year of his contract. Wide receiver CeeDee Lamb is holding out, seeking a new contract. Linebacker Micah Parsons is also in line for a new deal at some point.\n\n\"Nobody's feeling sorry for themselves,\" Jones said. \"As a matter of fact, I want to tell you how blessed we are to get to get up in the morning and have these problems. I wouldn't take anything for it. I'm emboldened, it puts gas in my tank to basically have these problems.\"\n\nDespite the sense of uncertainty surrounding the team, which includes head coach Mike McCarthy entering into the final year of his contract, Jones wasn't worried going into their annual training camp in Southern California.\n\nInstead, Jones is focused on what happens at the end of the upcoming season, which he hopes will see the Cowboys win the Super Bowl for the first time since the end of the 1995 season.\n\n\"I'm more about winning the award for the best way to end the season than I am winning the award for showing up at camp with my house in order,\" he said.\n\nEven with that strong core, success in the playoffs has been elusive since raising the Lombardi Trophy for the third time in four years on Jan. 28, 1996.\n\nDespite making the postseason in each of the past three seasons, the Cowboys have one win in that span and have not reached the NFC championship game. Their most recent playoff thud was a 48-32 home loss to the Green Bay Packers in an NFC wild-card game where Dallas trailed 27-0 in the first half.\n\nStephen Jones described the continued postseason failures as \"the elephant in the room.\" Prescott pointedly bristled at a question about how last season ended.\n\n\"We know that,\" Stephen Jones said. \"Our fans know that. Everybody knows that. These players know it, Mike knows it, his staff knows it. ... We've got to go take the next step. And we haven't done that, and until we do it, there'll be frustration.\"\n\nThe specter of another playoff exit was treated with more seriousness than the ongoing question of contracts. Stephen Jones said he has been having productive conversations with the agents for Prescott and Lamb.\n\nJerry Jones noted numerous contract disputes all over the league. Players likened Lamb's holdout to that of guard Zack Martin last year, when he received a reworked contract after missing three weeks of camp and the preseason opener.\n\nEven Prescott, who led the league with 36 touchdown passes, said he is going into this season with a welcoming sense of relief knowing he will be well compensated wherever he plays next.\n\n\"Obviously I want to be here,\" Prescott said. \"I want to be here, but when you look up all the great quarterbacks I watched played for other teams. My point in saying that is that's not something to fear. That may be a reality for me one day. It may not be my decision. So that's the freedom that I have.\"\n\nJones was optimistic Prescott's ninth season with the Cowboys will not be his last before conceding the uncertainty ahead.\n\n\"Believe it or not, in my life I've had a lot of things I wanted that I couldn't get because I couldn't afford it,\" Jones said. \"Now have I learned to live with that in 80-something years? You bet I have, and life does go on.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

And totally respect that. So very difficult situations that we're trying to work through with them. They want to win. They want to put a ring on their finger, and they understand the difficult situation we have.\"\n\nThe Cowboys held their first training camp practice Thursday without Lamb, their All-Pro receiver, who remains in Houston, working out as he awaits his contract. Prescott and Parsons were on hand, but there's not a guarantee either will be in Oxnard, California, next summer for training camp.\n\nPrescott will be a free agent next March. Parsons will be entering the fifth-year option of his rookie deal if he does not sign an extension before then and could follow Lamb's holdout plan.\n\nWhile it might feel tenuous to those outside of the organization, it doesn't to coach Mike McCarthy, who is also entering a contract year.\n\n\"That's not the way we're wired,\" McCarthy said, adding, \"We're energized by what's in front of us.\"\n\nIf Lamb, who is due $17.99 million this year on the fifth-year option, and Parsons, who is under contractual control through 2025, are seeking deals that would make them the highest-paid non-quarterbacks in the league, then those contracts would average more than $35 million a year. Prescott, who is in the final year of a deal that pays him $40 million on average, is looking at a deal that could make him the highest paid player in the NFL, north of $55 million per season.\n\nPrescott said once training camp begins, his involvement in the talks will end.\n\n\"Those guys definitely need to get paid and need to get their money,\" Prescott said. \"I've gotten a contract and so the last thing I'm going to ask them to do is take less. But this is a two-way street when you're talking about contracts. I've gotten older. I've got a decision in this thing so it's not just one-way here.\"\n\nPrescott reiterated he wants to remain with the Cowboys, but acknowledged he has an \"obligation,\" to other quarterbacks and his teammates on what he accepts. If Prescott accepts a new deal with the Cowboys or hits the open market, he will be well compensated.\n\nIn recent years, he has seen Tom Brady leave the New England Patriots for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Aaron Rodgers traded by the Green Bay Packers to the New York Jets.\n\n\"I want to be here but when you look up all the great quarterbacks I've watched played for other teams,\" Prescott said. \"So, my point in saying that is that that's not something to fear.

So that's the freedom that I have is [to] be where your feet are, make the most of it, be confident in yourself, make your team better. I love my teammates and I love that locker room and I love everything about being here in Oxnard and being a Dallas Cowboy so that's what allows me to be free and focused and understand that in time who knows what comes?\"\n\nOwner and general manager Jerry Jones said he does not worry about Prescott being elsewhere in 2025. He calls the contractual issues, \"business as usual,\" and is not afraid of the \"ambiguity,\" that comes from uncertain futures of players and coaches.\n\nHis focus is on 2024 and ending a Super Bowl drought that is 28 years and counting. For all of the losses in free agency, Jones was quick to point out 14 Pro Bowlers remain on the current roster even if there have not been substantial improvements made to a team that lost in the wild card round last January to Green Bay.\n\n\"I'm more about winning the award for the best way to end the season than I am winning the award for showing up at camp with my house in order,\" Jones said. \"I'm more worried about ending the season than I am a fast start ... I take a lot of solace in the fact that we've had the 12 [win] seasons, the wins that we've had over the last several years. The fact that we've got the personnel we've got here at camp, the coaches we got. I take a lot of solace that we're going to be there to get a chance to go to the playoffs and do better.\"", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescott,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prescott, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Prescott, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_McCarthy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mike McCarthy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All-Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxnard,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oxnard, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oxnard, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Rodgers", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Rodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Buccaneers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Green Bay Packers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Jets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Jets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Green Bay, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Green Bay, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://a2.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0725%2Fr1363296_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760782", "eventUri": "eng-9760782", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

He said it repeatedly. Then they weren't. In reality, it was just Jerry being Jerry. He likes microphones and says odd things at times. He was never going to spend wildly this offseason, not with the team having to figure out contracts for quarterback Dak Prescott, receiver CeeDee Lamb and pass rusher Micah Parsons.\n\nBut he said it, and it set an unrealistic expectation that wasn't met. Really, it served as an excuse for Cowboys doomsayers to freak out again.\n\nThe Cowboys have been one of the NFL's best teams the past few seasons but you'd never know it. Every playoff loss leads to months of Cowboys fans trying to fire or trade everyone. An offseason of inaction wasn't great, but it also didn't tear apart a roster that is a fantastic 36-15 the past three seasons. Dallas is treated like a team coming off three straight 5-12 seasons, not a trio of 12-5 seasons. The annual freakout was a focus of last offseason, this offseason and will be the theme of next offseason if Dallas doesn't make a deep playoff run.\n\nIn fairness, the way the Cowboys' season ended was disheartening. They were defeated 48-32 by the Green Bay Packers on wild-card weekend and it was worse than the final score. Dallas trailed 27-0 in the second quarter. By halftime everyone was already discussing if Mike McCarthy would get fired. He didn't, but it's not like there's more faith in him leading a Super Bowl run. This core is a great 73-41 in Prescott's career regular-season starts and just 2-5 in his playoff starts. Dallas seems like a great regular season team that won't get over the hump in the playoffs.\n\nBut that door hasn't closed. Prescott played so well he was in the MVP conversation until the very end of the season. Lamb led the NFL with 135 catches and had 1,735 yards. The running back situation isn't great, but there's a reason running backs have been devalued in the NFL. Dallas is a pass-first team anyway. The defense has been stellar the past few seasons and even with coordinator Dan Quinn moving on to be head coach of the Washington Commanders, it should still be one of the NFL's best groups. It's hard to win 12 games in the NFL. The Cowboys have done that three seasons in a row. It's not due to luck.\n\nIt wasn't the offseason Cowboys fans dreamed of when Jones got their hopes up. But the core of a 12-win roster stayed mostly the same. The Cowboys should be pretty good again this regular season. Then we'll see if the Cowboys can do better in the postseason. If not, we already know what the reaction will be.\n\nEven if we forget about Jerry Jones' \"all-in\" comments and how that affected the perception of the Cowboys' offseason, it wasn't great. The biggest losses were defensive lineman Dorace Armstrong, center Tyler Biadasz, running back Tony Pollard and offensive tackle Tyron Smith. That's not insignificant, though none of them are blue-chip players (Smith might be, but he has durability concerns and is 33 years old). The problem is the Cowboys did almost nothing to replace those players. Bringing back Ezekiel Elliott at running back doesn't fix much, even if Pollard wasn't great as a featured back last season. The Cowboys didn't have an exciting draft. They tried to beef up the line with offensive tackle Tyler Guyton in the first round and center Cooper Beebe in the third. Guyton was expected to be a developmental player but the Cowboys probably need him to play right away. Overall it's hard to say the Cowboys' roster is better, though the losses might be a bit overrated.\n\nGrade: D\n\nIf you listen to most of the chatter about Dak Prescott, you'd think he was one of the 10 worst quarterbacks in the NFL. Backups included. Prescott has become the new Kirk Cousins, ripped incessantly by some no matter how well he plays. Prescott was fantastic last season. He threw for 4,516 yards and a league-best 36 touchdowns with just nine interceptions. He had the third-best Pro Football Focus passing grade last season. He was third in EPA/play (expected points added) among quarterbacks behind only Brock Purdy and Josh Allen. He was named the most valuable player in the NFL last season by Seth Walder of ESPN Analytics.\n\nPrescott might have won the actual NFL MVP award if not for two December losses by the Cowboys. And he would have deserved it.\n\nThe chatter this season will be about Prescott's contract. If the Cowboys can't get an extension done with Prescott, he can be a free agent in 2025. No matter who signs Prescott to his next contract, he could blow away the current record of $55 million per season. He has leverage and has been better than Trevor Lawrence, one of the co-holders of that contract record (Joe Burrow is the other member of the $55 million per season club). The Cowboys always attract attention, so you're about to hear a lot about Prescott's contract situation over this season.\n\nThe Cowboys' win total at BetMGM opened at 10.5. That has inched closer to 9.5 as the offseason has gone on. Over 9.5 is -165 odds (bet $165 to win $100) and the under on 10.5 is -175, putting it roughly in the middle. The most bet under among all NFL teams at BetMGM is the Cowboys. Dallas has gone 12-5 each of the past three seasons and now most of the betting public doesn't think it can reach 11 wins. The Cowboys have slipped to 10th in the Super Bowl odds at +1800. They're behind teams like the Packers and Texans. The Eagles, who finished last season losing six of their last seven games and almost fired their coach, are ahead of Dallas in the NFC East odds. The Eagles are a heavy -120 to win the division while the Cowboys are +150. To repeat, Jerry Jones' \"all in\" comment and subsequent inaction has led to an abundance of negativity surrounding the Cowboys' prospects this season.\n\nFrom Yahoo's Scott Pianowski: \"Jake Ferguson had a breakout year in 2023, leading the tight end position in red-zone targets and charting as the TE8 through Week 17. But maybe there's room for improvement -- despite Ferguson's exposure around the goal, he scored a modest five touchdowns. Some of that positive regression kicked in during the playoffs, when Ferguson spiked three times (part of a 10-catch afternoon) against the Packers.\n\n\"The Cowboys didn't improve their receiver room, so Ferguson's target share looks secure. At minimum, Ferguson's a good bet to meet his TE9 ADP in Yahoo drafts, along with some profit potential as he steps into his third season.\"\n\nLast offseason Mike McCarthy talked about wanting to \"run the damn ball\" and to shift philosophy from old coordinator Kellen Moore who wanted to \"light the scoreboard up.\" Either McCarthy was playing coy, he realized that approach wasn't best in the modern NFL or he figured out his personnel pretty quickly. Because the Cowboys were fourth in the NFL in pass rate over expectation according to NFELO. They were also fourth in early-down pass rate, via RBSDM.com. Dallas was eighth in the NFL in passing attempts and 14th in rushing attempts. They were a pass-happy team, and that could get even more extreme this season.\n\nThe Cowboys let Tony Pollard leave in free agency and reunited with Ezekiel Elliott to replace him. The Cowboys' running back depth chart, led by Elliott with Rico Dowdle not far behind, might be the weakest in the NFL going into the season. Elliott is past his prime and Dowdle is an undrafted player with 385 career rushing yards in three NFL seasons. That is the weak spot on the Cowboys' roster, but they might compensate for that by leading the NFL in pass rate.\n\nThe biggest loss for the Cowboys wasn't on the roster. Dan Quinn did a fantastic job as the Cowboys' defensive coordinator and was hired away to be the Commanders' head coach. Mike Zimmer, the former Vikings coach, was hired to replace him. Zimmer is a respected defensive coach, but he has a different personality and schemes than Quinn. Quinn had an impressive run. Dallas finished as a top five defense in DVOA three straight seasons under his watch and led the NFL in takeaways during that stretch.\n\nZimmer won't try to replicate Quinn, but he isn't changing everything either.\n\n\"It's like I told the defense the first day I got here, 'This is a different deal for me. Usually when I come in, the defense is not good.' And they're pretty darn good,\" Zimmer said, via the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. \"We have to advance some of the things they were doing good and try to improve on the things they weren't doing as good.\n\n\"For the most part, they've played pretty darn good, and we're going to try to accentuate that and maybe be a little bit more technique-oriented, maybe a little bit more disciplined. At the end of the day, we've got to do it the way I want it done. I know [when] you try to come in and do somebody else's thing, it just doesn't go well.\"\n\nThe Cowboys have good talent, starting with Micah Parsons and including 2023 first-team All-Pro cornerback DaRon Bland. If Zimmer can provide a seamless coaching transition, Dallas should be among the league's best defenses again.\n\nThe Cowboys have been one of the NFL's elite teams ... in the regular season. Dak Prescott has played at an MVP level. Micah Parsons is going to win NFL Defensive Player of the Year soon. Dallas could be a top five offense and defense this season. And yet it seems like this team won't win a Super Bowl. That happens when you haven't been to the NFC championship game since the 1995 season. Since 1996, only Washington and Dallas haven't appeared in the NFC championship game. Still, logically, a team that can win 12 games three seasons in a row and has a top-tier offense, defense and a quarterback as good as Prescott can win a Super Bowl. If the Cowboys play as well as they did last regular season, they could win the NFC East and then maybe they can avoid a slow start against a wild-card opponent like last postseason. Everyone seems to be writing off the Cowboys but they still have the foundation to win a championship. At least an NFC East championship.\n\nContract situations can affect players, and the Cowboys' three best players have uncertain futures. Quarterback Dak Prescott, receiver CeeDee Lamb and edge rusher Micah Parsons are all seeking new deals. That could be a massive distraction this season. There are plenty of other potential concerns too, like the running back situation, receiving power beyond Lamb, an uncertain offensive line and how well the Cowboys defense adjusts without Dan Quinn. The Eagles were horrendous at the end of last season but still have the talent to run away with the NFC East. If the Cowboys don't adequately answer some of the questions they have coming into the season, they could miss the playoffs. Then you'd have to wonder if Mike McCarthy, Dak Prescott and many others are back in 2025.\n\nMaybe you're a big fan of Dorace Armstrong or Tyler Biadasz. If so, downgrading the Cowboys makes sense. If that's not the case, you're too busy listening to a lot of noise. Dallas is still a very good team. While the concerns about them aren't completely unfounded, there has been an overreaction to their offseason. That has happened before, mostly because it's the Cowboys and Dallas defeatism sells. The Cowboys are going to be good again. Dak Prescott will be among the NFL's best quarterbacks (and will get his contract extension from the Cowboys). Dallas will win the NFC East. Then the Cowboys will probably lose in the first two rounds of the playoffs and next offseason's chatter will lead you to believe they went 2-15. Then next year in their season preview here, you'll read about how it will be smart to ignore the negativity surrounding the Cowboys because they'll be better than people believe. It's becoming an annual tradition.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He paused before stating a rather telling quote.\n\n\"I want to be here, but when you look up -- all the great quarterbacks I watched played for other teams,\" Prescott said. \"That's not something to fear. It may be a reality for me one day. It may not be my decision. That's the freedom that I have.\"\n\nIf a contract isn't agreed upon, it's likely the 2024 season could be Prescott's last in Dallas.

Their most recent playoff thud was a 48-32 home loss to the Green Bay Packers in an NFC wild-card game where Dallas trailed 27-0 in the first half.\n\nStephen Jones described the continued postseason failures as \"the elephant in the room.\" Prescott pointedly bristled at a question about how last season ended.\n\n\"We know that,\" Stephen Jones said. \"Our fans know that.

And we haven't done that, and until we do it, there'll be frustration.\"\n\nThe specter of another playoff exit was treated with more seriousness than the ongoing question of contracts. Stephen Jones said he has been having productive conversations with the agents for Prescott and Lamb.\n\nJerry Jones noted numerous contract disputes all over the league. Players likened Lamb's holdout to that of guard Zack Martin last year, when he received a reworked contract after missing three weeks of camp and the preseason opener.\n\nEven Prescott, who led the league with 36 touchdown passes, said he is going into this season with a welcoming sense of relief knowing he will be well compensated wherever he plays next.\n\n\"Obviously I want to be here,\" Prescott said. \"I want to be here, but when you look up all the great quarterbacks I watched played for other teams. My point in saying that is that's not something to fear. That may be a reality for me one day. It may not be my decision. So that's the freedom that I have.\"\n\nJones was optimistic Prescott's ninth season with the Cowboys will not be his last before conceding the uncertainty ahead.\n\n\"Believe it or not, in my life I've had a lot of things I wanted that I couldn't get because I couldn't afford it,\" Jones said. \"Now have I learned to live with that in 80-something years?

However, Jones did make a somewhat surprising admission about Prescott's future Thursday during his media availability at training camp.\n\n\"To be very specific, I do not think that this will be his last year with the Cowboys, at all,\" Jones said. \"Am I being psychotic relative to my mirror? No. It's pretty clear, I think, I want to say it if it hadn't been clear of how much we appreciate what Dak Prescott has meant to this team in a positive way.\"\n\nDespite Jones' bold statement, he did, however, leave the door open to the possibility that Prescott might not be re-signed because his market could be more than what the Cowboys could afford to spend with contract extensions also looming for receiver CeeDee Lamb and edge-rusher Micah Parsons.\n\n\"But believe it or not, in my life I've had a lot of things I wanted that I couldn't get because I couldn't afford it,\" Jones added. \"Now, have I learned to live with that in 80-something years? You bet I have, and life does go on.\"\n\nSpotrac lists Prescott's market value at $53.1 million per season and it expects him to sign a four-year, $212.25 million contract next offseason.\n\nIf Jones sinks that kind of money into his QB, it's unlikely he can also sign Lamb to the kind of long-term deal he wants (likely in the $30M-per-year range) and keep Parsons the following year (top edge-rushers are making $25M to $34M per year).\n\nRelated: Jets RB Breece Hall Makes A Bold Guarantee For 2024 Season\n\nRelated: Jalen Hurts Gets Brutally Honest About Relationship With Eagles HC Nick Sirianni", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_gallagher@postandcourier.com", "name": "Michael Gallagher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dak_Prescott", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dak Prescott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CeeDee_Lamb", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CeeDee Lamb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micah_Parsons", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Micah Parsons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breece_Hall", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Breece Hall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Hurts", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Hurts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Sirianni", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nick Sirianni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Eagles"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/custom/image/6903687a-a7dc-11e9-896c-0bef6d6c9301.jpg?resize=600%2C314", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760782", "eventUri": "eng-9760782", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

Jones understands that it sets up a year with \"a lot on the line.\"\n\n\"There's nothing bright-lined about the kinds of things noted in this offseason that aren't happening. It's got a lot more ambiguity to it,\" Jones said Thursday.\n\nJones said that \"70 percent of your whole payroll\" will go to Prescott, holdout wide receiver CeeDee Lamb and outside linebacker Micah Parsons eventually, and reminded the Cowboys are still paying \"the credit card bill\" for restructuring bygone contracts.\n\nPrescott, who turns 31 on Monday, is in the final year of his contract and isn't eligible to be given the franchise tag.\n\nLamb, 25, was a camp no-show with $17.99 million due in salary for 2024, the final year of his contract.\n\nParsons, 25, has one year left on his four-year, $17.1 million rookie deal, and the Cowboys exercised his $21.3 million option for 2025, making him eligible for an extension.\n\n\"That's a challenge. How do you keep a supporting cast around (Dak) and make all of that work out? It's real,\" Jones said.\n\nHead coach Mike McCarthy sits at the middle of the mounting challenges but said he feels none of the pressure or perspiration of the outside media and fans focused on contracts and players who aren't in attendance at camp in Oxnard, Calif.\n\nHe's also working on an expiring contract but didn't want to discuss it Thursday.\n\n\"I view this question the same my whole tenure as a head coach. That's part of the business of the National Football League,\" McCarthy said. \"My energy, my focus, the players and the coaching staff is not even close to what we've been talking about the last 30 minutes. We're excited by the opportunity in front of us. ... The contract conversations, we talked about that back in the spring, and that's where that lies with me. That's not the way we're wired. We can't be wired that way. We're on an 11-hour workday.\"\n\nJones said he's still more than comfortable being responsible \"for any and everything that goes on\" under the Cowboys' roof. He said he's only comfortable operating that way because \"I can't delegate that.\"\n\nJones said he's not \"sitting up there throwing darts\" when asked about why the GM job wasn't on the line but the coach and players are fighting for their next season, said other teams change coaches and general managers far more frequently while the Cowboys have had two.\n\nStephen Jones remains a loud voice in the front office and indicated the Cowboys expect to be able to sign all of their key players with roster situations in flux.\n\n\"I just think it's very unique that you have a top quarterback on your team as well as two players on either side of the ball that feel like, and rightfully so, they're the best non-quarterback players in the league. It stresses the cap,\" Stephen Jones said. \"We think we can get it done. We think we can get Dak done. But there are tough decisions that you have to make if you want to keep your up-and-coming players. It's a good problem to have.\"\n\nJerry Jones said in Lamb's case he was \"waiting for more leaves to fall,\" before addressing his contract. Jones said there are \"hundreds of times\" in his life experiences when hindsight would indicate he maybe should have handed the ball off and not pitch it, equating his role as GM to being an option quarterback. He also referenced the \"Ben Franklin Method\" in listing\n\n\"We're buying time. We're option quarterbacking, going out toward the sideline and we haven't pitched the ball,\" Jerry Jones said. \"That's what we're doing.

Withholding services is the only way to grab the attention of a man who does not seem to realize the deleterious effects of his mismanagement.\n\nIn fact, I'll go a step further and say that Dak Prescott and Micah Parsons should join him in not practicing another down without long-term financial compensation.\n\nLong ago, good general managers, owners and coaches came to the critical realization that stability breeds success and that, when approaching a critical season, one of the key tenets is a sense-even if faint-of security; a sense that the sacrifices one has put on their body have been seen; a sense that they are not just going to be hurled out of the facility the moment they suffer a career-altering injury. We can see it in the way teams hire their coaches now. Gone are the Belichickian, Gruden-ian, Parcells-ian, paramilitary henchmen of years past, who have to operate publicly with little concern for someone's personal preferences and operate with the calculated coolness of an Alaskan detective. In are younger coaches who are just as revered for their team-building prowess; for keeping the door wide open; for leveling with their employees.\n\nGone next will be this absolutely ridiculous trend of waiting until the last possible second to sign valued members of the team to a contract. We've outlined this ad nauseam, but how much better is life for Detroit and Philadelphia, for example, having gotten ahead of their most pressing financial matters with the early signings of players such as DeVonta Smith, Amon-Ra St. Brown and Penei Sewell. Obviously, a team cannot pay everyone but they can pay their absolute best players before it is dangerously, frantically close to the deadline; before hard feelings and hurtful rumors and anonymous cat scratching creep into the fold and create those little moments of pessimism that force a player or a coach to ask, during the lean moments, \"Do I really want to lay my body out there for these cheapskates?\"\n\nI feel like we need to say it until someone hears: The Cowboys are \"attempting\" (quotes for emphasis) to win a Super Bowl this year whilst nearly the entire staff is on one-year contracts. The head coach has no security despite winning 12 games a year each of the past three years. The quarterback has no security despite three Pro Bowl appearances, despite leading the NFL in touchdown passes a year ago, despite finishing second-team All-Pro and despite being a Walter Payton Man of the Year. The generational pass rusher has little security beyond next year's fifth-year option despite logging 40 sacks and 89 quarterback hits in three seasons, along with three Pro Bowl and two first-team All-Pro nods, and a Defensive Rookie of the Year award.\n\nThe wide receiver is finally willing to take Jones Inc. to the mat ... well, you get it.\n\nA group holdout of the team's star troika would be the only way to snap Jerry Jones out of this trance. During the elongated lead-up to Prescott's last contract negotiation, I wrote about the franchise's long history of believing that there is a certain privilege to playing for the sport's most popular franchise. That posture informed a certain arrogance at the bargaining table and, indeed, they have gotten top-of-the-market players to take less at times (even before Jones, the team's culture of throwing around steakhouse dinners, pressuring unsigned players via their weekly television show and fixing them up with summer jobs was incredibly commonplace).\n\nBut that advantage is changing. Sure, it's great to be a Cowboy but if some name brand really mattered all that much, Notre Dame would be competing for a national championship every year and not getting boat raced by every five-star who opted into the SEC. The Yankees wouldn't be caving in every August and September as their brittle roster collapsed. Prescott and Parsons would still be just as famous playing for the Jaguars. Lamb, often overshadowed, may actually heighten his personal brand awareness by going to a place where he can enjoy top billing.\n\nLook around the NFL right now at all of the other pending holdouts. The Dolphins and Tua Tagovailoa have yet to come to terms in what is, legitimately, a complex situation. We don't know if Tagovailoa is the product of a system or has simply, miraculously improved under head coach Mike McDaniel. We don't know if he can function as a north star for this offense without Tyreek Hill. This is something that most sane people understand.\n\nThe Packers and Jordan Love? Another situation where the player has immense promise and is in need of a massive, market-altering extension despite a very limited sample size.\n\nThe 49ers and Brandon Aiyuk? Same deal. The offense is so prolific, and Aiyuk took so long to come around to playing within its rhythms. The team also drafted a potential replacement in the first round of this year's draft.\n\nLamb is not a player who elicits question marks. Nor is Prescott. Nor is Parsons. Each of them is either the best player at their position in the NFL, or among the best players at their position. They don't deserve to be held in the same purgatory. Kudos to Lamb for at least taking the first step toward changing that by throwing his feet up when it comes time to start padded practice.\n\nPrescott and Parsons should be right behind him. It's the only way to show Jones that, when it comes to this iteration of the Dallas Cowboys, it's not about the Star anymore. It's about a collection of them that a franchise has somehow stumbled upon but doesn't appear grateful for in the least.\n\nThis article was originally published on www.si.com as Cowboys' Dak Prescott

While appearing on The Athletic's Scoop City, the Cowboys chief operating officer and co-owner shared his thoughts on the team's playoff record the last three years.\n\n\"I think at the end of the day, a lot of people want to somewhat be critical of the organization of Jerry [Jones] and myself, Coach [Mike] McCarthy of our team, and of course, Dak [Prescott] being the quarterback gets the brunt of it of our success in the playoffs,\" Stephen Jones said.\n\n\"At the same time, you gotta certainly recognize that we've won 36 regular season games in three years, which of course we're playing 17 games. The Patriots may have done that, doing it in 16 games on a three-year run. But we're having really great success in the regular season. There's no question, I understand the criticism from our fans, I understand criticism from media, we all understand that in terms of not winning the big game in the playoffs.\n\n\"We certainly got to take that next step. I know we could go out there and no one's assuming anything and have another great regular season. And, they shouldn't, no one's going to give... 'Hey, they're going to get it done this time until they see it.' We understand that, we put ourselves in that position with our playoff-winning percentage. We do have to take that next step, but I certainly believe we can do it.\"\n\nIn the last three seasons, the Cowboys have gone 12-5 and have won two NFC East titles. But when it comes to the playoffs, Dallas has won just one postseason game. The team has not played in an NFC title game since the 1995 Super Bowl win.\n\nFollowing the end of the 2023 season, Jerry Jones explained why the 2024 season will be different in terms of a playoff run. \"What I would say is, I hope it's not different going into the first playoff game where we've got the second seed,\" Jones said. \"Now, when we play in that game, we need to stop the run better, and be more physical and we need to run better.\"\n\nWhile fans are hoping for big things this upcoming season, they are hoping that the Cowboys' star players get new contracts. Prescott, Micah Parsons and CeeDee Lamb are three Cowboys that are seeking new deals.", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brian_jones@on3.com", "name": "Brian Jones", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_operating_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief operating officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CeeDee_Lamb", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CeeDee Lamb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micah_Parsons", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Micah Parsons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFC_East", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFC East"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Football Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Word_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Word Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Baby_Showers", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Baby Showers", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2024/02/28113201/cowboys-stephen-jones-shares-thoughts-on-organization-culture.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9760782", "eventUri": "eng-9760782", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

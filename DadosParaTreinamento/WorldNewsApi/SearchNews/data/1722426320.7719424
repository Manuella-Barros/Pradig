The response came after Trump accused Biden of having caused \"deaths at the Southern border,\" alleging that he \u201cis a criminal.\u201d Biden looked at Trump in disgust, slamming his history, per The Daily Beast. \u201cHow many billions of dollars do you owe for molesting a woman in public? For doing a whole range of things?\u201d Biden asked, referencing the E. Jean Carroll case, adding on a particularly devastating shot about Daniels. \u201cOf having sex with a porn star on the night your wife was pregnant? What are you talking about? You have the morals of an alley cat.\u201d When Biden brought up Daniels during his speech, Trump grinned, lowered his gaze, nodded, and then shook his head. He then responded by raising his hand, and again refuting Daniels' account. Trump declared, \u201cI didn\u2019t have sex with a porn star.\u201d Biden was alluding to Stormy Daniel's claims that she and Trump had a one-night stand in 2006, when Melania was supposedly pregnant, and Carroll's allegations that the former president sexually assaulted her in a dressing room thirty years ago, for which he was found liable by a jury. In his Manhattan trial last month, Trump was found guilty on 34 counts of concealing a 2016 hush money payment he made to Daniels, becoming the first former president to be convicted of a felony. Before Biden's jab, Trump had attacked Hunter Biden, the president's son, without reason after being questioned about how he would get revenge on his political rivals. Trump then made an unverified accusation that the president was a criminal. \u201cJoe could be a convicted felon with all of the things that he\u2019s done. He\u2019s done horrible things. All of the death he\u2019s caused at the border,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThis man is a criminal. I had done nothing wrong. We have a system that is rigged and disgusting. I did nothing wrong,\u201d Trump continued. While Biden's performance in the debate was unimpressive generally, this specific exchange was the moment when he threw off his ivory tower style and entered the ring\u2014a move many have believed is essential when facing a pugilist such as Trump. Trump, who fueled the Jan. 6 uprising, was asked three times if he would accept the election results if judicial challenges were exhausted. He declined to offer an equivocal response, per The Guardian. The debate moderators, CNN's Dana Bash and Jake Tapper, did not conduct any thorough or even basic fact-checking on either candidate. Trump mentioned \"post-birth abortions,\" which resulted in zero pushback from Biden or the moderators. Trump also accused Nancy Pelosi of turning down an opportunity to deploy the National Guard on January 6. No one objected when Trump labeled Biden a \"Palestinian\" as if it were a pejorative.", "summary": "<img alt=\"Biden Says Trump \u2018Has Morals of an Alleycat\u2019 Taking Dig at Stormy Affair Amid Melania\u2019s Pregnancy\" src=\"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/702158/uploads/ad3c7fd0-354a-11ef-be72-eb8147723549_800_420.jpeg\" />\n                \u201cHaving  with a  star on the night your wife was pregnant?

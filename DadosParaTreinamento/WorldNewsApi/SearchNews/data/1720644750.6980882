Swifties described the Edinburgh concert as \u2018the best night ever.\u2019 On the morning after the show (June 8) Viagogo reported up to 30,000 fans an hour were looking at ticket availability for the remaining 14 UK Taylor Swift dates, according to a MyLondon report. The country star was full of praise for her UK fans, saying they had made her and her crew feel 'wonderfully welcome'. She added: \"Even before we got here, you showed love and passion. We got here and you guys are like this! The volume of singing and dancing, I can't stop looking at the crowd, I'm fully distracted by how great you are.\" READ MORE: Taylor Swift Eras Tour UK shows - set list, start times, bags policy, tickets and seating plans READ NEXT: How to get resale tickets for Taylor Swift's Eras Tour UK shows - everything you need to know Having queued at Murrayfield stadium from 5am, fans felt it was worth all the effort. And critics were impressed too. Daily Record music critic John Dingwall said it was \u2018a spectacle not to be missed\u2019 and \u2018three-and-a-half hours of pure entertainment\u2019 with a buzz unmatched by gigs he\u2019d seen by stars including Madonna, Prince, Springsteen, U2 and Michael Jackson. The 70,000-strong crowd went wild when Taylor performed two separate mashups in the much-loved 'surprise songs' section of the show, with fan @posingforcats on X, formerly Twitter, saying: \"This is the best combo of surprise songs ever. Unbeatable.\" Beginning with a medley of Would've, Could've, Should've from Midnights 3am Edition, she paused part way through to signal to security that a fan was in distress, saying she wouldn't continue until they were helped. She then continued with I Know Places from 1989 before moving on to a piano hybrid of 'Tis the Damn Season from Evermore and Daylight from Lover. Now fans are even more desperate to try to get hold of tickets for her remaining gigs in Edinburgh, Liverpool, Cardiff and London. Sites such as Viagogo and Vivid Seats allow fans to buy resale tickets from other fans. However, it is important to note that many event promoters say tickets should not be resold after initial purchase and will not be valid for admittance to gigs. Fans attending live events with tickets acquired through resale websites are advised to double-check the ticket terms and conditions at the point of sale - such as Ticketmaster or Live Nation - to ensure a smooth live event experience. Tickets could be voided if they were found to be bought second-hand. As a result, fans are buying at their own risk. With that said, Viagogo said: \u201cViagogo is a regulated marketplace where fans have the freedom to buy and sell tickets to their favourite live events, safely and securely, backed by a guarantee.\u201d There are currently a few hundred tickets available for each of the eight nights at Wembley. The cheapest tickets available now on Viagogo cost \u00a3317 for seated and \u00a3464 for standing, both on Sunday, June 23. The most expensive individual ticket is a whopping \u00a32,236. Limited tickets are still available for all UK dates on the tour not just through Viagogo but also Vivid Tickets and also from Ticketmaster, but in considerably fewer numbers. Prices vary across all sites.", "summary": "Viagogo says that 'up to 30,000 fans an hour' are scrambling to get resale tickets to Taylor Swift's UK gigs", "url": "https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/whats-on/shopping/taylor-swift-fans-clamour-eras-29317969", "image": "https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/incoming/article29318088.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Taylor-Swifts-Eras-Tour-Edinburgh.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 14:00:46", "author": "Narin Flanders", "authors": ["Narin Flanders"], "language": "en", "catgory": "entertainment", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.034}

Also, the offense stunk without him. Even beyond the mess at quarterback, New York dealt with a problematic offensive line. The unit seemed like a revolving door\u2014especially at center and on the right side\u2014and simply was not an effective group overall. This offseason, the Jets have continually invested in the O-line. New York signed veteran tackle Tyron Smith and guard John Simpson, traded for tackle Morgan Moses and drafted tackle Olu Fashanu in the first round. Three of them likely will start in 2024, and the fourth will be a top backup in case of injuries. Also, the Jets picked up wideout Mike Williams. He's recovering from a torn left ACL but should be a strong No. 2 option after Garrett WIlson. Third-round pick Malachi Corley may earn a starting job, too. Expectations will be high for Rodgers in this retooled offense.", "summary": "All 32 NFL teams attempt to improve their offense in free agency and the draft, but only a small number make significant strides.

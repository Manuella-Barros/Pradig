Plus, it's great for keeping skin hydrated on a daily basis! Customer review: \"I don't know where to begin. This is probably one of my very favorite products. Ever. And let me tell you, I have used a lot of products ranging from moisturizers to sun care, etc. this stuff is actual magic. I'm not kidding. I have tan, olive skin & still manage to peel each & every time I burn. It's inevitable, BUT this stuff literally prevents peeling 99% of the time for me (which happens often in the Florida sun). I've been using this for 3 years and I'm still amazed writing this review. If I could just have a lifetime supply, I'd be a happy gal.\"", "summary": "<img src=\"https://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/2024325/rs_1200x1200-240425073816-Shop_Best_After-Sun_Products_1200_x_1200_px.jpg?fit=around|660:660\"  \n                        height=\"660\" width=\"660\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Shop Best After-Sun Products\" align=\"left\" hspace=\"5\" />   \n                    We independently selected these products because we love them, and we hope you do too at these prices.

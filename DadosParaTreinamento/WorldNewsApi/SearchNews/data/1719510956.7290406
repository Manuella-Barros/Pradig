{"id": 223738992, "title": "El Nini: Top Sinaloa cartel sicario extradited to US", "text": "US prosecutors alleged El Nini was tasked with kidnapping, torturing and killing rival drug traffickers. He was detained in the organisation\u2019s stronghold of Culiac\u00e1n, the capital of the state of Sinaloa, which gives its name to the cartel. The arrest is part of an effort by US and Mexican authorities to stem the flow of fentanyl across the Mexico-US border. The drug contributes to the deaths of tens of thousands in the US every year. Perez is one of the highest-profile extraditions to have taken place under Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who has pledged to \"achieve peace and end the [drug] war\". According to the US Drug Enforcement Administration, three of El Chapo's sons - Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez and his half-brothers Iv\u00e1n Archivaldo and Jes\u00fas Alfredo Guzm\u00e1n Salazar - were leaders of a trafficking empire responsible for smuggling millions of doses of fentanyl to the US. Mr L\u00f3pez, whose nickname is the Mouse, was extradited to the US in September on charges of drug trafficking and money laundering, to which he pleaded not guilty. Two of the other brothers remain at large.", "summary": "Nestor Isidro Perez Salas is accused of the trafficking and sale of fentanyl in the United States.", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c722wlqlgglo", "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/13f8/live/7bc03100-1b63-11ef-abaf-37a7226419b1.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 14:02:49", "author": "Tom Mcarthur", "authors": ["Tom Mcarthur"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.287}

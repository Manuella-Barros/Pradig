The defending NL champion Diamondbacks have not been this close to .500 since they were 12-13 on April 23.\n\n\"It was a really clean game today for us,\" manager Torey Lovullo said.\n\nCJ Abrams extended his hitting streak to 11 games for Washington, which was limited to four hits and had its three-game winning streak snapped.\n\nThe Diamondbacks quickly went ahead against Jake Irvin (5-6) when Carroll led off the game with a walk and promptly stole second. Marte then drove a 2-2 curveball to right-center for his 15th home run.\n\nArizona tacked on two more in the fifth inning when Geraldo Perdomo doubled and scored on Carroll's triple to left-center. Carroll came around on Marte's sacrifice fly.\n\nCarroll also walked in the third and singled in the ninth. Last season's NL Rookie of the Year exited Sunday's game against the Chicago White Sox in the seventh inning after making an awkward throw from the outfield.\n\n\"He's a hungry player,\" Lovullo said. \"He did a great job. He said he was OK and he proved it. Sometimes you have to get out of the way of the athlete. When they tell you they can go out and do something, you have to trust them, and we certainly trust Corbin.\"\n\nIrvin was in trouble throughout his outing, allowing the leadoff batter to reach base in all five innings. But he limited the damage to four runs in part because the Diamondbacks hit into four inning-ending double plays.\n\n\"He was a little off,\" Washington manager Dave Martinez said. \"His command wasn't quite there, but he battled and he gave us five innings. Today he fell behind a lot of hitters. He walked the first guy of the game. That's not usually what he does.\"\n\nThe early support was plenty for Cecconi (2-5), who earned his first victory since April 21 and completed six innings for the first time since April 27. He retired the first nine batters he faced and yielded three hits and no walks while striking out six.\n\nCecconi, who gave up a career-high seven runs in three innings in his last outing Wednesday against the Los Angeles Angels, threw just 70 pitches against the aggressive Nationals. The right-hander recorded four first-pitch outs.\n\n\"It seems like that's what every team wants to do against me, and I get it,\" Cecconi said. \"I don't really walk a lot of guys. They know I throw strikes and they want to go out there and hit a mistake over the middle of the plate. Last week, I threw a lot of pitches over the middle of the plate that got hit. I don't think I did this week.\"\n\nJesse Winker, stranded after a two-out double in the fourth, was the only Nationals batter to reach scoring position.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nNationals: Winker (right knee) returned to the lineup after a one-game absence. ... RHP Josiah Gray (forearm flexor strain) will pitch Wednesday for Double-A Harrisburg. Martinez said Gray will throw around 75-80 pitches. ... RHP Cade Cavalli (Tommy John surgery) threw a bullpen. He is scheduled to make a rehab appearance Friday at Class A Wilmington.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nArizona RHP Brandon Pfaadt (3-5, 4.38 ERA) faces Washington for the first time Wednesday, while the Nationals counter with former Diamondbacks LHP Patrick Corbin (1-7, 5.84).\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press.

They'll be able to call on a quintet of established major league pitchers, including Zac Gallen, Merrill Kelly and Eduardo Rodriguez. It will finally be how General Manager Mike Hazen envisioned it this off-season when he put this team together, hoping for far greater things than the 36-37 start that has instead transpired.\n\nThat day, though, remains a mirage somewhere out on the horizon. Gallen may be close to a return, but both Kelly and Rodriguez are likely out through the All-Star break.\n\nIn the meantime, the Diamondbacks will need help from a trio of pitchers who are not established major leaguers. Combined, Slade Cecconi, Ryne Nelson and Tommy Henry have a 5.82 ERA. They have restricted the Diamondbacks' progress, even as the offense has found its rhythm in recent weeks. For the club to manage its way through the next month, at least two of them will likely have to provide more value.\n\nOn Tuesday night in Washington, Cecconi did exactly that. The Diamondbacks scored five runs -- the exact type of output that can go both ways. With poor pitching, their efforts would have been wasted. Instead, Cecconi paved the way to a comfortable 5-0 win over the Nationals.\n\n\"This was a really clean game,\" manager Torey Lovullo said. \"And it was because of Slade.\"\n\nIn six innings, Cecconi struck out six and allowed just three hits. He did not walk a batter nor allow a run. It was the first time this season that one of the Diamondbacks' replacement starters has gone six scoreless.\n\nAnd it came amid a brutal run for Cecconi, one that had only elevated Arizona's rotation concerns. He initially pitched well after an April call-up but since the start of May, he had allowed 30 runs in 32 1/3 innings. His latest outing was the worst yet -- a three-inning, seven-run disaster against the Angels.\n\n\"That was the worst (start) of my career,\" Cecconi said. But in the ensuing days, his teammates and coaches repeated a message of confidence. \"That I'm better than that and I'm gonna be better than that,\" as Cecconi relayed.\n\nAt the same time, pitching coach Brent Strom landed on a small mechanical adjustment. Over the off-season, he and Cecconi worked on pitching in a direct manner towards home plate rather than spinning out, which can cause him to become erratic with his command. The results, though, had only come sporadically.\n\nOn Tuesday, Cecconi adjusted the placement of his back foot, keeping it more closed towards the plate instead of open towards second base.\n\n\"With it being closed, I was able to hip load without having to really swing back and get into that rotational state,\" Cecconi said. \"So that was a big piece.\"\n\nThe tweak worked as well as the Diamondbacks could have hoped. On the very first batter of the game, Cecconi showed strong command, getting CJ Abrams to bounce out on a perfect changeup just off the plate. For six innings, that command rarely waivered, ending with what Lovullo described as \"a statement pitch.\" With a runner on for Lane Thomas, Cecconi spotted the ninth pitch of the at-bat on the outside corner, freezing the Nationals' outfielder for strike three looking.\n\n\"There would be a very crucial pitch to the at-bat and he was the one that was winning that crucial pitch,\" Lovullo said. \"He was ahead in counts and just the demeanor, just the focus, the intensity.\"\n\nAt the same time, the Diamondbacks' offense continued its recent impressive stretch. They've now scored 58 runs over their past eight games, a number that could have been higher if they had done a better job of capitalizing on their 14 hits.\n\nCorbin Carroll showed what the Diamondbacks would have been missing had his injury scare Sunday proven to be significant. He walked twice, tripled and singled. He stole a base and capitalized on an error to take second on his single. All of it was reminiscent of the player he was a year ago, and the player he has once again been over the past three weeks.\n\n\"He said he was okay,\" Lovullo said. \"And he proved it.\"\n\nAnd he helped fire the Diamondbacks to a spot they have not occupied in months. They are, somehow, in a National League playoff spot.\n\nWednesday's Diamondbacks-Nationals pitching matchup\n\nDiamondbacks at Nationals, 1:05 p.m., Cox, Ch. 34\n\nDiamondbacks RHP Brandon Pfaadt (3-5, 4.38) vs. Nationals LHP Patrick Corbin (1-7, 5.84).\n\nAt Chase Field: After being one of the breakout stars of the Diamondbacks' run to the World Series last fall, Pfaadt has struggled with inconsistency this season. His strikeout rate of 9.0 per nine and walk rate of 1.8 per nine are both encouraging but his ERA has lagged behind. ... Last time out was one of Pfaadt's good days as he struck out eight and allowed one run in six innings of a win over the Angels. ... Prior to that, he allowed at least four runs in three consecutive starts. He has not yet had a scoreless outing this year. ... Corbin has been one of baseball's worst pitchers for four seasons now. Since the start of 2021, he is 26-57 with a 5.76 ERA. ... Corbin had a strong first season in Washington after leaving the Diamondbacks in free agency, helping the Nationals to the 2019 World Series title, but he has held the Nationals back ever since. ... Corbin's trademark slider has not been effective for years. Opponents are batting .315 against him this season.\n\nComing up\n\nThursday: At Washington, 10:05 a.m., Diamondbacks RHP Ryne Nelson (4-5, 5.49) vs. Nationals LHP MacKenzie Gore (6-5, 3.24).\n\nFriday: At Philadelphia, 3:40 p.m., Diamondbacks LHP Tommy Henry (2-2, 6.23) vs. Phillies RHP Taijuan Walker (3-2, 5.33).\n\nSaturday: At Philadelphia, 1:05 p.m., Diamondbacks LHP Jordan Montgomery (5-4, 6.00) vs. Phillies RHP Zack Wheeler (8-4, 2.84).\n\nWhat to know about the Washington Nationals\n\nThe Nationals made little in the way of significant acquisitions over the offseason, but they find themselves playing competitive baseball and squarely in the middle of the playoff hunt in a mediocre National League. After sweeping the Marlins over the weekend, the Nationals have won eight of nine games. The Nationals have the third-worst OPS (.668) in the NL, but their pitching staff has been solid, ranking fifth with a 3.84 ERA. SS C.J. Abrams has been their most productive hitter with a .258/.310/.477 line and a team-leading 11 homers. OF Jesse Winker also is off to a solid start, hitting .265 with six homers and 31 RBIs. The Diamondbacks will face two of the Nationals' better starters this week in RHP Jake Irvin and LHP MacKenzie Gore. Irvin is a late-blooming former fourth-round pick in 2018 while Gore was one of the players acquired in the OF Juan Soto trade. RHP Kyle Finnegan ranks second in the league with 20 saves (in 22 opportunities) and a 1.78 ERA.", "source": {"uri": "azcentral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AZ Central"}, "authors": [{"uri":

That said, this page is updated frequently so make sure that you click on the link provided so that you're getting the most updated information.\n\nChristian Walker went 1-for-4 and scored the Diamondbacks' lone run in Wednesday's loss to the Nationals. The only run that the Diamondbacks were able to scratch out against Patrick Corbin and company on Wednesday afternoon came as Gabriel Moreno worked a bases-loaded walk in the third inning that allowed Walker to score. The 33-year-old slugger has been a force in the middle of the Diamondbacks' lineup once again this season -- slashing .255/.333/.475 with 16 homers, 49 RBI and a pair of stolen bases.\n\nJesse Winker slugged a go-ahead two-run homer in the sixth inning, powering the Nationals to a 3-1 victory over the Diamondbacks on Wednesday afternoon in Washington D.C. Winker's game-changing blast came off of Diamondbacks' right-hander Brandon Pfaadt with two outs in the sixth inning. He got an 0-1 fastball and crushed a 399-foot (101.8 mph EV) two-run shot that plated Lane Thomas as well, giving the Nationals a 2-1 edge. The 30-year-old outfielder finished the day 1-for-3 plus a walk and is now hitting a respectable .271/.383/.410 with seven homers, 33 RBI and a career-high 11 stolen bases on the season.\n\nThe total has gone UNDER in 10 of Washington's last 12 games when playing at home against Arizona\n\nNationals are 5-24 SU in their last 29 games played on a Thursday when playing at home\n\nOver/Under has gone UNDER in 10 of Arizona's last 12 games when playing on the road against Washington\n\nDiamondbacks are 10-3 SU in their last 13 games against Washington\n\nTake the under.

Cecconi has held opponents to 8-for-78 the first time through the batting order (.103).\n\nCJ Abrams delivered Washington's first hit but was quickly thrown out trying to steal second by catcher Gabriel Moreno.\n\nCecconi allowed three hits without walking a single batter. His seven-game streak allowing at least on home run ended. And he was fired up after catching Washington's Lane Thomas looking to end his outing.\n\nThe D-backs pulled Cecconi at 70 pitches (52 strikes) with a fully loaded bullpen.\n\n\"These young starters have to turn the page,\" assistant general manager Amiel Sawdaye told Arizona Sports' Wolf and Luke pregame.\n\n\"Slade has really good stuff. I think it's well chronicled when he gets second, third time through lineups, hitters make adjustments and he has to make those adjustments and counterpunch. I think he's learning that at the big league level, whether or not it's too early for him to be up here, he belongs. We expect him to perform like every other starting pitcher that we anticipate running out there.\"\n\nJustin Martinez and Bryce Jarvis got it done in relief to keep the shutout intact. Arizona has four shutout victories this season.\n\nDiamondbacks get going early\n\nThe D-backs got Cecconi an early lead to work with, as Ketel Marte blasted a two-run home run off Nationals starter Jake Irvin in the first inning. It was Marte's 15th home run of the season.\n\nCorbin Carroll tripled home a run in the fifth inning and scored on a Marte sacrifice fly to take a 4-0 lead.\n\nCarroll -- who had an MRI on Monday for left side tightness that came back clean -- went 2-for-3 with two walks, two runs scored and a stolen base. Marte was 2-for-4 with three RBIs.\n\nThe Diamondbacks out-hit the Nationals 14-4. They have recorded at least nine hits in seven of eight games.\n\nAnother trend to continue was the lack of close games. Arizona's last 10 contests have been decided by five or more runs.\n\nImportant wild card series\n\nThe Nationals entered the three-game set 0.5 games ahead of the D-backs in a crowded NL wild card field.\n\nArizona is climbing back to .500 with an 11-5 record in June.\n\nThe series continues Wednesday at 1:05 p.m. Brandon Pfaadt will pitch for Arizona, while former Diamondbacks left-hander Patrick Corbin is probable for Washington.", "source": {"uri": "arizonasports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arizona Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_weiner@arizonasports.com", "name": "Alex

Thomas homered in his third straight game on Sunday and extended his hitting streak to 10 games. During that stretch he is hitting .351 (13-for-37) with a double, a triple, four homers, eight RBIs and 10 runs scored.\n\n\"Right now, he's just seeing the ball really well,\" manager Dave Martinez said. \"He's getting back on time and really trying to stay in the middle of the field and drive the ball. ... He's really staying behind the baseball well. And when he does that, we've seen what he can do.\"\n\nThe Nationals completed a three-game sweep of the Marlins with a 3-1 win on Sunday and outscored Miami 15-2 in the series.\n\n\"This weekend was an all-around good weekend,\" Martinez said. \"Pitching was good. We scored runs when we needed to. Defense played well. We've got to clean up some things, but I'm very proud of the way the guys played.\"\n\nWashington right-hander Jake Irvin (5-5, 3.00 ERA) opens the series against right-hander Slade Cecconi (1-5, 6.70).\n\nIrvin has been on a roll, going 3-1 with a 1.48 ERA over his past five starts. Last time out, he allowed one run over six innings in a win against Detroit. He is 0-1 with a 3.60 ERA in two starts versus the Diamondbacks.\n\nCecconi has struggled this season, losing his last five decisions and posting a 8.25 ERA in three June starts. On June 12, he allowed seven runs on 10 hits over three innings in an 8-3 loss to the visiting Angels.\n\n\"Starting pitching for us -- I felt like could have been better,\" Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo said after the game. \"Slade needs to be on the attack, work his fastball on the edges and complement that with some secondary stuff. It's a grind. I'm not gonna lie to you.\"\n\nCecconi has never faced the Nationals.\n\nArizona has won three of its last four games and sits right behind Washington in the wild-card race. The Diamondbacks took two of three from the Chicago White Sox over the weekend, including a 12-5 win on Sunday.\n\nFirst baseman Christian Walker homered, doubled and drove in three runs for Arizona, but the news was not all good. Center fielder Corbin Carroll, the 2023 NL Rookie of the Year, left in the seventh inning after making a throw. He was scheduled for an MRI on his left side on Monday.\n\n\"Just kind of a weird position, kind of got my left leg out in front of me when I went to throw and (felt) just a general kind of, I guess, like a pull feeling,\" Carroll said. \"Not super painful. I'm feeling pretty good right now and, you know, I hope to be out there for the Washington series.\"", "source": {"uri": "deadspin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deadspin"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Mandatory Credit: Joe Camporeale-USA TODAY Sports / Joe Camporeale-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Arizona Diamondbacks are coming into today's matchup in D.C. with a large pitching disadvantage on paper. They will, however, have their star outfielder back to try and overcome it.\n\nSlade Cecconi will pitch today for the D-Backs. His numbers recently have not been particularily pretty, with him coming fresh off allowing 7 runs to a poor playing Angels club. That brought his ERA to 6.70 on the season and his FIP to a slightly better 5.99.\n\nCecconi has not done everything poorly, with his walks still being few and far between. He has an equal amount of walks as games pitched this year with only 9 on the season.\n\nA big challenge for the young righty has been facing the lineup a second time through the order. Every time the batting order turns over it seems like he gets hit hard. That trend was an issue before, but more recently it seems like he has been getting hit hard regardless. Cecconi needs to shut down the Nationals offense, and turn it over to the bullpen which is well rested after an offday.\n\nJake Irvin will go for Washington today, and he will be a force to be reckoned with. He has started 5 consecutive games while allowing 2 runs or less while alaso giving the Nationals much needed length, going a minimum of 6 innings in each of those starts. His 3.00 ERA and 3.24 FIP on the year dont give a worse impression on his impressive numbers in 2024.\n\nThe Nationals are a much more impressive club overall than some of the most recent opponents for the Diamondbacks. The Nats have won 8 of 10 games including three of four from the Braves at the beginning of this stretch.\n\nThis is an important series to take with Washington currently half a game ahead of the D-Backs in the Wild Card standings, giving Arizona a prime opportunity to jump ahead of them during this series.\n\nThe Diamondbacks are thankfully welcoming back Corbin Carroll to the top of the lineup. It might surprise some to hear the concern there as Carroll did not miss a game, but during the series finale against Chicago D-Backs fans got quite a scare.\n\nCarroll seemed to pull something on a funky throw back to the infield. He stayed back in Phoenix to get an MRI but all was clear and he rejoined the team in Washington today.\n\nGeraldo Perdomo has also enjoyed a nice return to the team, in his first week back hitting .389 with a .839 OPS. He is in a familiar spot in the lineup, hitting in the 9 hole, ready to send it back up to the top.\n\nC.J. Abrams, the Nationals young superstar is slated to lead off for them today. He is enjoying a breakout campaign in 2024, and in his last 6 games has a 1.221 OPS with a home run and 5 RBI. He will play a key role in Washington's series hopes, and will play and equal role in the Diamondbacks eyes as they look to keep him contained.\n\nThe D-backs and Nationals series opener begins at 3:45 PM Arizona time.

''I'm proud of this team. We've taken on a lot this year. I'm saying it a lot and I'm sure everybody is tired of hearing me say it, but we're missing three-fifths of our starting rotation. What we've done is pretty impressive, and we're just getting better every single day.''\n\nLane Thomas and Jesse Winker homered for Washington, which was denied its second chance in three days to get back to .500 for the first time since it was 20-20 after the first game of a doubleheader May 14. The Nationals are 36-38.\n\nNelson (5-5) needed only 70 pitches to breeze through seven innings of three-hit ball, and he allowed two runs without walking a batter. The right-hander struck out two and retired 13 of his last 14 batters to win consecutive starts for the first time this season.\n\n''Watching the last couple games, they seemed very aggressive,'' Nelson said. ''We didn't know if they were going to change that game plan or if they were going to stick to it. It was a lot about executing good pitches early in the counts and trying to get them to hit my pitch and get some quick outs and it ended up working.''\n\nNelson is 3-2 with a 3.60 ERA in his last six outings. He's dropped his ERA from 7.06 to 5.18 in that span.\n\n''We made early outs,'' Washington manager Dave Martinez said. ''These guys all attacked us this series. We have to get ready to hit.''\n\nPaul Sewald handled the ninth for his eighth save. Sewald has pitched 11 2/3 scoreless innings in 13 outings since May 9.\n\nDown 1-0 entering the fourth, Arizona sandwiched a pair of singles around a sacrifice bunt before Tucker Barnhart's single tied it. Two batters later, Grichuk doubled into the left field corner off MacKenzie Gore to drive in two more runs.\n\nKevin Newman added a two-out RBI single in the fifth off Gore (6-6), who had won four of his previous five starts. The left-hander allowed four runs and a season-high 10 hits in five innings. He struck out seven.\n\nThomas ripped Nelson's 93 mph fastball into the visitor's bullpen in left-center in the third, and Winker smashed a changeup to deep center with two outs in the sixth. It was Thomas' fourth home run on Washington's 4-2 homestand, while Winker went deep for the second consecutive day. Both have eight homers this season.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nDiamondbacks: RHPs Zac Gallen (strained hamstring) and Miguel Castro (shoulder) are scheduled to throw simulated games early next week. ...

The general manager seemed disappointed that he couldn't afford a larger role for his young outfielder. But the reality was McCarthy hadn't earned it. His \"offensive consistency,\" in Hazen's words, had not been sufficient.\n\n\"That has to come,\" Hazen said at the time. \"And then you solidify the role somewhere on the team. Forces me to sit tight from an off-season acquisition standpoint. In the absence of that, I can't do that.\"\n\nAfter a year in which McCarthy hit .243/.318/.326, lost his starting job and earned a pair of demotions to Triple-A, Hazen acted. He spent $11 million on Joc Pederson and Randal Grichuk -- a left-handed bat and a fourth outfielder. Together, they made McCarthy somewhat redundant. If Grichuk had been healthy on Opening Day, McCarthy's season likely would have begun in Triple-A.\n\nFast forward three months and the calculus has changed. For the first time all season, the Diamondbacks may have a healthy outfield on the horizon -- depending on the severity of Corbin Carroll's left side discomfort and the progression of Alek Thomas' rehab assignment.\n\nBut even if the unit does fill out, McCarthy will not be one of the candidates to be optioned to clear a roster spot. His play has been far too impactful. No matter how crowded the Diamondbacks' outfield gets, manager Torey Lovullo will continue to find him at-bats. And if Carroll's injury is significant, McCarthy will play a crucial role in masking the loss of the club's biggest star.\n\nThat's where McCarthy stands now. Through 62 games, he is hitting .279/.365/.409. It's reminiscent of his breakout 2022 season, when he seemed to establish himself as an important piece of the Diamondbacks' future. Only this time, it might be more replicable, hitting coach Joe Mather acknowledged.\n\nTo understand why, consider a pitch from last week that still lives in McCarthy's head.\n\nIn the second inning of the Diamondbacks' 8-3 loss to the Angels, McCarthy swung at a 3-1 sinker from Jos\u00e9 Soriano that tailed off the plate away. The result was something that McCarthy did far too often a year ago: He rolled the ball over meekly to second base. Four days later, he stood in the Diamondbacks' clubhouse, still frustrated by the ramifications.\n\n\"You work a walk early in the game, maybe that gets him out of his rhythm,\" McCarthy said. \"And maybe he doesn't go eight (innings).\"\n\nLast year, that out would have one poor at-bat in a lengthy string of them. This year, it's the exception.\n\nMcCarthy is not hitting balls any harder than he was a year ago. His rate of loud contact -- quantified as over 95 mph off the bat -- is the fifth-lowest in the league.\n\nBut his command of the strike zone has taken a massive step forward. In 2023, his poor contact was compounded by subpar decision-making. Even in 2022, that was largely true, only masked by some fortunate results on batted balls.\n\nNow, he's walking more than he ever has and striking out less. He's narrowed the strike zone so that when he does swing, it's a pitch he can hit for a line drive, not a lazy groundball.\n\n\"It sounds super simple and super repetitive but it's getting the right pitch to swing at,\" McCarthy said. \"Sometimes you want to look at your mechanics and it's like, well that was a pretty (difficult) pitch that I swung at.\"\n\nMcCarthy's approach is bearing out in the numbers. In 2022 and 2023, he swung at 54.4% of pitches on the edge of the strike zone with less than two strikes. Those might be balls or they might be strikes, but either way, a swing favors the pitcher. Now, he's swinging at just 45.5% of those pitches.\n\nWhy is that important? On pitches in those areas and in those counts, McCarthy is hitting .219. On pitches over the heart of the plate, he's hitting .369. By avoiding the former, he sees more of the latter.\n\nThat wasn't always a natural mindset for McCarthy. He pointed to a game last week against the Angels as an example. In the seventh inning, he went to the plate for his last at-bat carrying an 0-for-3 stat line.\n\n\"Maybe in years past, it's like, I'm 0-for-3, I really want to salvage my day, go 1-for-4,\" McCarthy said. \"You go 1-for-4 with a homer or a double, that's a pretty good day.\"\n\nBut instead of forcing that outcome, he took what was available to him and drew a full-count walk.\n\n\"At the end of the day, sure, no one wants to go 0-fer,\" McCarthy said. \"But I didn't get myself out in that last at-bat because of the three previous at-bats.\"\n\nTime and time again this year, that mentality has paid dividends. McCarthy has not gone consecutive starts without reaching base since mid-April. His offensive consistency is at an all-time high. And the Diamondbacks, as they did two years ago, are winning games because of him.\n\n\"He's put himself,\" Lovullo said, \"firmly in the middle of everything we're trying to do on a nightly basis.\"\n\nTuesday's Diamondbacks-Nationals pitching matchup\n\nDiamondbacks at Nationals, 3:45 p.m., Cox, Ch. 34\n\nDiamondbacks RHP Slade Cecconi (1-5, 6.70) vs. Nationals RHP Jake Irvin (5-5, 3.00).\n\nAt Nationals Park: Cecconi was hammered by the Angels in his most recent start, permitting seven runs in three-plus innings. He gave up single runs in each of the first three innings then all four batters he faced in the fourth scored. ... Even when the results have been better, the Diamondbacks have not been allowing Cecconi to pitch deep into games. He went only 4 2/3 innings on June 1, then 4 1/3 innings on June 6, pitching competitively both times. ... Cecconi has never faced the Nationals. ... Irvin has logged at least six innings in five consecutive starts, posting a 1.48 ERA in that span. Most recently, he fired six innings of one-run ball against the Tigers. ... He faced the Diamondbacks twice last year, giving up four runs (three earned) in four innings in the first outing, then holding them to two runs (one earned) in six innings a couple of weeks later. ... Irvin averages 93-94 mph with his fastballs while also mixing in curveballs and cutters.\n\nComing up\n\nWednesday: At Washington, 1:05 p.m., Diamondbacks RHP Brandon Pfaadt (3-5, 4.38) vs. Nationals LHP Patrick Corbin (1-7, 5.84).\n\nThursday: At Washington, 10:05 a.m., Diamondbacks RHP Ryne Nelson (4-5, 5.49) vs. Nationals LHP MacKenzie Gore (6-5, 3.24).\n\nFriday: At Philadelphia, 3:40 p.m., Diamondbacks TBA vs. Phillies RHP Taijuan Walker (3-2, 5.33).\n\nWhat to know about the Washington Nationals\n\nThe Nationals made little in the way of significant acquisitions over the offseason, but they find themselves playing competitive baseball and squarely in the middle of the playoff hunt in a mediocre National League. After sweeping the Marlins over the weekend, the Nationals have won eight of nine games. The Nationals have the third-worst OPS (.668) in the NL, but their pitching staff has been solid, ranking fifth with a 3.84 ERA. SS C.J. Abrams has been their most productive hitter with a .258/.310/.477 line and a team-leading 11 homers. OF Jesse Winker also is off to a solid start, hitting .265 with six homers and 31 RBIs. The Diamondbacks will face two of the Nationals' better starters this week in RHP Jake Irvin and LHP MacKenzie Gore. Irvin is a late-blooming former fourth-round pick in 2018 while Gore was one of the players acquired in the OF Juan Soto trade. RHP Kyle Finnegan ranks second in the league with 20 saves (in 22 opportunities) and a 1.78 ERA.", "source": {"uri": "azcentral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AZ Central"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Our MLB odds series has our Diamondbacks-Nationals prediction, odds, and pick for Wednesday.\n\nThe Diamondbacks make the trip to Washington D.C. to face the Nationals! These two teams are playing very similarly and are fighting for a wildcard spot. Both are playing better recently, even with the Diamondbacks being ravaged by injuries. Our MLB odds series has our Diamondbacks-Nationals prediction, odds, and pick for Wednesday.\n\nLast Start: Pitched six innings and gave up one run on six hits with three walks and eight strikeouts in a Diamondbacks win.\n\nLast Start: Pitched 5.1 innings and gave up one run on four hits with two walks and four strikeouts in a Nationals loss.\n\nThe Diamondbacks have been inconsistent this season and are ravaged by injuries on their way to a 35-37 record. They have won three out of their last four games. The Diamondbacks have had a strong season behind the plate and are in the top 10. Their pitching has struggled and is one of the worst in the league due to injuries. Lourdes Gurriel Jr., Ketel Marte, Joc Pederson, Corbin Carroll, Eugenio Suarez, and Christian Walker have been great on offense. Zac Gallen, Brandon Pfaadt, and Merrill Kelly, despite both Gallen and Kelly being injured. The Diamondbacks have been decimated by injuries and need to get healthy, especially on the mound.\n\nThe Diamondbacks are starting Brandon Pfaadt on the mound where he has a 3-5 record, a 4.38 ERA, and a 1.16 WHIP. Through 84.1 innings, Pfaadt has allowed 45 runs on 80 hits with 18 walks and 84 strikeouts. The Diamondbacks are 6-8 in the 14 games he has started in this season. Pfaadt has been asked to carry the team on the mound with Gallen and Kelly injured and he has been decent overall this season. The Nationals also have not played well behind the plate this season.\n\nThe offense for the Diamondbacks has been great this season. The Diamondbacks are eighth in the MLB in team batting average at .251 after having a .250 one season ago. Ketel Marte and Christian Walker lead the team in almost every important batting category. Also, at least 13 Diamondbacks have hit one home run up to this point in the season. Marte leads the team in batting average at .283, in OBP at .348, and in total hits at 78. Walker then leads in home runs at 16 and RBI at 42. This offense has been great, and they get a favorable matchup against Corbin for the Nationals.\n\nWhy The Nationals Will Cover The Spread/Win\n\nThe Nationals have been one of the most inconsistent teams in the MLB. They sit with a 35-36 record but have won eight of their last nine games and three straight heading into this matchup. Their pitching has been great and is just outside the top 10, while they have struggled behind the plate on offense. Jesse Winker, CJ Abrams, Joey Meneses, and Luis Garcia Jr. have stood out for an offense that has struggled this season in the capital. Trevor Williams, MacKenzie Gore, and Jake Irvin have all been solid up to this point on the mound and have been the best players pitching-wise. The Nationals have talent and they might be putting it together finally.\n\nThe Nationals are starting Patrick Corbin on the mound in this game and he has a 1-7 record, a 5.84 ERA, and a 1.62 WHIP. Through 77 innings, Corbin has allowed 54 runs on 96 hits with 29 walks and 48 strikeouts. The Nationals are 4-10 in the 14 games that he's started in this season. Corbin has struggled this season and it does not get any easier against the offense for his old team.\n\nThe offense for the Nationals has struggled this season. They are 20th in the MLB in team batting average at .235 after having a team batting average of .254 one season ago. Luis Garcia Jr., CJ Abrams, Joey Meneses, and Jesse Winker stand out and lead the way in most of the batting categories. Abrams leads the way in home runs at 11 and in total hits at 68. Garcia Jr. leads in batting average at .269, Meneses leads in RBI at 36, and Winker leads in OBP at .378. The Nationals have struggled behind the plate and get a difficult matchup against Brandon Pfaadt on the mound.\n\nFinal Diamondbacks-Nationals Prediction & Pick\n\nAs inconsistent as these teams have been this year, both are playing well recently. The key is pitching and Pfaadt has the advantage on the mound compared to Corbin for the Nationals. The Diamondbacks have a much better offense behind the plate as well. This game should be close at first, but the Diamondbacks are better thanks to Pfaadt, and should win and cover on the road against the Nationals.\n\nClick here for more betting news and predictions", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jake_faigus@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Jake Faigus", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Nationals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington Nationals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Diamondbacks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Diamondbacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Corbin", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Corbin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Pfaadt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Pfaadt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joc_Pederson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joc Pederson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lourdes_Gurriel_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lourdes Gurriel Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketel_Marte", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ketel Marte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zac_Gallen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zac Gallen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrill_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Merrill Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenio_Su\u00e1rez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Eugenio Su\u00e1rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "On-base percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Walks plus hits per inning pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJ_Abrams", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CJ Abrams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Garc\u00eda_(pitcher,_born_1996)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luis Garc\u00eda (pitcher, born 1996)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joey_Meneses", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joey Meneses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacKenzie_Gore", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MacKenzie Gore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trevor_Williams_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trevor Williams (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Winker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jesse Winker"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CAF", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CAF", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Non-FIFA_Nations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Non-FIFA Nations", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Diamondbacks-vs.-Nationals-prediction-odds-pick.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660777", "eventUri": "eng-9660777", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

He will opposed by left-hander Patrick Corbin (1-7, 5.84).\n\nPfaadt, 25, is coming off one of his best starts of the season. On Thursday, he allowed one run on six hits over six innings to defeat the Los Angeles Angels. He walked three and struck out eight to bounce back from a loss against the San Diego Padres in which he gave up three home runs.\n\nPfaadt has never faced the Nationals.\n\nCorbin, 34, has plenty of experience for, and limited experience against, the Diamondbacks. He spent his first six major league seasons with Arizona, posting a 56-54 record with a 3.91 ERA and finishing fifth in National League Cy Young Award voting in 2018.\n\nHe joined the Nationals as a free agent the next winter and was a key member of the 2019 World Series winners, both in the regular season and postseason. Since then, it has been one long slog. Corbin is 28-64 with a 5.65 ERA over the past five seasons.\n\nCorbin, pitching on extra rest, turned in one of his better efforts of the season in his most recent start, limiting the Tigers to one run on four hits over 5 1/3 innings during a no-decision on Thursday. Detroit wound up winning 7-2.\n\n\"He was really good,\" Nationals manager Dave Martinez said after the game. \"We've got to score some runs for him. He's kept us in the ballgame, we're just not scoring runs for him, but I thought he threw the ball well.\"\n\nCorbin is 0-3 with a 10.80 ERA in four career starts against Arizona.\n\nKetel Marte hit a two-run homer and drove in three runs while Slade Cecconi tossed six shutout innings to lead Arizona on Tuesday.\n\nJoc Pederson had three hits, giving him a .375 average (12-for-32) with two doubles, two homers, 12 RBIs and four walks over the past 10 games.\n\nArizona's Corbin Carroll, who left the Sunday game against the Chicago White Sox when he felt discomfort in his left side after a throw, got a clean MRI exam on Monday. He joined the team in Washington and finished 2-for-3 with two walks, two runs and an RBI on Tuesday.\n\n\"He said he was OK, and he proved it,\" Lovullo said.\n\nCarroll has now reached base in 18 consecutive games (with a plate appearance) and is batting .314 (22-for-70) with five doubles, two triples, six RBIs and 12 walks in that span.\n\nThree Arizona pitchers held the Nationals to four hits on Tuesday, two each by CJ Abrams and Jesse Winker.

Mandatory Credit: Rick Scuteri-USA TODAY Sports / Rick Scuteri-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Arizona Diamondbacks will play the Washington Nationals in a day game at Nationals Park Thursday. First pitch is 1:05 EST, 10:05 MST. The teams have split the first two games of the three games series with the D-backs taking the first 5-0, and the Nationals winning on Wednesday 3-1.\n\nThe Diamondbacks are 11-6 in June, and 36-38 on the season. They are tied with three teams, 0.5 games in back of the Nationals and Cardinals in the tightly packed NL Wild Card race.\n\nDespite splitting the two games, the Diamondbacks can't help but be happy to have seen two more quality starts from young pitchers. Slade Cecconi was brilliant in his six shutout innings on Tuesday. Brandon Pfaadt went 6.1 innings allowing three runs on Wednesday, taking the loss despite his team leading 8th quality start.\n\nIn their last six games Diamondbacks starting pitchers have combined to post a 1.71 ERA in 31.2 innings pitched. Zac Gallen could possibly return from a hamstring injury over the next week.\n\nMerrill Kelly and Eduardo Rodriguez are not going to return until after the All Star break, if at all however. So continued development from their young starters is critical to their playoff chances.\n\nRyne Nelson, (4-5, 5.49 ERA) will try to keep the positive momentum going in the rotation. His most recent outing against the White Sox on June 14th was his best of the year. He threw six innings, giving up just one run on six hits and one walk while striking out a career high eight batters.\n\nNelson has faced the Nationals one time prior in his career, May 7th of last year. He was solid in a no-decision, going five innings, giving up three runs, but just two earned. He left with a 7-3 lead but the bullpen couldn't hold it, as the D-backs lost 9-8.\n\nMacKenzie Gore, (6-5, 3.24 ERA) is having a breakout season for the Nationals. The 25 year old left-hander was fantastic in his most recent outing against the Marlins, going seven innings and giving up just one run while striking out 10. He beat the Braves on June 8th with five solid innings, allowing one run and striking out seven.\n\nGore throws a high 90's four seamer, a curve ball, a slider and a change up. The Curve and Slider have been very difficult to hit this year. He throws the change up exclusively to right-hand batters, and gets a lot of swing and miss with the pitch, but it's also been hit hard at times.\n\nGore pitched well in his only start against Arizona May 6th, 2023. He went six innings, allowing two runs on eight hits and struck out nine. The D-backs came back to win that game 8-7 after allowing five runs in the top of the ninth to blow a 6-2 lead. Pavin Smith drew a walk with the bases loaded for the winning run.\n\nCorbin Carroll gets a day off against the tough left-hander and Jake McCarthy will man centerfield. MVP candidate Ketel Marte will be the DH today, providing his legs and back a bit of a breather. Blaze Alexander will man second base.\n\nGeraldo Perdomo takes a seat as well, giving way to Kevin Newman at shortstop. Newman has a career .282 batting average with a .736 OPS vs. left-hand pitching. Randal Grichuk is two for four against Gore with a homer, but both hits came back in 2022 during Gore's rookie year.\n\nJesse Winker has three hits in the series for the Nationals, including the big go-ahead two-run homer against Pfaadt in in the 6th inning of Wednesday's game. The left-hand hitting Winker is a tough out, especially against right-hand pitching. He has a .280/.397/.439 slash line, good for a 141 wRC+ against righties. Containing him is a key to the game for Nelson and the D-backs.\n\nThe Diamondbacks only had to use Joe Mantiply and Kevin Ginkel yesterday and they threw just 13 and 14 pitches respectively. Paul Sewald and Ryan Thompson haven't worked since Sunday and Justin Martinez only threw seven pitches on Tuesday. Long relievers Scott McGough and Thyago Vieira haven't worked since Saturday.\n\nThe Nationals have one of the better bullpens in the league, but had to use three relievers yesterday, including closer Kyle Finnegan. Finnegan is second in the majors with 21 saves and has a 1.72 ERA. If he has any weakness, it's when he works on back to back days. With zero days rest he has a 6.35 ERA and has allowed three of his five homers this year.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

The defending NL champion Diamondbacks have not been this close to .500 since they were 12-13 on April 23.\n\nCJ Abrams extended his hitting streak to 11 games for Washington, which was limited to four hits and had its three-game winning streak snapped.\n\nThe Diamondbacks quickly went ahead against Jake Irvin (5-6) when Carroll led off the game with a walk and promptly stole second. Marte then drove a 2-2 curveball to right-center for his 15th home run.\n\nArizona tacked on two more in the fifth inning when Geraldo Perdomo doubled and scored on Carroll's triple to left-center. Carroll came around on Marte's sacrifice fly.\n\nCarroll also walked in the third and singled in the ninth. Last season's NL Rookie of the Year exited Sunday's game against the Chicago White Sox in the seventh inning after making an awkward throw from the outfield.\n\nIrvin was in trouble throughout his outing, allowing the leadoff batter to reach base in all five innings.

As reported by Nick Piecoro of the Arizona Republic, Corbin Carroll's MRI on his sore left rib cage showed no significant injury.\n\nThe outfielder worked out at Salt River Fields and was cleared to get on a plane and rejoin the team. He could possibly be in the lineup Tuesday night.\n\nThat should help the D-backs stay hot. They're coming off their 5th consecutive series without a series loss. They did exactly what they had to, going 4-2 over an important stretch against struggling clubs in the Angels and White Sox and have set themselves up masterfully to reclaim their position in the middle of the playoff race. Next stop? A trip to Americas capitol.\n\nThe Washinton Nationals have been a struggling franchise since their World Series victory in 2019. That franchise core has since split ways, but the team they left behind has never been quite the same.\n\n2024 may be a different story for the young Nationals however. Fans in the capitol city finally have some form of hope. An up and coming core centered around C.J. Abrams, and a pitching staff with some potential has them in the thick of Pennant race. The Nationals find themselves half a game ahead of the Diamondbacks at a 35-36 record, sitting tied for a Wild Card spot with the San Diego Padres.\n\nThe Diamondbacks season may have gotten off to a rocky start but things have looked much better for Arizona as of late. The D-Backs have played to a 10-5 record since the beginning of June even while battling some of the leagues worst injuries.\n\nZac Gallen, Merrill Kelly, and Eduardo Rodriguez are still on the injured list and will remain there for this series against the Nationals. The top of the rotation mates each have a different time table, with Zac Gallen being a good deal ahead of the other two. Eduardo Rodriguez is continuing his throwing program with things moving in a positive direction for the veteran lefty. Merrill Kelly's situation though is more dire.\n\nManager Torey Lovullo confirmed to the press during the last series that Kelly would likely not return until after the All Star break. The exact extent of this delay is still not clear, but his injury was expected to put him on the shelf for an extended period of time when he first went down. The loss of Kelly has been a big one for the D-Backs, as he was their best pitcher in the early goings of the year, and was a consistent force at the top of the rotation.\n\nAlek Thomas is on the brink of returning. This is not the first time we have felt this close to the young center fielders return but it is certainly the best we have felt about it. He has been working his way back to the field since the second series of the year but has faced multiple setbacks. He is taking part in a rehab assignment with AAA Reno and the team is hopeful that his return will come when the Diamondbacks return home from this road trip.\n\nSlade Cecconi RHP, 1-5, 6.70 ERA, 5.99 FIP in 44.1 IP. Cecconi is on a relatively poor stretch of starts. He failed to go more than 3 against the Angels while allowing 7 ER. His inability to face lineups more than once has almost flipped as opponents are jumping on him early.\n\nJake Irvin RHP, 5-5, 3.00 ERA, 3.24 FIP in 81 IP. Irvin has been dominant. Not just dominant, but also consistent. He is on a stretch of 5 straight starts while going 6+ IP and allowing 2 or less runs. He is giving his team a win every turn around the rotation and giving them length while doing it.\n\nBrandon Pfaadt RHP, 3-5, 4.38 ERA, 3.41 FIP in 84.1 IP. Pfaadt had a big rebound start against the Angels his last time out, going 6 innings of 1 run ball. He was previously coming off 3 mediocre starts. Pfaadt is a key member of the rotation, and likely will be a deciding factor in this series of young starters.\n\nPatrick Corbin LHP, 1-7, 5.84 ERA, 5.14 FIP in 77 IP. Corbin is once again not having the best of years. He has fallen a long way since his first season with the Nationals in 2019. Corbin was a two-time All Star for the Diamondbacks in 2013 and 2018. In four previous starts against his former team he's 0-3 with a 10.80 ERA. His last time out was solid against the Tigers, allowing only 1 in 5.1 innings.\n\nRyne Nelson RHP, 4-5, 5.49 ERA, 4.30 FIP in 57.1 IP. Nelson was fantastic in his last start. He struck out a career high 8 batters in 6 innings while only allowing 1 run. He will look to make a trend out of his new found swing and miss against the Nats.\n\nMacKenzie Gore LHP, 6-5, 3.24 ERA, 2.93 FIP in 75 IP. Gore has been exceptional this season aside from two hiccups against the Mets and Blue Jays. He is coming off a great start against the Marlins, going 7 innings and allowing just one run.\n\nThe Diamondbacks have been hitting well as a collective recently. As a team they have hit .300 over their last 6 games, with only two players having an OPS under .800.\n\nRandal Grichuk was given more opportunities against righties in the last week and managed to deliver. He has hit .333 with a 1.345 OPS in 14 at bats. With Alek Thomas' return looming it will likely mean that there will be less at bats available to outfielders, including Grichuk, however he is making a strong case to earn more regardless of handedness.\n\nJoc Pederson has been once again crushing the ball. His 1.131 OPS in the last 6 games ranks 3rd on the team, and highest among players to play in all 6. He belted 2 home runs with 10 RBI good for the most runs batted in of any Dbacks hitter in that span.\n\nChritian Walker may be the definition of hot right now. His 4 home runs over the last 6 games rank first on the team, at one point hitting 3 in 4 at bats. He is once again driving the ball with authority and brinigng in runs consistently. His 1.000 OPS is 4th on the Diamondbacks in the last 6 games.\n\nBlaze Alexander has not been given many opportunities in the last week with Eugenio Suarez batting well and Geraldo Perdomo returning from the injured list. In the 3 games he got into he batted only .111 with a .311 OPS, worst on the team.\n\nThe Nationals are a far more top heavy offensive team than the Diamondbacks. They have a team OPS of .765 and have 3 hitters with an OPS over 1.000. They also however have 4 players with a sub .350 OPS.\n\nCJ Abrams is a star. 2024 seems like his big breakout parade as hes hit 11 home runs with a .258 batting average so far. Over the last 6 games he fittingly slots in right at the top of the Nationals offense, boasting a 1.221 OPS with a home run and 5 RBI.\n\nLane Thomas is one of the Nationals' top Trade Deadline chips, and hes playing like someone who teams will want to trade for. His 1.203 OPS is only slightly behind Abrams' but his 3 Home Runs and 7 RBI lead the team over the last week.\n\nTrey Lipscomb has had a rough week. In 3 games played he is batting .143 with a .286 OPS. He got only 1 hit in that span.\n\nDrew Millas, Nick Senzel, and Eddie Rosario are in a similar boat. They have all struggled to similar degrees over the past week and combined make up the bottom half of the Nationals offensive standings .They each have a .333 individular OPS with a combined 0 RBI, 0 Home Runs, and 5 hits.\n\nThe Diamondbacks will have a tough time in this series, sending out 3 young pitchers once again, but need to take advantage of an opportunity to jump the Nationals in the Wild Card standings. This series could have large implictions later in the season.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

There are some splits that end up happening every year. Some of the splits don't last season to season, and some pitchers have no split differentials whatsoever. Finding out the different splits isn't always apparent, but now that we are almost halfway through the season, we should have a clear indication of when you can trust, and when you cannot trust someone. Tonight we see a pitcher with a clear split difference and I'm going to put a play on the game between the Diamondbacks and Nationals.\n\nAt the end of the first half of the 2023 season, the Diamondbacks were in first place within their division. This season they are sitting with a 35-37 record and are struggling at both home and on the road. If you want a reason to be a bit more optimistic, Arizona now has a bit of a golden opportunity because of the injury to Dodgers stud Mookie Betts. The bad news is that the Giants and Padres have that same opportunity presented to themselves. Both of those teams also have struggles that they will need to address and figure out, so there isn't a clear winner in this, but one of them needs to step up and make their move now. One opportunity for them would be getting tonight's starter, Slade Cecconi, on track and getting them meaningful innings. I mentioned splits being something you can rely on now, and those are evident with Cecconi. He isn't exactly a stud on the road, but he is significantly better on the road than at home. At home, he has allowed 19 earned runs in 13 innings (just three starts), but he has allowed 14 earned runs over 31 innings over five starts on the road. His day starts are also significantly better than his night outings, but all three home starts were night starts, so that's a bit more skewed than the reality is. He only has two quality starts for this season, and both came on the road. He's allowed three or fewer earned runs in five of his six road appearances. He has never faced the Nationals, but it seems like opposing hitters are not struggling to figure him out.\n\nThe Nationals came into the season with significantly fewer expectations than the Diamondbacks had, especially considering that the latter team made the World Series last year. This is somewhat of a reconstruction year for the Nationals, but they do look fairly competitive in most games. For the year, they are one of many teams that are hovering around .500. The question that looms is if they feel like it is worth it to go for the playoffs this season, or if they have a longer-term plan, and will sell off pieces in hopes of building the franchise for later. I have to imagine that tonight's starter will get a bit of attention on the trade market if he does become available. The starter, Jake Irvin, is off to a nice beginning in this campaign and has been a very reliable option for his team. For the year, Irvin was 5-5 with a 3.00 ERA and a 1.04 WHIP, both of those numbers are top 20 in the Majors right now. Irvin matches Cecconi in the fact that he is worse at home than on the road, but it isn't quite as drastic, a 3.86 ERA at home vs 2.55 on the road. He has pitched very well lately though with five consecutive quality starts and nine in his last 12. He has faced the Diamondbacks hitters 34 times and allowed seven hits. Just one of those hits have gone for extra bases, and they are hitting .206 overall against him.\n\nThis is a bit harder of a game to judge than just openly fading Cecconi because he is pitching in Arizona. However, I think we can trust Irvin significantly more than we can trust Cecconi. Irvin has shown a long period of success and is limiting the damage even when opponents start to attack him. The best option for this game is to take the Nationals through five innings at -112.\n\nFor more sports betting information and plays, follow David on X/Twitter: @futureprez2024", "source": {"uri": "outkick.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OutKick"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_troy@outkick.com", "name": "David Troy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Diamondbacks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Diamondbacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Nationals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington Nationals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mookie_Betts", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mookie Betts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_start", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quality start"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra-base_hit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Extra-base hit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Walks plus hits per inning pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_betting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sports betting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Periodicals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Periodicals", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Europe", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Oceania", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Oceania", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Asia", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Asia", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2024/06/Jake-Irvin-Washington-Nationals-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660777", "eventUri": "eng-9660777", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

Mandatory Credit: Denis Poroy-USA TODAY Sports at Petco Park. / Denis Poroy-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Arizona Diamondbacks have another critical game in Washington DC, taking on the Nationals at 1:05 PM Local AZ time. They had a near-perfect game yesterday when Slade Cecconi dominated on the mound and the offense scored five runs to beat the Nats 5-0.\n\nIt was a must-win game as is today due to the Wild Card standings and how close they are in standings to the D-backs. Thanks to their win yesterday, the Arizona Diamondbacks are now 36-37 and hold the third Wild Card spot in the NL.\n\nThe Nationals are 35-37 and are just 0.5 games behind the D-backs. Plus, tiebreakers will be critical later in the season should so many teams be bunched up together. If Arizona can get the tiebreaker over Washington, it will go a long way towards solidifying their position in the Wild Card.\n\nThe D-backs are 6-4 in their last 10 games. They will look to get the series victory today in a must-win situation.\n\nPfaadt is on the mound for Arizona. The young right-hander is coming off one of his best pitched games of the season from last Thursday against the Angels. He pitched six innings, gave up six hits, one run, three walks, and eight strikeouts.\n\nPfaadt has been a reliable innings eater this season for the Diamondbacks. Out of 14 starts, he has a Quality Start in seven of them. He's worked six or more innings 10 times.\n\nPfaadt has been racking up the strikeouts, leading the Diamondbacks in strikeouts and ranking near the top of baseball in them. He's limited the walks as well with just 18 of them, which has allowed him to keep his FIP low and limit baserunners.\n\nThe lone issue plaguing Pfaadt is the \"slippery inning\" that Manager Torey Lovullo likes to say. Pfaadt will have an inning a game where he struggles with his command and gives up hits or runs. If Pfaadt can avoid that today or limit the damage if it happens, he will put the D-backs in great shape to win the game and keep the bullpen rested.\n\nThe former Diamondbacks All-Star is facing his former club yet again since he left in free agency after the 2018 season. This season has continued Corbin's downward spiral since 2020, a year after signing with the Nationals.\n\nIt's his fourth year in a row with his ERA above 5.80. While he's pitching consistently and staying healthy, the results just have not been there. Corbin continues to allow far too much contact and walks without missing bats. He has just 48 strikeouts to 29 walks. In fact, he's given up 50 earned runs, meaning he's given up more runs than strikeouts.\n\nCorbin has allowed 96 hits in just 77 innings. This has sent his WHIP sky-high to 1.623. In his last four starts, he's pitched much better in three of the four. Over those 22.2 innings, Corbin has pitched to a 4.76 ERA, but a 5.93 FIP. He's given up 21 hits and eight walks, but struck out 16. However, he allowed two or fewer runs in two of those starts.\n\nIn his career against the Arizona Diamondbacks, Patrick Corbin is 0-3 with a 10.80 ERA over four games and 18.1 innings. He's given up 32 hits, 23 runs, five homers, nine walks, and just 17 strikeouts.\n\nThis is a regular lineup of the Washington Nationals. No one in their lineup has faced Brandon Pfaadt before.\n\nCorbin Carroll will look to stay hot at the plate and against Corbin. He's 2-3 against Patrick Corbin. Meanwhile, over his last 12 games, Carroll is hitting .340 and he's reached base safely in 18 straight games. He'll look to continue that streak today.\n\nSuarez has a homer and four RBI in 21 at-bats and is hitting .381 against Corbin. Christian Walker is 4-8 against Corbin.\n\nMeanwhile, future 2024 All-Star Ketel Marte has two homers and four RBI with a .556 batting average against Corbin over his nine at-bats. Make sure to vote Ketel Marte to the All-Star Game here.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Home plate umpire Chad Fairchild raised his arm to call strike three, and Cecconi let out a yell and a fist pump, triumphantly marching off the mound.\n\nIt was the ninth pitch of the at-bat and capped off six brilliant, scoreless innings for Cecconi. He left with a 5-0 lead and the bullpen kept it scoreless the rest of the way. Justin Martinez threw one inning and Bryce Jarvis threw two, completing the shutout over the Nationals.\n\nCecconi threw just 70 pitches, 52 for strikes. But with the game time temperature in the high 80s and the humidity making it feel like the mid-90s, Cecconi had done more than anyone could ask for. His final line was 6 IP, 3 H, 0 Runs, 6K.\n\nThe big right-hander was in total command. He did not have a three-ball count all game, nor did he even go 2-0 on any batter. He threw first-pitch strikes to 17 of 20 batters. Just as importantly, he maintained his stuff through the end of the game, as his velocity did not wane as it often has the second and third time through the order.\n\nIn his previous outing, Cecconi had perhaps the worst outing of his career, giving up seven runs on 10 hits in just three innings. Following that start, Torey Lovullo was asked if Cecconi was going to make his next start, the manager was noncommittal. \"I want him to, I want it to be Slade but we've got to have guys get the job done\"\n\nCecconi got the job done tonight and Lovullo acknowledged the hard work that was done during the week with the pitching coaches.\n\n\"He had four tough days, I know because the last outing against the Angels wasn't up to par, he knew that. I think he was challenged. I think the pitching coaches did a great job of addressing things.\"\n\nThe Diamondbacks had a scare with Corbin Carroll on Sunday, as he experienced some right-side soreness. The outfielder stayed behind to have an MRI but was cleared and caught up to the team late Monday night and was in the lineup today.\n\nThe speedy Carroll set the table in the first inning drawing a leadoff walk, and stole second base. Ketel Marte followed with a line-drive homer to right-center field, his 15th of the year for a quick 2-0 lead.\n\nSpeaking to Jody Jackson after the game, Marte said \"When Corbin gets on base, something good is going to happen........I'm glad he's back in the lineup again, we need him, and the good thing is he's starting to get hot\"\n\nNationals starter Jake Irvin kept allowing baserunners, but the D-backs kept hitting into inning-ending double plays in each of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th innings.\n\nThe fifth inning started with a Geraldo Perdomo bloop double. Carroll then lined a ball through the gap that went all the way to the wall for an RBI triple. He came home to score on a sacrifice fly from Marte. That inning would end with a double play too, but it didn't matter. Arizona tacked on another run in the\n\nCarroll, who extended his on-base streak to 18 games, also had a single, finishing his day 2-for-3 with two walks, two runs scored, and an RBI. His batting average continues to climb, as he's now up to .218 B.A. and .631 OPS.\n\nThe D-backs record is now 36-37 as they move past the 35-37 Nationals by half a game in the standings. Game two of the series is tomorrow afternoon is 1:05 P.M. Arizona time.

They are going for their third consecutive series win, which would be their first time pulling off that feat this season.\n\nThe Diamondbacks scored their first three runs in the fourth inning. Jake McCarthy, Kevin Newman and Tucker Barnhart all singled before Randal Grichuk delivered the big blow with a two-run double down the left field line.\n\nMcCarthy, who is 3 for 3 with two steals, also instigated the Diamondbacks' two-out rally in the fifth. He singled and stole second, then came around on a bloop hit from Newman.\n\nRyne Nelson has allowed one run in four fairly clean innings. That lone run came on a Lane Thomas homer with two outs in the third.\n\nAlek Thomas set to resume rehab progression\n\nWASHINGTON -- Earlier this week, the Diamondbacks said they did not know the next steps for centerfielder Alek Thomas, who experienced soreness after rehab games in the Arizona Complex League. But after that brief scare, Thomas will resume his rehab in the complex league with games on both Friday and Saturday.\n\nIf all goes well there, it appears likely that Thomas -- who has missed nearly the entire season with a hamstring strain -- could head to Triple-A Reno on a rehab assignment next week.\n\n\"He's in a pretty good spot,\" manager Torey Lovullo said. \"Everything shook down the right way and he seems to be in a very positive space. You hear the word fatigue and it sends a signal. You just want to be cautious with everything that he's been through.\"\n\nZac Gallen nearing potential return to Diamondbacks\n\nWASHINGTON -- All went well for Zac Gallen in a three-inning sim game earlier this week as he works his way back from a minor hamstring strain. He is set to pitch in another sim game early next week, potentially as soon as Monday. That game will be four innings and around 60 to 65 pitches.\n\nLovullo's comments Thursday made it sound as if Gallen will not need a full rehab assignment after his next sim game. That could put his return to the Diamondbacks as early as next weekend's home series against the Athletics or the road series against the Dodgers immediately after that.\n\n\"Once you get up to 65 (pitches), if you can trigger the next one to be around 80 (pitches), that wouldn't be a bad spot for him here back with us,\" Lovullo said. \"But we've gotta get him through that next one.\"\n\nThe Diamondbacks rotation is in desperate need of reinforcements. With both Eduardo Rodriguez and Merrill Kelly likely sidelined through the All-Star break, the Diamondbacks are without their three best starters.\n\nFriday's Diamondbacks-Phillies pitching matchup\n\nDiamondbacks at Phillies, 3:40 p.m., Apple TV+\n\nDiamondbacks LHP Jordan Montgomery (5-4, 6.00) vs. Phillies RHP Taijuan Walker (3-2, 5.33).\n\nAt Citizens Bank Park: After back-to-back disastrous starts against the Mets and Giants, Montgomery pitched well in the Diamondbacks' latest homestand. In starts against the Angels and White Sox, he combined for 10 2/3 innings, 10 strikeouts and three earned runs allowed. ... Montgomery had both his changeup and curveball working better than he has all season against the White Sox, paving the way to seven strikeouts, tied for a season-high. ... Walker is in the second year of a four-year, $72 million deal with the Phillies. ... He posted middling results last season, with a 4.38 ERA and has taken another step back this year. He is currently the weak link in a dominant Philadelphia rotation. ... Walker has only made it through the sixth inning once in his last five starts. ... His sweeper has been by far his best pitch this season.\n\nComing up\n\nSaturday: At Philadelphia, 1:05 p.m., Diamondbacks LHP Tommy Henry (2-2, 6.23) vs. Phillies RHP Zack Wheeler (8-4, 2.84).\n\nSunday: At Philadelphia, 8:35 a.m., Diamondbacks RHP Slade Cecconi (2-5, 5.90) vs. Phillies LHP Christopher Sanchez (4-3, 2.91).\n\nMonday: Off day.\n\nTuesday: At Chase Field, 6:40 p.m., Diamondbacks RHP Brandon Pfaadt (3-6, 4.37) vs. Twins RHP Joe Ryan (5-5, 3.13).\n\nWhat to know about the Philadelphia Phillies\n\nThe Phillies have cooled off a little bit in recent weeks, going 4-6 over their last 10. Still, they have been the best team in the National League at 49-25. They rank fourth in runs scored, sixth in home runs and fourth in OPS. Their rotation has the sport's third-best ERA at 2.97 and their bullpen is eighth at 3.47. In other words, this is a team with no notable weaknesses. 1B Bryce Harper is having another dominant season with a .931 OPS. 3B Alek Bohm, DH Kyle Schwarber and SS Trea Turner have all produced at a high level as well, though Turner has only played two games since returning from a six-week stint on the injured list. LHP Ranger Suarez (1.75 ERA) has been perhaps the best starting pitcher in baseball, although the Diamondbacks will miss him. They will also miss RHP Aaron Nola, who is having another strong year after re-signing with Philadelphia on a long-term deal this winter. That said, they'll have to face Zack Wheeler and Christopher Sanchez, both of whom have been among the better starters in the National League this year.", "source": {"uri": "azcentral.com",

The Nationals are 36-38.\n\nNelson (5-5) needed only 70 pitches to breeze through seven innings of three-hit ball, and he allowed two runs without walking a batter. The right-hander struck out two and retired 13 of his last 14 batters to win consecutive starts for the first time this season.\n\nNelson is 3-2 with a 3.60 ERA in his last six outings. He's dropped his ERA from 7.06 to 5.18 in that span.\n\nRyan Thompson worked the eighth, and Paul Sewald handled the ninth for his eighth save. Sewald has pitched 11 2/3 scoreless innings in 13 outings since May 9.\n\nDown 1-0 entering the fourth, Arizona sandwiched a pair of singles around a sacrifice bunt before Tucker Barnhart's single tied it. Two batters later, Grichuk doubled into the left field corner off MacKenzie Gore to drive in two more runs.\n\nKevin Newman added a two-out RBI single in the fifth off Gore (6-6), who had won four of his previous five starts. The left-hander allowed four runs and a season-high 10 hits in five innings. He struck out seven.\n\nThomas ripped Nelson's 93 mph fastball into the visitor's bullpen in left-center in the third, and Winker smashed a changeup to deep center with two outs in the sixth.

He's dropped his ERA from 7.06 to 5.18 in that span.\n\nRyan Thompson worked the eighth, and Paul Sewald handled the ninth for his eighth save. Sewald has pitched 11 2/3 scoreless innings in 13 outings since May 9.\n\nDown 1-0 entering the fourth, Arizona sandwiched a pair of singles around a sacrifice bunt before Tucker Barnhart's single tied it. Two batters later, Grichuk doubled into the left field corner off MacKenzie Gore to drive in two more runs.\n\nKevin Newman added a two-out RBI single in the fifth off Gore (6-6), who had won four of his previous five starts. The left-hander allowed four runs and a season-high 10 hits in five innings. He struck out seven.\n\nThomas ripped Nelson's 93 mph fastball into the visitor's bullpen in left-center in the third, and Winker smashed a changeup to deep center with two outs in the sixth.

It was predictable, given that Patrick Corbin throws this pitch nearly a third of the time. It was hittable, with a batting average of .306 against his slider this year.\n\nBut Marte -- a likely All-Star and potential MVP candidate -- could only wave over the pitch. On his way out of the batters' box, he reared his bat back and slammed it into the infield dirt. His teammates didn't finish their at-bats with much less frustration. Two batters after Marte returned to the dugout, Corbin finished his day by walking off the mound in a rare state: unscathed.\n\nOver the past four years, Corbin has a 5.73 ERA. This year has been even worse. But in Wednesday's 3-1 loss to the Nationals, the Diamondbacks had limited answers, enabling Corbin to work five innings, allow one run and strike out seven. It was just his third start since 2022 that has hit each of those marks.\n\nAnd it left the Diamondbacks feeling as if an opportunity had evaded them. At the beginning of the afternoon, Wednesday was filled with tantalizing possibility. They had a chance to hit the .500 mark for the first time in two months. They were facing Corbin. They were pitching their most consistent healthy starter, Brandon Pfaadt.\n\nAt the end of the afternoon, it was one of the Diamondbacks' most confounding losses of the season.\n\nPfaadt contributed with an unusual day of his own. He pitched effectively for five innings before allowing three runs over his final 1 1/3 frames. But for the second time this year, he failed to strike out a batter. This time, he did not even garner a single swing and miss. His 77 pitches were the most without a whiff by a Diamondbacks pitcher in the Statcast era, which dates back to 2015.\n\n\"From the beginning, slider wasn't really there,\" Pfaadt said. \"That's definitely pitch that I need. That's my best pitch.\"\n\nThe Diamondbacks, though, would like to win games in which they allow three runs while facing hittable starting pitching.\n\n\"This was a day about our offense for me,\" Lovullo said. \"Our offense had a lot of opportunities.\"\n\nIn recent days, Lovullo has had plenty of chances to praise his offense. After struggling for large swaths of the season, they entered Wednesday averaging six runs per game in May. Lovullo's explanations for the turnaround have largely centered on the Diamondbacks' approach.\n\n\"We've gotten really stubborn to the pitch that we're looking to do damage on,\" Lovullo said last week.\n\nOn Wednesday, that approach went missing. The Diamondbacks chased 29 pitches out of the strike zone, their third-highest tally this season. Those undisciplined at-bats enabled Corbin to go out of the zone on a season-high 62% of his offerings.\n\nAgainst him, that's a fatal flaw. Opposing hitters are batting just .192 on Corbin's pitches outside of the strike zone this year. In the strike zone, they're batting .353.\n\n\"I would like to see patience,\" Lovullo said. \"And back the ball up a little bit so you can determine what are balls and strikes in the most crucial situation.\"\n\nThe Diamondbacks' inability to do that reared its head in a few key moments.\n\nIn the second inning, they got a one-out walk only to make consecutive outs on pitches outside the strike zone.\n\nIn the fourth inning, they loaded the bases with one out for Blaze Alexander, who chased an 0-1 slider below the zone then struck out on a cutter. The next batter, Geraldo Perdomo, popped out on a center-cut slider.\n\nIn the eighth inning, Corbin Carroll reached third with one out only for Lourdes Gurriel Jr. to swing over a curveball down. Christian Walker then ended the threat with a groundout to third.\n\nAfterward, Alexander -- whose fourth-inning strikeout proved to be the biggest missed opportunity -- credited Corbin. \"He had me moving forward, back, forward, back,\" Alexander said.\n\nThe Diamondbacks' issues, though, extended past Corbin and deep into the Nationals' bullpen.\n\n\"This one has me shaking my head a little bit,\" Lovullo said. \"I'm here talking about it with a couple of coaches, thinking what happened? How did we not win this game?\"\n\nDiamondbacks put Alek Thomas' rehab on pause\n\nWASHINGTON -- The Arizona Diamondbacks are once again backing off centerfielder Alek Thomas' progression in his recovery from a hamstring injury, Torey Lovullo said Wednesday. How long this latest pause lasts remains uncertain.\n\nThomas played in an Arizona Complex League game on Monday, after which point the Diamondbacks were aiming to send him on a rehab assignment to Triple-A Reno. Thomas, though, has experienced \"general soreness\" over the past two days, Lovullo said.\n\nLovullo offered mixed messaging in his press conference before Wednesday's game against the Nationals. He said that Thomas could undergo further imaging on his hamstring in the coming days, but also that he remains \"very\" optimistic that Thomas will get back into a rehab game within the next week.\n\n\"We want to be as cautious as possible to make sure that everything is resolved before we continue pushing forward,\" Lovullo said. \"It was resolved but he's been active and we want to make sure that it's still in a good spot.\"\n\nThomas initially suffered his hamstring injury on March 31. He returned for three rehab games in Reno in early May, but re-injured the hamstring and was sidelined for over a month before appearing in a complex league game on Thursday. He played in three games there last week -- going 5 for 7 with a double and a homer -- before experiencing this latest round of discomfort.\n\nEduardo Rodriguez nearing next steps in rehab\n\nWASHINGTON -- Left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez -- another injured Diamondback who has dealt with a frustrating series of setbacks -- is progressing in his rehab.\n\nRodriguez, who has not yet pitched this season, underwent a recent MRI that showed \"almost 100% healing\" in his left lat, Torey Lovullo said.\n\nRodriguez is throwing from out to 105 feet. Lovullo said that he will \"probably\" get on a mound for a bullpen session within the next week. Rodriguez initially suffered his injury in spring training before experiencing a major setback during a bullpen session in mid-April. That was the last time he stepped on a mound.\n\nLovullo said that the two-week window between the All-Star break and the end of July is \"a really realistic spot\" for both Rodriguez's and right-hander Merrill Kelly's returns to the Diamondbacks.\n\nThursday's Diamondbacks-Nationals pitching matchup\n\nDiamondbacks at Nationals, 10:05 p.m., Cox, Ch. 34\n\nDiamondbacks RHP Ryne Nelson (4-5, 5.49) vs. Nationals LHP MacKenzie Gore (6-5, 3.24).\n\nAt Nationals Park: This season has been yet another inconsistent one for Nelson, who has struggled to piece together a prolonged stretch of positive results since the start of 2023. ... Last start was one of Nelson's best. He allowed one run in eight innings against the White Sox and struck out a career-high eight batters. Nelson has always possessed an excellent four-seam fastball but against the White Sox, he got strikeouts on his changeup, slider and curveball as well. ... That outing came after consecutive one-strikeout starts. Since the start of May, he has a 5.83 ERA. ... Gore was one of the key pieces of the Nationals' trade for Juan Soto in 2022. He was drafted third overall out of high school by the Padres in 2017. ... Gore has increased his strikeout rate to 10.9 per nine and dropped his walk rate to 2.8 per nine this season. ... He struck out 10 in seven innings of one-run ball against the Marlins last time out. ... Gore averages 96.5 mph on his four-seam fastball and has gotten impressive whiff rates on his curveball, slider and changeup this season.\n\nComing up\n\nFriday: At Philadelphia, 3:40 p.m., Diamondbacks LHP Tommy Henry (2-2, 6.23) vs. Phillies RHP Taijuan Walker (3-2, 5.33).\n\nSaturday: At Philadelphia, 1:05 p.m., Diamondbacks LHP Jordan Montgomery (5-4, 6.00) vs. Phillies RHP Zack Wheeler (8-4, 2.84).\n\nSunday: At Philadelphia, 8:35 a.m., Diamondbacks RHP Slade Cecconi (2-5, 5.90) vs. Phillies LHP Christopher Sanchez (4-3, 2.91).\n\nWhat to know about the Washington Nationals\n\nThe Nationals made little in the way of significant acquisitions over the offseason, but they find themselves playing competitive baseball and squarely in the middle of the playoff hunt in a mediocre National League. After sweeping the Marlins over the weekend, the Nationals have won eight of nine games. The Nationals have the third-worst OPS (.668) in the NL, but their pitching staff has been solid, ranking fifth with a 3.84 ERA. SS C.J. Abrams has been their most productive hitter with a .258/.310/.477 line and a team-leading 11 homers. OF Jesse Winker also is off to a solid start, hitting .265 with six homers and 31 RBIs. The Diamondbacks will face two of the Nationals' better starters this week in RHP Jake Irvin and LHP MacKenzie Gore. Irvin is a late-blooming former fourth-round pick in 2018 while Gore was one of the players acquired in the OF Juan Soto trade. RHP Kyle Finnegan ranks second in the league with 20 saves (in 22 opportunities) and a 1.78 ERA.", "source": {"uri": "azcentral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AZ Central"}, "authors": [{"uri":

We're here to share our MLB odds series, make a Diamondbacks-Nationals prediction, and pick while showing you how to watch.\n\nLast Start: Nelson was good in his last outing as he went six innings, allowing one earned run on six hits while striking out eight and walking one in a win over the Chicago White Sox. It was a nice bounce-back effort after a disastrous outing.\n\n2024 Road Splits: Nelson has been slightly better on the road, going 1-3 with a 5.19 ERA over six games and five starts away from Nationals Park.\n\nMacKenzie Gore (6-5) with a 3.24 ERA\n\nLast Start: Gore had an amazing time out in his last outing, going seven innings while allowing one earned run on five hits, striking out 10, and walking one in a win over the Miami Marlins. It was his first quality start after three mediocre outings.\n\n2024 Home Splits: Gore is 4-3 with a 3.80 ERA over nine starts at Nationals Park.\n\nThe Diamondbacks started this series with a 5-0 thumping on Tuesday in Washington. Overall, they mustered up enough runs and their pitching staff was elite to hold the Nats scoreless while allowing just four hits. It has helped spring them into the final wildcard spot in the National League while the Nats fell behind by a game. Ultimately, the offense is displaying some strengths.\n\nThe Diamondbacks are fifth in batting average and on-base percentage. They are also fifth in on-base percentage and eighth in slugging percentage. However, they have lacked some power as they are 16th in home runs. The Diamondbacks certainly have some players who can rake.\n\nChristian Walker is having a solid season. So far, he is batting .255 with 16 home runs, 49 RBIs, and 44 runs and is well on his way to 30 home runs, 100 RBIs, and 100 runs if he can sustain the production. Ketel Marte clobberedd a home run in the opener. Now, he is hitting .286 with 15 home runs, 42 RBIs, and 50 runs. Lourdes Gurriel Jr. had two hits and scored a run in the opener. Thus, his stats now stand at .250, with nine home runs, 42 RBIs, and 33 runs. Corbin Carroll had a triple in Tuesday's game. Yet, his number are still down as he is batting .218 with two home runs, 23 RBIs, and 43 runs.\n\nThe pitching staff has been atrocious. Sadly, they rank just 26th in team ERA. Their relievers have not been much better. Currently, the Diamondbacks are 22nd in team ERA.\n\nThe Diamondbacks will cover the spread if they can string together some hits again. Then, they need Nelson to avoid making mistakes down the heart of the plate and mow down hitters.\n\nWhy The Nationals Will Cover The Spread/Win\n\nThe Nationals have been fighting for a wildcard spot while playing mediocre baseball. Therefore, it's no surprise that this series-opening loss dropped them just behind the last spot while still holding a record under .500.\n\nThe offense has struggled, ranking 20th in batting average, 23rd in on-base percentage, and 24th in runs. Furthermore, Washington has struggled to clobber the baseball, ranking 29th in home runs and 27th in slugging percentage.\n\nJoey Meneses is one of the top hitters. Yet, he has struggled often and is currently batting .241 with three home runs, 36 RBIs, and 16 runs. CJ Abrams is getting better as the season chugs along, carrying an 11-game hitting streak into Wednesday's action. Now, he is hitting .261 with 11 home runs, 36 RBIs, and 40 runs. Jesse Winker is capable of doing big things. Significantly, he is batting .270 with six home runs, 31 RBIs, and 33 runs.\n\nThe pitching staff has kept them afloat throughout the season. Ultimately, they are 14th in team ERA. Their relievers have also been hot and cold. Significantly, they are 16th in team ERA.\n\nThe Nationals will cover the spread if they can manage to get on base and drive runners home. Then, they need Gore to pitch well.\n\nFinal Diamondbacks-Nationals Prediction & Pick\n\nThe Diamondbacks were 34-39 against the spread after winning the series-opening matchup. Yet, the Nats are the best team in the majors against the run-line record. The Nationals are also 19-15 against the spread at home and 4-3 when they are the home favorites. But the Diamondbacks are 16-9 against the spread when they have been the away underdogs. We like Gore over Nelson because he has shown more consistency. The only worrying factor is whether the Nats will score. In this case, the Nationals will give Gore enough runs to help cover the odds.\n\nClick here for more betting news and predictions", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rb_hayek@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Rb Hayek", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationals_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nationals Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Nationals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington Nationals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Diamondbacks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Diamondbacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "On-base percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacKenzie_Gore", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MacKenzie Gore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami Marlins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lourdes_Gurriel_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lourdes Gurriel Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketel_Marte", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ketel Marte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Corbin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Corbin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CJ_Abrams", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CJ Abrams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joey_Meneses", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joey Meneses"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitting_streak", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hitting streak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Winker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jesse Winker"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail_Running", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Trail Running", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Off-Road", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Multi-Sports/Off-Road", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Diamondbacks-vs.-Nationals-prediction-odds-pick.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9660777", "eventUri": "eng-9660777", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 147, "relevance": 1}

Washington was held to six hits.\n\n\"I talk about it all the time -- hitting is hard,\" Nationals manager Dave Martinez said. \"And you're going to go through those lapses where it's like that, where you score two or three runs but you've got a chance to win. That's what I love about this team -- they don't give up.\"\n\nHitting has not been hard lately for Winker, who has reached safely in 13 of his past 14 games, hitting .452 (19-for-42) with eight RBIs and eight runs.\n\nArizona, which had won four of its past six, managed only four hits. Three of the Diamondbacks' hits and their run came against Corbin, who began the day with a 5.84 ERA. Arizona fared no better against Washington's bullpen, which tossed four scoreless innings.\n\n\"This one has me shaking my head a little bit,\" Lovullo said. \"I'm here talking with my coaches, thinking what happened?

Mandatory Credit: Geoff Burke-USA TODAY Sports / Geoff Burke-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Arizona Diamondbacks hung on for a 5-2 victory over the Nationals Thursday afternoon to climb a half game past Washington into the third Wild Card spot. Jake McCarthy keyed rallies in the 4th and 5th innings. Ryne Nelson threw seven innings allowing just two runs in yet another D-backs quality start.\n\nArizona took two of three in the series, upping their record to 37-38. They are 12-6 in June. It was their third straight series victory and they've won or split their last six series dating back to May 30th.\n\nMcCarthy came into spring training seemingly on the outside looking in for an opening day roster spot. The D-backs had brought back Lourdes Gurriel Jr. on a free agent contract and also signed Randal Grichuk and Joc Pederson. Along with Corbin Carroll and Alek Thomas, the Diamondbacks had six players to cover three outfield spots and the DH.\n\nA hamstring injury to Thomas in the third game of the year opened the door for McCarthy to get playing time however, and he's seized the opportunity with a vengeance. He was the catalyst for the offense Thursday afternoon in Washington. He had three hits, two stolen bases, and scored two runs.\n\nMcCarthy led off the fourth inning with a base hit and later scored on Tucker Barnhart's clutch base hit. Randal Gruchuk also had a two-run double later in the inning. McCarthy then knocked a two-out opposite field hit in the 5th inning, stole second, and scored on Kevin Newman's bloop base hit.\n\nThe incredible thing about McCarthy's day is that all three hits came against left-hander MacKenzie Gore. McCarthy has hit left-handers this year to the tune of 15 for 35, .429. For the full year McCarthy is batting .298 with an .800 OPS.\n\nSpeaking with Jody Jackson McCarthy downplayed the difficulty of hitting same side pitching. \"The lefty-righty thing, they've got to throw it over the same plate. I try not to let it become too mental......I try to swing at strikes, try to hit line drives \"\n\nThe simplified contact approach has led to hits to all fields for McCarthy, regardless of the pitcher handedness. And once on the bases he creates havoc, even if he gets picked off occasionally. The two steals today upped his season total to 12.\n\n\"I got picked off two days ago. I try to limit when we do that,\" McCarthy said. \"Sometimes you get caught stealing, sometimes you get picked off, but I think our M.O. is being aggressive.\"\n\nHaving McCarthy in the lineup more days than not, getting on base and pressing the envelope once he gets there has helped restore some of the team's identity from last year.\n\nRyne Nelson meanwhile took advantage of an overly aggressive Nationals lineup. Pitching to contact, he needed just 70 pitches to record 21 outs. Nelson allowed three hits, two of which were solo homers by Lane Thomas and Jesse Winker. He only struck out two batters, but walked none.\n\nFor Nelson it was his second straight excellent outing. He evened his record at 5-5 and lowered his ERA to 5.18. It was the third quality start by a Diamondbacks pitcher this series. Over their last 7 games, D-backs starters have a 1.86 ERA, allowing just eight earned runs in 38.2 innings.\n\nChristian Walker hit his 17th home run of the year in the top of the 9th to provide some insurance for closer Paul Sewald. Then with a runner on first and two out Walker lept high in the air to snare a line drive headed to the corner off the bat of Kelbert Ruiz. That saved a run and allowed Sewald to collect his 8th save of the year.\n\nFinal Box Score\n\nThe Diamondbacks head to Philadelphia via train for a three game series in Citizens Bank Ballpark, the scene of their National League Championship triumph. Jordan Montgomery will try to keep the ball rolling when he takes the ball for Arizona. Former Diamondbacks Taijuan Walker will start for the Phillies.\n\nThe game will be an Apple TV exclusive broadcast. Game time is 6:40 P.M. EST, 3:40 P.M. MST. There will be a watch party Friday afternoon starting at 3:30 at Guy Fieri's Downtown Phoenix Kitchen. Merrill Kelly will be there for a Q&A with fans.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

BetMGM is one of several leading sportsbooks that accept credit card and PayPal.\n\nMiami Marlins vs. Washington Nationals\n\nThe Washington Nationals face off against their division rival in the Miami Marlins in the second game of this three-game series. These teams already played each other in a series this season in Miami and the Nationals swept that four-game series. These teams are going in completely opposite directions with their organizations. The Nationals are toward the end of a rebuild and they are looking up. They have plenty of young talent and impressive prospects, and they are 33-36 on the season, but just two games out of the last Wild Card spot. The Marlins are 23-46 this season after a miserable start to their season, and they are 2-8 in their last 10 games. They made the playoffs last season but they have already traded their best player in Luis Arraez, and optioned their best starting pitcher in Max Meyer to control his service time. They are all in on a long-term rebuild and they don't have many talented prospects, so they have a long way to go until they are finally competing again.\n\nBaseball fans present in the Tar Heel State can claim thousands of dollars in bonuses with North Carolina betting promos this baseball season now that North Carolina sports betting is officially live. The Caesars Sportsbook North Carolina promo code gets new customers $250 in bonus bets after making an initial wager of at least $10.\n\nTrevor Rogers is making the start for the Marlins and he is 1-7 with a 5.37 ERA in 13 starts this season. He has been very hit or miss this season, when he has his good stuff he is pitching very well. But when he doesn't have his good stuff, he pitches very poorly. He has not pitched a quality start the entire season and he has only pitched six innings once this season. He faced the Nationals earlier this season at home and allowed three runs in five innings on his way to the loss. He walked three batters and only struck out three batters. DJ Herz will be making just his third career start and he allowed four earned runs in four innings pitching in his debut. Then he allowed just two earned runs in 4.1 innings pitched in his second game. However, I think he will make a big step in his third game. The Marlins are ranked dead last in the league in wOBA against lefties and he is a tough lefty to pick up. The Nationals aren't too much better, ranked second worst in the league in wOBA against lefties this season, but they have been playing very well overall lately while the Marlins haven't. The Nationals are also much healthier right now with Joey Meneses and Lane Thomas in the lineup against lefties, and Thomas had been hurt most the season so that significantly helps. Joey Gallo was also added to the IL and he has been miserable this season, so the Nationals are finally able to stack righties when they face a lefty.\n\nHowever, the Nationals also have a bullpen advantage. They are ranked 18th in the league in bullpen ERA while the Marlins aren't too far behind them ranked 20th. But the Nationals' bullpen has a big gap from the top end arms to the bottom end. Their top four relievers are very good and they have been dominant all season. They will also all be available. It's when they are losing that their bullpen isn't great. The Nationals have just been playing too well lately and they have been playing well against the Marlins all season. I like the Nationals to win on the short moneyline at home.\n\nStay up to date on the best MLB picks and props every day of the season using RotoWire's props tool.

Arizona is 12-6 in June.\n\nNelson retired nine hitters in a row between solo home runs by Lane Thomas and Jesse Winker.\n\nHis effectiveness came at a different flavor than his stellar start against the White Sox last week. Nelson struck out a career-high eight batters in six innings, allowing one earned run for a victory against Chicago.\n\nThis time, Nelson only struck out two hitters with six whiffs. He got nine ground ball outs, which has been much more prevalent with Nelson this season. His ground ball rate entering Thursday was 43%, a sizable increase from 37.5% last year.\n\nNelson also did not surrender a walk on Thursday, helping to keep the pitch count down.\n\nThis has been a promising stretch of starts for Arizona despite the numerous injuries:\n\nRyan Thompson and Paul Sewald locked it down with two scoreless innings in relief at Nationals Park. Sewald earned his first save since June 6 due to a lack of close games.\n\nThe offense struck in the third inning with three runs, a rally started by a Jake McCarthy single.\n\nTucker Barnhart delivered the first RBI with a single to left, and Randal Grichuk plated two with a double into the left-field corner.\n\nMcCarthy recorded three hits against left-handed starter MacKenzie Gore and scored a pair of runs. He also swiped two bases to up his total to 12 this season, one back of Corbin Carroll for the team lead despite more than 120 fewer plate appearances.\n\nHe became the first D-backs player since Carroll last September to pick up three hits and two steals in a game.\n\nA notable feat of McCarthy's season has been his success hitting left-on-left. He has had pretty even splits over the past couple seasons, but this year he is slashing .400/.471/.433 against southpaws.\n\nHe told the D-backs' postgame show he is not focused on the handedness of the pitcher, saying they have to throw it over the same plate.\n\nDoes this trend open a role for him against lefties when Alek Thomas returns to the lineup or make the D-backs' decision that much more confusing?\n\nChristian Walker gifted the D-backs another insurance run with a solo shot in the ninth inning, his team-leading 17th of the season. Walker also made a web gem leaping catch to end the game.\n\nThe D-backs head to Citizens Bank Park for three games at the Philadelphia Phillies starting Friday.\n\nArizona has Montgomery, Tommy Henry and Cecconi slated as probables, respectively. Philadelphia's probables are Taijuan Walker, Zack Wheeler and Cristopher Sanchez in order.\n\nThis will be the first meeting between the two sides since the National League Championship Series, when the D-backs won the pennant in Philadelphia.", "source": {"uri": "arizonasports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Arizona Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_weiner@arizonasports.com", "name": "Alex

Daily quotas will limit the number of applications accepted to ensure smooth software performance. To renew online, applicants must meet specific requirements and pay standard fees, with a processing time of 6-8 weeks. SIMPLEFLYING VIDEO OF THE DAY SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT\n\nThe US State Department has revealed a new online passport renewal system, which will save travelers the hassle of mailing in paper passport renewal applications.\n\nA growing program.\n\nThe link to renew passports online is now live on the State Department website. However, the number of daily applications will be limited over the next several months as the Department rolls out the beta release of its updated online passport renewal system.\n\nRelated How To Renew Global Entry Step-By-Step The first step to renewing a Global Entry membership is straightforward, but completing it can take time.\n\nThe online renewal system will open for a limited window at 12:00 Eastern Time each day and close once the daily quota is reached. According to the US State Department, this cap is to ensure the software works smoothly before rolling it out on a larger scale:\n\n\"During the next several months, we plan to continue to limit the number of applications accepted each day so we can monitor the system's performance in real time.\n\n\"This beta release during which we are limiting the daily applications is an important and standard part of the software development process.\u202f\"\n\nPhoto: Tatjana Meininger | Shutterstock\n\nApplicants can also begin the application and finish it at a later date as long as it is completed within 30 days of starting.\n\nHow to renew your passport online Confirm you meet the requirements.\n\nIndividuals looking to renew online must meet all of the following requirements:\n\nThe passport you are renewing is or was valid for 10 years, and you are age 25 or older.\u202f The passport you are renewing was issued between 2009 and 2015, or over 9 years, but less than 15 years from the date you plan to submit your application. You are not changing your name, gender, date of birth, or place of birth. You are not traveling internationally for at least 8 weeks from submitting your application.\u202fWe will only offer routine service during this limited release, and the time it takes to get a passport will be the same as renewing by mail. You are applying for a regular (tourist) passport. You cannot renew a special issuance (diplomatic, official, service) passport online. You live in the United States (either state or territory). You do not qualify to renew online if you live in a foreign country\u202for have an Army Post Office (APO) or Fleet Post Office (FPO) address. You have your passport with you, and it is not damaged or mutilated, and you have not previously reported it as lost or stolen. Keep your most recent passport, and do not mail it to us.\u202f You can pay for your passport using a credit or debit card. You can upload a digital passport photo. You are aware that the passport you are renewing will be canceled after you submit your application, and you cannot use it for international travel. Create an account\n\nNext, one must create a MyTravelGov account, which can be done using the Login.gov platform. As the US government's official login provider, many people already have an account to access websites such as the Veterans Affairs office.\n\nStart your application\n\nOnce the account has been created, users can click the \"Renew Your Passport\" button on the home page to start the application. Next, enter the personal information as it was printed on the passport being renewed. The passport must be expiring within one year or have been expired less than five years.\n\nRelated The Key Differences Between A Passport Card & A Passport Book For US citizens traveling exclusively by land or sea, obtaining a passport card is cheaper, although it cannot be used for air travel. Confirm and pay\n\nIf the system decides the renewal application meets all the requirements outlined above, applicants will be asked to upload a digital photo, which must be in the .JPEG file format. Users will then have to pay the standard passport fee, which is currently set at $130 for the standard passport (passport book), $30 for the passport card, or $160 for both.\n\nApplicants can only renew the product they currently have and cannot use the system to apply for a card or book online at this time.\n\nHow long will it take?\n\nAccording to the Department's website, the processing time for renewing online is 6-8 weeks, which aligns with the routine application times when applying by mail. It is not yet possible to use the Expedited or Urgent Travel packages online, so anyone with urgent renewal requirements is encouraged to make an appointment at a passport agency or center.", "source": {"uri": "simpleflying.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Simple Flying"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Passport"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Entry", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Global Entry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Software release life cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_mail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Military mail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software development process"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_territories_of_Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "States and territories of Australia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_passport_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States passport card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Citizenship of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "JPEG"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Veterans_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Veterans Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Debit card"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers", "label": "dmoz/Computers", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Supplies_and_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Supplies and Equipment", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Business", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Business", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Preparation", "wgt": 33}], "image": "https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/shutterstock_1144913249-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662373", "eventUri": "eng-9662373", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 213, "relevance": 1}

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nMartin Lewis' Money Saving Expert (MSE) has said that holidaymakers should complete two crucial passport checks before they head abroad.\n\nIn their latest newsletter, the experts on the money saving website said that you need to know your passport's expiry date before you book. Failure to do these checks could increase your risk of being refused at the airport.\n\nThe MSE financial gurus discussed passports saying: \"Some countries demand that it's valid for at least six months from your arrival. Plus, if your passport's worse for wear, ripped or water damaged for example, some countries may refuse you entry.\"\n\nUrging people to check the Government's foreign travel advice before you go, they say that if you're visiting the EU, you'll need at least three months left on your passport after the day you plan to leave.

The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nHigher demand for US passports\n\nCharlotte's new agency comes amid a surge in international travel. In 1990, only 5% of Americans held passports, according to the State Department. Today, that number has skyrocketed to nearly half the population. In the past year alone, the Department of State processed a record-breaking 24 million passport books and cards.\n\nDuring the height of the pandemic, the wait time for a new passport grew as long as 13 weeks. But the backlog is gone, according to the State Department. With more overtime and increasing staffing, the State Department brought wait times back to pre-pandemic levels, according to the department's website.\n\nThe new Charlotte agency is different from the nearly 7,500 passport acceptance facilities across the country -- like one that opened last year in uptown. Acceptance facilities, often located in post offices or local government offices, are OK for routine applications like renewals. But they offer limited services and mail applications for processing, which takes six to eight weeks.\n\nCharlotte's new facility is just one of six new agencies announced on Tuesday. The State Department will be opening new locations in Salt Lake City, Utah, Kansas City, Mo., Orlando, Fla., San Antonio, Texas., and Cincinnati, Ohio. It will bring the total number of passport agencies to 36 once opened.\n\nHOW TO APPLY FOR A NEW PASSPORT\n\nHere are the materials you need to have when applying for a new passport:\n\nThere are additional documents needed to get a passport for children 16 and under.

Besides Salt Lake City, the new offices will be located in Kansas City, Mo.; Orlando, Fla.; Charlotte, N.C.; San Antonio and Cincinnati.\n\nThe Department of State's announcement did not say when the new passport agencies will open.\n\nThe agencies will provide same-day services to travelers with urgent travel needs. The new additions are line the government's effort to accommodate the surge in passport demand after the pandemic, bringing the total number of passport agencies and centers to 35 nationwide.\n\nPreviously, the closest passport office from downtown Salt Lake City was eight hours away, in Aurora, Colorado. And without a passport agency, getting a new passport through an acceptance facility takes a standard processing time of 10 to 12 weeks. So if you had found out just hours before your flight that your son had scribbled all over your passport or that your dog had chewed it away, you were out of luck. But with a new passport agency, not anymore.\n\nSen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, was excited to hear the news. He posted Tuesday afternoon on X, \"Passport demand in Utah is enormous -- due in part to our rapid growth and the thousands of missionaries departing SLC each year. After years of work by our team, Salt Lake City is finally getting its own passport agency to provide Utahns with improved, in-person consular services!\"\n\nThis is a move Romney's office has been pushing for years. In April 2021, Romney sent a letter to Secretary of State Antony Blinken to plead why a passport agency was necessary in the state.\n\n\"Utah is rapidly expanding as a center for global commerce and tourism, is home to thousands of Latter-day Saints who annually embark on worldwide religious missions,\" Romney wrote to Blinken in 2021.\n\nOver the years, Romney has followed through with his request by getting a measure passed in September 2022 to check where passport agencies are needed the most, and by sending another letter to Blinken last year about the delays in passport processing.\n\nIn a news release Tuesday, Romney wrote, \"for more than three years, my team and I have worked with the State Department to bring a passport agency to Salt Lake City to improve passport services for Utahns.\" He added, \"I could not be more thrilled with today's announcement.\"\n\nUtah Gov. Spencer Cox expressed his gratitude. \"We're grateful to Senator Romney and the rest of our Congressional delegation for their great work in bringing a passport office to Utah,\" Cox said in a statement. \"We're proud of how many Utahns have international experience and language skills.

In Florida, 1.5 million passports were issued last year, according to State Department statistics, compared to 1.3 million in 2022, 878,410 in 2021 and 690,804 in 2020. Before the pandemic shut down most travel, 1.2 million passports were issued to Floridians in 2019.\n\nThe State Department also announced this month that Americans with existing U.S. passports issued between 2009 and 2015 could use a new beta system that allows them to renew some passports online. The number of applicants is limited during this test phase but the system is expected to expand over the next several months, the department said.\n\nNew ID requirements coming: When do Real ID driver's licenses go into effect?

The department says the current passport processing time is lower now: six to eight weeks.\n\nHow to renew a passport online\n\nTo renew your passport online, you'll need to visit the MyTravelGov website. The system will ask you to make an account and fill out information about your passport.\n\nWith the new system, you can upload a digital photo of yourself in .JPEG format, which should be easier than getting printed passport photos.\n\nYou can pay the $130 fee with a credit or debit card. Once your application is submitted, sign up for email updates.\n\nThe cost of a passport has been the same since December 2021.

First, check if your passport was issued before September 2018.\n\nHas it passed its 10-year anniversary? Even though it could have some months left, your passport will be invalid for travel to all EU countries with the exception of Ireland as well as Iceland, Norway, Lichtenstein and Switzerland.\n\nIf you are going to these countries you must have a passport issued less than 10 years before your departure date. If your passport is invalid you can try and book an emergency appointment online at your nearest passport office which offers a one-day and a one-week fast track service.\n\nOtherwise passports can be renewed online by HM Passport Office or by using a paper application from certain Post Offices. It can take up to three weeks to renew a passport from the UK.\n\n\"Don't assume that just because your passport is valid for the duration of your stay, that everything is fine. Countries have a variety of rules about how long you need left, and how old the passport can be. Since Brexit, this includes most EU countries too,\" MSE says.\n\n\"If you fall foul of these, you could be refused entry - we've heard one story of a family's four-year-old girl being refused entry to Turkey because she had less than two months left on her passport.\"", "source": {"uri": "birminghammail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Birmingham Mail"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_rodger@birminghammail.co.uk", "name": "James Rodger", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Lewis_(financial_journalist)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Martin Lewis (financial journalist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Passport"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoneySavingExpert.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "MoneySavingExpert.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign,_Commonwealth_and_Development_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brexit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HM_Passport_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "HM Passport Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greece"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_state_of_the_European_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member state of the European Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Norway"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Norway"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liechtenstein", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liechtenstein"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Liechtenstein"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iceland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iceland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Preparation", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Stamps", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Stamps", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Cao_Dai", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Cao Dai", "wgt": 9}], "image": "https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/news/cost-of-living/article29383426.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_martin9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662373", "eventUri": "eng-9662373", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "textStart": 534, "textEnd": 541}, {"amb": false, "date": "2018-09-", "textStart": 720, "textEnd": 734, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

Mr. Blinken said in the statement that they reflect a \"commitment to provide prompt customer services to more Americans closer to where they live.\"\n\nThe statement did not say when the facilities would be operational.\n\nBack in 1990, only 5 percent of Americans had a passport, a figure that has now grown to 48 percent, he noted. In fiscal year 2023, the department issued over 24 million passport books and cards, \"more than ever before.\"\n\nThe six new facilities will expand the department's passport network to 35 passport agencies and centers.

Individuals who do not require such services are advised to apply at any of the thousands of passport acceptance facilities, which include post offices and local government centers.\n\nMr. Blinken pointed out that over 99 percent of Americans live within 25 miles of an acceptance center.\n\nThe Secretary of State said that the department is processing passports at pre-pandemic levels even though it is issuing more passports than before.\n\nIn a June 19 X video post by the State Department, Mr. Blinken advised Americans to check their passport expiry dates and get a new one if the expiration date is close.\n\n\"Check out travel.state.gov for the latest information and enroll in our STEP program so that you know anything that's going on that you need to know about the country that you're going to.

Expedited processing, which adds an additional cost of $60 on top of the standard fee of $130, took about seven to nine weeks.\n\nIn December 2023, the agency announced that processing times had returned to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels, with routine processing taking six to eight weeks.\n\nThis past week, the agency announced a beta trial of an online passport renewal system.\n\n\"Utah is experiencing rapid population growth as it becomes a center for global commerce and tourism -- as well as home base to thousands of Latter-day Saints who embark on worldwide religious missions each year,\" he said.\n\n\"A passport agency in Salt Lake now means that Utahns will not have to travel such long distances to obtain in-person consular services.

Here's what it means for passport emergencies.", "body": "For years, if someone in the Kansas City area had an emergency with their passport, it required an hours-long drive to cities like Chicago, Hot Springs, Ark., Dallas, Denver or Minneapolis.\n\nNo longer.\n\nThe State Department on Tuesday announced Kansas City is one of six new cities getting a passport agency.\n\n\"There is simply no reason that families in the Kansas City region should have to drive five hours or more to receive in-person assistance for passport services, and after a year of encouragement from Rep. (Sharice) Davids and I, I'm thrilled that they've heeded our calls to establish a passport agency right here in Kansas City,\" said Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, a Kansas City Democrat.\n\nKansas City, Orlando, Salt Lake City, Charlotte, San Antonio and Cincinnati will now be among the 35 passport agencies and centers across the country. Those agencies are responsible for processing passport requests and providing in-person appointments for people who have a foreign travel emergency within 14 days or need a foreign visa within 28 days.\n\nThe State Department did not say when the new passport centers are expected to open.\n\nMillions of Americans have grown increasingly frustrated with long wait times for passports as the State Department has struggled to keep up with a crushing demand of requests. The department processed 45 million passport claims in the 2023 fiscal year, as the number of Americans who has a passport grew from 5% in 1990 to more than 48% in 2024.\n\nThe high demand resulted in wait times as long as 10 to 13 weeks last June. When people in Kansas City needed quicker service, they often found that appointments at passport centers were completely booked.\n\nAs of December, the State Department said the current wait time is back down to six to eight weeks. International travel is up to 97% of its pre-pandemic levels, according to according to the World Tourism Organization, an agency of the United Nations.\n\nThe State Department also recently created an online passport renewal service, to help make it easier for people to renew their passports online.\n\nDavids said she was thrilled Kansas City was chosen to have a passport agency.\n\n\"Our teams have received countless inquiries from constituents, who often face long drives and unnecessary stress to get their passports,\" Davids said. \"This new agency will significantly streamline the request and renewal process, making it easier and more efficient for everyone.\"", "source": {"uri": "kansascity.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Kansas City Star"}, "authors": [{"uri":

common mistake", "body": "A WOMAN has revealed how she was forced to miss four days of her holiday because of a simple, yet common, passport mistake.\n\nEven if your passport is yet to expire, it could still prevent you from entering a country because of certain validity rules.\n\nThat's exactly what happened to Tiktoker Fran Hainingg who was due to head to Greece for a summer break.\n\nBecause she hadn't checked the rules, she instead found herself having to go to London to get a new passport instead of heading to the beach, after she was unable to board her flight at the airport.\n\nThe problem she encountered was to do with the 10-year passport rule, which prevents Brits from entering EU countries, if their passports are more than 10 years old on the day they're travelling.\n\nPassports must also have more than three months remaining on them on the day they're due to return to the UK.\n\nHowever, Fran's passport was two days beyond the 10 year threshold, meaning she had to abandon her holiday in search of a new passport.\n\nFor this, she needed to make an appointment at the London passport office, which set her back a further two days and meant she missed the first four days of her trip, and spent an extra \u00a3300.\n\nIn a video, she said: \"I got declined to get on the flight because my passport was two days out of date from being 10 years old.\n\n\"We initially got turned away because we didn't have an appointment, so two days later we were heading back into London.\n\n\"Instead of waking up in sunny Greece, I was commuting with all the other 9-5 girlies.\"\n\nEventually, though Fran was able to sort out new, valid documents and able to book herself onto a new flight.\n\nShe added: \"Anyway, \u00a3200 on a new passport and \u00a3100 on new flights, four days into the holiday and we got to Greece.\"\n\nAnyone with a holiday coming up should check their passports now and, if their passports aren't valid, apply for a new one as soon as possible.\n\nAs many as 10,000 people get caught out by the problem each year, so it's worth having a look at your passport just to make sure.\n\nIn fact, Brits have been urged to check their passports now, even if they're not due to travel until the end of the summer.\n\nOfficial government guidance is three weeks for a standard passport renewal, but this could take longer if applying for the first time.\n\nIt could also take even longer during peak travel periods, when more people are getting passports renewed.\n\nTherefore it's better to get it done as soon as possible, to avoid missing out on highly-anticipated holidays this summer.\n\nThat's why the Post Office has launched a campaign urging people to check their passports sooner rather than later, so they can avoid holiday disappointment.\n\nThe initiative provides holidaymakers with a timely reminder, marking six weeks before the onset of peak summer international travel.\n\nThis provides travellers with enough time to renew their documents, or factor in additional checks that may be required if applying for a first-time passport before travelling.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk", "dataType":

This information has recently been updated, and is now available.\n\nExpanding Passport Agencies Across the United States [ https://www.state.gov/expanding-passport-agencies-across-the-united-states/ ] 06/18/2024 03:56 PM EDT\n\nAntony J. Blinken, Secretary of State\n\nMore Americans can travel abroad today than at any time in our history. In 1990, only five percent of Americans had a passport. Today, that number is 48 percent. In Fiscal Year 2023, the Department of State issued over 24 million passport books and cards - more than ever before. To better serve the growing number of Americans seeking U.S. passports, the Department is taking steps to establish six new passport agencies. These offices - which will open in Salt Lake City, UT; Kansas City, MO; Orlando, FL; Charlotte, NC; San Antonio, TX; and Cincinnati, OH - reflect our commitment to provide prompt customer services to more Americans closer to where they live.\n\nThe six additional facilities will expand our passport network to 35 passport agencies and centers and over 7,400 public passport acceptance facilities nationwide. As our existing network of agencies do every day, these new passport agencies will provide service to travelers with urgent travel needs. Travelers who do not require urgent passport services can apply at one of our 7,400 passport acceptance facilities, which include post offices and other local government facilities. More than 99 percent of Americans already live within 25 miles of an acceptance facility.\n\nWhile we undertake steps to establish these new agencies, we are issuing more passports than ever before while maintaining our passport processing times at our pre-pandemic levels. We thank Congress for its partnership and support, and we look forward to working with our congressional partners and other stakeholders to open these new facilities.\n\nThe Department of State encourages U.S. citizens to apply for, or renew, their passports before they book travel.

Today's announcement is the result of a provision secured into law by Senator Romney that required the State Department's Bureau of Consular Affairs to improve in-person and emergency passport services for Americans living in significant population centers more than a five-hour drive from an existing passport agency.\n\n\"For more than three years, my team and I have worked with the State Department to bring a passport agency to Salt Lake City to improve passport services for Utahns,\" said Senator Romney. \"Utah is experiencing rapid population growth as it becomes a center for global commerce and tourism -- as well as home base to thousands of Latter-day Saints who embark on worldwide religious missions each year. A passport agency in Salt Lake now means that Utahns will not have to travel such long distances to obtain in-person consular services. I could not be more thrilled with today's announcement.\"\n\nBackground:\n\nRomney personally received a phone call from Secretary of State Antony Blinken informing him that the State Department is opening up a passport agency in Salt Lake City -- fulfilling one of Senator Romney's top priorities to help improve the lives of Utahns.\n\nIn January 2021, during the confirmation process for Secretary Blinken, Senator Romney highlighted the need for timely and accessible passport services in Utah and the Mountain West and secured a commitment from Secretary Blinken to review appropriate steps to ensure that passport services are accessible to all eligible Americans. Romney followed up on that commitment in a public letter to Secretary Blinken in April 2021.\n\nIn September 2022, Romney secured a measure in the Department of State Authorization Act of 2022 requiring the State Department to review and report on the geographical diversity of passport agencies, specifically identifying areas of the country with both high demand and no-in person access. This measure became law in December as part of the James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023.\n\nIn April 2023, Romney led the Utah Congressional Delegation in sending a letter to Secretary Blinken raising concerns over extreme delays in the processing of passports and renewing its request for the State Department to open a passport agency in Salt Lake City to give Mountain West residents an in-person option for passport services. Later that year, Romney secured several passport provisions into law with the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024, one of which required the State Department to produce a strategy to ensure reasonable access to passport services for all Americans, including how to provide U.S. residents living in a significant population center more than a five-hour drive from a passport agency with urgent, in-person passport services -- such as building new passport agencies.\n\nEarlier this year, Romney welcomed Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs Rena Bitter, and representatives from the State Department to Utah for a slate of \"passport fairs\" and to discuss the planned expansion of in-person consular affairs services. More than one-thousand Utahns attended one of six passport fairs throughout the state to obtain passport services closer to home.", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz", "name": "Mil-Osi Publisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Passport"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitt_Romney", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mitt Romney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Lake_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Salt Lake City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Salt Lake City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consul_(representative)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Consul (representative)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Consular_Affairs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bureau of Consular Affairs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_Blinken", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antony Blinken"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advice_and_consent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advice and consent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_West_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mountain West Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tourism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rena_Bitter", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rena Bitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Defense_Authorization_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Defense Authorization Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Inhofe", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jim Inhofe"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Fire_and_Security", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Fire and Security", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Preparation", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Human_Resources/Government_Agencies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Human Resources/Government Agencies", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 74}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662373", "eventUri": "eng-9662373", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Maxwell Frost, D-Orlando, announced in a news conference Tuesday.\n\nThe result? Fewer 235-mile trips from Orlando to Miami, currently the site of the only passport agency in the state.\n\nThere are about 25 \"passport counters\" within 25 miles of downtown Orlando, ]usually in government buildings like post offices, but they can't do what an agency can. As Frost explained, passport counters receive your information and dispatch it to the Miami agency for processing. It can take six to eight weeks to receive your passport, and if you want it faster, you may have to pay a private \"passport expediter\" to handle it for you.\n\nBut agencies like Miami's have the authority to deal with emergencies, like a life-and-death situation with a family member when you need a same-day passport. Even lesser emergencies, like you forgot your trip is actually next month, are enough to get an agency to expedite. And if there's a problem with your ID documents or background check, they often can tell you right away.\n\nFor the privilege, \"people have to drive hours and hours,\" he said. \"A lot of people have to spend their own money to get a hotel to stay overnight because it's so far from their home.\"\n\nSoon, that will be no more.\n\nIt may take up to a year for the U.S. General Services Administration to determine where the office should go. In the meantime, Frost said he wants recommendations from city leaders.\n\nFrost said receiving approval for a passport office is difficult because of the amount of federal money required,though he didn't know an exact amount at Tuesday's conference.\n\n\"We're really happy we got this,\" he said, \"but this is something that a lot of times can take years, if not decades to try to win in your area, but we had a good case for it.\"", "source": {"uri": "orlandosentinel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Orlando Sentinel"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lauren_brensel@orlandosentinel.com", "name": "Lauren Brensel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Passport"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell_Frost", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maxwell Frost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central Florida"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downtown_Orlando", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Downtown Orlando"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Services_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General Services Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Preparation", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Agents_and_Agencies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Agents and Agencies", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 10}], "image": "https://www.orlandosentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/TE.RFID11P2.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662373", "eventUri": "eng-9662373", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

Appointments are required.\n\nIn addition to these passport agencies, the State Department offers more than 7,400 public passport acceptance facilities where travelers can submit their applications. These include post offices, public libraries, local government offices, and more.\n\nThe State Department also runs \"Special Passport Acceptance Fairs\" across the country.

Only travelers who currently live in the U.S. and have passports that were issued between 2009 and 2015 are eligible to renew online. Travelers also can't renew online if they want to change things like their name.\n\nCurrently, the processing time for passports is six to eight weeks for routine service and two to three weeks for

Mitt Romney and other members of Utah's congressional delegation, an office will soon be open in Utah.\n\nRomney released a statement after the announcement saying he and his team had worked for more than three years to bring a passport agency to Utah.\n\n\"Utah is experiencing rapid population growth as it becomes a center for global commerce and tourism -- as well as home base to thousands of Latter-day Saints who embark on worldwide religious missions each year,\" Romney said. \"A passport agency in Salt Lake now means that Utahns will not have to travel such long distances to obtain in-person consular services. I could not be more thrilled with today's announcement.\"\n\nIn a statement released alongside the announcement, Blinken said six new agencies will open, including the one in Salt Lake, and that the department is issuing more passports \"than ever before.\"\n\n\"To better serve the growing number of Americans seeking U.S. passports, the Department is taking steps to establish six new passport agencies. These offices - which will open in Salt Lake City, UT; Kansas City, MO; Orlando, FL; Charlotte, NC; San Antonio, TX; and Cincinnati, OH - reflect our commitment to provide prompt customer services to more Americans closer to where they live,\" he said.\n\nRomney helped insert language into the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2024, that required the State Department to determine if they should open more passport offices closer to population centers, especially if they were more than a five-hour drive from a passport agency. Salt Lake City met those criteria.\n\nAt a passport fair he helped organize in Salt Lake City in February, Romney said his sole purpose was to \"encourage the State Department to open a passport office\" in Utah.\n\n\"We have a lot of people in Utah who do a lot of travel internationally. We have a lot of missionaries, we have a lot of families, big families. They want to go around the world and see different places,\" Romney said.\n\nThe February fair also included a visit from Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs Rena Bitter, who said the department was researching locations around the country and would make a decision soon about where to place a new office.\n\nIn April 2023, several members of Utah's congressional delegation said because of a backlog at passport processing centers their offices were flooded with requests for help from their constituents. At the time, they asked the agency to consider opening a passport office in Utah.\n\nRomney, in a 2021 letter to Blinken, highlighted the hardships his constituents face without a passport facility.\n\n\"Today, residents throughout the Western Mountain region of the United States, including Idaho, Oregon, Montana, Nevada, Utah, and Wyoming must renew their passports by mail, or travel significant distances to neighboring states to access the nearest passport office,\" he said. \"Same day, in-person service is essentially impossible for millions of Americans in these states.\"\n\nHe also pointed out that Utah is a fast-growing state, a bustling center for global commerce and tourism. Salt Lake City is also the west-coast hub for Delta Airlines. Every year, Utah receives 250,000, Romney previously said.

It contains a microchip which carries your passport information. So, what you have in your passport data page, that is the page you see with your name, date of birth, and all of that, is also contained on a microchip,\" Gordon stated.\n\n\"People may ask, why do I need to get this passport? It adds a layer of security to your passport, so if someone gets a hold of your passport as sometimes things happen and we lose our passport travelling or sometimes we misplace it, you have an added layer of security, so persons can't easily alter your passport and change your information,\" she added.\n\nGordon was speaking during a luncheon Plenary at the 10th Biennial Jamaica Diaspora Conference, being held at the Montego Bay Convention Centre in St James on Tuesday.\n\nShe noted that \"the chip contains your information, once it is personalised, so it is an added layer of security and makes your passport less susceptible to fraud\".\n\nGordon further stated that the use of e-passports makes it easier for persons to clear immigration at the airports.\n\n\"There are still a number of our Jamaicans who live overseas who are still holding on to the old manual passport, that's the fancy blue one that some of us love. So, the e-passport facilitates the use of the kiosks and our e-gates. So, for those who are here, we are still open for you to come and have your passport renewed and even after you leave, if you were not prepared to do it here, you can still send your application through our overseas Mission,\" she noted.\n\nOn March 31, 2023, PICA went live with a new high-security electronic or e-passport document to the public.\n\nThe agency has been taking steps over the years to secure Jamaica's passport as part of its efforts to safeguard the identity of Jamaicans and the Jamaican travel document, and the e-passport is the latest initiative in that regard.", "source": {"uri": "jamaica-gleaner.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jamaica Gleaner"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometric_passport", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Biometric passport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Passport"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaspora", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Diaspora"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Integrated circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montego_Bay", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Montego Bay"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montego Bay"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_James_Parish,_Jamaica", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saint James Parish, Jamaica"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint James Parish, Jamaica"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jamaica"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_document", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Travel document"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Preparation", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Advisories_and_Patches", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/Advisories and Patches", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hacking/Conventions", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Security/FAQs,_Help,_and_Tutorials", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Security/FAQs, Help, and Tutorials", "wgt": 9}], "image": "https://jamaica-gleaner.com/sites/default/files/styles/250px/public/media/article_images/2024/06/19/thumbnail_dsc_2959_cropped.jpg?itok=4nHuI3dv", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662373", "eventUri": "eng-9662373", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

Mitt Romney and other members of Utah's congressional delegation have been pushing to bring a passport office to Salt Lake City\n\nSalt Lake City will get a permanent passport office, Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced Tuesday.\n\nThe closest passport office to Salt Lake is currently 500 miles away in Denver, but after a concerted effort by Sen. Mitt Romney and other members of Utah's congressional delegation, an office will soon be open in Utah.\n\nRomney released a statement after the announcement saying he and his team had worked for more than three years to bring a passport agency to Utah.\n\n\"Utah is experiencing rapid population growth as it becomes a center for global commerce and tourism -- as well as home base to thousands of Latter-day Saints who embark on worldwide religious missions each year,\" Romney said. \"A passport agency in Salt Lake now means that Utahns will not have to travel such long distances to obtain in-person consular services. I could not be more thrilled with today's announcement.\"\n\nIn a statement released alongside the announcement, Blinken said six new agencies will open, including the one in Salt Lake, and that the department is issuing more passports \"than ever before.\"\n\n\"To better serve the growing number of Americans seeking U.S. passports, the Department is taking steps to establish six new passport agencies. These offices - which will open in Salt Lake City, UT; Kansas City, MO; Orlando, FL; Charlotte, NC; San Antonio, TX; and Cincinnati, OH - reflect our commitment to provide prompt customer services to more Americans closer to where they live,\" he said.\n\nUtah Gov. Spencer Cox applauded the news in a statement Tuesday.\n\n\"We're grateful to Senator Romney and the rest of our Congressional delegation for their great work in bringing a passport office to Utah,\" he said. \"We're proud of how many Utahns have international experience and language skills. Having in-person passport services will be an important improvement for Utah residents and will enhance Utah's international reach.\"\n\nRomney helped insert language into the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2024, that required the State Department to determine if they should open more passport offices closer to population centers, especially if they were more than a five-hour drive from a passport agency. Salt Lake City met those criteria.\n\nAt a passport fair he helped organize in Salt Lake City in February, Romney said his sole purpose was to \"encourage the State Department to open a passport office\" in Utah.\n\n\"We have a lot of people in Utah who do a lot of travel internationally. We have a lot of missionaries, we have a lot of families, big families. They want to go around the world and see different places,\" Romney said.\n\nThe February fair also included a visit from Assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs Rena Bitter, who said the department was researching locations around the country and would make a decision soon about where to place a new office.\n\nIn April 2023, several members of Utah's congressional delegation said because of a backlog at passport processing centers their offices were flooded with requests for help from their constituents. At the time, they asked the agency to consider opening a passport office in Utah.\n\nRomney, in a 2021 letter to Blinken, highlighted the hardships his constituents face without a passport facility.\n\n\"Today, residents throughout the Western Mountain region of the United States, including Idaho, Oregon, Montana, Nevada, Utah, and Wyoming must renew their passports by mail, or travel significant distances to neighboring states to access the nearest passport office,\" he said. \"Same day, in-person service is essentially impossible for millions of Americans in these states.\"\n\nHe also pointed out that Utah is a fast-growing state, a bustling center for global commerce and tourism. Salt Lake City is also the west-coast hub for Delta Airlines. Every year, Utah receives 250,000 passports, Romney previously said. This demand will only amplify when the 2034 Olympics comes to Utah.", "source": {"uri": "deseret.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deseret News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gitanjali_poonia@deseret.com",

Tiktok star and content creator Fran Hainingg who was due to head to Greece in the European Union for a summer break.\n\nBut after being denied boarding, she was told to get a new passport. Fran was one of many Brits to fall foul of the 10-year passport rule, which prevents Brits from entering EU countries, if their passports are more than 10 years old on the day they're travelling.\n\nPassports must also have more than three months remaining on them on the day they're due to return to the UK. She said: \"I got declined to get on the flight because my passport was two days out of date from being 10 years old.\n\nREAD MORE Foreign Office 'alters' Spain, Turkey, Greece travel advice amid 'red alert'\n\n\"We initially got turned away because we didn't have an appointment, so two days later we were heading back into London. \"Instead of waking up in sunny Greece, I was commuting with all the other 9-5 girlies.\"\n\nShe added: \"Anyway, \u00a3200 on a new passport and \u00a3100 on new flights, four days into the holiday and we got to Greece.\" The rules mean your passport must be under 10 years old on the date of departure to the EU and have three months remaining on the date of return. In the past the UK used to issues credit for \"uspent\" time when renewing passports, this meant that documents could be issued that were valid for up to 10 years and nine months.\n\nFor example a passport issued on 31 October 2012 could show an expiry date of 31 July 2023. Since we left the EU the 10 year rule has kicked in meaning this extra time won't be counded by EU border officials. The UK government stopped allowing credit for usnpent time in 2018 so passports issued after this date won't be affected.\n\nIf your passport was issued 9 years and 364 days ago, you can still enter the EU provided you would still have at least 3 months on it at the time of leaving.", "source": {"uri": "birminghammail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Birmingham Mail"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_rodger@birminghammail.co.uk", "name": "James Rodger", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Passport"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Greece"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign,_Commonwealth_and_Development_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brexit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_United_Kingdom", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of the United Kingdom"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Dating", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Dating", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Preparation", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Trade_Shows", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Trade Shows", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Cao_Dai", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Cao Dai", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 17}], "image": "https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/article29382943.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_greece.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662373", "eventUri": "eng-9662373", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2012-10-31", "textStart": 1640, "textEnd": 1655}], "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

The number of Americans with passports today is 48% - a huge increase from 1990 when it was just 5%.\n\nOffices like the one in Miami and the eventual one in Orlando are for travelers with \"urgent needs\" who are traveling internationally within 14 days. Appointments must be made to be seen at one of these offices.\n\nDetails on where the office will be in Orlando have not been released just yet.\n\nHowever, wherever it ends up in Orange County, it's a much closer drive than Miami. The next closest office is in Atlanta.\n\nWhen the six new offices open, that will bring the number of passport agencies nationwide to 35. These 35 offices are used for urgent travel needs, such as needing to travel out of the country on short notice.\n\nThat also has not been announced.\n\nNo. You can do that at one of the 7,400 public passport acceptance facilities throughout the country.\n\n\"More than 99% of Americans already live within 25 miles of an acceptance facility,\" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in an email release.\n\nIn Brevard there are 10 of these facilities.\n\nCurrent wait times for passports are four to six weeks for routine applications and two to three weeks for expedited applications.\n\nSpitzer is a Trending Reporter.

As authorities struggle with demand, many are missing out on vacation and work opportunities.\n\nIt's a fine mid-June morning in Skopje and the sun is already blazing. It is getting hot, both outside and inside, especially at the office of the Department for Administrative Affairs in the building of public broadcaster MRT, where passports are issued with the country's new name: North Macedonia.\n\n\"What did I wait half an hour for?\" asks a disappointed young woman, speaking to someone on the phone. \"I'm supposed to come back in a week. But when exactly?\" a middle-aged man says to himself as he comes down the stairs.\n\nFor some Macedonians leaving the building this morning, the wait for their new travel documents is not over. They will have to come back again. Others leave with a smile on their face and a new passport in hand, ready to head straight off on their summer vacation.\n\nSix years ago, on June 17, 2018, Greece and the then Republic of Macedonia signed the Prespa Agreement, which stipulated, among other things, that Macedonia would change its name to North Macedonia.\n\nIn accordance with the agreement, Macedonian citizens wishing to leave the country after February 12, 2024 would only be able to do so with a passport bearing the state's new name.\n\nEven though the terms of the agreement came into force with the amendment of the Macedonian Constitution in February 2019, citizens who applied for passports two years later were still getting documents with the country's old name. Passports are needed by anyone who wants to travel or work outside the country.\n\nAlthough people are still waiting in line, the crowds at the office today are much smaller than they were a few months ago when people had to wait for hours just to speak to a staff member. Telephone lines for appointments were flooded with calls.\n\nBy law, the state is required to issue documents within 15 working days or 48 hours if a passport is requested under an expedited procedure that costs \u20ac100 ($107). However, the citizens who spoke to DW said that they had been waiting two months in the standard procedure.\n\nAfter several unsuccessful attempts, Angel from Skopje got an appointment to have his photo taken for the passport at the beginning of March. \"They told me that I will receive the passport in one to two months. But two months have already passed. I asked everywhere, they couldn't find my passport. Is it made or not?\" he wondered. While waiting for his passport, he lost opportunities to work in Spain and in Germany. \"It's not a pleasant experience at all,\" he told DW.\n\nAngel feels that the entire process for issuing new documents could have started much earlier and should have included an appropriate information campaign. Since speaking to DW, Angel has finally received his passport.\n\n\"I was in a situation where I could neither plan, nor see options for leaving the country or booking tickets,\" says Arbnora Memeti, a freelance photographer from Skopje. \"I wanted to go to Italy, but I couldn't. You can't book tickets if you don't know the new passport number,\" she told DW.\n\nBut fortune smiled on her and after countless checks on the online platform to find out when her passport would be ready, she finally received a message telling her to pick it up.\n\nOthers have not been so lucky, with many taking to social media to vent their frustration at the opportunities they have missed as a result of the delays. Some have even raised the possibility of suing the state for damages suffered.\n\nThe Ministry of Internal Affairs told DW that between July 5, 2021 and May 31, 2024, 1.6 million requests for passports were received, 1.3 million for identity cards and over 680,000 for driving licenses. It also said that 3,000 to 4,000 passports are currently being issued every day.\n\nBut it's not just individuals who are feeling the negative effects of the passport crisis. This summer will also be a very difficult one for travel agencies too.\n\nThe consequences are already being felt, says Pavlina Popovski of the travel agency Atlantis. \"The first flights of the summer season were not even full because of the problem with the passports,\" she told DW.\n\nIt is usual for people to book summer flights as early as December/January to benefit from the low prices. But many Macedonian travelers have had to cancel their plans because they didn't get their passports in time. Now, prices are higher.\n\n\"If they keep waiting, they might get their passport weeks before they leave. But if they don't and they cancel, then we have to impose penalties on them, and that doesn't suit anyone, so they cancel the arrangements,\" she clarifies.\n\nSome people opted for the fast-track passport application procedure, which means an additional \u20ac400 for a family of four.\n\nPopovski is frustrated: \"The problem here is not just whether you will have a travel document/passport or not. A whole large sector is affected. Three years ago it was COVID, now it's the passports.\"\n\nMeanwhile, North Macedonia has both a new government and a new president. The previous ruling Social Democrats and their presidential candidate, Stevo Pendarovski, suffered major defeats in the elections on May 8.\n\nVoters elected the country's first female president -- Gordana Siljanovska-Davkova, a retired university professor of constitutional law and the political system -- and a new government, led by the right-wing VMRO-DPMNE.\n\nBut Macedonian-Greek relations were quickly back in the headlines again after incoming President Siljanovska-Davkova refused to say the country's new constitutional name during her inauguration.\n\nThis raised the question as to whether Greece would respond by withdrawing its support for North Macedonia's attempts to join the EU.\n\nAlthough the new government indicated that the Macedonian president will adhere to the official application of the state's constitutional name, it said that \"In her public appearances, the Macedonian president has the right to use the name Macedonia, as an act of personal right to self-determination and self-identification, respecting basic human rights and freedoms, and in accordance with European values and principles.\"", "source": {"uri": "dw.com", "dataType": "news",

Not exactly what anyone will have hoped for when voting leave.\n\nMaking sure you have everything in order is essential before heading to the airport. We've all seen the horror stories and certainly don't want to join the club.\n\nWhen it comes to your passport, Lewis and the MSE team have two questions you need to answer on the day you're entering another country:\n\nIf you said no to either question, you could be in trouble.\n\n\"Don't assume that just because your passport is valid for the duration of your stay, that everything is fine. Countries have a variety of rules about how long you need left, and how old the passport can be. Since Brexit, this includes most EU countries too,\" MSE says.\n\n\"If you fall foul of these, you could be refused entry - we've heard one story of a family's four-year-old girl being refused entry to Turkey because she had less than two months left on her passport.\"\n\nIf you are travelling to the EU, your passport needs to be less than 10 years old on the day you enter, and valid for at least three months after the day you plan to leave.\n\nThis counts for anyone travelling to any of the follow: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Republic of Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden.\n\nSome passports also have a different issue date and expiry, with the issue date taking priority over the latter. This is due to now defunct rules, which allowed Brits to carry over nine months from their old passport on to a new one.\n\nFor instance, your passport might have been issued on 1 August, 2014 and expires on 10 January, 2025, carrying over five months on top of the 10 years. In this instance, you couldn't travel to the EU in the three months leading up to 1 August 2024 due to the issue date having less than three months left until hitting the 10 year mark.\n\nNon-EU countries have different rules to the EU, ranging from needing to be valid for your stay and no other period required to needing to be valid for at least six months from the day you enter.\n\nIf you're heading outside of the EU, it is best to check well in advance in case you need to renew.", "source": {"uri": "ladbible.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LADbible"}, "authors": [],

And that's where problems can arise.\n\nAs a flight attendant, I often see people at airports getting into problems that they didn't know existed - and for some it ruins their holiday completely.\n\nThis week, in my blog for Sun Travel, I'll explain the simple passport errors that I come across regularly while at work- and how you can avoid disappointment when travelling this summer.\n\nFirstly, look after your passport, please, it's an incredibly valuable document and keeping it in good nick is much more important than you might realise.\n\nIn fact, the most common problem I see holidaymakers encountering is being refused entry to countries because of their tatty or ripped passports which some countries just will not accept.\n\nEven the slightest rip can be enough for a border official to tell you that you're not permitted to enter, regardless of how small and insignificant it may first appear.\n\nThe main place I see this happening is in South East Asia, with popular destinations like Bali, Bangkok and Singapore all high up on the list of places where people regularly get turned away.\n\nThey tend to be a bit stricter than other places, but really, if your passport isn't in good condition, anywhere has the right to refuse your entry.\n\nYou may be prevented from boarding your outbound flight, or worse, you could be turned away on arrival.\n\nThat tends to be what happens the most in these scenarios - instead of being let into the country, the tourists are simply told they cannot enter and are put back on a plane going home.\n\nSo it really is worth taking good care of your passports, otherwise you could find yourself flying home before you've set foot anywhere near a beach or sampled any of the local cuisine.\n\nIt's not the only big mistake people make though - a lot of people don't realise when their passports expire, which may seem laughable, considering the date is printed right next to your photo.\n\nBut it happens much more often than you'd realise - and people will turn up at the airport, only to be sent home.\n\nThere's absolutely no way around this, other than to get a new one.\n\nWith some people so desperate to go on their pre-booked holidays, they often end up paying extra for the express service, so that they can get a new passport in time to enjoy the rest of their break.\n\nThat also means booking new flights and could cost an absolute fortune, so it's worth keeping an eye on that expiry date and also the rules around when your passport could still stop you from flying.\n\nIf it's older than 10 years, it doesn't matter if it's expired or not, you won't be permitted to enter the EU because of their rules.\n\nNot a lot of people know about this and end up getting turned away when they arrive at the airport, so it's always worth just checking your passport and the rules well in advance of your holiday.\n\nThat way you have time to get a new one, without having to change flights or pay any extra.\n\nAlways get it ready the day before you fly. Keep it somewhere accessible, where you can easily find it, and make sure you've got it in your bag when you're on your way to the airport.\n\nIf you don't have it, you're not going on holiday - it's as simple as that.\n\nMeanwhile, this woman missed four days of her Greek holiday because of her big passport mistake.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Sun"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Passport"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sun"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caribbean"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kent"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kent"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Southeast Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bali", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bali"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bali"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Indonesia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangkok", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bangkok"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bangkok"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Thailand"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Greece"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Travelogues", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Transportation_and_Logistics/Aviation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Transportation and Logistics/Aviation", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Preparation", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Travel", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Travel", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://www.thesun.ie/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/pym8xj-family-check-in-desk-911009191.jpg?strip=all&quality=100&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662373", "eventUri": "eng-9662373", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nPersonal finance expert Martin Lewis has issued a timely reminder to all holidaymakers jetting off this summer, urging them to \"act now\" to avoid hefty extra costs and the disappointment of being turned away at the airport or falling prey to scams.\n\nThe Money Saving Expert founder has compiled a list of \"crucial\" tips that could save sun-seekers potentially hundreds of pounds. From car hire abroad to a long-overdue passport check, Martin Lewis' guidance could prevent unnecessary outlays and price hikes.\n\nWith the Euros 2024 dominating his usual BBC Radio 5 Live slot, Martin Lewis took to his podcast this week to focus on how travellers can dodge additional fees and economise on their summer getaways. He promoted the episode on social media, stating: \"Act now and you take away the risk and can make real savings\", reports the Manchester Evening News.\n\nREAD MORE: Martin Lewis issues 'money transfer' warning after popular firm 'goes bust'\n\nHe emphasised the importance of early preparation to \"slash\" holiday expenses, warning that procrastination often leads to paying more, saying: \"If you leave it to the last minute, you will usually pay more.\"\n\nPassports\n\nPassport rules have changed in recent years for lots of countries, with lots of people finding themselves turned away due to an out-of-date passport, even if they still have months before it expires.\n\nWomen who change their name after getting married and ask for a new passport are among those most likely to be affected, as this name change can often make your passport more than 10 years old. This means that, while your passport is still in date, some countries will not accept it.\n\nYour passport should have at least six months left on it before you travel. If your passport is within a year of its expiry date, or you have had it for 10 years, you should check on the passport requirements of your destination - or you could be forced to pay for a flight home.\n\nMartin Lewis said: \"You want to go and get your passport and the passport of every member of your family now. You want to open it up and you want to go and have a look at the expiry date.\n\nThe questions to ask yourself are: Will there be over six months left on my passport on the day I enter the country? If you're going to the European Union, there is only three months left.\n\n\"If that's a tick, good. Yet even if that is fine, you also need to check that your passport is less than 10 years old. This has been something new that has caught people out.\"\n\nCar hire\n\nOptional extras and insurance cover can be an easy way for the car hire company to squeeze more money out of you, with many pressuring you at the hire desk to pay more for extra cover.\n\nInstead, as Martin Lewis advises, you can just buy standalone insurance beforehand and save up to \u00a325 for every day that you are renting the vehicle. Many of these companies make a large portion of their profits up-selling various insurances, when you can buy the comprehensive cover before you even go.\n\nWith many firms charging more after the pandemic, this can cut the daily cost of your rental by as much as half. The Money Saving Expert called this his \"big tip\", saying: \"Instead of \u00a325 a day, it can just be a couple of quid a day.\"\n\nRebooking tip\n\nIf your booking for your car hire or hotel has either a no or low cancellation fee policy, Martin Lewis' money-saving tip is to constantly check for lower prices in the time before your holiday, and just cancel and rebook. This might mean still getting a last-minute offer, even on something you booked months ago.\n\nHealth insurance\n\nHaving a European or Global Health Insurance Card (EHIC/GHIC) can save you a steep hospital bill if you end up needing healthcare while on holiday, but many people try and get these at the last minute and end up getting scammed, or are forced to cough up cash when the doctor tells them their insurance is out of date.\n\n4.3 million EHICs will no longer be valid this year, so if you already have one, you should check its expiry date before you head abroad. Everyone travelling with you will need one and it could save you lots of money if someone falls ill on holiday.\n\nMartin Lewis said: \"You need to check that your EHIC, or its replacement the GHIC... so if you're going to the EU, you want to make sure that your EHIC is still valid.\" You can apply for an EHIC on the NHS website and gives you access to any state-run hospital while in the EU,\n\nMr Lewis cautioned: \"WARNING - do not Google. There are shyster sites which talk about things like fast tracks for EHICs. It's just not true, it does not exist.\n\n\"It's just a lookalike website trying to make money out of a service that is free, it will not benefit you in any way.\" This also applies to ESTA and passport fast-track services.\n\nUsing debit or credit cards\n\nGenerally, it is cheaper to get your holiday money in the UK as you can compare the exchange rates of different firms and pick the best one. But more and more people also use their credit and debit cards when travelling, though many banks add extra fees for the money you use abroad - which can add up quickly and cut into your holiday funds.\n\nBut there are banks out there that do not charge when you use your cards abroad, simply converting the cost into local currency using the exchange rate. Online banking giant Monzo and the Chase MasterCard are among the most popular options, but this choice will depend on whether you would be withdrawing cash at ATMs, or paying directly.\n\nMartin Lewis noted that you could even get \u00a3175 toward your holiday, if you're happy to switch accounts. Holidaymakers could choose to pick up a card with a switching bonus, like Santander Edge or First Direct, which also offers zero fees when spending abroad.\n\nWithdrawing cash at an ATM abroad, even with these cards, can come with a transaction fee, typically of two to seven euros.\n\nMr Lewis advised: \"If you are going to get money out of an overseas ATM, you need to make sure it's one that's got a low fee and you're doing it in as large a lump as you possibly can or feel secure with. So don't get four lots of 50 euros out, get one lot of 200 euros out, it's far better.\"", "source": {"uri": "birminghammail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Birmingham Mail"}, "authors": [{"uri": "william_morgan@birminghammail.co.uk", "name": "William Morgan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Lewis_(financial_journalist)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Martin Lewis (financial journalist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Passport"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoneySavingExpert.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "MoneySavingExpert.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Radio_5_Live", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC Radio 5 Live"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Evening_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester Evening News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire_transfer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wire transfer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Confidence trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Personal finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Renting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra_(acting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Extra (acting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastercard", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mastercard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banco_Santander", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Banco Santander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_banking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Online banking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_teller_machine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Automated teller machine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Health Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exchange rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Preparation", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Paper_Money", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Paper Money", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/news/money/article29379846.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/5_martinlewis2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662373", "eventUri": "eng-9662373", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 136, "relevance": 1}

This is because such name changes can often result in your passport being more than 10 years old.\n\nWhile it may still be valid, some countries might not accept it.\n\nIt's crucial that your passport has at least six months remaining before you travel. If your passport is nearing its expiry date within a year, or if you've had it for a decade, it's advisable to check the passport requirements of the country you're visiting.\n\nFailure to do so could result in an unexpected flight back home.\n\nMartin Lewis advised: \"You want to go and get your passport and the passport of every member of your family now. You want to open it up and you want to go and have a look at the expiry date.The questions to ask yourself are: Will there be over six months left on my passport on the day I enter the country?

Beware of optional extras and insurance cover when hiring a car. These can be a sneaky way for the car hire company to extract more money from you, with many pressuring you at the hire desk to pay more for additional cover.\n\nAs Martin Lewis suggests, purchasing standalone insurance in advance can save you up to \u00a325 per day of vehicle rental. Many car hire companies make a significant portion of their profits from upselling various insurances, but you can secure comprehensive cover before you even set off.\n\nIn the wake of increased charges post-pandemic, this strategy could halve the daily cost of your rental. The Money Saving Expert labelled this his \"big tip\", stating: \"Instead of \u00a325 a day, it can just be a couple of quid a day.\n\nRebooking Tip\n\nIf your car hire or hotel booking has a no or low cancellation fee policy, Martin Lewis advises regularly checking for lower prices leading up to your holiday. If you find a better deal, simply cancel and rebook. This could result in securing a last-minute offer on something you booked months in advance.\n\nHealth Insurance\n\nPossessing a European or Global Health Insurance Card (EHIC/GHIC) can prevent a hefty hospital bill if you require healthcare while abroad. However, many people leave it until the last minute to obtain these cards and end up being scammed, or are forced to pay out-of-pocket when informed their insurance is outdated.\n\nThis year, 4.3 million EHICs will expire, so if you have one, ensure you check its expiry date before travelling. Everyone in your party will need one, and it could save you a considerable amount of money should someone fall ill during the holiday.\n\nMartin Lewis has issued a crucial tip for travellers: \"You need to check that your EHIC, or its replacement the GHIC... so if you're going to the EU, you want to make sure that your EHIC is still valid. \" He also warned against using Google to find these services due to deceptive sites: \"WARNING - do not Google.\n\nThere are shyster sites which talk about things like fast tracks for EHICs. It's just not true, it does not exist.\n\n\"\"It's just a lookalike website trying to make money out of a service that is free, it will not benefit you in any way. \" The same caution applies to ESTA and passport fast-track services.\"\n\nUsing debit or credit cards abroad\n\nWhen it comes to spending abroad, Martin Lewis advises getting holiday money in the UK to secure the best exchange rates. However, he notes that many travellers now prefer using their debit or credit cards.\n\nWhile this can incur additional bank fees, Lewis points out that some banks, such as Monzo and the Chase MasterCard, offer fee-free transactions abroad, converting expenses into local currency at the current exchange rate. This can be particularly beneficial depending on whether you plan to withdraw cash or pay directly with your card.\n\nMartin Lewis highlighted that holidaymakers could bag themselves a \u00a3175 boost for their travels by simply switching bank accounts. He suggested considering banks like Santander Edge or First Direct, which offer not only a switching bonus but also the perk of zero fees on foreign spending.\n\nHowever, he warned that withdrawing cash from ATMs abroad can still incur charges, typically ranging from two to seven euros per transaction. Lewis's tip for savvy travellers is to minimise these fees by making fewer, larger withdrawals rather than multiple small ones. He advised: \"If you are going to get money out of an overseas ATM, you need to make sure it's one that's got a low fee and you're doing it in as large a lump as you possibly can or feel secure with. So don't get four lots of 50 euros out, get one lot of 200 euros out, it's far better.\"", "source": {"uri": "chroniclelive.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Chronicle Live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "william_morgan@chroniclelive.co.uk", "name": "William Morgan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Lewis_(financial_journalist)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Martin Lewis (financial journalist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Passport"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoneySavingExpert.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "MoneySavingExpert.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evening_Chronicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Evening Chronicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Radio_5_Live", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC Radio 5 Live"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Confidence trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Budget"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Personal finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Evening_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manchester Evening News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra_(acting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Extra (acting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastercard", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mastercard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employee_benefits", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Employee benefits"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_System_for_Travel_Authorization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electronic System for Travel Authorization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santander,_Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Santander, Spain"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santander, Spain"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_teller_machine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Automated teller machine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exchange rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debit_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Debit card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Preparation", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Publications", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://i2-prod.chroniclelive.co.uk/incoming/article29387275.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Tourists-Flock-To-The-Mallorcan-Town-Of-Magalufjfif.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662373", "eventUri": "eng-9662373", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 134, "relevance": 1}

His appearance, voice, and skin texture seemed significantly younger than the details provided in the passport. Closer observation revealed that he had dyed his hair and beard white and was wearing glasses to appear older.\n\nDue to these suspicions, he was taken to the random checking point in the departure area for a thorough search. During the inspection of his mobile phone, a soft copy of another passport in the name of Guru Sewak Singh, date of birth June 10, 2000, with passport number V4770942, was found.\n\nUpon further inquiry, the passenger admitted that his real name is Guru Sewak Singh and that he is 24 years old, travelling on a passport issued in the name of Rashvindar Singh Sahota, aged 67 years.\n\nAs the case involved a forged passport and impersonation, the passenger and his belongings was handed over to Delhi Police for legal action in the matter.\n\nThe vigilance and keen observation of the CISF personnel were crucial in intercepting the individual and preventing potential misuse of travel documents.

So as we are waiting for the permanent measures, let them [Techno Brain] come back and continue their work.

Whether you are hiring a car abroad, or simply haven't checked your family's passports in a while, Martin Lewis' advice could save some travellers hundreds in extra fees or inflated prices.\n\nWith coverage of the Euros 2024 taking over his usual slot on BBC Radio 5 Live, Mr Lewis decided to dedicate most of this week's podcast to all of the ways that people heading abroad this summer can avoid extra fees and save on their holiday. Promoting the show on social media, he said: \"Act now and you take away the risk and can make real savings\"\n\nREAD MORE: DWP clarifies rules on neighbour contact and video surveillance in benefit fraud cases\n\nMartin Lewis shared his crucial tips to \"slash\" holiday costs, reminding listeners that preparation is key, as: \"If you leave it to the last minute, you will usually pay more.\"\n\nPassport\n\nPassport rules have changed in recent years for lots of countries, with lots of people finding themselves turned away due to an out-of-date passport, even if they still have months before it expires.\n\nWomen who change their name after getting married and ask for a new passport are among those most likely to be affected, as this name change can often make your passport more than 10 years old. This means that, while your passport is still in date, some countries will not accept it.\n\nYour passport should have at least six months left on it before you travel. If your passport is within a year of its expiry date, or you have had it for 10 years, you should check on the passport requirements of your destination - or you could be forced to pay for a flight home.\n\nMartin Lewis said: \"You want to go and get your passport and the passport of every member of your family now. You want to open it up and you want to go and have a look at the expiry date.\n\nThe questions to ask yourself are: Will there be over six months left on my passport on the day I enter the country? If you're going to the European Union, there is only three months left.\n\n\"If that's a tick, good. Yet even if that is fine, you also need to check that your passport is less than 10 years old. This has been something new that has caught people out.\"\n\nCar hire\n\nOptional extras and insurance cover can be an easy way for the car hire company to squeeze more money out of you, with many pressuring you at the hire desk to pay more for extra cover.\n\nInstead, as Martin Lewis advises, you can just buy standalone insurance beforehand and save up to \u00a325 for every day that you are renting the vehicle. Many of these companies make a large portion of their profits up-selling various insurances, when you can buy the comprehensive cover before you even go.\n\nWith many firms charging more after the pandemic, this can cut the daily cost of your rental by as much as half. The Money Saving Expert called this his \"big tip\", saying: \"Instead of \u00a325 a day, it can just be a couple of quid a day.\"\n\nRebooking tip\n\nIf your booking for your car hire or hotel has either a no or low cancellation fee policy, Martin Lewis' money-saving tip is to constantly check for lower prices in the time before your holiday, and just cancel and rebook. This might mean still getting a last-minute offer, even on something you booked months ago.\n\nHealth insurance\n\nHaving a European or Global Health Insurance Card (EHIC/GHIC) can save you a steep hospital bill if you end up needing healthcare while on holiday, but many people try and get these at the last minute and end up getting scammed, or are forced to cough up cash when the doctor tells them their insurance is out of date.\n\n4.3 million EHICs will no longer be valid this year, so if you already have one, you should check its expiry date before you head abroad. Everyone travelling with you will need one and it could save you lots of money if someone falls ill on holiday.\n\nMartin Lewis said: \"You need to check that your EHIC, or its replacement the GHIC... so if you're going to the EU, you want to make sure that your EHIC is still valid.\" You can apply for an EHIC on the NHS website and gives you access to any state-run hospital while in the EU,\n\nMr Lewis cautioned: \"WARNING - do not Google. There are shyster sites which talk about things like fast tracks for EHICs. It's just not true, it does not exist.\n\n\"It's just a lookalike website trying to make money out of a service that is free, it will not benefit you in any way.\" This also applies to ESTA and passport fast-track services.\n\nUsing debit or credit cards abroad\n\nGenerally, it is cheaper to get your holiday money in the UK as you can compare the exchange rates of different firms and pick the best one. But more and more people also use their credit and debit cards when travelling, though many banks add extra fees for the money you use abroad - which can add up quickly and cut into your holiday funds.\n\nBut there are banks out there that do not charge when you use your cards abroad, simply converting the cost into local currency using the exchange rate. Online banking giant Monzo and the Chase MasterCard are among the most popular options, but this choice will depend on whether you would be withdrawing cash at ATMs, or paying directly.\n\nMartin Lewis noted that you could even get \u00a3175 toward your holiday, if you're happy to switch accounts. Holidaymakers could choose to pick up a card with a switching bonus, like Santander Edge or First Direct, which also offers zero fees when spending abroad.\n\nWithdrawing cash at an ATM abroad, even with these cards, can come with a transaction fee, typically of two to seven euros.\n\nMr Lewis advised: \"If you are going to get money out of an overseas ATM, you need to make sure it's one that's got a low fee and you're doing it in as large a lump as you possibly can or feel secure with. So don't get four lots of 50 euros out, get one lot of 200 euros out, it's far better.\"", "source": {"uri": "manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manchester Evening News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "william_morgan@manchestereveningnews.co.uk", "name": "William Morgan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Lewis_(financial_journalist)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Martin Lewis (financial journalist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Passport"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoneySavingExpert.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "MoneySavingExpert.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Radio_5_Live", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC Radio 5 Live"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-circuit_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Closed-circuit television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Personal finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_Work_and_Pensions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Department for Work and Pensions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Renting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extra_(acting)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Extra (acting)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastercard", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mastercard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banco_Santander", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Banco Santander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_banking", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Online banking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_teller_machine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Automated teller machine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Health Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exchange rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Preparation", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Insurance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Insurance", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/news/cost-of-living/article29382407.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_martin5.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662373", "eventUri": "eng-9662373", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.419607843137255, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

By then the consulate only processed the paperwork and forms had to be submitted in passport offices in the country.\n\nThankfully, that has changed now as the Zimbabwe Embassy in South Africa has started issuing passports in that country.\n\nAn estimated 2 million Zimbos live and work in South African. Amongst those are my six siblings and a dozen relatives who stand to benefit from this positive development, so cheers to that because it's not nice at all to struggle to get basic documents.\n\nI must also add that even in Zim, getting a passport is now a walk in the park, especially in smaller towns.\n\nMy husband got his in Hwange when we travelled to Victoria Falls recently. We initially thought the systems were down as there was no one being served; we were wrong. He was served in no time and after 14 days he got his passport.\n\nThis really is reason to celebrate considering how Zimbos have suffered in the past to acquire passports, kudos to the republic for this.\n\nTalking of the republic, President Emmerson Mnangagwa never ceases to hog the limelight in a bad way.\n\nA leaked voice note by controversial businessman, Wicknell Chivayo, which has been widely trending, has implicated Mnangagwa in his ill gotten wealth including millions paid for printing last year's voting material.\n\nChivayo, who now frequently attends public functions with the President, brags in the audio that he has captured the country and gets what he wants because of his connection with the top office.\n\nThe flashy businessman also reveals he has unspecified deals, (approved by the President) with the country's immigration department and the police which are raking in millions\n\nChivayo's source of wealth has always been a mystery considering his company, Intratek is only known for failing to deliver a solar power plant in Gwanda, a small town in Matabeleland South.\n\nMeanwhile, in sports news, it was a disappointing few days for the men's national football team, suffering defeats to Lesotho and South Africa to leave their World Cup hopes hanging by a thread.\n\nWith the 80, 000-seater National Sports Stadium not meeting FIFA standards, the Warriors had to play Friday's 'home' game against Lesotho at Orlando Stadium in Soweto, where they fell to a shock 2-0 loss.\n\nThis was followed by a 3-1 humbling by the South Africans on Tuesday, a result which saw us slip to the bottom of our group.\n\nThe one bright spark was the performance of 20-year-old striker, Tawanda Chirewa.\n\nThe winger, who plays for Wolverhampton Wanderers in the English Premier League, scored our only goal and won rave reviews for his impressive display.", "source": {"uri": "thevoicebw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheVoiceBW"}, "authors": [{"uri":

His U.S. passport was delivered last week, 12 weeks to the day after he was born on March 12, 2024.\n\nGreyson, who was 2 pounds, 12.6 ounces at birth, spent the first 51 days of his life in the neonatal intensive care unit of Ilha Hospital e Maternidade in Florian\u00f3polis.\n\nThe Phillipses, U.S. citizens who had not planned to have a child born in Brazil, have spent the past four months getting Greyson's documentation squared away.\n\nAmong the issues: Brazilian officials wouldn't issue Greyson a birth certificate because the Phillipses' passports, like all U.S. passports, don't list their parents' names. Without a birth certificate, U.S. officials in Brazil wouldn't issue him an American passport. Without a passport, his parents couldn't take him home to Minnesota.\n\nThe Phillipses reached out to media in Minnesota and Brazil and conducted dozens of interviews before Brazilian officials agreed to help.\n\nGreyson, who now weighs a whopping 7 1/2 pounds, now has his birth certificate, his Brazilian passport, and his Cadastro de Pessoas F\u00edsicas, or \"Registry of Individuals,\" which is like a Brazilian Social Security number, Chris Phillips said.\n\nChris and Cheri Phillips also were able to secure Greyson's U.S. passport, but until just a few weeks ago were concerned there might be an issue at immigration in S\u00e3o Paulo when they leave Brazil on Monday.\n\n\"Why? Because that (U.S.) passport has no entry stamp/visa, seeing as how he never passed through immigration to enter Brazil. (They don't issue visas to fetuses, apparently.)\" Phillips wrote in an update to friends and family. \"Even with a birth certificate and umpteen online articles and videos explaining our story, one never knows which immigration officer you'll get or what their mood will be on a particular day. So, we wanted to make sure we have his Brazilian passport to lessen the odds of anything going wrong when we do leave Brazil.\"\n\nWhen the couple got word that Greyson's Brazilian passport was ready - a full four days earlier than anticipated, Chris Phillips said he raced over to the passport office to pick it up.\n\n\"After informing the federal employee on the other side of the glass why I was there, I handed over his birth certificate and my U.S. passport,\" he wrote. \"She checked her computer then turned around to pull out a row of Brazilian passports from the wall behind her. Stoic and business-like as one would expect from any government employee, she opened his passport to verify the information. Then, upon seeing his picture with his chubby cheeks and wide-open blue eyes staring into the camera, broke into a huge smile and emitted an audible, 'awwww.' ... Unbelievable. After so much stress and strife over the preceding 12+ weeks as to how and when we'd ever get this kid's documentation in order so we could take him home to Minnesota, we obtained both his U.S. and Brazilian passports within 48 hours of each other.\"\n\nThe couple plan to fly to Sao Paulo on Sunday and then fly to Atlanta the next day. They plan to arrive at MSP International Airport at 1:55 p.m. on Tuesday.\n\nAfter four months away, the couple is looking forward to speaking English \"and not having to translate everything, everywhere, all the time,\" he said.\n\nThey also will be moving into their new house in Cambridge - a house they closed on while in Brazil. Family and friends moved all of their belongings for them.\n\nThey will miss Melory, Chris Phillips' 8-year-old daughter, who lives with her mother in Florian\u00f3polis, on an island off the country's southeast coast, but are grateful she has had so much time to bond with her half-brother -- an opportunity she otherwise would not have had if he'd been born in Minnesota in June as planned.\n\n\"She asked me the other night, 'Quando ser\u00e1 a pr\u00f3xima vez que eu vejo o fofinho?' ('When will I see the little cutie again?')\" he said.\n\nThey are hoping that that entire family can be reunited again in Brazil for her 9th birthday in February, he said.", "source": {"uri": "twincities.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Twin Cities"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mary_divine@twincities.com", "name": "Mary Divine", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Phillips", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chris Phillips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_passport", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States passport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_certificate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Birth certificate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Passport"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_passport", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brazilian passport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound_sterling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pound sterling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Citizenship of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_visa", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Travel visa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intensive care unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_document", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Identity document"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPF_number", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CPF number"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport_stamp", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Passport stamp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_number", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social Security number"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fetus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florian\u00f3polis", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florian\u00f3polis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florian\u00f3polis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S\u00e3o_Paulo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S\u00e3o Paulo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "S\u00e3o Paulo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cambridge"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cambridge"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Immigration", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Travel/Preparation", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Pregnancy_and_Birth", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Pregnancy and Birth", "wgt": 18}], "image": "https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/STP-L-GREYSON-0620_NEW_16x9.png?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662373", "eventUri": "eng-9662373", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2012-03-", "textStart": 622, "textEnd": 630}], "sentiment": 0.3333333333333333, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

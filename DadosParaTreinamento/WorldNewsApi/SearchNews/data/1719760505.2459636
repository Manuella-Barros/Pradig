AT&T is the best internet provider for most households in Reno due to its range of speeds, pricing and internet options. This includes Internet Air, Fiber and 5G. However, AT&T service isn\u2019t available everywhere in Reno, so Spectrum or locally based provider Net NV are also solid picks, depending on what\u2019s available in your area. If you're hunting for the lowest prices or the fastest speeds, we've got it. The cheapest internet in Reno is Spectrum, offering up to 300 megabits per second for $50 per month.

Other available internet providers in Reno Satellite internet: Reno residents have their pick of satellite internet providers, including Hughesnet, Viasat and Starlink. However, unless your only other option is a slower DSL plan, we wouldn't recommend it due to high fees (including steep equipment rental costs) and a two-year contract commitment. The exception might be Starlink, which offers faster speeds without the contract. However, there's a steep upfront equipment cost of nearly $600. Whoa.T-Mobile Home Internet: This major mobile carrier offers Reno's best 5G home internet service with an affordable, internet-only plan of $50 per month with no additional equipment fees or commitments. Existing customers with eligible mobile phone plans can add home internet for just $30 monthly. There is a one-time $35 activation fee, but they are currently waiving it if you order online.

If you're looking for an internet plan that can accommodate videoconferencing, streaming video or gaming, you'll have a better experience with a more robust connection. Here's an overview of the recommended minimum download speeds for various applications, according to the FCC. Note that these are only guidelines -- and that internet speed, service and performance vary by connection type, provider and address. For more information, refer to our guide on how much internet speed you really need. 0 to 5Mbps allows you to tackle the basics -- browsing the internet, sending and receiving email, streaming low-quality video.5 to 40Mbps gives you higher-quality video streaming and videoconferencing.40 to 100Mbps should give one user sufficient bandwidth to satisfy the demands of modern telecommuting, video streaming and online gaming. 100 to 500Mbps allows one to two users to simultaneously engage in high-bandwidth activities like videoconferencing, streaming and online gaming. 500 to 1,000Mbps allows three or more users to engage in high-bandwidth activities like videoconferencing, streaming and online gaming all at the same time. How CNET chose the best internet providers in Reno Internet service providers are numerous and regional. Unlike the latest smartphone, laptop, router or kitchen tool, it's impractical to personally test every internet service provider in a given city. So what's our approach? For starters, we tap into a proprietary database of pricing, availability and speed information that draws from our own historical ISP data, partner data and mapping information from the Federal Communications Commission at FCC.gov. But it doesn\u2019t end there. We go to the FCC\u2019s website to check our data and ensure we consider every ISP that provides service in an area. We also input local addresses on provider websites to find specific options for residents. We look at sources, including the American Customer Satisfaction Index and J.D. Power, to evaluate how happy customers are with an ISP's service. ISP plans and prices are subject to frequent changes; all information provided is accurate as of publication. Once we have this localized information, we ask three main questions: Does the provider offer access to reasonably fast internet speeds? Do customers get decent value for what they're paying? Are customers happy with their service? While the answer to those questions is often layered and complex, the providers who come closest to \u201cyes\u201d on all three are the ones we recommend. When selecting the cheapest internet service, we look for the plans with the lowest monthly fee, though we also factor in things like price increases, equipment fees and contracts. Choosing the fastest internet service is relatively straightforward. We look at advertised upload and download speeds and consider real-world speed data from sources like Ookla and FCC reports.

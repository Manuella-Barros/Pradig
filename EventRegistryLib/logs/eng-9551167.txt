Mizuhara, the former interpreter for Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani pleaded guilty to bank and tax fraud Wednesday, May 8, 2024, in a sports betting case where prosecutors allege he stole $16 million [...]\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) -- The former interpreter for Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani has agreed to plead guilty to bank and tax fraud in a sports betting case in which prosecutors allege he stole nearly $17 million from the Japanese baseball player to pay off debts, federal prosecutors said Wednesday.\n\nThe scandal surrounding Ippei Mizuhara shocked baseball fans from the U.S. to Japan when the news broke in March.\n\nMizuhara will plead guilty to one count of bank fraud and one count of subscribing to a false tax return, the U.S. Justice Department announced. The bank fraud charge carries a maximum of 30 years in federal prison, and the false tax return charge carries a sentence of up to three years in federal prison.\n\nThe plea agreement says Mizuhara will be required to pay Ohtani restitution that could total nearly $17 million, as well as more than $1 million to the IRS. Those amounts could change prior to sentencing.\n\nMizuhara will enter his guilty plea in the coming weeks and is set to be arraigned May 14, prosecutors said.\n\n\"The extent of this defendant's deception and theft is massive,\" United States Attorney Martin Estrada said in a statement. \"He took advantage of his position of trust to take advantage of Mr. Ohtani and fuel a dangerous gambling habit.\"\n\nMizuhara exploited his personal and professional relationship with Ohtani to plunder millions from the two-way player's account for years, at times impersonating Ohtani to bankers, prosecutors said. Mizuhara's winning bets totaled over $142 million, which he deposited in his own bank account and not Ohtani's. But his losing bets were around $183 million, a net loss of nearly $41 million. He did not wager on baseball.\n\nMizuhara helped Ohtani open a bank account in 2018 and began stealing money from that account in 2021, according to the plea agreement. At one point, Mizuhara charged the security protocols, email and phone number associated with it so that calls came directly to him, not Ohtani, when the back was trying to verify wire transfers. Mizuhara impersonated Ohtani to the bank about 24 times, according to the agreement.\n\nMizuhara also admitted to falsifying his 2022 tax returns by underreporting his income by more than $4 million.\n\nMizuhara's attorney, Michael G. Freedman, did not comment on the deal Wednesday.\n\nThere was no evidence that Ohtani was involved in or aware of Mizuhara's gambling, and the player is cooperating with investigators, authorities said.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times and ESPN broke the news of the prosecution in late March, prompting the Dodgers to fire the interpreter and MLB to open its own investigation.\n\nDodgers manager Dave Roberts said he had no comment on the plea deal Wednesday, adding, \"I just hope it is more closure on the situation.\"\n\nMLB rules prohibit players and team employees from wagering on baseball, even legally. MLB also bans betting on other sports with illegal or offshore bookmakers.\n\nMizuhara has been free on an unsecured $25,000 bond, colloquially known as a signature bond, meaning he did not have to put up any cash or collateral to be freed. If he violates the bond conditions -- which include a requirement to undergo gambling addiction treatment -- he will be on the hook for $25,000.\n\nOhtani has sought to focus on the field as the case winds through the courts. Hours after his ex-interpreter first appeared in court in April, he hit his 175th home run in MLB, tying Hideki Matsui for the most by a Japan-born player, during the Dodgers' 8-7 loss to the San Diego Padres in 11 innings.", "source": {"uri": "tribtown.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@tribtown.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ippei_Mizuhara", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ippei Mizuhara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_evasion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tax evasion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_betting", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sports betting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_prison", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal prison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bank fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodger_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dodger Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-way_player", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Two-way player"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internal Revenue Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Theft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arraignment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arraignment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Roberts_(pitcher)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dave Roberts (pitcher)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmaker_(gambling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bookmaker (gambling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hideki_Matsui", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hideki Matsui"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Problem gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/International", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/International", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://tribtown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/preview-707.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551167", "eventUri": "eng-9551167", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-14", "textStart": 1368, "textEnd": 1374}, {"amb": false, "date": "2014-12-", "textStart": 105, "textEnd": 112}], "sentiment": -0.5686274509803921, "wgt": 239, "relevance": 1}

Mizuhara's winning bets totaled over $142 million, which he deposited in his own bank account and not Ohtani's. But his losing bets were around $183 million, a net loss of nearly $41 million. He did not wager on baseball.\n\nMizuhara helped Ohtani open a bank account in 2018 and began stealing money from that account in 2021, according to the plea agreement. At one point, Mizuhara changed the security protocols, email and phone number associated with it so that calls came directly to him, not Ohtani, when the bank was trying to verify wire transfers. Mizuhara impersonated Ohtani to the bank about 24 times, according to the agreement.\n\nMizuhara also admitted to falsifying his 2022 tax returns by underreporting his income by more than $4 million.\n\nMizuhara's attorney, Michael G. Freedman, did not comment on the deal Wednesday.\n\nDodgers manager Dave Roberts said he had no comment on the plea deal Wednesday, adding, \"I just hope it is more closure on the situation.\"\n\nMLB rules prohibit players and team employees from wagering on baseball, even legally. MLB also bans betting on other sports with illegal or offshore bookmakers.\n\nMizuhara has been free on an unsecured $25,000 bond, colloquially known as a signature bond, meaning he did not have to put up any cash or collateral to be freed. If he violates the bond conditions -- which include a requirement to undergo gambling addiction treatment -- he will be on the hook for $25,000.\n\nOhtani has sought to focus on the field as the case winds through the courts.

His arraignment is scheduled for May 14, Justice Department said.\n\n\"The extent of this defendant's deception and theft is massive,\" said United States Attorney Martin Estrada. \"He took advantage of his position of trust to take advantage of Mr. Ohtani and fuel a dangerous gambling habit. My office is committed to vindicating victims throughout our community and ensuring that wrongdoers face justice.\"\n\n\"Our joint investigation with Homeland Security Investigations clearly showed Mr. Mizuhara not only stole from Mr. Ohtani, but also that he lied to the IRS about his income, \"said Special Agent in Charge Tyler Hatcher, IRS Criminal Investigation, Los Angeles Field Office.\n\n\"Mr. Mizuhara exploited his relationship with Mr. Ohtani to bankroll his own irresponsibility. In cases where we are able to identify them, we make every effort to make things right for victims, and this is one of those cases.\"\n\n\"This investigation into Mr. Mizuhara and subsequent plea highlight the threat posed by financial crimes in the Los Angeles-area,\" said HSI Los Angeles Special Agent Eddy Wang. \"The HSI-led El Camino Real Financial Crimes Task Force is dedicated to protecting all victims of financial fraud from all walks of life.\"\n\nAccording to his plea agreement also filed today, Mizuhara was the translator and de facto manager of a professional baseball player identified in court documents as \"Victim A,\" but who in fact was MLB star Shohei Ohtani.\n\nAs part of his job duties, Mizuhara regularly interacted with Ohtani's sports agents and financial advisors - who did not speak Japanese - on behalf of Ohtani, who did not speak English.\n\nAlthough Mizuhara was an employee of the Los Angeles Angels MLB team, for whom Ohtani played from 2018 to 2023, and, later, the Los Angeles Dodgers, for whom Ohtani has played since 2024, Ohtani paid him separately for the additional work of driving him to meetings and interpreting for non-baseball-related activities.\n\nIn March 2018, Mizuhara accompanied Ohtani to a bank in Phoenix to help him open a bank account to deposit his MLB salary. Inside the bank branch, Mizuhara interpreted for Ohtani when the bank employee provided Ohtani the login information for this bank account.\n\nBeginning in September 2021, Mizuhara began placing sports bets with an illegal bookmaker. Shortly thereafter, Mizuhara began to lose bets and quickly became indebted to the bookmaker. Unable to pay his gambling debts, Mizuhara orchestrated a scheme to deceive and cheat the bank to fraudulently obtain money from the account.\n\nFrom no later than November 2021 to March 2024, Mizuhara used Ohtani's password to successfully sign into the bank account and then changed the account's security protocols without Ohtani's knowledge or permission. Specifically, Mizuhara changed the registered email address and telephone number on the account so bank employees would call him - not Ohtani - when attempting to verify wire transfers from the account.\n\nIn furtherance of the scheme, Mizuhara impersonated Ohtani and used Ohtani's personal identifying information to deceive the bank's employees into authorizing wire transfers from the bank account. In total, Mizuhara called the bank and impersonated Ohtani on approximately 24 occasions.\n\nDuring this time, Mizuhara regularly logged into Ohtani's bank account and initiated wire transfers from the account to the bookmaker and his associates as payments for gambling debts.\n\nFor example, on June 20, 2023, Mizuhara accessed the account without Ohtani's permission and transferred $500,000 to one of the bookmaker's associates.", "source": {"uri": "saharareporters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sahara Reporters"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Mizuhara allegedly siphoned millions from Ohtani's bank account, to which he had direct access, to fund his sports gambling, which is illegal in California. Between December 2021 and January 2024, Mizuhara allegedly lost more than $40 million across about 19,000 individual bets, according to a criminal complaint filed in April as part of a joint investigation by the Internal Revenue Service's criminal division, the Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California.\n\nMizuhara, who had worked with Ohtani since he signed with the Angels for the 2018 MLB season, was fired a day into the 2024 MLB season after the gambling scandal broke on March 20. MLB has formally launched an investigation and Ohtani has denied that he had placed any bets or had any knowledge of Mizuhara's gambling. Prosecutors have also said that Ohtani is a victim and was not aware of the gambling or the wire transfers from his bank account.\n\nMizuhara spoke with ESPN in late March, originally claiming that Ohtani was paying off his gambling debts. He changed his story a day later, however, to say Ohtani was unaware of the payments. The reversal from Mizuhara, who was in in Seoul, South Korea, with Ohtani and the Dodgers as they opened the 2024 season, came after he addressed the Dodgers following their season-opening win against the Padres.\n\nPer ESPN, Mizuhara apologized to the team about the news and said he has a gambling addiction. The Dodgers were told Ohtani had covered his debts. But Ohtani's camp said this clubhouse meeting was the first time Ohtani learned there was money missing from his bank account. Hours later, Mizuhara changed his story to ESPN, the Dodgers fired him and Ohtani's lawyers issued a statement saying Ohtani was a victim of \"massive theft.\"\n\n\"Technically I did steal from him,\" Mizuhara allegedly said in a text to the bookmaker uncovered in court documents.\n\nMizuhara claimed to ESPN that he never bet on baseball and prosecutors in April said the same. Illegal gambling on any sport, however, violates MLB rules.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the ongoing scandal:\n\nHow did the scandal start?\n\nProsecutors allege that Mizuhara began making bets on sports in 2021, but the scandal did not become public until March 20, 2024. The bookmaker, named by the L.A. Times as Mathew Bowyer of Orange County, reportedly surfaced in a federal investigation along with Ohtani's name. The Times was investigating the matter, which caused Ohtani's lawyers to look into the situation and discover the alleged theft by Mizuhara.\n\nBowyer's home was raided by federal agents last year, the Times reported. The same prosecutors have been investigating a large gambling operation in the area, one that has even roped in former Dodgers player Yasiel Puig, though it's unclear if the two are formally related.\n\n\"In the course of responding to recent media inquiries, we discovered that Shohei has been the victim of a massive theft and we are turning the matter over to the authorities,\" a spokesperson for Berk Brettler law firm told CBS Sports in a statement on March 20.\n\nBowyer's lawyer, Bass, told CBS Sports the following: \"Mr. Bowyer had no contact with Mr. Ohtani.\"\n\nWhat was Mizuhara's side of the story?\n\nMizuhara originally, in an interview with ESPN, claimed that he had asked Ohtani to cover his gambling debts, which the outlet reported totaled at least $4.5 million. Prosecutors have since alleged the total is more than $16 million.\n\nMizuhara said that he previously had placed bets via DraftKings and assumed bets placed through Bowyer were legal.\n\n\"Obviously, he [Ohtani] wasn't happy about it and said he would help me out to make sure I never do this again,\" Mizuhara said. \"He decided to pay it off for me.\n\n\"I want everyone to know Shohei had zero involvement in betting. I want people to know I did not know this was illegal. I learned my lesson the hard way. I will never do sports betting ever again.\"\n\nThen, according to ESPN, Mizuhara changed his story, claiming instead that Ohtani \"had no knowledge of his gambling debts and that Ohtani had not transferred money to the bookmaker's associate.\"\n\nMizuhara claimed that he never gambled on baseball and instead bet on international soccer, the NBA, the NFL and college football.\n\nAs for the drastic change in Mizuhari's story, Tisha Thompson of ESPN reported the following:\n\nA source close to Ohtani gave an explanation for the changing storylines: As Ohtani's handlers tried to determine what had happened, they initially relied solely on Mizuhara, who continued to translate for Ohtani.\n\nWith Mizuhara fired, the Dodgers' manager of performance operations, Will Ireton, is now serving as Ohtani's temporary interpreter. Ireton has been interpreting for teammate Yoshinobu Yamamoto this season and previously worked with Kenta Maeda.\n\nAccording to the plea documents, Mizuhara confessed to the grift in which he regularly took money out of Ohtani's bank account to pay off his own debts. According to prosecutors, after going to a Phoenix bank with Ohtani to open a bank account, Mizuhara changed the security protocols on the account so bank employees would call him, rather than Ohtani, with any questions. Mizuhara impersonated Ohtani in calls with bank employees at least 24 times, according to the Attorney's Office. Mizuhara also denied access to Ohtani's bank account to the player's agent and financial advisors.\n\nWhat has Ohtani said?\n\nOhtani and the Dodgers were initially mum on the subject until the player gave a lengthy statement in Japanese on March 25, denying that he had placed any bets himself, asked anyone to place bets for him or worked with a bookmaker.\n\n\"Ippei has been stealing money from my account and has been telling lies,\" Ohtani said through his interpreter, Will Ireton. \"The first time I knew about Ippei's gambling was after the first game when we had the team meeting in the clubhouse.\"\n\nOhtani said repeatedly that Mizuhara had lied to both his representatives and the media when the interpreter said Ohtani had agreed to pay off his debts. He also claimed Mizuhara admitted to him that he had wired the money from Ohtani's account.\n\n\"To summarize how I'm feeling right now, I'm beyond shocked. It's really hard to verbalize how I'm feeling at this point,\" Ohtani said through Ireton's translation. \"The season's going to start and I'm going to obviously let my lawyers handle matters from here out. I am completely assisting in all investigations taking place right now.\"\n\nWhat do prosecutors allege?\n\nIn a 37-page criminal complaint filed in April, prosecutors laid out the story of a gambler racking up debts. Between December 2021 and January 2024, Mizuhara allegedly placed about 19,000 wages, averaging 25 a day. Prosecutors tallied the winnings at about $142 million and losses at about $182 million, good for a net loss of more than $40 million.\n\nAccording to the criminal complaint, Mizuhara had direct access to Ohtani's bank account and transferred the money himself. In at least two phone calls to the bank, he allegedly impersonated Ohtani, providing biographical information to secure the transfers.\n\n\"Technically I did steal from him,\" Mizuhara allegedly wrote in a message to his bookmaker after news of the scandal broke in late March, according to the criminal complaint. \"It's all over for me.\"\n\nProsecutors have stressed that Ohtani was a victim and had no knowledge of Mizuhara's actions.\n\n\"Mr. Mizuhara used and abused that position of trust to take advantage of Mr. Ohtani ... to plunder Mr. Ohtani's account to the tune of $16 million\" and to \"feed his insatiable appetite for illegal sports betting,\" U.S. Attorney Martin Estrada said at a press conference in April.\n\nThe complaint also includes digital messages allegedly between Mizuhara and the bookmaker in which the former jokes about being \"terrible at this sport betting thing\" and having \"a problem.\"\n\nMizuhara voluntarily surrendered to authorities on April 12 and was released on $25,000 bond. He is not allowed to contact Ohtani or leave the area until his next hearing.\n\n\"He is continuing to cooperate with the legal process and is hopeful that he can reach an agreement with the government to resolve this case as quickly as possible so that he can take responsibility,\" his lawyer, Michael Freedman, said in a statement to CBS Sports. \"He wishes to apologize to Mr. Ohtani, the Dodgers, Major League Baseball, and his family. As noted in court, he is also eager to seek treatment for his gambling.\"\n\nMizuhara has agreed to plead guilty, the U.S Attorney's Office for the Central District of California announced on May 8. He faces a maximum sentence of 33 years in prison, five years of supervised release and a fine of $1,250,000. He will also be required to pay full restitution to his victims, which includes $16,975,010 to Ohtani and $1,149,400 to the IRS for lying on his 2022 tax return.\n\nWhere does MLB's investigation stand?\n\nOn March 22, MLB announced an investigation is underway. Here is the league's statement:\n\n\"Major League Baseball has been gathering information since we learned about the allegations involving Shohei Ohtani and Ippei Mizuhari from the news media. Earlier today, our Department of Investigations (DOI) began their formal process investigating the matter.\"\n\nCommissioner Rob Manfred said on March 28 that he hopes it will be a \"short\" investigation, though it remains ongoing. \"We never have the kind of authority that law enforcement people have, but we manage to get these investigations done and find the facts and I'm sure we will on this one. I hope (it's) short, but I just don't know,\" Manfred said on MLB Network.\n\nAfter the criminal complaint was revealed, a spokesperson for the league said MLB will \"wait until resolution of the criminal proceeding to determine whether further investigation is warranted.\"\n\n\"We are aware of the charges filed by the U.S. Attorney's Office against Mr. Mizuhara for bank fraud after a thorough federal investigation,\" the spokesperson said in a statement on April 11. \"According to that investigation, Shohei Ohtani is considered a victim of fraud and there is no evidence that he authorized betting with an illegal bookmaker. Further, the investigation did not find any betting on baseball by Mr. Mizuhara.\"\n\nOhtani has not been placed on administrative leave or the restricted list, and he remains an active player.\n\nCould Ohtani face punishment?\n\nPer MLB policy, no employee is allowed to gamble on baseball (or softball, aka the \"diamond sports\"). They are permitted to legally gamble on other sports, as Mizuhara claimed he did, but here's the pertinent rule to this incident:\n\nAny player, umpire, or Club or League official or employee who places bets with illegal book makers, or agents for illegal book makers, shall be subject to such penalty as the Commissioner deems appropriate in light of the facts and circumstances of the conduct. Any player, umpire, or Club or League official or employee who operates or works for an illegal bookmaking business shall be subject to a minimum of a one-year suspension by the Commissioner. For purposes of this provision, an illegal bookmaker is an individual who accepts, places or handles wagers on sporting events from members of the public as part of a gaming operation that is unlawful in the jurisdiction in which the bets are accepted.\n\nWith federal investigators describing Ohtani as a victim, however, it currently seems unlikely that he would face any legal punishment.\n\nWho is Ippei Mizuhara?\n\nMizuhara had worked with Ohtani since he joined the Los Angeles Angels as a free agent in December 2017. For more on Ohtani's now-former interpreter, here are some details.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_snyder@cbssports.com",

guilty over $17 mn fraud: US Justice Dept", "body": "Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani (right) and former interpreter Ippei Mizuhara, who is to plead guilty to stealing nearly $17 million from the baseball ace\n\nShohei Ohtani's former interpreter has agreed to plead guilty over charges of illegally transferring nearly $17 million from the baseball star's bank account in order to pay off gambling debts, the United States Justice Department said Wednesday.\n\nIppei Mizuhara, 39, will plead guilty to one count of bank fraud -- punishable by up to 30 years in prison -- and one count of filing a false tax return, which carries a maximum sentence of three years, the Justice Department said.\n\nFederal prosecutors have said Mizuhara -- Ohtani's long-time friend and confidant -- plundered millions from the Los Angeles Dodgers ace's bank account to fund an \"insatiable appetite\" for gambling.\n\nMizuhara is expected to formally enter his guilty plea in the coming weeks, with arraignment scheduled to take place in Los Angeles on May 14.\n\n\"The extent of this defendant's deception and theft is massive,\" United States Attorney Martin Estrada said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\n\"He took advantage of his position of trust to take advantage of Mr Ohtani and fuel a dangerous gambling habit,\" Estrada added.\n\nJapanese sensation Ohtani, currently the biggest star in baseball, joined the Dodgers last December in a record-breaking $700 million deal -- the richest contract in North American sports history.\n\nTyler Hatcher, special agent in charge from the Internal Revenue Service's criminal investigation unit, said the probe had revealed Mizuhara \"not only stole from Mr Ohtani, but also that he lied to the IRS about his income.\"\n\n\"Mr Mizuhara exploited his relationship with Mr Ohtani to bankroll his own irresponsibility,\" Hatcher said in a statement.\n\nMizuhara's guilty plea had been expected.\n\nAfter an initial court appearance last month, his lawyer said he wished to apologize to \"Ohtani, the Dodgers, and Major League Baseball\" for his actions and sought a swift resolution so he can \"take responsibility.\"\n\n- Massive losses -\n\nThe revelations surrounding Mizuhara erupted as the new baseball season got under way in March, stunning the sports world and potentially embroiling Ohtani in scandal.\n\nProsecutors have repeatedly emphasized that Ohtani was an innocent victim of Mizuhara's deception, and that there was no evidence to suggest the Dodgers star was aware of or involved in illegal gambling.\n\nA criminal complaint released by prosecutors last month detailed a staggering volume of bets placed by Mizuhara, who exploited the language barrier to keep Ohtani, his financial advisors and management team in the dark about his crimes.\n\nThe complaint revealed that between December 2021 and January 2024, Mizuhara placed approximately 19,000 bets ranging in value from $10 to $160,000 at an average of around $12,800 per bet.\n\nDuring that period, Mizuhara had winning bets worth $142.3 million, and losing bets of $182.9 million -- leaving him with losses of roughly $40.7 million.\n\nThe complaint detailed that contact information on Ohtani's bank account was later changed to link it to Mizuhara's phone number and to an anonymous email address connected to Mizuhara.\n\nMizuhara also would allegedly falsely identify himself as Ohtani to trick bank employees into authorizing wire transfers.\n\nBank recordings of telephone calls captured Mizuhara impersonating Ohtani as he sought to make wire transfers.\n\nMajor League Baseball's gambling policy bars \"any player, umpire, or club or league official or employee\" from betting on baseball or making illegal bets on any other sport.\n\nPlayers found guilty of betting on a game they were involved in are subject to life bans, with one-year suspensions if they are found to have gambled on games they are not directly involved in.\n\nOhtani is a rarity in baseball in that he combines elite-level pitching and hitting ability, making him a generational talent who has been portrayed as a modern-day version of Babe Ruth.\n\nThose skills and his clean-cut image have made him the global face of baseball.\n\nOhtani is currently leading baseball's key hitting rankings, with an MLB-leading average of .358 as well as an MLB-best 11 home runs.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ippei_Mizuhara",

Arraignment is scheduled for May 14.\n\nNBCLA has reached out to representatives for Mizuhara and Ohtani for comment.\n\nProsecutors accused Mizuhara of placing a staggering number of bets using money stolen from a long-time friend and one of the world's most popular and well-paid athletes to support a \"voracious appetite\" for sports betting. The allegations against the Orange County man were outlined in a lengthy criminal complaint in support of federal bank fraud charge.\n\nHe is accused of stealing $16 million from the baseball star's account to pay illegal sports wagering debts.\n\nA day after the federal charges were announced in April, Mizuhara apologized to Ohtani in a statement made through his attorney. Attorney Michael G. Freedman issued the statement, saying Mizuhara hopes to \"reach an agreement with the government to resolve this case as quickly as possible so that he can take responsibility.\" He further added Mizuhara \"wishes to apologize to Mr. Ohtani, the Dodgers, Major League Baseball, and his family.\"\n\nAccording to the criminal complaint filed in the gambling scandal, Mizuhara placed about 19,000 wagers between December 2021 and January 2024 with nearly 25 bets per day on average. The wagers ranged in value from roughly $10 to $160,000 per bet, with an average bet amount of roughly $12,800.\n\nMizuhara's winning bets totaled more than $142,256,000 and losing bets about $182,935,000. Total losses amounted to more than $40,679,000, the affidavit said.\n\nThe complaint, written by an IRS senior special agent, cites wire transfers, text messages, phone records and interviews. In a text message to a bookmaker, Mizuhara admitted that he was stealing the money from Ohtani's account, prosecutors said. The investigation into Mizuhara was part of a larger probe involving illegal gambling operations.\n\nProsecutors have said there is no evidence Ohtani authorized the transfers from his account and characterized the baseball superstar as a victim in the case. Ohtani reportedly has been assisting authorities with the investigation.\n\nThe records do not indicate any bets on baseball.\n\nThe scandal broke in mid-March after Mizuhara was fired for an alleged theft from Ohtani's bank accounts to cover illegal gambling losses. Those gambling debts were to an illegal bookmaker in Orange County who was under IRS investigation.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, Mizuhara accompanied Ohtani to a bank branch in Arizona when they opened the account in 2018, with Mizuhara translating for Ohtani to set up the account. Ohtani's salary was deposited into the account, prosecutors said, and he never gave Mizuhara control of the account or any of his other financial accounts, according to the affidavit.\n\nInvestigators believe Ohtani's earnings from endorsement deals and investments went to a different account.\n\nMizuhara later identified himself as Ohtani in communications with the bank, which allowed him to lift an online banking suspension on the account.\n\nMizuhara began gambling with an illegal sportsbook in 2021, according to prosecutors. Months later, he started losing \"substantial\" amounts of money and, at about the same time, contact information on Ohtani's bank account was changed to link it to Mizuhara's phone number and an anonymous email, prosecutors said.\n\nMizuhara told ESPN on March 19 that Ohtani paid his gambling debts at the interpreter's request, saying the bets were on international soccer, the NBA, the NFL and college football. But the following day, ESPN said Mizuhara dramatically changed his story, claiming Ohtani had no knowledge of the gambling debts and had not transferred any money to bookmakers.\n\nOhtani and his attorneys have maintained that he was completely unaware of the \"massive theft\" until the news came to light last month when the Dodgers were opening the season in South Korea against the San Diego Padres.\n\nMajor League Baseball launched its own investigation concurrent to the federal one by the IRS.\n\nOhtani has been playing throughout the investigation.", "source": {"uri": "nbcmiami.com",

Prosecutors allege that Mizuhara stole more than $16 million from Ohtani to cover gambling bets and debts. (Bill Robles via AP)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) -- The former interpreter for Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani has agreed to plead guilty to bank and tax fraud in a sports betting case where prosecutors allege he stole $16 million from the Japanese baseball player to pay off debts, federal prosecutors said Wednesday.\n\nThe scandal surrounding Ippei Mizuhara shocked baseball fans from the U.S. to Japan when the news broke in March.\n\nMizuhara will plead guilty to one count of bank fraud and one count of subscribing to a false tax return, the U.S. Justice Department announced. The bank fraud charge carries a maximum of 30 years in federal prison, and the false tax return charge carries a sentence of up to three years in federal prison.\n\nMizuhara will enter his guilty plea in the coming weeks and is set to be arraigned May 14, prosecutors said.\n\n\"The extent of this defendant's deception and theft is massive,\" United States Attorney Martin Estrada said in a statement. \"He took advantage of his position of trust to take advantage of Mr. Ohtani and fuel a dangerous gambling habit.\"\n\nMizuhara exploited his personal and professional relationship with Ohtani to plunder millions from the two-way player's account for years, at times impersonating Ohtani to bankers, prosecutors said. Mizuhara's winning bets totaled over $142 million, which he deposited in his own bank account and not Ohtani's. But his losing bets were around $183 million, a net loss of nearly $41 million. He did not wager on baseball.\n\nThere was no evidence that Ohtani was involved in or aware of Mizuhara's gambling, and the player is cooperating with investigators, authorities said.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times and ESPN broke the news of the prosecution in late March, prompting the Dodgers to fire the interpreter and MLB to open its own investigation.\n\nMLB rules prohibit players and team employees from wagering on baseball, even legally. MLB also bans betting on other sports with illegal or offshore bookmakers.\n\nMizuhara has been free on an unsecured $25,000 bond, colloquially known as a signature bond, meaning he did not have to put up any cash or collateral to be freed. If he violates the bond conditions -- which include a requirement to undergo gambling addiction treatment -- he will be on the hook for $25,000.\n\nOhtani has sought to focus on the field as the case winds through the courts. Hours after his ex-interpreter first appeared in court in April, he hit his 175th home run in MLB, tying Hideki Matsui for the most by a Japan-born player, during the Dodgers' 8-7 loss to the San Diego Padres in 11 innings.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

His arraignment is scheduled for May 14.\n\n\"The extent of this defendant's deception and theft is massive,\" said United States Attorney Martin Estrada. \"He took advantage of his position of trust to take advantage of Mr. Ohtani and fuel a dangerous gambling habit. My office is committed to vindicating victims throughout our community and ensuring that wrongdoers face justice.\"\n\n\"Our joint investigation with Homeland Security Investigations clearly showed Mr. Mizuhara not only stole from Mr. Ohtani, but also that he lied to the IRS about his income, \"said Special Agent in Charge Tyler Hatcher, IRS Criminal Investigation, Los Angeles Field Office. \"Mr. Mizuhara exploited his relationship with Mr. Ohtani to bankroll his own irresponsibility. In cases where we are able to identify them, we make every effort to make things right for victims, and this is one of those cases.\"\n\n\"This investigation into Mr. Mizuhara and subsequent plea highlight the threat posed by financial crimes in the Los Angeles-area,\" said HSI Los Angeles Special Agent Eddy Wang. \"The HSI-led El Camino Real Financial Crimes Task Force is dedicated to protecting all victims of financial fraud from all walks of life.\"\n\nAccording to his plea agreement also filed today, Mizuhara was the translator and de facto manager of a professional baseball player identified in court documents as \"Victim A,\" but who in fact was MLB star Shohei Ohtani. As part of his job duties, Mizuhara regularly interacted with Ohtani's sports agents and financial advisors - who did not speak Japanese - on behalf of Ohtani, who did not speak English. Although Mizuhara was an employee of the Los Angeles Angels MLB team, for whom Ohtani played from 2018 to 2023, and, later, the Los Angeles Dodgers, for whom Ohtani has played since 2024, Ohtani paid him separately for the additional work of driving him to meetings and interpreting for non-baseball-related activities.\n\nIn March 2018, Mizuhara accompanied Ohtani to a bank in Phoenix to help him open a bank account to deposit his MLB salary. Inside the bank branch, Mizuhara interpreted for Ohtani when the bank employee provided Ohtani the login information for this bank account.\n\nBeginning in September 2021, Mizuhara began placing sports bets with an illegal bookmaker. Shortly thereafter, Mizuhara began to lose bets and quickly became indebted to the bookmaker. Unable to pay his gambling debts, Mizuhara orchestrated a scheme to deceive and cheat the bank to fraudulently obtain money from the account.\n\nFrom no later than November 2021 to March 2024, Mizuhara used Ohtani's password to successfully sign into the bank account and then changed the account's security protocols without Ohtani's knowledge or permission. Specifically, Mizuhara changed the registered email address and telephone number on the account so bank employees would call him - not Ohtani - when attempting to verify wire transfers from the account.\n\nIn furtherance of the scheme, Mizuhara impersonated Ohtani and used Ohtani's personal identifying information to deceive the bank's employees into authorizing wire transfers from the bank account. In total, Mizuhara called the bank and impersonated Ohtani on approximately 24 occasions.\n\nDuring this time, Mizuhara regularly logged into Ohtani's bank account and initiated wire transfers from the account to the bookmaker and his associates as payments for gambling debts. For example, on June 20, 2023, Mizuhara accessed the account without Ohtani's permission and transferred $500,000 to one of the bookmaker's associates.\n\nIn addition, in September 2023, Mizuhara needed $60,000 worth of dental work and Ohtani agreed to pay for it via a check drawn on a business account at a different bank. However, Mizuhara provided his dentist Ohtani's debit card number for the bank account Ohtani had opened in Phoenix, charged $60,000 to that account, then deposited the $60,000 check into Mizuhara's personal bank account.\n\nFrom January 2024 to March 2024, Mizuhara purchased approximately $325,000 worth of baseball cards from online resellers such as eBay from Ohtani's bank account with the intent to resell them later and for his own personal benefit.\n\nWhen Ohtani's sports agent and financial advisors asked Mizuhara for access to the bank account, Mizuhara lied and said Ohtani did not want them to access the account because it was private. In fact, Mizuhara did not want them to know that he had been stealing from Ohtani and had fraudulently obtained more than $16,975,010 from him.\n\nMizuhara also admitted in his plea agreement that in February 2024 he willfully made and subscribed to a false individual federal income tax return for the tax year 2022. On that tax return, Mizuhara falsely claimed that his total taxable income for that year was $136,865 when in fact he knew the amount was substantially higher and he knowingly failed to report additional income of $4.1 million. The source of the unreported income was from his scheme to defraud the bank.\n\nMizuhara, under penalty of perjury, signed the false income tax return and admitted in his plea agreement that he owes approximately $1,149,400 in additional taxes for the tax year 2022, plus additional interest and penalties.\n\nIRS Criminal Investigation and Homeland Security Investigations are investigating this matter.\n\nAssistant United States Attorneys Jeff Mitchell of the Major Frauds Section and Dan Boyle of the Environmental Crimes and Consumer Protection Section, and Special Assistant United States Attorney Rachel N. Agress are prosecuting this case.", "source": {"uri": "independent.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Santa Barbara Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Those amounts could change prior to sentencing.\n\nMizuhara will enter his guilty plea in the coming weeks and is set to be arraigned May 14, prosecutors said.\n\n\"The extent of this defendant's deception and theft is massive,\" United States Attorney Martin Estrada said in a statement. \"He took advantage of his position of trust to take advantage of Mr. Ohtani and fuel a dangerous gambling habit.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMizuhara exploited his personal and professional relationship with Ohtani to plunder millions from the two-way player's account for years, at times impersonating Ohtani to bankers, prosecutors said. Mizuhara's winning bets totaled over $142 million, which he deposited in his own bank account and not Ohtani's. But his losing bets were around $183 million, a net loss of nearly $41 million. He did not wager on baseball.\n\nMizuhara helped Ohtani open a bank account in 2018 and began stealing money from that account in 2021, according to the plea agreement. At one point, Mizuhara changed the security protocols, email and phone number associated with it so that calls came directly to him, not Ohtani, when the bank was trying to verify wire transfers. Mizuhara impersonated Ohtani to the bank about 24 times, according to the agreement.\n\nMizuhara also admitted to falsifying his 2022 tax returns by underreporting his income by more than $4 million.\n\nMizuhara's attorney, Michael G. Freedman, did not comment on the deal Wednesday.\n\nThere was no evidence that Ohtani was involved in or aware of Mizuhara's gambling, and the player is cooperating with investigators, authorities said.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times and ESPN broke the news of the prosecution in late March, prompting the Dodgers to fire the interpreter and MLB to open its own investigation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDodgers Manager Dave Roberts said he had no comment on the plea deal Wednesday, adding, \"I just hope it is more closure on the situation.\"\n\nMLB rules prohibit players and team employees from wagering on baseball, even legally. MLB also bans betting on other sports with illegal or offshore bookmakers.\n\nMizuhara has been free on an unsecured $25,000 bond, colloquially known as a signature bond, meaning he did not have to put up any cash or collateral to be freed. If he violates the bond conditions - which include a requirement to undergo gambling addiction treatment - he will be on the hook for $25,000.\n\nOhtani has sought to focus on the field as the case winds through the courts. Hours after his ex-interpreter first appeared in court in April, he hit his 175th home run in MLB, tying Hideki Matsui for the most by a Japan-born player, during the Dodgers' 8-7 loss to the San Diego Padres in 11 innings.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

Mizuhara was expected to enter the plea in the coming weeks. Arraignment is scheduled for May 14.\n\n\"The extent of this defendant's deception and theft is massive,\" said United States Attorney Martin Estrada. \"He took advantage of his position of trust to take advantage of Mr. Ohtani and fuel a dangerous gambling habit. My office is committed to vindicating victims throughout our community and ensuring that wrongdoers face justice.\"\n\nNBCLA has reached out to representatives for Mizuhara and Ohtani for comment.\n\nProsecutors accused Mizuhara of placing a staggering number of bets using money stolen from a long-time friend and one of the world's most popular and well-paid athletes to support a \"voracious appetite\" for sports betting. The allegations against the Orange County man were outlined in a lengthy criminal complaint in support of federal bank fraud charge.\n\nHe is accused of stealing $16 million from the baseball star's account to pay illegal sports wagering debts.\n\nA day after the federal charges were announced in April, Mizuhara apologized to Ohtani in a statement made through his attorney. Attorney Michael G. Freedman issued the statement, saying Mizuhara hopes to \"reach an agreement with the government to resolve this case as quickly as possible so that he can take responsibility.\" He further added Mizuhara \"wishes to apologize to Mr. Ohtani, the Dodgers, Major League Baseball, and his family.\"\n\nAccording to the criminal complaint filed in the gambling scandal, Mizuhara placed about 19,000 wagers between December 2021 and January 2024 with nearly 25 bets per day on average. The wagers ranged in value from roughly $10 to $160,000 per bet, with an average bet amount of roughly $12,800.\n\nMizuhara's winning bets totaled more than $142,256,000 and losing bets about $182,935,000. Total losses amounted to more than $40,679,000, the affidavit said.\n\nThe complaint, written by an IRS senior special agent, cites wire transfers, text messages, phone records and interviews. In a text message to a bookmaker, Mizuhara admitted that he was stealing the money from Ohtani's account, prosecutors said. The investigation into Mizuhara was part of a larger probe involving illegal gambling operations.\n\nProsecutors have said there is no evidence Ohtani authorized the transfers from his account and characterized the baseball superstar as a victim in the case. Ohtani reportedly has been assisting authorities with the investigation.\n\nThe records do not indicate any bets on baseball.\n\nThe scandal broke in mid-March after Mizuhara was fired for an alleged theft from Ohtani's bank accounts to cover illegal gambling losses. Those gambling debts were to an illegal bookmaker in Orange County who was under IRS investigation.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, Mizuhara accompanied Ohtani to a bank branch in Arizona when they opened the account in 2018, with Mizuhara translating for Ohtani to set up the account. Ohtani's salary was deposited into the account, prosecutors said, and he never gave Mizuhara control of the account or any of his other financial accounts, according to the affidavit.\n\nInvestigators believe Ohtani's earnings from endorsement deals and investments went to a different account.\n\nMizuhara later identified himself as Ohtani in communications with the bank, which allowed him to lift an online banking suspension on the account.\n\nMizuhara began gambling with an illegal sportsbook in 2021, according to prosecutors. Months later, he started losing \"substantial\" amounts of money and, at about the same time, contact information on Ohtani's bank account was changed to link it to Mizuhara's phone number and an anonymous email, prosecutors said.\n\nMizuhara told ESPN on March 19 that Ohtani paid his gambling debts at the interpreter's request, saying the bets were on international soccer, the NBA, the NFL and college football. But the following day, ESPN said Mizuhara dramatically changed his story, claiming Ohtani had no knowledge of the gambling debts and had not transferred any money to bookmakers.\n\nOhtani and his attorneys have maintained that he was completely unaware of the \"massive theft\" until the news came to light last month when the Dodgers were opening the season in South Korea against the San Diego Padres.\n\nMajor League Baseball launched its own investigation concurrent to the federal one by the IRS.\n\nOhtani has been playing throughout the investigation.", "source": {"uri": "necn.com",

Ohtani's legal team described the star as a \"victim of massive theft.\"\n\nThe Dodgers fired Mizuhara in the wake of the scandal and hired a new interpreter for Ohtani.\n\nAfter weeks of investigation, the gambling saga is reaching its pinnacle. Mizuhara agreed Wednesday to plead guilty to federal charges, and he is expected to enter the guilty plea in the coming weeks, ESPN reported.\n\nThe Sporting News details the charges against Mizuhara and what this means for Ohtani.\n\nMORE: Shohei Ohtani was 'shocked' by Ippei Mizuhara's gambling scandal\n\nMizuhara agreed to plead guilty to federal charges of felony bank fraud and submitting a false tax return.\n\nThe former interpreter, who turned himself into authorities last month, would have faced up to 33 years in federal prison if his case had gone to trial. Instead, he will face a judge to determine the length of his sentence, though the sentencing date has not been set.\n\nIn exchange for his guilty plea, prosecutors will recommend a reduced sentence.\n\nMizuhara lost more than $40 million in bets and stole nearly $17 million from Ohtani. He allegedly made 19,000 bets from from December 2021 to January 2024.\n\nMizuhara was charged with bank fraud because he \"impersonated Ohtani and later changed information in order to start funneling money from the account.\" He also was charged with submitting a false tax return, which means Mizuhara kept his winnings and losses secret from the government.\n\nMORE: Shohei Ohtani, Ippei Mizuhara relationship and gambling timelime\n\nThe timetable for Mizuhara's sentence is unknown, though as a result of his plea agreement, he should not face the maximum.\n\nFelony bank fraud can carry a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison, while submitting false tax returns can mean up to three years. That would be a total of 33 years behind bars. But because Mizuhara has agreed to plead guilty, prosecutors will recommend a reduced sentence.\n\nThe court proceedings are expected to begin next Tuesday, though no sentencing date has been set.\n\nOhtani won't be suspended for Mizuhara's actions, as the investigation proved Ohtani was not involved in providing funds to Mizuhara.\n\nThe Japanese baseball star will avoid punishment and continue his terrific start to the season in the Dodgers blue.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_interpretation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Language interpretation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ippei_Mizuhara", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ippei Mizuhara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmaker_(gambling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bookmaker (gambling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_betting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports betting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Theft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sporting_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Sporting News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://ng-sportingnews.com/s3/files/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-05/GettyImages-2092456554.jpg?itok=jng89vBE", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551167", "eventUri": "eng-9551167", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2784313725490196, "wgt": 225, "relevance": 1}

Arraignment is scheduled for May 14.\n\nNBCLA has reached out to representatives for Mizuhara and Ohtani for comment.\n\nProsecutors accused Mizuhara of placing a staggering number of bets using money stolen from a long-time friend and one of the world's most popular and well-paid athletes to support a \"voracious appetite\" for sports betting. The allegations against the Orange County man were outlined in a lengthy criminal complaint in support of federal bank fraud charge.\n\nHe is accused of stealing $16 million from the baseball star's account to pay illegal sports wagering debts.\n\nAccording to the criminal complaint filed in the gambling scandal, Mizuhara placed about 19,000 wagers between December 2021 and January 2024 with nearly 25 bets per day on average. The wagers ranged in value from roughly $10 to $160,000 per bet, with an average bet amount of roughly $12,800.\n\nMizuhara's winning bets totaled more than $142,256,000 and losing bets about $182,935,000. Total losses amounted to more than $40,679,000, the affidavit said.\n\nThe complaint, written by an IRS senior special agent, cites wire transfers, text messages, phone records and interviews. In a text message to a bookmaker, Mizuhara admitted that he was stealing the money from Ohtani's account, prosecutors said. The investigation into Mizuhara was part of a larger probe involving illegal gambling operations.\n\nProsecutors have said there is no evidence Ohtani authorized the transfers from his account and characterized the baseball superstar as a victim in the case. Ohtani reportedly has been assisting authorities with the investigation.\n\nThe records do not indicate any bets on baseball.\n\nThe scandal broke in mid-March after Mizuhara was fired for an alleged theft from Ohtani's bank accounts to cover illegal gambling losses. Those gambling debts were to an illegal bookmaker in Orange County who was under IRS investigation.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, Mizuhara accompanied Ohtani to a bank branch in Arizona when they opened the account in 2018, with Mizuhara translating for Ohtani to set up the account. Ohtani's salary was deposited into the account, prosecutors said, and he never gave Mizuhara control of the account or any of his other financial accounts, according to the affidavit.\n\nInvestigators believe Ohtani's earnings from endorsement deals and investments went to a different account.\n\nMizuhara later identified himself as Ohtani in communications with the bank, which allowed him to lift an online banking suspension on the account.\n\nMizuhara began gambling with an illegal sportsbook in 2021, according to prosecutors. Months later, he started losing \"substantial\" amounts of money and, at about the same time, contact information on Ohtani's bank account was changed to link it to Mizuhara's phone number and an anonymous email, prosecutors said.\n\nMizuhara told ESPN on March 19 that Ohtani paid his gambling debts at the interpreter's request, saying the bets were on international soccer, the NBA, the NFL and college football. But the following day, ESPN said Mizuhara dramatically changed his story, claiming Ohtani had no knowledge of the gambling debts and had not transferred any money to bookmakers.\n\nOhtani and his attorneys have maintained that he was completely unaware of the \"massive theft\" until the news came to light last month when the Dodgers were opening the season in South Korea against the San Diego Padres.\n\nMajor League Baseball launched its own investigation concurrent to the federal one by the IRS.\n\nOhtani has been playing throughout the investigation.", "source": {"uri":

According to the criminal complaint, Mizuhara was with Ohtani when he went to Phoenix, Arizona in 2018. The two were in the Grand Canyon State so Ohtani could establish a bank account after he arrived in the U.S. to play for the MLB and deposit his salary. Mizuhara translated for the bank employees, who didn't speak Japanese, and Ohtani, who didn't speak English. Mizuhara was there when the bank gave Ohtani his login credentials for the bank account.\n\nPREVIOUS COVERAGE: Shohei Ohtani's interpreter Ippei Mizuhara fired by Dodgers amid allegations of 'massive theft'\n\nThat's when federal investigators said Mizuhara started placing illegal sports bets with an Orange County bookmaker and losing a lot. According to the criminal complaint, Mizuhara averaged 25 bets per day for two years, accumulating more than $40 million in debt.\n\nThat's when the Justice Department alleges that Mizuhara accessed Ohtani's bank account, changed the login credentials and the associated email address and phone number, and started making payments to his bookmaker from that account. Mizuhara did all this without Ohtani's knowledge.\n\nOver the next few years, Mizuhara is accused of using Ohtani's money to pay for several things, including dental work and baseball cards.\n\nThe complaint also alleges that Ohtani's agent and financial advisors asked Mizuhara at one point for access to that Phoenix bank account. However, Mizuhara lied and told them that Ohtani wanted to keep the account private.\n\nThe guilty plea seems to give credence to what Ohtani has maintained since the story broke in March -- that he did not know Mizuhara's access to his bank accounts or his illegal bets. Mizuhara originally claimed to ESPN that Ohtani knew about the payments to the bookmaker but said that the payments were for someone else. He later recanted this story.\n\nThe Dodgers fired Mizuhara on March 20 after the gambling allegations surfaced. Days later Ohtani, through a new translator, addressed the scandal for the first time, saying he was \"just beyond shocked\" by his former friend's betrayal. Ohtani also claimed that he first learned about the theft after the Dodgers' first game in South Korea, when Mizuhara told the team about his gambling addiction.\n\nMizuhara is expected to enter his guilty plea at an arraignment next week.", "source": {"uri": "foxla.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 11 Los Angeles"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

In cases where we are able to identify them, we make every effort to make things right for victims, and this is one of those cases.\"\n\n\"This investigation into Mr. Mizuhara and subsequent plea highlight the threat posed by financial crimes in the Los Angeles-area,\" said HSI Los Angeles Special Agent Eddy Wang. \"The HSI-led El Camino Real Financial Crimes Task Force is dedicated to protecting all victims of financial fraud from all walks of life.\"\n\nAccording to his plea agreement also filed today, Mizuhara was the translator and de facto manager of a professional baseball player identified in court documents as \"Victim A,\" but who in fact was MLB star Shohei Ohtani. As part of his job duties, Mizuhara regularly interacted with Ohtani's sports agents and financial advisors - who did not speak Japanese - on behalf of Ohtani, who did not speak English. Although Mizuhara was an employee of the Los Angeles Angels MLB team, for whom Ohtani played from 2018 to 2023, and, later, the Los Angeles Dodgers, for whom Ohtani has played since 2024, Ohtani paid him separately for the additional work of driving him to meetings and interpreting for non-baseball-related activities.\n\nIn March 2018, Mizuhara accompanied Ohtani to a bank in Phoenix to help him open a bank account to deposit his MLB salary. Inside the bank branch, Mizuhara interpreted for Ohtani when the bank employee provided Ohtani the login information for this bank account.\n\nBeginning in September 2021, Mizuhara began placing sports bets with an illegal bookmaker. Shortly thereafter, Mizuhara began to lose bets and quickly became indebted to the bookmaker. Unable to pay his gambling debts, Mizuhara orchestrated a scheme to deceive and cheat the bank to fraudulently obtain money from the account.\n\nFrom no later than November 2021 to March 2024, Mizuhara used Ohtani's password to successfully sign into the bank account and then changed the account's security protocols without Ohtani's knowledge or permission. Specifically, Mizuhara changed the registered email address and telephone number on the account so bank employees would call him - not Ohtani - when attempting to verify wire transfers from the account.\n\nIn furtherance of the scheme, Mizuhara impersonated Ohtani and used Ohtani's personal identifying information to deceive the bank's employees into authorizing wire transfers from the bank account. In total, Mizuhara called the bank and impersonated Ohtani on approximately 24 occasions.\n\nDuring this time, Mizuhara regularly logged into Ohtani's bank account and initiated wire transfers from the account to the bookmaker and his associates as payments for gambling debts. For example, on June 20, 2023, Mizuhara accessed the account without Ohtani's permission and transferred $500,000 to one of the bookmaker's associates.\n\nIn addition, in September 2023, Mizuhara needed $60,000 worth of dental work and Ohtani agreed to pay for it via a check drawn on a business account at a different bank. However, Mizuhara provided his dentist Ohtani's debit card number for the bank account Ohtani had opened in Phoenix, charged $60,000 to that account, then deposited the $60,000 check into Mizuhara's personal bank account.\n\nFrom January 2024 to March 2024, Mizuhara purchased approximately $325,000 worth of baseball cards from online resellers such as eBay from Ohtani's bank account with the intent to resell them later and for his own personal benefit.\n\nWhen Ohtani's sports agent and financial advisors asked Mizuhara for access to the bank account, Mizuhara lied and said Ohtani did not want them to access the account because it was private. In fact, Mizuhara did not want them to know that he had been stealing from Ohtani and had fraudulently obtained more than $16,975,010 from him.\n\nMizuhara also admitted in his plea agreement that in February 2024 he willfully made and subscribed to a false individual federal income tax return for the tax year 2022. On that tax return, Mizuhara falsely claimed that his total taxable income for that year was $136,865 when in fact he knew the amount was substantially higher and he knowingly failed to report additional income of $4.1 million. The source of the unreported income was from his scheme to defraud the bank.\n\nMizuhara, under penalty of perjury, signed the false income tax return and admitted in his plea agreement that he owes approximately $1,149,400 in additional taxes for the tax year 2022, plus additional interest and penalties.\n\nIRS Criminal Investigation and Homeland Security Investigations are investigating this matter.\n\nAssistant United States Attorneys Jeff Mitchell of the Major Frauds Section and Dan Boyle of the Environmental Crimes and Consumer Protection Section, and Special Assistant United States Attorney Rachel N.

Mizuhara will also plead guilty to one count of subscribing to a false tax return, which carries a sentence of up to three years.\n\nHe is expected to enter a guilty plea 'in the coming weeks,' with his arraignment scheduled for May 14.\n\nThe scandal surrounding Mizuhara shocked baseball fans from the U.S. to Japan when the news broke in March. Mizuhara exploited his personal and professional relationship with Ohtani to plunder millions from the two-way player's account for years, at times impersonating Ohtani to bankers, prosecutors said.\n\nMizuhara's winning bets totaled over $142M, which he deposited in his own bank account and not Ohtani's. But his losing bets were around $183M, a net loss of nearly $41M. He did not wager on baseball.\n\nIppei Mizuhara (L) agreed to plead guilty to federal criminal charges for illegally transferring $17 million from Shohei Ohtani's bank account without the player's knowledge or permission\n\nMizuhara is facing a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison. He has been free on a $25k bond\n\nMizuhara helped Ohtani open a bank account in 2018 and began stealing money from that account in 2021, according to the plea agreement. At one point, Mizuhara charged the security protocols, email and phone number associated with it so that calls came directly to him, not Ohtani, when the back was trying to verify wire transfers.\n\nThere was no evidence that Ohtani was involved in or aware of Mizuhara's gambling, and the player is cooperating with investigators, authorities said.\n\nAfter news of the prosecution broke in late March, the Dodgers proceeded to fire the interpreter, while MLB opened its own investigation.\n\nMLB rules prohibit players and team employees from wagering on baseball, even legally. MLB also bans betting on other sports with illegal or offshore bookmakers.\n\nOhtani has stayed focus on the field while Mizuhara's case carried on, as he hit his 17th run in MLB against the Padres last month, tying Hideki Matsui for most HRs by a Japan-born player\n\nDodgers manager Dave Roberts said he had no comment on the plea deal on Wed., adding, 'I just hope it is more closure on the situation.'\n\nMizuhara has been free on an unsecured $25,000 bond, colloquially known as a signature bond, meaning he did not have to put up any cash or collateral to be freed.\n\nIf he violates bond conditions - which include a requirement to undergo gambling addiction treatment - he will be on the hook for $25k.\n\nOhtani has sought to focus on the field as the case winds through the courts. Hours after his ex-interpreter first appeared in court in April, he hit his 175th home run in MLB, tying Hideki Matsui for the most by a Japan-born player, during the Dodgers' 8-7 loss to the San Diego Padres in 11 innings.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bank fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ippei_Mizuhara", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ippei Mizuhara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-way_player", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Two-way player"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_Central_District_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States District Court for the Central District of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Roberts_(pitcher)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dave Roberts (pitcher)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmaker_(gambling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bookmaker (gambling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hideki_Matsui", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hideki Matsui"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Problem gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/05/08/21/84423887-0-image-m-146_1715200769303.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551167", "eventUri": "eng-9551167", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-14", "textStart": 533, "textEnd": 539}], "sentiment": -0.4588235294117647, "wgt": 222, "relevance": 1}

His arraignment is scheduled for Tuesday in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.\n\nA sentencing date has not been set. The total maximum sentence Mizuhara could receive for both crimes would be 33 years imprisonment and fines of $1.25 million, but in exchange for his plea -- outlined in the agreement released Wednesday -- prosecutors would recommend a reduced sentence.\n\nThe plea agreement says Mizuhara will be required to pay full restitution, or $16,975,010, to Ohtani.\n\nA spokesperson for Ohtani declined to comment, as did the Dodgers.\n\nFederal authorities filed the complaint against Mizuhara on April 11, just three weeks after an ESPN investigation detailing wire transfers of $500,000 from Ohtani's bank account to the bookmaking operation. Mizuhara initially told ESPN that Ohtani had sent the money to help him pay his debts but later changed his story to say Ohtani had no knowledge of his gambling or the wire transfers. Ohtani's attorneys alleged the slugger had been the victim of a \"massive theft.\"\n\n\"The extent of this defendant's deception and theft is massive,\" United States Attorney Martin Estrada said in a news release. \"He took advantage of his position of trust to take advantage of Mr. Ohtani and fuel a dangerous gambling habit.\"\n\nAlso in the statement, IRS Criminal Investigation Special Agent in Charge Tyler Hatcher said, \"Mr. Mizuhara exploited his relationship with Mr. Ohtani to bankroll his own irresponsibility.\"\n\nThe documents filed Wednesday further detailed a relationship of trust in which Ohtani, who does not speak English, relied on his Japanese interpreter to help him with everything from answering questions at news conferences and transacting with financial advisers and sports agents to opening bank accounts.\n\nMizuhara began placing bets with an illegal bookmaker in September 2021, and as his losses quickly mounted, he began to exploit his access to Ohtani's financial accounts to pay off his debts.\n\nThe agreement detailed Mizuhara's transfers of Ohtani's money to the bookmaker's associates as one $40,010 transfer in November 2021, one $300,000 transfer in February 2022, 36 transfers totaling $15 million from February 2022 to October 2023, and three transfers totaling $1.25 million from December 2023 through January 2024.\n\nMizuhara took many steps to deceive Ohtani, including changing contact information on the baseball player's bank accounts so communication would come to Mizuhara. He even impersonated Ohtani on the phone with calls to the bank, which he did at least 24 times, according to the plea agreement.\n\nIn one such attempt, on Feb. 2, 2022, Mizuhara called a representative of a bank -- referred to as Bank A -- for help getting a wire transfer for what Mizuhara said was a \"car loan\" and verified the transaction with a six-digit code sent via text message, which went to Mizuhara's phone as he had already changed the information on the account.\n\nIn September 2023, Mizuhara told Ohtani he needed $60,000 for dental work, which Ohtani arranged to give him via a check drawn from a business account. However, Mizuhara pocketed that money and instead used Ohtani's debit card to pay the $60,000 dental bill.\n\nThe agreement also states that Mizuhara filed a false tax return for tax year 2022, noting multiple inaccuracies such as failing to report $4.1 million, according to the plea agreement. For that, he owes an additional $1.15 million in taxes.", "source": {"uri": "espn.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ippei_Mizuhara", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ippei Mizuhara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gannett", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gannett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmaker_(gambling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bookmaker (gambling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_Central_District_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States District Court for the Central District of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DuPont", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DuPont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsbook", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sportsbook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire_transfer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wire transfer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Theft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arraignment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arraignment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Special agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_return_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tax return (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deception", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internal Revenue Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0412%2Fr1317958_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551167", "eventUri": "eng-9551167", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-11", "textStart": 1229, "textEnd": 1237}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 222, "relevance": 1}

His arraignment is scheduled for May 14.\n\nThe scale of the defendants' deception and theft is enormous, said U.S. Attorney Martin Estrada. He used his position of trust to take advantage of Mr. Ohtani and fuel a dangerous gambling habit. My office is committed to standing up for victims throughout our community and ensuring that perpetrators are brought to justice.\n\nOur joint investigation with Homeland Security Investigations clearly showed that Mr. Mizuhara not only stole from Mr. Ohtani, but also lied to the IRS about his income, said Special Agent in Charge Tyler Hatcher, IRS Criminal Investigation, Los Angeles Field Office. Mr. Mizuhara exploited his relationship with Mr. Ohtani to finance his own irresponsibility. In cases where we are able to identify them, we do everything we can to make things right for the victims, and this is one of those cases.\n\nThis investigation of Mr. Mizuhara and the subsequent plea highlight the threat posed by financial crimes in the Los Angeles area, said HSI Los Angeles Special Agent Eddy Wang. The El Camino Real Financial Crimes Task Force led by HSI is dedicated to protecting all victims of financial fraud from all walks of life.\n\nAccording to his plea agreement also filed today, Mizuhara was the translator and de facto manager of a professional baseball player identified in court documents as Victim A, but who was actually MLB star Shohei Ohtani. As part of his duties, Mizuhara regularly interacted with Ohtani's sports agents and financial advisors who did not speak Japanese on behalf of Ohtani, who did not speak English. Although Mizuhara was an employee of the Los Angeles Angels MLB team, for whom Ohtani played from 2018 to 2023, and, later, the Los Angeles Dodgers, for whom Ohtani played since 2024, Ohtani paid him separately for additional driving work. meetings and interpretation for non-baseball activities.\n\nIn March 2018, Mizuhara accompanied Ohtani to a Phoenix bank to help him open a bank account to deposit his MLB salary. Inside the bank branch, Mizuhara interpreted for Ohtani when the bank employee provided Ohtani with the login information for that bank account.\n\nStarting in September 2021, Mizuhara began placing sports bets with an illegal bookmaker. Soon after, Mizuhara began losing bets and quickly fell into debt with the bookmaker. Unable to pay his gambling debts, Mizuhara orchestrated a scheme to deceive and deceive the bank in order to fraudulently obtain money from the account.\n\nNo later than November 2021 to March 2024, Mizuhara used Ohtani's password to successfully log into the bank account and then changed the account's security protocols without Ohtani's knowledge or permission. Specifically, Mizuhara changed the email address and phone number registered to the account so that bank employees would not call Ohtani when attempting to verify wire transfers from the account.\n\nAs part of this scheme, Mizuhara posed as Ohtani and used Ohtani's personal identifying information to deceive bank employees into authorizing wire transfers from the bank account. In total, Mizuhara called the bank and posed as Ohtani approximately 24 times.\n\nDuring this time, Mizuhara regularly logged into Ohtani's bank account and initiated wire transfers from the account to the bookmaker and its associates as payment for gambling debts. For example, on June 20, 2023, Mizuhara accessed the account without Ohtani's permission and transferred $500,000 to one of the bookmaker's associates.\n\nAdditionally, in September 2023, Mizuhara needed $60,000 in dental work and Ohtani agreed to pay for it via a check drawn on a business account at another bank. However, Mizuhara provided his dentist Ohtani's debit card number for the bank account Ohtani had opened in Phoenix, charged $60,000 to that account, and then deposited the $60,000 check into the personal bank account by Mizuhara.\n\nFrom January 2024 to March 2024, Mizuhara purchased approximately $325,000 worth of baseball cards from online retailers such as eBay from Ohtani's bank account with the intention of reselling them later and for his own personal benefit .\n\nWhen Ohtani's sports agent and financial advisors asked Mizuhara for access to the bank account, Mizuhara lied and said Ohtani did not want them to access the account because it was private. In fact, Mizuhara didn't want them to know that he had stolen from Ohtani and fraudulently obtained over $16,975,010 from him.\n\nMizuhara also admitted in his plea agreement that in February 2024, he intentionally made and subscribed to a false federal individual income tax return for the 2022 tax year. In that tax return, Mizuhara falsely claimed that his total taxable income for that year was $136,865 when in fact he knew the amount was significantly higher and he knowingly failed to report an additional $4.1 million in income. The source of the unreported income was from his scheme to defraud the bank.\n\nMizuhara, under penalty of perjury, signed the false tax return and admitted in his plea agreement that he owed approximately $1,149,400 in additional taxes for the 2022 tax year, plus additional interest and penalties.\n\nIRS Criminal Investigations and Homeland Security are investigating this matter.\n\nAssistant United States Attorneys Jeff Mitchell of the Major Fraud Section and Dan Boyle of the Environmental Crimes and Consumer Protection Section, along with Special Assistant United States Attorney Rachel N. Agress , are continuing this matter.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors":

He faces a maximum sentence of 33 years in prison, five years of supervised release and a fine of $1,250,000.\n\nMizuhara will be required to pay full restitution to his victims, which includes $16,975,010 to Victim A, Ohtani, and $1,149,400 to the IRS.\n\n\"The extent of this defendant's deception and theft is massive,\" United States Attorney Martin Estrada said in a statement Wednesday. \"He took advantage of his position of trust to take advantage of Mr. Ohtani and fuel a dangerous gambling habit. My office is committed to vindicating victims throughout our community and ensuring that wrongdoers face justice.\"\n\nSpecial Agent in Charge Tyler Hatcher, IRS Criminal Investigation, Los Angeles Field Office said in a statement that Mizuhara \"exploited his relationship with Mr. Ohtani to bankroll his own irresponsibility.\"\n\nNews of the fraud that entangled Ohtani broke back in March, and in the ensuing weeks we learned that Ohtani was the victim. Mizuhara racked up tens of millions of dollars in gambling debts to an illegal bookmaker and was funneling the money through casinos. He had been illicitly making withdrawals from Ohtani's bank accounts, including by impersonating Ohtani on the phone with the bank, and having had access to all pertinent passwords and codes.\n\nMore, from the press release on Wednesday:\n\nAs part of his job duties, Mizuhara regularly interacted with Ohtani's sports agents and financial advisors - who did not speak Japanese - on behalf of Ohtani, who did not speak English. Although Mizuhara was an employee of the Los Angeles Angels MLB team, for whom Ohtani played from 2018 to 2023, and, later, the Los Angeles Dodgers, for whom Ohtani has played since 2024, Ohtani paid him separately for the additional work of driving him to meetings and interpreting for non-baseball-related activities.\n\nMizuhara's gambling activities appeared to start in September 2021 and continued through March 2024. According to prosecutors, after going to a Phoenix bank with Ohtani to open a bank account, Mizuhara changed the security protocols on the account so bank employees would call him, rather than Ohtani, with any questions. Mizuhara impersonated Ohtani in calls with bank employees at least 24 times, according to the Attorney's Office.\n\n\"When Ohtani's sports agent and financial advisors asked Mizuhara for access to the bank account, Mizuhara lied and said Ohtani did not want them to access the account because it was private,\" the DOJ said in a press release. \"In fact, Mizuhara did not want them to know that he had been stealing from Ohtani and had fraudulently obtained more than $16,975,010 from him.\"\n\nAs well as the millions siphoned out of Ohtani's account to pay off gambling debt, Mizuhara also bought $325,000 worth of baseball cards on eBay and other online resellers in order to flip them and profit himself. In September 2023, Ohtani agreed to pay for Mizuhara's $60,000 dental work and provided him with a check. Instead, according to prosecutors, Mizuhara paid the bill with Ohtani's debit card and deposited the check into his personal account.\n\nAn attorney representing Mizuhara did not immediately return a

Mizuhara allegedly stole nearly $17 million from Ohtani to cover up his, Mizuhara's, illegal gambling losses, which totaled more than $40 million.\n\nMizuhara agreed to plead guilty to two charges, bank fraud and subscribing to a false tax return, on Wednesday. The first charge carries a maximum sentence of up to 30 years in federal prison, and the second could add up to three years.\n\nMizuhara is expected to enter his guilty plea officially next week.\n\nMizuhara turned himself in to authorities officially last month after he was accused of stealing millions from Ohtani. He allegedly made 19,000 wagers with an alleged illegal bookie between December 2021 and January 2024, which averages out to about 25 bets per day. In total, Mizuhara ended up losing more than $40.5 million.\n\nMizuhara was Ohtani's financial point person since the star moved to the United States in 2018. He reportedly helped him set up a bank account, and then impersonated him and later changed information in order to start funneling money from it. Ohtani's agent reportedly only talked to him through Mizuhara, too.\n\nMizuhara reportedly transferred the weekly $500,000 payments into an account of an associate of Matthew Boyer, who is also under federal investigation. That associate then transferred the money into accounts with Resorts World, a Las Vegas casino, and Pechanga Resort Casino in Temecula, California. The scandal is reportedly part of a much larger operation, in which 12 people have already been charged and convicted and multiple casinos have paid fines.\n\nThe associate in question, according to ESPN, was Ryan Boyajian, who is a cast member of \"The Real Housewives of Orange County.\" Scott Sibella, who is the former president of Resorts World and MGM Grand, is set to be sentenced in federal court in Los Angeles on Wednesday, too, after he pleaded guilty in connection with another sports gambling charge.\n\nOhtani has denied knowing anything about the scandal ahead of time, too, and said he learned about it when everyone else did. Major League Baseball has released a statement recognizing that authorities see Ohtani as a victim, too. Ohtani is playing with the Dodgers normally this season in the wake of the scandal.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ippei_Mizuhara", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ippei Mizuhara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmaker_(gambling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bookmaker (gambling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casino", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Casino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MGM_Grand_Las_Vegas", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MGM Grand Las Vegas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Real_Housewives_of_Orange_County", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Real Housewives of Orange County"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_betting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sports betting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temecula,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Temecula, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Temecula, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Unsolved", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/6xZkccUjqN8TkUn1JjD3bQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-03/3b2d81c0-e7e1-11ee-9fff-7841f66ecac1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551167", "eventUri": "eng-9551167", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.5372549019607843, "wgt": 222, "relevance": 1}

His arraignment is scheduled for Tuesday in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.\n\nA sentencing date has not been set. The total maximum sentence Mizuhara could receive for both crimes would be 33 years imprisonment and fines of $1.25 million, but in exchange for his plea -- outlined in the agreement released Wednesday -- prosecutors would recommend a reduced sentence.\n\nA spokesperson for Ohtani declined to comment, as did the Dodgers.\n\nFederal authorities filed the complaint against Mizuhara on April 11, just three weeks after an ESPN investigation detailing wire transfers of $500,000 from Ohtani's bank account to the bookmaking operation. Mizuhara initially told ESPN Ohtani had sent the money to help him pay his debts but later changed his story to say Ohtani had no knowledge of his gambling or the wire transfers. Ohtani's attorneys alleged the slugger had been the victim of a \"massive theft.\"\n\n\"The extent of this defendant's deception and theft is massive,\" said United States Attorney Martin Estrada in a press release. \"He took advantage of his position of trust to take advantage of Mr. Ohtani and fuel a dangerous gambling habit.\"\n\nAlso in the statement, IRS Criminal Investigation Special Agent in Charge Tyler Hatcher said, \"Mr. Mizuhara exploited his relationship with Mr. Ohtani to bankroll his own irresponsibility.\"\n\nThe documents filed Wednesday further detailed a relationship of trust in which Ohtani, who did not speak English, relied on his Japanese translator to help him with everything from answering questions at press conferences, transacting with financial advisors and sports agents, and opening bank accounts.\n\nMizuhara began placing bets with an illegal bookmaker in September 2021, and as his losses quickly mounted, he began to exploit his access to Ohtani's financial accounts to pay off his debts.\n\nMizuhara took many steps to deceive Ohtani, including changing contact information on the baseball player's bank accounts so communication would come to Mizuhara. He even impersonated Ohtani on the phone with calls to the bank, which he did at least 24 times, according to the plea agreement.\n\nIn one such attempt, on Feb. 2, 2022, Mizuhara called a representative of a bank -- referred to as Bank A -- for help getting a wire transfer for what Mizuhara said was a \"car loan\" and verified the transaction with a six-digit code sent via text message, which went to Mizuhara's phone as he had already changed the information on the account.\n\nIn September 2023, Mizuhara told Ohtani he needed $60,000 for dental work, which Ohtani arranged to give him via a check drawn from a business account. However, Mizuhara pocketed that money and instead used Ohtani's debit card to pay the $60,000 dental bill.\n\nThe agreement also states that Mizuhara filed a false tax return for tax year 2022, noting multiple inaccuracies such as failing to report $4.1 million, according to the plea agreement. For that, he owes an additional $1.15 million in taxes.", "source": {"uri": "espn.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ippei_Mizuhara", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ippei Mizuhara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gannett", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gannett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmaker_(gambling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bookmaker (gambling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_Central_District_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States District Court for the Central District of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DuPont", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DuPont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsbook", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sportsbook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire_transfer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wire transfer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Theft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arraignment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arraignment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Special agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_return_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tax return (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deception", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internal Revenue Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sports agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment_Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment Associations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0412%2Fr1317958_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551167", "eventUri": "eng-9551167", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-11", "textStart": 1126, "textEnd": 1134}], "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 221, "relevance": 1}

Mizuhara faces up to 33 years in federal prison for the two crimes, which authorities allege he committed as part of a scheme to surreptitiously steal more than $17 million from Ohtani to pay off an Orange County bookmaker.\n\nThe blockbuster March revelation that the Dodgers had fired Mizuhara amid an investigation into claims he had stolen Ohtani's money and gambled on sports shocked the sports world. Last month, federal authorities cleared Ohtani of wrongdoing, quieting widespread speculation about the potential fallout of the scandal for his baseball career and potential criminal charges.\n\nMizuhara has not yet formally entered a plea, according to Ciaran McEvoy, a spokesman for the DOJ. McEvoy said Wednesday he expects Mizuhara to \"plead guilty in the coming weeks.\"\n\n\"The extent of this defendant's deception and theft is massive,\" U.S. Attorney Martin Estrada said in a news release. \"He took advantage of his position of trust to take advantage of Mr. Ohtani and fuel a dangerous gambling habit. My office is committed to vindicating victims throughout our community and ensuring that wrongdoers face justice.\"\n\nMizuhara, a Newport Beach resident, served as a go-between between Ohtani and his non-Japanese-speaking agents and financial advisors, according to the plea agreement released Thursday.\n\nDocuments filed with the agreement say Mizuhara obtained the login details for Ohtani's bank account in 2018, when he translated for the baseball phenom as he set up an account at a bank branch in Phoenix. Mizuhara started making illegal bets with the Orange County bookie in September 2021, quickly going deeply into debt, according to the court records.\n\n\"Shortly thereafter, Mizuhara began to lose bets and quickly became indebted to the bookmaker. Unable to pay his gambling debts, Mizuhara orchestrated a scheme to deceive and cheat the bank to fraudulently obtain money from the account,\" according to the news release.\n\nWithout telling Ohtani, prosecutors said, Mizuhara proceeded to change the email address and phone number on file for Ohtani's bank account, which meant bank employees would contact Mizuhara about wire transfers from the account. He allegedly impersonated Ohtani about two dozen times.\n\nThe interpreter made a number of sizable wire transfers, prosecutors said, including one for $500,000 to an associate of the bookmaker. The scheme continued through this year; prosecutors said that Mizuhara used Ohtani's money to purchase about $325,000 worth of baseball cards between January and March, hoping to later sell them for profit.\n\nIn his plea agreement, Mizuhara admitted that he also tried to fool the IRS, filing a false income tax return for 2022 in which he claimed that he only netted around $137,000 of taxable income that year -- a fraction of his actual earnings.\n\n\"[H]e knowingly failed to report additional income of $4.1 million,\" the release stated. \"The source of the unreported income was from his scheme to defraud the bank.\"\n\nIn September 2023, prosecutors said, Mizuhara even stole from Ohtani after the player agreed to pay for costly dental work.\n\nMizuhara needed $60,000 worth of work done on his teeth, prosecutors said, and Ohtani approved payment for the procedure from a business account. But rather than use the allotted funds, Mizhuara deposited the money in his personal bank account and paid his dentist from the Ohtani account he secretly controlled.", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmaker_(gambling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bookmaker (gambling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ippei_Mizuhara", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ippei Mizuhara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_return_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tax return (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japanese language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_prison", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal prison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_County,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orange County, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orange County, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newport_Beach,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Newport Beach, California"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire_transfer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wire transfer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_account", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank account"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deception", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Theft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dentistry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internal Revenue Service"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Employment", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Employment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://resources.arcamax.com/newspics/288/28853/2885393.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551167", "eventUri": "eng-9551167", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 221, "relevance": 1}

"Ohtani interpreter to plead guilty over $17 mn fraud: US Justice Dept", "body": "Shohei Ohtani's former interpreter has agreed to plead guilty over charges of illegally transferring nearly $17 million from the baseball star's bank account in order to pay off gambling debts, the United States Justice Department said Wednesday.\n\nIppei Mizuhara, 39, will plead guilty to one count of bank fraud -- punishable by up to 30 years in prison -- and one count of filing a false tax return, which carries a maximum sentence of three years, the Justice Department said.\n\nFederal prosecutors have said Mizuhara -- Ohtani's long-time friend and confidant -- plundered millions from the Los Angeles Dodgers ace's bank account to fund an \"insatiable appetite\" for gambling.\n\nMizuhara is expected to formally enter his guilty plea in the coming weeks, with arraignment scheduled to take place in Los Angeles on May 14.\n\n\"The extent of this defendant's deception and theft is massive,\" United States Attorney Martin Estrada said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\n\"He took advantage of his position of trust to take advantage of Mr Ohtani and fuel a dangerous gambling habit,\" Estrada added.\n\nJapanese sensation Ohtani, currently the biggest star in baseball, joined the Dodgers last December in a record-breaking $700 million deal -- the richest contract in North American sports history.\n\nTyler Hatcher, special agent in charge from the Internal Revenue Service's criminal investigation unit, said the probe had revealed Mizuhara \"not only stole from Mr Ohtani, but also that he lied to the IRS about his income.\"\n\n\"Mr Mizuhara exploited his relationship with Mr Ohtani to bankroll his own irresponsibility,\" Hatcher said in a statement.\n\nMizuhara's guilty plea had been expected.\n\nAfter an initial court appearance last month, his lawyer said he wished to apologize to \"Ohtani, the Dodgers, and Major League Baseball\" for his actions and sought a swift resolution so he can \"take responsibility.\"\n\n- Massive losses -\n\nThe revelations surrounding Mizuhara erupted as the new baseball season got under way in March, stunning the sports world and potentially embroiling Ohtani in scandal.\n\nProsecutors have repeatedly emphasized that Ohtani was an innocent victim of Mizuhara's deception, and that there was no evidence to suggest the Dodgers star was aware of or involved in illegal gambling.\n\nA criminal complaint released by prosecutors last month detailed a staggering volume of bets placed by Mizuhara, who exploited the language barrier to keep Ohtani, his financial advisors and management team in the dark about his crimes.\n\nThe complaint revealed that between December 2021 and January 2024, Mizuhara placed approximately 19,000 bets ranging in value from $10 to $160,000 at an average of around $12,800 per bet.\n\nDuring that period, Mizuhara had winning bets worth $142.3 million, and losing bets of $182.9 million -- leaving him with losses of roughly $40.7 million.\n\nThe complaint detailed that contact information on Ohtani's bank account was later changed to link it to Mizuhara's phone number and to an anonymous email address connected to Mizuhara.\n\nMizuhara also would allegedly falsely identify himself as Ohtani to trick bank employees into authorizing wire transfers.\n\nBank recordings of telephone calls captured Mizuhara impersonating Ohtani as he sought to make wire transfers.\n\nMajor League Baseball's gambling policy bars \"any player, umpire, or club or league official or employee\" from betting on baseball or making illegal bets on any other sport.\n\nPlayers found guilty of betting on a game they were involved in are subject to life bans, with one-year suspensions if they are found to have gambled on games they are not directly involved in.\n\nOhtani is a rarity in baseball in that he combines elite-level pitching and hitting ability, making him a generational talent who has been portrayed as a modern-day version of Babe Ruth.\n\nThose skills and his clean-cut image have made him the global face of baseball.\n\nOhtani is currently leading baseball's key hitting rankings, with an MLB-leading average of .358 as well as an MLB-best 11 home runs.\n\nrcw/bb", "source": {"uri": "ktbs.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KTBS"}, "authors": [{"uri":

He is expected to enter a plea in the coming weeks, with an arraignment scheduled for May 14, the DOJ said.\n\n\"The extent of this defendant's deception and theft is massive,\" U.S. Attorney Martin Estrada said in a statement. \"He took advantage of his position of trust to take advantage of Mr. Ohtani and fuel a dangerous gambling habit. My office is committed to vindicating victims throughout our community and ensuring that wrongdoers face justice.\"\n\nAccording to the plea agreement, Mizuhara helped Ohtani, who does not speak English, set up a bank account in Phoenix in 2018, during which he interpreted the login information for the player's account. In September 2021, Mizuhara started placing sports bets with an illegal bookmaker to whom he quickly became indebted, according to the plea agreement.\n\n\"Unable to pay his gambling debts, Mizuhara orchestrated a scheme to deceive and cheat the bank to fraudulently obtain money from the account,\" the DOJ said in a release.\n\nMizuhara accessed Ohtani's bank account and updated security information so bank employees would contact him, not Ohtani, when attempting to verify wire transfers from the account, according to the plea agreement. He also impersonated Ohtani on 24 occasions in calls to the bank, according to the agreement.\n\nFrom November 2021 to March 2024, Mizuhara transferred nearly $17 million from the account to associates of the bookmaker in more than 40 wires without Ohtani's permission, according to the plea agreement.\n\nMizuhara also admitted in the plea agreement to falsely claiming that his total taxable income for 2022 was $136,865 when, in fact, he failed to report an additional $4.1 million in income.\n\n\"The source of the unreported income was from his scheme to defraud the bank,\" the DOJ said, noting that he owes approximately $1,149,400 in additional taxes for the tax year 2022, plus additional interest and penalties.\n\nEstrada previously stressed that Ohtani is a victim in the case and has cooperated \"fully and completely\" in the investigation.\n\nThe Dodgers announced they had fired the Japanese interpreter on March 20, after the gambling controversy surfaced. The team did not provide a specific reason for Mizuhara's termination.\n\nMizuhara was charged in the matter last month. Following his initial appearance in federal court on April 12, his attorney, Michael Freedman, said in a statement to ABC News that Mizuhara is \"continuing to cooperate with the legal process and is hopeful that he can reach an agreement with the government to resolve this case as quickly as possible so that he can take responsibility.\"\n\n\"He wishes to apologize to Mr. Ohtani, the Dodgers, Major League Baseball, and his family,\" the statement continued. \"As noted in court, he is also eager to seek treatment for his gambling.\"\n\nOhtani addressed the scandal for the first time on March 25 during a press conference.

He did not wager on baseball.\n\nThere was no evidence that Ohtani was involved in or aware of Mizuhara's gambling, and the player is cooperating with investigators, authorities said.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times and ESPN broke the news of the prosecution in late March, prompting the Dodgers to fire the interpreter and MLB to open its own investigation.\n\nMLB rules prohibit players and team employees from wagering on baseball, even legally. MLB also bans betting on other sports with illegal or offshore bookmakers.\n\nMizuhara has been free on an unsecured $25,000 bond, colloquially known as a signature bond, meaning he did not have to put up any cash or collateral to be freed. If he violates the bond conditions -- which include a requirement to undergo gambling addiction treatment -- he will be on the hook for $25,000.\n\nOhtani has sought to focus on the field as the case winds through the courts. Hours after his ex-interpreter first appeared in court in April, he hit his 175th home run in MLB, tying Hideki Matsui for the most by a Japan-born player, during the Dodgers' 8-7 loss to the San Diego Padres in 11 innings.\n\nThe Associated Press", "source": {"uri": "sudbury.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sudbury.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "canadian_press@sudbury.com", "name": "Canadian Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ippei_Mizuhara", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ippei Mizuhara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_prison", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal prison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bank fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_evasion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tax evasion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_betting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports betting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-way_player", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Two-way player"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Theft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmaker_(gambling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bookmaker (gambling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hideki_Matsui", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hideki Matsui"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Problem gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Times"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/International", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/International", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://www.vmcdn.ca/files/sudbury/images/logos/logo_sudbury_186x40.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551167", "eventUri": "eng-9551167", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-14", "textStart": 801, "textEnd": 807}], "sentiment": -0.388235294117647, "wgt": 220, "relevance": 1}

His arraignment is scheduled for May 14. Mizuhara's attorney, Michael Freedman, said that he had no comment at this time. Spokesmen for the Dodgers and for Ohtani also declined comment.\n\nMizuhara will plead guilty to one count of bank fraud carrying a maximum sentence of 30 years, and one count of submitting a false tax return, which carries a maximum sentence of three years.\n\nThe plea agreement states that it is expected that Mizuhara will almost certainly be deported to Japan, the country of his birth. Mizuhara has spent much of his life in the United States, attending school in Southern California.\n\n\"Defendant and his counsel have discussed the fact that, and defendant understands that, if defendant is not a United States citizen, the convictions in this case make it a practically inevitable and a virtual certainty that defendant will be removed or deported from the United States,\" the agreement reads.\n\nMizuhara, 39, was fired by the Dodgers on March 21 amid news reports that at least $4.5 million was wired from Ohtani's accounts to an alleged illegal bookmaker, Mathew Bowyer. Ohtani accused Mizuhara of \"massive theft,\" alleging that Mizuhara had taken the money without his knowledge. Federal authorities charged Mizuhara with bank fraud on April 11, releasing a 37-page affidavit outlining how the former interpreter gained access to Ohtani's accounts and used the money to \"feed his insatiable appetite for illegal sports betting,\" U.S. Attorney Martin Estrada said.\n\n\"The extent of this defendant's deception and theft is massive,\" Estrada said in a statement Wednesday. \"He took advantage of his position of trust to take advantage of Mr. Ohtani and fuel a dangerous gambling habit. My office is committed to vindicating victims throughout our community and ensuring that wrongdoers face justice.\"\n\nAccording to the release, Mizuhara \"fraudulently obtained\" more than $16,975,010 from Ohtani's account, which contained playing salaries from his contract with the Los Angeles Angels.\n\nMizuhara had worked for Ohtani dating back to his arrival in the United States in 2018, when Ohtani hired Mizuhara as his de facto manager as well as his interpreter, according to court documents. Their relationship spanned longer than that, as Mizuhara worked for the Nippon Ham Fighters of NPB when Ohtani played there from 2013 to 2017.\n\nOhtani, who is in the first year of a new 10-year contract with the Dodgers after six seasons with the Angels, hasn't addressed the subject in a public forum since giving a statement on March 25 in which he said he was \"very saddened and shocked that someone who I trusted has done this.\"", "source": {"uri": "theathletic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Athletic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "fabian_ardaya@theathletic.com", "name": "Fabian

fraud -- punishable by up to 30 years in prison -- and one count of filing a false tax return, which carries a maximum sentence of three years, the Justice Department said.\n\nFederal prosecutors have said Mizuhara -- Ohtani's long-time friend and confidant -- plundered millions from the Los Angeles Dodgers ace's bank account to fund an \"insatiable appetite\" for gambling.\n\nMizuhara is expected to formally enter his guilty plea in the coming weeks, with arraignment scheduled to take place in Los Angeles on May 14.\n\n\"The extent of this defendant's deception and theft is massive,\" United States Attorney Martin Estrada said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\n\"He took advantage of his position of trust to take advantage of Mr Ohtani and fuel a dangerous gambling habit,\" Estrada added.\n\nJapanese sensation Ohtani, currently the biggest star in baseball, joined the Dodgers last December in a record-breaking $700 million deal -- the richest contract in North American sports history.\n\nTyler Hatcher, special agent in charge from the Internal Revenue Service's criminal investigation unit, said the probe had revealed Mizuhara \"not only stole from Mr Ohtani, but also that he lied to the IRS about his income.\"\n\n\"Mr Mizuhara exploited his relationship with Mr Ohtani to bankroll his own irresponsibility,\" Hatcher said in a statement.\n\nMizuhara's guilty plea had been expected.\n\nAfter an initial court appearance last month, his lawyer said he wished to apologize to \"Ohtani, the Dodgers, and Major League Baseball\" for his actions and sought a swift resolution so he can \"take responsibility.\"\n\n- Massive losses -\n\nThe revelations surrounding Mizuhara erupted as the new baseball season got under way in March, stunning the sports world and potentially embroiling Ohtani in scandal.\n\nMore from this section Peter Andre unveils hidden meaning in newborn baby daughter's name after weeks of 'deliberation' Early storms Tuesday followed by partial sun; temps warm to upper-70s NYCHA tenant in Melrose dealing with floor falling apart in home\n\nProsecutors have repeatedly emphasized that Ohtani was an innocent victim of Mizuhara's deception, and that there was no evidence to suggest the Dodgers star was aware of or involved in illegal gambling.\n\nA criminal complaint released by prosecutors last month detailed a staggering volume of bets placed by Mizuhara, who exploited the language barrier to keep Ohtani, his financial advisors and management team in the dark about his crimes.\n\nThe complaint revealed that between December 2021 and January 2024, Mizuhara placed approximately 19,000 bets ranging in value from $10 to $160,000 at an average of around $12,800 per bet.\n\nDuring that period, Mizuhara had winning bets worth $142.3 million, and losing bets of $182.9 million -- leaving him with losses of roughly $40.7 million.\n\nThe complaint detailed that contact information on Ohtani's bank account was later changed to link it to Mizuhara's phone number and to an anonymous email address connected to Mizuhara.\n\nMizuhara also would allegedly falsely identify himself as Ohtani to trick bank employees into authorizing wire transfers.\n\nBank recordings of telephone calls captured Mizuhara impersonating Ohtani as he sought to make wire transfers.\n\nMajor League Baseball's gambling policy bars \"any player, umpire, or club or league official or employee\" from betting on baseball or making illegal bets on any other sport.\n\nPlayers found guilty of betting on a game they were involved in are subject to life bans, with one-year suspensions if they are found to have gambled on games they are not directly involved in.\n\nOhtani is a rarity in baseball in that he combines elite-level pitching and hitting ability, making him a generational talent who has been portrayed as a modern-day version of Babe Ruth.\n\nThose skills and his clean-cut image have made him the global face of baseball.\n\nOhtani is currently leading baseball's key hitting rankings, with an MLB-leading average of .358 as well as an MLB-best 11 home runs.\n\nrcw/bb", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com",

That will include a whopping $17 million to Ohtani and $1.1 million to the IRS.\n\nIt's unlikely Mizuhara has anywhere close to that much cash on hand. The scandal exposed his financial struggles and his crippling gambling addiction, which led him to lose $40 million on wagers.\n\nMizuhara won't be able to rake in cash from selling his trove of Ohtani-signed memorabilia, either. Mizuhara's plea agreement, obtained by The Daily Beast, says he's barred by selling his \"various collectible baseball cards and sports memorabilia\" that were seized by authorities from his Newport Beach home.\n\nMizuhara allegedly made 19,000 wagers with an illegal bookie between December 2021 and January 2024, which averages out to about 25 bets per day. He claims to have never bet on MLB games or on Ohtani.\n\nProsecutors said Mizuhara took advantage of Ohtani by translating for the MLB star at a bank in Arizona and learning of his password. Mizuhara later broke into the account to change his password and account email to his own, authorizing himself to make transactions on Ohtani's behalf.\n\nOnce in control of the account, prosecutors said Mizuhara siphoned funds from his boss to pay off his growing gambling debt -- confirming wire transfers over the phone himself, with Ohtani ignorant to the scheme.\n\nMizuhara's agreement specified that he called the bank and impersonated Ohtani on 24 occasions.\n\nIn a press release, prosecutors said Mizuhara tried to cover up his theft by insisting Ohtani wanted to keep his finances private.\n\n\"When Ohtani's sports agent and financial advisors asked Mizuhara for access to the bank account, Mizuhara lied and said Ohtani did not want them to access the account because it was private,\" the statement said. \"In fact, Mizuhara did not want them to know that he had been stealing from Ohtani and had fraudulently obtained more than $16,975,010 from him.\"\n\nIn a statement of his own, U.S. Attorney Martin Estrada skewered Mizuhara for his recklessness.\n\n\"The extent of this defendant's deception and theft is massive,\" he said. \"He took advantage of his position of trust to take advantage of Mr. Ohtani and fuel a dangerous gambling habit.\"\n\nThe plea agreement, which is yet to go into effect, added that Mizuhara is likely to be deported from the U.S. and denied re-entry into the country upon his release from prison, if he is sent there as expected.\n\nMizuhara will waive his right to appeal his charges if he goes through with the plea deal, the document said.", "source": {"uri": "thedailybeast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Beast"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ippei_Mizuhara", "type":

The news, which broke in March, has shocked baseball fans across the world, from the US to Ohtani's native Japan.\n\nMr Mizuhara will plead guilty to one count of bank fraud and one count of subscribing to a false tax return, the US Justice Department announced on Wednesday. The plea will be entered in the coming weeks ahead of his arraignment on 14 May.\n\nThe bank fraud charge carries a maximum of 30 years in federal prison, and the false tax return charge carries a sentence of up to three years in federal prison.\n\nThe plea agreement says Mizuhara will be required to pay Mr Ohtani restitution that could total nearly $17m, as well as more than $1m to the IRS. Those amounts could change before sentencing.\n\n\"The extent of this defendant's deception and theft is massive,\" United States Attorney Martin Estrada said in a statement. \"He took advantage of his position of trust to take advantage of Mr Ohtani and fuel a dangerous gambling habit.\"\n\nAccording to prosecutors, Mizuhara exploited his personal and professional relationship with Mr Ohtani to plunder millions from the two-way player's account for years. At times, he even allegedly impersonated the player himself when dealing with bankers.\n\nProsecutors say that he had begun placing bets with an illegal bookmaker in September 2021, and quickly got in over his head.\n\n\"Shortly thereafter, Mizuhara began to lose bets and quickly became indebted to the bookmaker. Unable to pay his gambling debts, Mizuhara orchestrated a scheme to deceive and cheat the bank to fraudulently obtain money from the account,\" the DOJ said.\n\n\"From no later than November 2021 to March 2024, Mizuhara used Ohtani's password to successfully sign into the bank account and then changed the account's security protocols without Ohtani's knowledge or permission.\n\n\"In total, Mizuhara called the bank and impersonated Ohtani on approximately 24 occasions.\"\n\nDuring this time, Mizuhara regularly logged into Mr Ohtani's bank account and initiated wire transfers from the account to the bookmaker and his associates as payments for gambling debts.\n\nOn June 20, 2023, Mizuhara accessed the account without the player's permission and transferred $500,000 to one of the bookmaker's associates. From January 2024 to March 2024, Mr Mizuhara purchased approximately $325,000 worth of baseball cards from online resellers such as eBay from Mr Ohtani's bank account with the intent to resell them later and for his own benefit.\n\nWhen Mr Ohtani's sports agent and financial advisors asked Mr Mizuhara for access to the bank account, Mizuhara lied and said his boss did not want them to access the account because it was private.\n\nThe long-time interpreter's winning bets totalled over $142m, which he deposited in his own bank account and not Mr Ohtani's. But his losing bets were around $183m, a net loss of nearly $41m.\n\nIn total Mr Mizuhara fraudulently obtained more than $16,975,010 from Mr Ohtani, according to the DOJ.\n\nHe did not wager on baseball, prosecutors said.\n\nMajor League Baseball (MLB) rules prohibit players and team employees from wagering on baseball, even legally. MLB also bans betting on other sports with illegal or offshore bookmakers.\n\nMr Mizuhara was fired by the Dodgers, and the MLB opened an investigation into the situation after The Los Angeles Times and ESPN broke the news of the prosecution in late March.\n\nThere was no evidence that Mr Ohtani was involved in or aware of Mr Mizuhara's gambling, and the player is cooperating with investigators, authorities said.\n\nSince the allegations emerged, Mr Mizuhara has been free on an unsecured $25,000 bond, colloquially known as a signature bond.\n\nThis means he did not have to put up any cash or collateral to be freed. If he violates the bond conditions -- which include a requirement to undergo gambling addiction treatment -- he will be required to pay $25,000.\n\nMr Ohtani has played in the United States since 2018, first for the Los Angeles Angels before signing a record-breaking contract with the Dodgers in December. The contract is worth $700m and stretches over 10 years.\n\nSince the case against his ex-interpreter was announced, the Dodgers star has focussed on his game. Just hours after his Mr Mizuhara first appeared in court in April, he hit his 175th home run as an MLB player, tying Hideki Matsui for the most by a Japan-born player, during the Dodgers' 8-7 loss to the San Diego Padres in 11 innings.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Mizuhara allegedly stole nearly $17 million from Ohtani to cover up his illegal gambling losses, which totaled more than $40 million.\n\nMizuhara agreed to plead guilty to two charges, bank fraud and subscribing to a false tax return, on Wednesday. The first charge carries a maximum sentence of up to 30 years in federal prison, and the second could add up to three years.\n\nMizuhara is expected to enter his guilty plea officially next week.\n\nMizuhara turned himself in to authorities officially last month after he was accused of stealing millions from Ohtani. He allegedly made 19,000 wagers with an alleged illegal bookie between December 2021 and January 2024, which averages out to about 25 bets per day. In total, Mizuhara ended up losing more than $40.5 million.\n\nMizuhara was Ohtani's financial point person since the star moved to the United States in 2018. He reportedly helped him set up a bank account, and then impersonated him and later changed information in order to start funneling money from it. Ohtani's agent reportedly only talked to him through Mizuhara, too.\n\nMizuhara reportedly transferred the weekly $500,000 payments into an account of an associate of Matthew Boyer, who is also under federal investigation. That associate then transferred the money into accounts with Resorts World, a Las Vegas casino, and Pechanga Resort Casino in Temecula, California. The scandal is reportedly part of a much larger operation, in which 12 people have already been charged and convicted and multiple casinos have paid fines.\n\nOhtani has denied knowing anything about the scandal ahead of time, too, and said he learned about it when everyone else did. Major League Baseball has released a statement recognizing that authorities see Ohtani as a victim, too. Ohtani is playing with the Dodgers normally this season in the wake of the scandal.\n\nThis post will be updated with more information shortly.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_young@aol.com", "name": "Ryan Young", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ippei_Mizuhara", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ippei Mizuhara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_interpretation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Language interpretation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmaker_(gambling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bookmaker (gambling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_prison", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal prison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casino", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Casino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temecula,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Temecula, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Temecula, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Casinos", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Casinos", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Guides", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gambling", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gambling", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/pCfViJ_Pu5G3XHwgM1e1Bw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_yahoo_sports_800/e28266eee3783f02161a23b4b8a39056", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551167", "eventUri": "eng-9551167", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.6392156862745098, "wgt": 218, "relevance": 1}

That will include a whopping $17 million to Ohtani and $1.1 million to the IRS.\n\nIt's unlikely Mizuhara has anywhere close to that much cash on hand. The scandal exposed his financial struggles and his crippling gambling addiction, which led him to lose $40 million on wagers.\n\nMizuhara won't be able to rake in cash from selling his trove of Ohtani-signed memorabilia, either. Mizuhara's plea agreement, obtained by The Daily Beast, says he's barred by selling his \"various collectible baseball cards and sports memorabilia\" that were seized by authorities from his Newport Beach home.\n\nMizuhara allegedly made 19,000 wagers with an illegal bookie between December 2021 and January 2024, which averages out to about 25 bets per day. He claims to have never bet on MLB games or on Ohtani.\n\nProsecutors said Mizuhara took advantage of Ohtani by translating for the MLB star at a bank in Arizona and learning of his password. Mizuhara later broke into the account to change his password and account email to his own, authorizing himself to make transactions on Ohtani's behalf.\n\nOnce in control of the account, prosecutors said Mizuhara siphoned funds from his boss to pay off his growing gambling debt -- confirming wire transfers over the phone himself, with Ohtani ignorant to the scheme.\n\nShohei Ohtani Signs Historic Mega-Contract With Los Angeles Dodgers\n\nMizuhara's agreement specified that he called the bank and impersonated Ohtani on 24 occasions.\n\nIn a press release, prosecutors said Mizuhara tried to cover up his theft by insisting Ohtani wanted to keep his finances private.\n\n\"When Ohtani's sports agent and financial advisors asked Mizuhara for access to the bank account, Mizuhara lied and said Ohtani did not want them to access the account because it was private,\" the statement said. \"In fact, Mizuhara did not want them to know that he had been stealing from Ohtani and had fraudulently obtained more than $16,975,010 from him.\"\n\nIn a statement of his own, U.S. Attorney Martin Estrada skewered Mizuhara for his recklessness.\n\n\"The extent of this defendant's deception and theft is massive,\" he said. \"He took advantage of his position of trust to take advantage of Mr. Ohtani and fuel a dangerous gambling habit.\"\n\nThe plea agreement, which is yet to go into effect, added that Mizuhara is likely to be deported from the U.S. and denied re-entry into the country upon his release from prison, if he is sent there as expected.\n\nMizuhara will waive his right to appeal his charges if he goes through with the plea deal, the document said.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox.

He also pleaded guilty to one count of filing a false tax return, which carries a maximum sentence of three years, the Justice Department said.\n\nFederal prosecutors said Mizuhara, a longtime friend and confidant of Ohtani, looted millions from the Los Angeles Dodgers star's bank account to fund an \"insatiable gambling habit\".\n\nOhtani, currently the biggest star in baseball, joined the Dodgers last December in a record-breaking $700 million (\u20ac652 million) deal, the biggest contract in North American sports history. A rarity in today's baseball, he combines elite pitching and hitting skills, making him a generational talent not seen since the retirement of the legendary Babe Ruth.\n\nMizuhara is expected to formally enter his guilty plea in the coming weeks, with the hearing scheduled for 14 May in Los Angeles.\n\nPlea bargaining between defendants and prosecutors is common in the criminal justice system of the world's leading economic power, allowing defendants to plead guilty to a lesser charge in exchange for a lighter sentence, although the decision must be ratified by a judge.\n\n\"The magnitude of this defendant's fraud and theft is enormous,\" U.S. Attorney Martin Estrada said in a statement on Wednesday. \"He used his position of trust to take advantage of Mr Ohtani and to fuel a dangerous gambling habit,\" Estrada added.Tyler Hatcher, special agent in charge of the Internal Revenue Service's criminal investigation division, said the investigation revealed that Mizuhara \"not only stole from Mr. Ohtani, but also lied to the IRS about his income. Mr. Mizuhara used his relationship with Mr. Ohtani to finance his own irresponsibility,\" Hatcher said in a statement.\n\nRevelations about Mizuhara surfaced at the start of the new baseball season in March, stunning the sports world and potentially implicating Ohtani in an illegal betting scandal.\n\nProsecutors have repeatedly insisted that Ohtani was an innocent victim of Mizuhara's deception and that there is no evidence that the Dodgers star was aware of or involved in illegal gambling.\n\nThe complaint revealed that between December 2021 and January 2024, Mizuhara placed approximately 19,000 bets ranging from $10 to $160,000, with an average of approximately $12,800 per bet.\n\nDuring this period, Mizuhara had winning bets worth $142.3 million (\u20ac132 million) and losing bets worth $182.9 million (\u20ac169 million), resulting in losses of approximately $40.7 million (\u20ac37.2 million).\n\nThe complaint details that the contact information on Ohtani's bank account was subsequently changed to link it to Mizuhara's telephone number and an anonymous email address associated with Mizuhara. Mizuhara allegedly falsely identified himself as Ohtani in order to trick bank employees into authorising bank transfers.\n\nRecords of the bank calls captured Mizuhara impersonating Ohtani while attempting to make bank transfers.\n\nMajor League Baseball's gambling policy prohibits \"any player, umpire, club or league official or employee\" from betting on baseball or engaging in illegal betting on any other sport, so there was initial speculation that the Japanese player would be sanctioned, but the evidence at trial and his innocence ruled that out.\n\nPlayers found guilty of betting on a match in which they are involved face a lifetime ban, with a one-year suspension if they are found to have bet on matches in which they are not directly involved.\n\nWith a .358 average and MLB-high 11 home runs, Ohtani currently leads all major baseball batting rankings.", "source": {"uri": "insidethegames.biz", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.insidethegames.biz"}, "authors":

The bank fraud charge carries a maximum of 30 years in federal prison, and the false tax return charge carries a sentence of up to three years in federal prison.\n\nThe plea agreement says Mizuhara will be required to pay Ohtani restitution that could total nearly $17 million, as well as more than $1 million to the IRS. Those amounts could change prior to sentencing.\n\nMizuhara will enter his guilty plea in the coming weeks and is set to be arraigned May 14, prosecutors said.\n\n\"The extent of this defendant's deception and theft is massive,\" United States Attorney Martin Estrada said in a statement. \"He took advantage of his position of trust to take advantage of Mr. Ohtani and fuel a dangerous gambling habit.\"\n\nMizuhara exploited his personal and professional relationship with Ohtani to plunder millions from the two-way player's account for years, at times impersonating Ohtani to bankers, prosecutors said. Mizuhara's winning bets totaled over $142 million, which he deposited in his own bank account and not Ohtani's. But his losing bets were around $183 million, a net loss of nearly $41 million. He did not wager on baseball.\n\nThere was no evidence that Ohtani was involved in or aware of Mizuhara's gambling, and the player is cooperating with investigators, authorities said.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times and ESPN broke the news of the prosecution in late March, prompting the Dodgers to fire the interpreter and MLB to open its own investigation.\n\nMLB rules prohibit players and team employees from wagering on baseball, even legally. MLB also bans betting on other sports with illegal or offshore bookmakers.\n\nMizuhara has been free on an unsecured $25,000 bond, colloquially known as a signature bond, meaning he did not have to put up any cash or collateral to be freed. If he violates the bond conditions -- which include a requirement to undergo gambling addiction treatment -- he will be on the hook for $25,000.\n\nOhtani has sought to focus on the field as the case winds through the courts. Hours after his ex-interpreter first appeared in court in April, he hit his 175th home run in MLB, tying Hideki Matsui for the most by a Japan-born player, during the Dodgers' 8-7 loss to the San Diego Padres in 11 innings.\n\nMore from this section\n\nGemoo Launches CapUp to Make Viral Videos for Tiktok, Instagram, and YouTube easily and Instantly Monterra Credit Union elevates the member

As well as a length jail term, he must also pay $16,975,010 in restitution to Victim A, assumed to be Ohtani.\n\nOhtani and Mizuhara became close friends beyond their working relationship after the player moved to the US from Japan to begin his Major League Baseball career with the Los Angeles Angels in 2018. That relationship continued when Ohtani crossed LA to join the Dodgers on a 10-year, $700m deal last December. But Mizuhara was fired by the Dodgers in March after admitting that he stole at least $4.5m from Ohtani, the biggest star in baseball, to pay off gambling debts.\n\nReports have said the plea agreement would include an admission that corroborates Ohtani's version of the events - that the player never wagered on sports, had no idea that Mizuhara did so and was the victim of a \"massive theft\" by his former friend. MLB players are forbidden from betting on baseball, and face a lifetime ban if found to have placed a wager on their own team. They are allowed to bet on other sports in the nearly 40 US states where gambling is legal, but not in California, where Mizuhara and Ohtani are based. There is no evidence that Ohtani ever placed any wagers himself or was aware of Mizuhara's gambling.\n\nMizuhara exploited his relationship with Ohtani to plunder millions from the star's account for years, at times impersonating Ohtani to bankers, prosecutors said. Mizuhara's winning bets totalled over $142m, which he deposited them money into his own bank account and not Ohtani's. But his losing bets were around $183m, a net loss of nearly $41m. He did not wager on baseball.\n\nThe theft became public knowledge when wire transfers from Ohtani's bank account were discovered in a federal investigation of an alleged illegal bookmaker. Mizuhara initially said that Ohtani agreed to cover his gambling debts, then backtracked and admitted that Ohtani was unaware of the payment to the bookie in California.\n\nOhtani, a rare player who excels as both a pitcher and hitter, is one of the most famous people in his homeland. The scandal does not appear to have affected his performance on the field. He leads MLB in home runs and batting average and the Dodgers are top of their division, the National League West, by 6.5 games.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_lutz@theguardian.com", "name": "Tom Lutz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ippei_Mizuhara", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ippei Mizuhara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Angels", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Angels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmaker_(gambling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bookmaker (gambling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_West", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National League West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/112798b7ee50b5b99556f0b9a674b4b88c505032/1038_76_4693_2817/master/4693.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&s=4c3f97e303d9f9f94b41d365cf571336", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551167", "eventUri": "eng-9551167", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 217, "relevance": 1}

He now faces up to 33 years in prison.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), Mizuhara agreed to plead guilty to stealing nearly $7 million from Ohtani in order to \"cover gambling debts.\"\n\nThe U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California stated that Mizuhara, 39, has consented to enter a guilty plea to one count of bank fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison, and one count of subscribing to a false tax return, which carries a maximum sentence of three years in prison.\n\n\"The extent of this defendant's deception and theft is massive,\" U.S. Attorney Martin Estrada said in a statement. \"He took advantage of his position of trust to take advantage of Mr. Ohtani and fuel a dangerous gambling habit. My office is committed to vindicating victims throughout our community and ensuring that wrongdoers face justice.\"\n\nThe plea agreement stated that the 39-year-old interpreter previously helped the baseball star set up a bank account in Phoenix in 2018, and during which, he \"interpreted the login information\" for Ohtani's account.\n\nLater in September of 2021, Mizuhara then began placing sports bets with an illegal bookmaker that would eventually lead him into racking up large amounts of debt.\n\n\"Unable to pay his gambling debts, Mizuhara orchestrated a scheme to deceive and cheat the bank to fraudulently obtain money from the account,\" the DOJ said in a release.\n\nMizuhara then purportedly accessed the account and updated the security information, so that bank employees would contact him rather than Ohtani if wire transfers needed further confirmation from the account holder. The plea also stated that he impersonated Ohtani in his phone calls to the bank.\n\nMizuhara transferred approximately $7 million from the account to associates of the bookmaker in more than 40 wires from November 2021 to March 2024 without Ohtani's knowledge.\n\nThe interpreter also admitted to falsely claiming that his total taxable income for 2022 was $136,865, when, in fact, he failed to report the additional $4.1 million in income.\n\n\"The source of the unreported income was from his scheme to defraud the bank,\" the DOJ said, noting that he owes approximately $1,149,400 in additional taxes for the tax year 2022, plus additional interest and penalties.\n\nEstrada previously stressed that Ohtani is a \"victim in the case\" and has cooperated \"fully and completely\" in the investigation.\n\nOn March 20, following the emergence of the gambling controversy, the Dodgers team announced that they had fired the Japanese interpreter. However, they did not give a detailed explanation as to why Mizuhara was let go.\n\nLast month, Mizuhara was charged, and as per the statement provided by his lawyer, Michael Freedman, to ABC News after Mizuhara's first appearance in federal court on April 12, he is \"continuing to cooperate with the legal process and is hopeful that he can reach an agreement with the government to resolve this case as quickly as possible so that he can take responsibility.\"\n\n\"He wishes to apologize to Mr. Ohtani, the Dodgers, Major League Baseball, and his family,\" the statement continued. \"As noted in court, he is eager to seek treatment for his gambling.\"\n\nOn March 25, Ohtani addressed the scandal during a press conference and said he was \"very saddened and shocked that someone who [he] trusted had done this.\"\n\nAccording to the DOJ, Mizuhara is expected to enter a plea in the upcoming weeks, and his arraignment is set for May 14.\n\nStay informed!

His arraignment is scheduled for Tuesday in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.\n\nA sentencing date has not been set. The total maximum sentence Mizuhara could receive for both crimes would be 33 years imprisonment and fines of $1.25 million, but in exchange for his plea -- outlined in the agreement released Wednesday -- prosecutors would recommend a reduced sentence.\n\nA spokesperson for Ohtani declined to comment.\n\nFederal authorities filed the complaint against Mizuhara on April 11, just three weeks after an ESPN investigation detailing wire transfers of $500,000 from Ohtani's bank account to the bookmaking operation. Mizuhara initially told ESPN Ohtani had sent the money to help him pay his debts but later changed his story to say Ohtani had no knowledge of his gambling or the wire transfers. Ohtani's attorneys alleged the slugger had been the victim of a \"massive theft.\"\n\n\"The extent of this defendant's deception and theft is massive,\" said United States Attorney Martin Estrada in a press release. \"He took advantage of his position of trust to take advantage of Mr. Ohtani and fuel a dangerous gambling habit.\"\n\nAlso in the statement, IRS Criminal Investigation Special Agent in Charge Tyler Hatcher said, \"Mr. Mizuhara exploited his relationship with Mr. Ohtani to bankroll his own irresponsibility.\"\n\nThe documents filed Wednesday further detailed a relationship of trust in which Ohtani, who did not speak English, relied on his Japanese translator to help him with everything from answering questions at press conferences, transacting with financial advisors and sports agents, and opening bank accounts.\n\nMizuhara began placing bets with an illegal bookmaker in September 2021, and as his losses quickly mounted, he began to exploit his access to Ohtani's financial accounts to pay off his debts.\n\nMizuhara took many steps to deceive Ohtani, including changing contact information on the baseball player's bank accounts so communication would come to Mizuhara. He even impersonated Ohtani on the phone with calls to the bank, which he did at least 24 times, according to the plea agreement.\n\nIn September 2023, Mizuhara told Ohtani he needed $60,000 for dental work, which Ohtani arrange to give him via a check drawn from a business account. However, Mizuhara pocketed that money and instead used Ohtani's debit card to pay the $60,000 dental bill.", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ippei_Mizuhara", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ippei Mizuhara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emmy Awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freedom Forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_Central_District_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States District Court for the Central District of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DuPont", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DuPont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportsbook", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sportsbook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire_transfer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wire transfer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Theft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arraignment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arraignment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmaker_(gambling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bookmaker (gambling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deception", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sports agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Special agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internal Revenue Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment_Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment Associations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0412%2Fr1317958_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551167", "eventUri": "eng-9551167", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-11", "textStart": 1106, "textEnd": 1114}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 216, "relevance": 1}

"title": "Ohtani interpreter to plead guilty over $17 mn fraud: US Justice Dept", "body": "Shohei Ohtani's former interpreter has agreed to plead guilty over charges of illegally transferring nearly $17 million from the baseball star's bank account in order to pay off gambling debts, the United States Justice Department said Wednesday.\n\nIppei Mizuhara, 39, will plead guilty to one count of bank fraud -- punishable by up to 30 years in prison -- and one count of filing a false tax return, which carries a maximum sentence of three years, the Justice Department said.\n\nFederal prosecutors have said Mizuhara -- Ohtani's long-time friend and confidant -- plundered millions from the Los Angeles Dodgers ace's bank account to fund an \"insatiable appetite\" for gambling.\n\nMizuhara is expected to formally enter his guilty plea in the coming weeks, with arraignment scheduled to take place in Los Angeles on May 14.\n\n\"The extent of this defendant's deception and theft is massive,\" United States Attorney Martin Estrada said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\n\"He took advantage of his position of trust to take advantage of Mr Ohtani and fuel a dangerous gambling habit,\" Estrada added.\n\nJapanese sensation Ohtani, currently the biggest star in baseball, joined the Dodgers last December in a record-breaking $700 million deal -- the richest contract in North American sports history.\n\nTyler Hatcher, special agent in charge from the Internal Revenue Service's criminal investigation unit, said the probe had revealed Mizuhara \"not only stole from Mr Ohtani, but also that he lied to the IRS about his income.\"\n\n\"Mr Mizuhara exploited his relationship with Mr Ohtani to bankroll his own irresponsibility,\" Hatcher said in a statement.\n\nMizuhara's guilty plea had been expected.\n\nAfter an initial court appearance last month, his lawyer said he wished to apologize to \"Ohtani, the Dodgers, and Major League Baseball\" for his actions and sought a swift resolution so he can \"take responsibility.\"\n\n- Massive losses -\n\nThe revelations surrounding Mizuhara erupted as the new baseball season got under way in March, stunning the sports world and potentially embroiling Ohtani in scandal.\n\nProsecutors have repeatedly emphasized that Ohtani was an innocent victim of Mizuhara's deception, and that there was no evidence to suggest the Dodgers star was aware of or involved in illegal gambling.\n\nA criminal complaint released by prosecutors last month detailed a staggering volume of bets placed by Mizuhara, who exploited the language barrier to keep Ohtani, his financial advisors and management team in the dark about his crimes.\n\nThe complaint revealed that between December 2021 and January 2024, Mizuhara placed approximately 19,000 bets ranging in value from $10 to $160,000 at an average of around $12,800 per bet.\n\nDuring that period, Mizuhara had winning bets worth $142.3 million, and losing bets of $182.9 million -- leaving him with losses of roughly $40.7 million.\n\nThe complaint detailed that contact information on Ohtani's bank account was later changed to link it to Mizuhara's phone number and to an anonymous email address connected to Mizuhara.\n\nMizuhara also would allegedly falsely identify himself as Ohtani to trick bank employees into authorizing wire transfers.\n\nBank recordings of telephone calls captured Mizuhara impersonating Ohtani as he sought to make wire transfers.\n\nMajor League Baseball's gambling policy bars \"any player, umpire, or club or league official or employee\" from betting on baseball or making illegal bets on any other sport.\n\nPlayers found guilty of betting on a game they were involved in are subject to life bans, with one-year suspensions if they are found to have gambled on games they are not directly involved in.\n\nOhtani is a rarity in baseball in that he combines elite-level pitching and hitting ability, making him a generational talent who has been portrayed as a modern-day version of Babe Ruth.\n\nThose skills and his clean-cut image have made him the global face of baseball.\n\nOhtani is currently leading baseball's key hitting rankings, with an MLB-leading average of .358 as well as an MLB-best 11 home runs.\n\nrcw/bb\n\nMore from this section\n\nFormer Addict Dedicates Himself to Paying Help Forward With Foundation

The bank fraud charge carries a maximum of 30 years in federal prison, and the false tax return charge carries a sentence of up to three years in federal prison.\n\nThe plea agreement says Mizuhara will be required to pay Ohtani restitution that could total nearly $17 million, as well as more than $1 million to the IRS. Those amounts could change prior to sentencing.\n\nMizuhara will enter his guilty plea in the coming weeks and is set to be arraigned May 14, prosecutors said.\n\n\"The extent of this defendant's deception and theft is massive,\" United States Attorney Martin Estrada said in a statement. \"He took advantage of his position of trust to take advantage of Mr. Ohtani and fuel a dangerous gambling habit.\"\n\nMizuhara exploited his personal and professional relationship with Ohtani to plunder millions from the two-way player's account for years, at times impersonating Ohtani to bankers, prosecutors said. Mizuhara's winning bets totaled over $142 million, which he deposited in his own bank account and not Ohtani's. But his losing bets were around $183 million, a net loss of nearly $41 million. He did not wager on baseball.\n\nThere was no evidence that Ohtani was involved in or aware of Mizuhara's gambling, and the player is cooperating with investigators, authorities said.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times and ESPN broke the news of the prosecution in late March, prompting the Dodgers to fire the interpreter and MLB to open its own investigation.\n\nMLB rules prohibit players and team employees from wagering on baseball, even legally. MLB also bans betting on other sports with illegal or offshore bookmakers.\n\nMizuhara has been free on an unsecured $25,000 bond, colloquially known as a signature bond, meaning he did not have to put up any cash or collateral to be freed. If he violates the bond conditions -- which include a requirement to undergo gambling addiction treatment -- he will be on the hook for $25,000.\n\nOhtani has sought to focus on the field as the case winds through the courts. Hours after his ex-interpreter first appeared in court in April, he hit his 175th home run in MLB, tying Hideki Matsui for the most by a Japan-born player, during the Dodgers' 8-7 loss to the San Diego Padres in 11 innings.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press.

Mizuhara updated the contact information so bank employees would call him to verify wire transfers.\n\nMizuhara impersonated Ohtani around 24 times to confirm transactions and frequently logged into the MVP's account without his knowledge.\n\nHe purchased $325,000 worth of baseball cards using Ohtani's money with plans to resell them. Mizuhara concealed his theft from Ohtani's agent and financial representatives by falsely claiming that Ohtani didn't want them accessing his private bank account.\n\nAs part of his plea agreement, Mizuhara also confessed to falsifying his income tax returns in 2022. He admitted to owing $1,149,400 in additional taxes, plus interest and penalties.\n\nMizuhara faces up to three years in prison time for the tax charge and up to 30 years for bank fraud.", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_gould@postandcourier.com", "name": "Andrew Gould", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ippei_Mizuhara", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ippei Mizuhara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_return", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tax return"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_interpretation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Language interpretation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_prison", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal prison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_account", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank account"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Estrada_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marco Estrada (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Theft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire_transfer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wire transfer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Income tax"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Boats", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Boats", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment_Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment Associations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/9e/19e44647-974d-503c-8c7b-e3d5a95912f3/663ce6513560d.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C85&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551167", "eventUri": "eng-9551167", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

AFP-Yonhap\n\nJapanese baseball great Shohei Ohtani's former interpreter has agreed to plead guilty to federal charges he fraudulently wired nearly $17 million stolen from the athlete's bank account to pay off his own gambling debts, court records showed on Wednesday.\n\nThe plea agreement between federal prosecutors and Ippei Mizuhara, the onetime translator and de facto manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers' power-hitting pitcher, was announced by the U.S. Attorney's Office in L.A., where the case was first brought last month.\n\nA 33-page record of the deal, in which Mizuhara, 39, agreed to plead guilty to one count of felony bank fraud and one count of subscribing to a false tax return, was filed on Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles.\n\nA federal bank fraud conviction carries a statutory maximum sentence of 30 years in prison, with the tax offense punishable by up to three years behind bars. The tax charge was added to the case in conjunction with the plea deal.\n\nMizuhara is due to appear at a formal arraignment before a U.S. magistrate on May 14. He would likely enter his plea at a subsequent hearing before a federal district judge and be sentenced sometime after that, according to a U.S. attorney spokesperson.\n\nIn the meantime, Mizuhara remains free on $25,000 bond on condition he complies with a judge's order last month requiring him to undergo gambling addiction treatment and refrain from any contact with bookmakers, gambling establishments or Ohtani.\n\nMizuhara was accused of embezzling nearly $17 million from a bank account of Ohtani's that Mizuhara had helped open in Phoenix in 2018, and transferring the funds without the ballplayer's knowledge to an illegal bookmaking operation to cover Mizuhara's gambling debts.\n\nMichael Freedman, left, attorney for Ippei Mizuhara, leaves the Edward R. Roybal Federal Building and Courthouse in Los Angeles, California, April 12. EPA-Yonhap\n\nAnnouncing the original bank fraud charge on April 11, U.S. Attorney E. Martin Estrada stressed there was nothing to suggest wrongdoing by Ohtani, who signed a record $700 million, 10-year contract to join the Dodgers this season, becoming the highest paid player in Major League Baseball.\n\nOhtani, 29, whose talents as a slugger and a pitcher have earned him comparisons to Babe Ruth, has said he was an unwitting victim of theft and has never bet on baseball or knowingly paid a bookmaker.\n\nThe allegations against Mizuhara, stemming from a wider federal probe of illegal sports gambling, surfaced during the Dodgers' season-opening series in Seoul, Korea.\n\nThe outcome spared the Dodgers and the league a potential scandal of epic proportions, recalling the uproar stirred 35 years ago when Pete Rose was accused of gambling on baseball while he played for and managed the Cincinnati Reds. Rose, who later admitted to wagering on MLB games but not against his own team, ended up permanently banned from baseball in 1989.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, Mizuhara began gambling with an illegal sports book in late 2021 and lost substantial sums.\n\nTo cover his debts, Mizuhara impersonated Ohtani over the phone on more than two dozen occasions to deceive bank employees into authorizing wire transfers from Ohtani's account, where the player's baseball salary was deposited, prosecutors said.\n\nA longtime trusted confidante and driver for Ohtani, Mizuhara regularly interacted with the ballplayers' sports agents and financial advisors on behalf of the baseball star, who did not speak English, according to prosecutors.

Many of the questions around the explanation centered around how Mizuhara was able to secure the gambling \"marker\" from the bookie with his interpreter salary. But according to the release, \"Ohtani paid him separately for the additional work of driving him to meetings and interpreting for non-baseball-related activities.\"\n\nAs to how the interpreter gained access to Ohtani's bank account, Mizuhara interpreted for Ohtani when opening an account in 2018, particularly when a \"bank employee provided Ohtani the login information for this bank account.\"\n\nHe also called the bank to impersonate Ohtani 24 different times in order to have employees authorize wire transfers from the 29-year-old superstar's account.\n\nThe release provided one previously unreported detail of just how thorough Mizuhara was in siphoning money off from his boss.\n\n\"In addition, in September 2023, Mizuhara needed $60,000 worth of dental work and Ohtani agreed to pay for it via a check drawn on a business account at a different bank,\" it explains. \"However, Mizuhara provided his dentist Ohtani's debit card number for the bank account Ohtani had opened in Phoenix, charged $60,000 to that account, then deposited the $60,000 check into Mizuhara's personal bank account.\"\n\nThe scale of the theft is staggering; the guilty plea includes the charge of filing a false tax return, which they explain showed he had an unreported additional income of $4.1 million in 2022. That income came as a result of his \"scheme to defraud the bank.\"\n\nVirtually all of the doubts around Ohtani's version of events have been answered in the ensuing release of information from the Justice Department and other news stories. Mizuhara had access to a specific bank account, had the login information, changed the password and notification settings to ensure Ohtani wasn't aware of transactions, and impersonated him vocally to authorize wire transfers with the bank.\n\nREAD: Multiple MLB Interpreters Back Up Possible Shohei Ohtani Explanation\n\nHe had an additional income from salary earned as a sort of personal assistant to Ohtani and siphoned off money at every opportunity over the past two and a half years. Even the desperate \"Mizuhara is the fall guy\" deflections are no longer valid, considering he faces decades of prison time.\n\nYet through all this off-field drama, Ohtani has managed to get even better on the field...when he was already the best player in the sport.\n\nREAD: Somehow The Best Player In Baseball Has Gotten Even Better\n\nCommissioner Rob Manfred had essentially told the media they intended to wait to see what happened with the government's investigation before taking action.

The 39-year-old resident of Newport Beach, Calif., faces a maximum prison sentence of 33 years. However, given his cooperation and guilty plea, Mizuhara will likely receive a much shorter sentence.\n\nMore from Sportico.com\n\nFederal prosecutors depict Ohtani as a victim of crime whose wealth and limited English made him easy prey for Mizuhara. U.S. Attorney Martin Estrada said that to \"fuel\" his gambling habit, Mizuhara \"took advantage of his position of trust to take advantage of Mr. Ohtani.\"\n\nMizuhara facilitated his criminal acts by transforming his role from translator to Ohtani's de facto personal manager. Mizuhara, employed by the Los Angeles Angels and then the Dodgers, used his close relationship to routinely interact with Ohtani's agents and financial advisors, who did not speak Japanese.\n\nIn 2018, Mizuhara assisted Ohtani in opening a bank account in Phoenix, then used his interpreter role to secure the player's login information. After Mizuhara amassed gambling debts, he fraudulently obtained money from the bank. Mizuhara also used Ohtani's password and then altered the security protocols so that bank employees would call him -- and not Ohtani -- for verification of wire transfers.\n\nIn addition, Mizuhara impersonated Ohtani when communicating with bank employees. He used Ohtani's money to pay off gambling debts, dental bills and to buy baseball cards with the intent of reselling them for profit. Prosecutors say Mizuhara fraudulently obtained $16.98 million from Ohtani.\n\nA Mizuhara guilty plea means he will not defend himself in a trial. This was likely a smart move given what appears to be a vast trove of incriminating evidence. Mizuhara, a gambler, may have also been apprised of the long odds. Defendants in federal criminal cases are rarely cleared through a trial. Last year Pew Research found that, in 2022, only 290 of 71,954 defendants (0.4%) in federal criminal cases went to trial and were acquitted. In contrast, 89.5% of defendants, like Mizuhara, pleaded guilty.\n\nHad Mizuhara opted to take his chances in a trial, he might have tried to plant doubt in jurors' minds by suggesting Ohtani or others around the player were involved in the plot. Ohtani would have almost certainly had to testify. Jurors might have drawn from their common sense and wondered why neither Ohtani nor his agents, representatives or bankers noticed a multiyear and multi-step scheme occurring right under them.\n\nIt remains to be seen if Mizuhara's plea deal will require him to testify against others in related prosecutions. ESPN and other media have reported on government investigations into sports betting operations in California, where sports betting is illegal.\n\nMLB is separately investigating the Mizuhara matter. Earlier this week, commissioner Rob Manfred said the league's investigation will proceed judiciously and will let the criminal process play out. Given that federal prosecutors believe Ohtani was a victim, it stands to reason MLB will probably reach the same conclusion.\n\nOhtani, 29, doesn't appear distracted by the off-field controversy. As of Wednesday, he was leading all of MLB in home runs, doubles, batting average, hits, total bases, slugging percentage and OPS.\n\nBest of Sportico.com", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com",

The tax charge was added to the case in conjunction with the plea deal.\n\nMizuhara is due to appear at a formal arraignment before a US magistrate on May 14. He would likely enter his plea at a subsequent hearing before a federal district judge and be sentenced sometime after that, according to a US attorney spokesperson.\n\nIn the meantime, Mizuhara remains free on $25,000 bond on condition he complies with a judge's order last month requiring him to undergo gambling addiction treatment and refrain from any contact with bookmakers, gambling establishments or Ohtani.\n\nALSO READ: Japanese interpreter charged with stealing $16m from MLB star Shohei Ohtani\n\nMizuhara was accused of embezzling nearly $17 million from a bank account of Ohtani's that Mizuhara had helped open in Phoenix in 2018, and transferring the funds without the ballplayer's knowledge to an illegal bookmaking operation to cover Mizuhara's gambling debts.\n\nAnnouncing the original bank fraud charge on April 11, US Attorney E. Martin Estrada stressed there was nothing to suggest wrongdoing by Ohtani, who signed a record $700 million, 10-year contract to join the Dodgers this season, becoming the highest paid player in Major League Baseball.\n\nThe allegations against Mizuhara, stemming from a wider federal probe of illegal sports gambling, surfaced during the Dodgers' season-opening series in Seoul, South Korea\n\nOhtani, 29, whose talents as a slugger and a pitcher have earned him comparisons to Babe Ruth, has said he was an unwitting victim of theft and has never bet on baseball or knowingly paid a bookmaker.\n\nThe allegations against Mizuhara, stemming from a wider federal probe of illegal sports gambling, surfaced during the Dodgers' season-opening series in Seoul, South Korea.\n\nThe outcome spared the Dodgers and the league a potential scandal of epic proportions, recalling the uproar stirred 35 years ago when Pete Rose was accused of gambling on baseball while he played for and managed the Cincinnati Reds. Rose, who later admitted to wagering on MLB games but not against his own team, ended up permanently banned from baseball in 1989.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, Mizuhara began gambling with an illegal sports book in late 2021 and lost substantial sums.\n\nTo cover his debts, Mizuhara impersonated Ohtani over the phone on more than two dozen occasions to deceive bank employees into authorizing wire transfers from Ohtani's account, where the player's baseball salary was deposited, prosecutors said.\n\nA longtime trusted confidante and driver for Ohtani, Mizuhara regularly interacted with the ballplayers' sports agents and financial advisors on behalf of the baseball star, who did not speak English, according to prosecutors.", "source": {"uri": "chinadailyasia.com", "dataType": "news",

He made multiple $500,000 deposits into market accounts at Resort World casinos, based in California, which currently does not have legally licensed online sports betting. These accounts are linked to an associate of bookmaker Matthew Bowyer, who is currently under federal investigation.\n\nBack in 2018, Mizuhara assisted Ohtani with opening bank accounts in Arizona. One of these accounts received the superstar's MLB salary, which led to Mizuhara siphoning funds by allegdly changing the security protocols, email, and phone number of the account to go directly to him instead of Ohtani.\n\nThese actions helped keep the wire transfers, verified by the bank, from being flagged for suspicious activity. Mizuhara then went on to impersonate Ohtani at the bank more than 20 times, per the former interpreter's plea agreement. He's also admitted to falsifying his tax returns in 2022 after Mizuhara began getting into gambling debt in 2021. Mizuhara underreported his income by more than $4 million.\n\nHe's currently free on an unsecured $25,000 bond, or a signature bond, but he has to fulfill certain terms and conditions while awaiting his arraignment scheduled for May 14.\n\nMizuhara's gambling addiction while wagering on an unregulated sportsbook began in September 2021. This quickly turned into a large gambling deficit. Ohtani released a public statement back in March stating that Mizuhara had stolen the funds from his account without his knowledge. He followed this up by stating that he has never bet on baseball or any other sport, which includes asking somebody else to do it for him.\n\nDuring the Dodgers' trip to South Korea to open up the MLB season against the San Diego Padres in late March, Ohtani followed up with more comments on his lack of awareness surrounding Mizuhara's alleged gambling addiction.\n\n\"I do want to make it clear that I never bet on sports or have willfully sent money to a bookmaker.\" He went on to say, through Dodgers' manager of performance operations, Will Ireton, that Mizuhara, \"has been stealing money from my account and has been telling lies.

He then proceeded to contact his representatives, who escalated it to the Dodgers organization and his lawyers.

Those amounts could change prior to sentencing.\n\nMizuhara will enter his guilty plea in the coming weeks and is set to be arraigned May 14, prosecutors said.\n\n\"The extent of this defendant's deception and theft is massive,\" United States Attorney Martin Estrada said in a statement. \"He took advantage of his position of trust to take advantage of Mr. Ohtani and fuel a dangerous gambling habit.\"\n\nMizuhara exploited his personal and professional relationship with Ohtani to plunder millions from the two-way player's account for years, at times impersonating Ohtani to bankers, prosecutors said. Mizuhara's winning bets totaled over $142 million, which he deposited in his own bank account and not Ohtani's. But his losing bets were around $183 million, a net loss of nearly $41 million. He did not wager on baseball.\n\nMizuhara helped Ohtani open a bank account in 2018 and began stealing money from that account in 2021, according to the plea agreement. At one point, Mizuhara charged the security protocols, email and phone number associated with it so that calls came directly to him, not Ohtani, when the back was trying to verify wire transfers. Mizuhara impersonated Ohtani to the bank about 24 times, according to the agreement.\n\nMizuhara also admitted to falsifying his 2022 tax returns by underreporting his income by more than $4 million.\n\nAn email to Mizuhara's attorney, Michael G. Freedman, seeking comment on the deal was not immediately returned Wednesday.\n\nThere was no evidence that Ohtani was involved in or aware of Mizuhara's gambling, and the player is cooperating with investigators, authorities said.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times and ESPN broke the news of the prosecution in late March, prompting the Dodgers to fire the interpreter and MLB to open its own investigation.\n\nMLB rules prohibit players and team employees from wagering on baseball, even legally. MLB also bans betting on other sports with illegal or offshore bookmakers.\n\nMizuhara has been free on an unsecured $25,000 bond, colloquially known as a signature bond, meaning he did not have to put up any cash or collateral to be freed. If he violates the bond conditions -- which include a requirement to undergo gambling addiction treatment -- he will be on the hook for $25,000.\n\nOhtani has sought to focus on the field as the case winds through the courts. Hours after his ex-interpreter first appeared in court in April, he hit his 175th home run in MLB, tying Hideki Matsui for the most by a Japan-born player, during the Dodgers' 8-7 loss to the San Diego Padres in 11 innings.\n\nChristopher Weber And Stefanie Dazio, The Associated Press", "source": {"uri": "lethbridgenewsnow.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lethbridge News Now"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-way_player", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Two-way player"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deception", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Estrada_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marco Estrada (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internal Revenue Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Theft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arraignment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arraignment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire_transfer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wire transfer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmaker_(gambling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bookmaker (gambling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hideki_Matsui", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hideki Matsui"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Problem gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Times"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://d2ksr9467jthww.cloudfront.net/20240508210516/663bebf5023d1607a079ec10jpeg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551167", "eventUri": "eng-9551167", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-14", "textStart": 289, "textEnd": 295}], "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

As part of Mizuhara's agreement with the U.S. Attorney's Office, prosecutors will recommend a two-level reduction in Mizuhara's prison term.\n\nWith the reduction and Mizuhara's status as a first-time offender, the recommended prison sentence would range from seven to nine years, according to the Washington Post, although the agreement stipulates that prosecutors cannot guarantee the length of sentence once he goes before a judge for sentencing in the Central District of California.\n\nMizuhara also must pay a $1.15 million fine to the Internal Revenue Service, after he failed to report more than $4 million in income -- ostensibly thieved from Ohtani -- in tax year 2022 and then knowingly signed a false return.\n\nMichael Freedman, Mizuhara's attorney, declined comment Wednesday.\n\nMizuhara's plea puts much of the burgeoning scandal behind Ohtani, who was befriended by Mizuhara a decade ago and retained him when he switched Los Angeles clubs this off-season, agreeing to a record 10-year, $700 million contract with the Dodgers in December after six seasons with the Angels.\n\nYet the relationship among Ohtani, the Dodgers and Mizuhara fractured just as it began, when ESPN reported in March that Mizuhara used Ohtani's bank account to cover millions of dollars in gambling losses to an alleged operation run by Orange County resident Mathew Bowyer.\n\nMizuhara claimed he never bet on baseball and gave conflicting answers to ESPN regarding Ohtani's knowledge of his thievery. The Dodgers fired Ohtani after their first game of the season, played in Seoul, South Korea, and Mizuhara surrendered his cell phone to federal agents upon returning to the USA.\n\nThat resulted in a 37-page indictment that cast a grim light on Ohtani's gambling habits, frequently requesting to bookmakers that his credit limit be raised.\n\nMizuhara's bank fraud spanned November 2021 to March 2024, according to federal prosecutors, and began after he changed a registered email address and phone number on Ohtani's account from the then-Los Angeles Angel to himself. Prosecutors say Mizuhara did not \"notify, or seek permission from, Victim A before transferring money from the account.\"\n\nMizuhara aided in interpreting when Ohtani opened the Bank of America account in February 2018, shortly after joining the Angels after a decorated career in Japan.\n\nThe agreement also states that Mizuhara must forfeit all assets \"derived from or acquired as a result of\" illegal activity, including \"collectible baseball cards and sports memorabilia.\" Prosecutors say Mizuhara purchased approximately $325,000 of baseball cards between January and March 2024, including valuable cards featuring Hall of Famer Yogi Berra, Yankees slugger Juan Soto and Ohtani.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [],

Mizuhara is expected to plead guilty to bank fraud and filing a false tax return in the coming weeks.\n\n\"He took advantage of his position of trust to take advantage of Mr. Ohtani and fuel a dangerous gambling habit,\" Martin Estrada, the US Attorney for the Central District of California, said in a statement.\n\nThe plea agreement comes as Ohtani, a rare combination of pitcher and hitter who signed a record $700 million contract with the Dodgers in December, has become a symbol of MLB's efforts to expand its brand worldwide.\n\nThe Japanese wunderkid began playing in California in 2018 and relied on Mizuhara to act as his translator as his US career took off. Mizuhara, who was charged in April, was not only the 29-year-old's interpreter but also a close friend and de facto manager, according to federal prosecutors.\n\nMizuhara's attorney, Michael Freedman, declined to comment. A spokesperson for the Dodgers did not immediately respond to an email request for comment.\n\nDetails of Mizuhara's fraud were outlined on Wednesday as the Justice Department announced his plan to plead guilty. Mizuhara gained access to Ohtani's bank account after helping him open an account at a branch in Phoenix in 2018. Mizuhara began placing bets with an illegal bookmaker from September 2021. Saddled with debt, he used Ohtani's bank login details over the next two and a half years to gain unfettered access to his salary.\n\nHe also changed the security protocols on Ohtani's account so the bank would call Mizuhara to verify any wire transfers, according to prosecutors.\n\nThe government says the interpreter siphoned almost $17 million from Ohtani's accounts. He faces more than 30 years in prison.\n\nDespite the distractions from the scandal, Ohtani is having a big season for the Dodgers, who are on top of the National League West. He's leading the team in batting average, home runs and hits.\n\nAn arm injury has prevented him from pitching this year.

A 33-page record of the deal, in which Mizuhara, 39, agreed to plead guilty to one count of felony bank fraud and one count of subscribing to a false tax return, was filed on Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles.\n\nJapanese baseball great Shohei Ohtani's former interpreter has agreed to plead guilty to federal charges he fraudulently wired nearly $17 million stolen from the athlete's bank account to pay off his own gambling debts, court records showed on Wednesday. The plea agreement between federal prosecutors and Ippei Mizuhara, the onetime translator and de facto manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers' power-hitting pitcher, was announced by the U.S. Attorney's Office in L.A., where the case was first brought last month.\n\nA 33-page record of the deal, in which Mizuhara, 39, agreed to plead guilty to one count of felony bank fraud and one count of subscribing to a false tax return, was filed on Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. A federal bank fraud conviction carries a statutory maximum sentence of 30 years in prison, with the tax offense punishable by up to three years behind bars. The tax charge was added to the case in conjunction with the plea deal.\n\nMizuhara is due to appear at a formal arraignment before a U.S. magistrate on May 14. He would likely enter his plea at a subsequent hearing before a federal district judge and be sentenced sometime after that, according to a U.S. attorney spokesperson. In the meantime, Mizuhara remains free on $25,000 bond on condition he complies with a judge's order last month requiring him to undergo gambling addiction treatment and refrain from any contact with bookmakers, gambling establishments or Ohtani.\n\nMizuhara was accused of embezzling nearly $17 million from a bank account of Ohtani's that Mizuhara had helped open in Phoenix in 2018, and transferring the funds without the ballplayer's knowledge to an illegal bookmaking operation to cover Mizuhara's gambling debts. Announcing the original bank fraud charge on April 11, U.S. Attorney E. Martin Estrada stressed there was nothing to suggest wrongdoing by Ohtani, who signed a record $700 million, 10-year contract to join the Dodgers this season, becoming the highest paid player in Major League Baseball.\n\nOhtani, 29, whose talents as a slugger and a pitcher have earned him comparisons to Babe Ruth, has said he was an unwitting victim of theft and has never bet on baseball or knowingly paid a bookmaker. The allegations against Mizuhara, stemming from a wider federal probe of illegal sports gambling, surfaced during the Dodgers' season-opening series in Seoul, South Korea.\n\nThe outcome spared the Dodgers and the league a potential scandal of epic proportions, recalling the uproar stirred 35 years ago when Pete Rose was accused of gambling on baseball while he played for and managed the Cincinnati Reds. Rose, who later admitted to wagering on MLB games but not against his own team, ended up permanently banned from baseball in 1989. According to prosecutors, Mizuhara began gambling with an illegal sports book in late 2021 and lost substantial sums.\n\nTo cover his debts, Mizuhara impersonated Ohtani over the phone on more than two dozen occasions to deceive bank employees into authorizing wire transfers from Ohtani's account, where the player's baseball salary was deposited, prosecutors said. A longtime trusted confidante and driver for Ohtani, Mizuhara regularly interacted with the ballplayers' sports agents and financial advisors on behalf of the baseball star, who did not speak English, according to prosecutors.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ippei_Mizuhara", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ippei Mizuhara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "De facto"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bank fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmaker_(gambling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bookmaker (gambling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_interpretation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Language interpretation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Problem gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embezzlement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Embezzlement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Statute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arraignment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arraignment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magistrate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Magistrate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._Martin_Estrada", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "E.

Audero ordered Mizuhara to seek the treatment as a condition of his bond in the sports betting case. Michael G. Freedman, the interpreter's attorney, said his client had planned to do so anyway.\n\nWhile he is best known as Ohtani's voice in ballparks across the country, Mizuhara only spoke on Friday to answer the judge's questions, saying \"yes\" when Audero asked if he understood several parts of the case.\n\nMizuhara hopes to \"reach an agreement with the government to resolve this case as quickly as possible so that he can take responsibility,\" Freedman said in a statement issued after the hearing ended.\n\nHe added that his client \"wishes to apologize to Mr. Ohtani, the Dodgers, Major League Baseball, and his family.\"\n\nA criminal complaint filed April 11 detailed the alleged scheme through evidence that included text messages, financial records and recordings of phone calls. Mizuhara's winning bets totaled over $142 million, which he deposited in his own bank account and not Ohtani's. But his losing bets were around $183 million, a net loss of nearly $41 million. He did not wager on baseball.\n\nOther bond conditions stipulate that Mizuhara cannot gamble, either electronically or in-person, go inside any gambling establishments or associate with any known bookmakers.\n\nMizuhara was released after the hearing on an unsecured $25,000 bond, colloquially known as a signature bond, meaning he did not have to put up any cash or collateral to be freed.

The bank fraud charge carries a possible prison term of up to 30 years, while the tax charge carries up to three years in federal prison.\n\nA date has not yet set for him to enter the plea. His initial arraignment is scheduled for Tuesday.\n\n\"The extent of this defendant's deception and theft is massive,\" U.S. Attorney Martin Estrada said in a statement. \"He took advantage of his position of trust to take advantage of Mr. Ohtani and fuel a dangerous gambling habit. My office is committed to vindicating victims throughout our community and ensuring that wrongdoers face justice.\"\n\nOhtani was charged last month with bank fraud and surrendered to federal authorities on April 12. He was released on $25,000 bond.\n\nWhen the criminal case was announced, Estrada said Mizuhara had an \"insatiable appetite\" for illegal sports betting, which landed him millions of dollars in debt to a bookmaker and led him to transferring money out of Ohtani's bank account without his knowledge.\n\nMizuhara worked as an interpreter for Ohtani since the slugger joined the Angels organization six years ago. In that capacity, he helped Ohtani set up a bank account in Arizona, which eventually became the source of wire transfers to the illegal gambling operation, Estrada said.\n\nEstrada stressed that Ohtani was a victim in the case and had no knowledge of Mizuhara's actions.\n\nAccording to Estrada, Mizuhara also allegedly lied to bank officials, and he was captured on tape-recorded calls impersonating Ohtani to \"convince the bank to approve large wire transfers of large amounts of money to the bookmakers.\"\n\nEstrada said Mizuhara's acted \"to plunder\" Ohtani's bank account to satisfy his \"insatiable appetite for illegal sports betting,\" and he \"committed fraud on a massive scale.\"\n\nAccording to an affidavit filed in federal court by Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigations special agent Chris Seymour, records obtained from a source within the illegal gambling operation showed that between December 2021 and January 2024, about 19,000 wagers were attributed to Mizuhara, averaging roughly 25 per day and ranging in amounts from about $10 to $160,000.\n\nDuring that period, the records showed Mizuhara had winning bets worth nearly $142.3 million, and losing bets of $182.9 million, leaving him with a roughly $40.7 million deficit.\n\nSeymour wrote in the document that Mizuhara was acting as a \"de facto manager\" for Ohtani, and he began placing bets with the illegal gambling operation in late 2021. At about that time, bank records showed that the contact information on the Arizona bank account, which was opened in March 2018, was changed to a phone number and email linked to Mizuhara.\n\nThe Dodgers fired Mizuhara earlier this year when news of the criminal investigation broke.\n\nAt a subsequent news conference, Ohtani denied any knowledge of Mizuhara's actions. He also vehemently denied that he was involved in any gambling activity.\n\n\"I never bet on baseball or any other sports or never have asked somebody to bet on my behalf,\" he insisted.\n\nOhtani said Mizuhara \"has been stealing money from my account and has told lies.\"\n\nEstrada said none of the illegal bets allegedly placed by Mizuhara were on baseball games.\n\nAccording to various reports, wire transfers were made from Ohtani's bank account to an illegal bookmaking operation allegedly run Orange County resident Mathew Bowyer, who is under federal investigation.\n\nBowyer's San Juan Capistrano home was searched by federal agents last year.\n\nProsecutors said Wednesday Mizuhara also took money from Ohtani's account to pay other expenses, including $60,000 in dental work and $325,000 worth of baseball cards.\n\nThe false tax return charge stems from 2022 when Mizuhara falsified his taxable income by claiming only $136,865, when in fact the figure was more than $4.1 million stemming from his bank fraud, prosecutors said. He admits in his plea agreement that he owes more than $1.1 million in taxes for 2022.", "source": {"uri": "mynewsla.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "My News LA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_account", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bank account"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bank fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaming_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaming law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ippei_Mizuhara", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ippei Mizuhara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmaker_(gambling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bookmaker (gambling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_return_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tax return (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire_transfer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wire transfer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_prison", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal prison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deception", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_betting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports betting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Theft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arraignment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arraignment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Special agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_procedure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Criminal procedure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internal Revenue Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affidavit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Affidavit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "De facto"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Juan_Capistrano,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Juan Capistrano, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Juan Capistrano, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_County,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orange County, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orange County, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Holding_Companies", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Holding Companies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Boats", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions/Boats", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment_Associations", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Payment Associations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/mynewsla.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/MNLA-Facebook.jpg?fit=640%2C360&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551167", "eventUri": "eng-9551167", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-12", "textStart": 1057, "textEnd": 1065}, {"amb": false, "date": "2018-03-", "textStart": 3002, "textEnd": 3012}], "sentiment": -0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

Instead, the two-way superstar will be the subject of a scripted TV series about his friend and former interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara, who stole almost $17 million from him to pay off illegal gambling debts, Lionsgate Television announced Thursday.\n\nTony Award winner and producer Scott Delman, who has credits on Broadway shows from \"Mean Girls\" to \"The Book of Mormon\" as well as serving as executive producer on \"Station Eleven,\" and former Sports Illustrated reporter Albert Chen, author of the sports gambling book \"Billion Dollar Fantasy,\" are behind the untitled project.\n\n\"This is Major League Baseball's biggest sports gambling scandal since Pete Rose - and at its center is its biggest star, one that MLB has hitched its wagon on,\" Chen said in a statement. \"We'll get to the heart of the story - a story of trust, betrayal and the trappings of wealth and fame.\"\n\nThe announcement comes a day after the Department of Justice announced that Mizuhara has agreed to plead guilty to one count of bank fraud and one count of subscribing to a false tax return. Mizuhara, who served as Ohtani's interpreter with the Angels and the Dodgers before being fired on the first day of the 2024 MLB season, used his access to Ohtani's bank accounts to pay off millions of dollars owed to an illicit bookmaker in California, where sports betting is illegal. According to prosecutors, after going to a Phoenix bank with Ohtani to open a bank account, Mizuhara changed the security protocols on the account so bank employees would call him, rather than Ohtani, with any questions. Mizuhara impersonated Ohtani in calls with bank employees at least 24 times, according to the U.S Attorney's Office for the Central District of California.\n\nMizuhara also used Ohtani's accounts to buy $325,000 worth of baseball cards on eBay and other online resellers in order to flip them and profit himself. In September 2023, Ohtani agreed to pay for Mizuhara's $60,000 dental work and provided him with a check. Instead, according to prosecutors, Mizuhara paid the bill with Ohtani's debit card and deposited the check into his personal account.\n\nProsecutors have labeled Ohtani a victim and said he had no role in Mizuhara's gambling.\n\n\"The extent of this defendant's deception and theft is massive,\" United States Attorney Martin Estrada said in a statement Wednesday. \"He took advantage of his position of trust to take advantage of Mr. Ohtani and fuel a dangerous gambling habit. My office is committed to vindicating victims throughout our community and ensuring that wrongdoers face justice.\"\n\nMizuhara faces a maximum sentence of 33 years in prison, five years of supervised release and a fine of $1,250,000. He will also required to pay full restitution to his victims, which includes $16,975,010 to Ohtani, and $1,149,400 to the IRS for lying on his 2022 tax return.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com",

Mizuhara's losses from betting began to mount, and he soon found himself \"indebted to the bookmaker.\" Starting in November '21 and running through March of this year, Mizuhara impersonated Ohtani 24 times and stole millions out of Ohtani's bank account via numerous wire transfers.\n\n\"Mr. Mizuhara exploited his relationship with Mr. Ohtani to bankroll his own irresponsibility,\" Tyler Hatcher, special agent in charge of the Los Angeles Field Office's IRS criminal investigation division, said in a statement.\n\nMizuhara filed a 2022 tax return that he admitted was false, reporting to the IRS that his total taxable income was $136,865, but failing to include additional income of $4.1 million, according to his plea agreement. Mizuhara then admitted that he actually owes roughly $1,149,400 in additional taxes as well as interest and penalties.\n\nAs part of the plea deal, Mizuhara \"will be required to pay full restitution to\" Ohtani. The nearly $17 million he stole from the Dodgers star covered less than half of the $41 million he found himself in the hole to the bookmaker, Mathew Bowyer. Bowyer has not yet been charged with a crime but is being investigated by federal authorities.", "source": {"uri": "frontofficesports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Front Office Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "a_j_perez@frontofficesports.com", "name": "A.J.

Estrada said he quickly became indebted to the bookmaker.\n\nAs his gambling debts mounted, Mizuhara \"orchestrated a scheme to deceive and cheat the bank to fraudulently obtain money from the account,\" Estrada said.\n\nFrom November 2021 to March 2024, Estrada said Mizuhara used Ohtani's login information to access the Phoenix bank account and change its security protocols without Ohtani's knowledge.\n\nThe changed information meant a bank employee would call Mizuhara instead of Ohtani when verifying wire transfers from Ohtani's account to the bookmaker and the bookmaker's associates to pay gambling debts.\n\nEstrada said Mizuhara also called the bank and impersonated Ohtani on 24 occasions.\n\nDuring one occasion, Estrada said, Mizuhara transferred $500,000 from Ohtani's account to one of the bookmaker's associates. He also used Ohtani's banking information to pay for a $60,000 dental bill and deposited a check drawn from a separate bank in the same amount into his personal bank account.\n\nEstrada also said Mizuhara used Ohtani's banking information to buy $325,000 worth of baseball bards from online resellers from January through March and intended to resell them for his own benefit.\n\nMizuhara also refused to provide Ohtani's banking information to the baseball player's sports agent and financial advisers, saying Ohtani didn't want anyone to access the account.\n\nEstrada said Mizuhara had stolen more than $16.98 million from Ohtani by that point and was hiding the transactions.\n\nMizuhara also allegedly falsely filed a 2022 federal tax return claiming $136,865 in income without reporting an additional $4.1 million obtained through his scheme to defraud Ohtani.\n\nEstrada said Mizuhara owes $1.15 million in unpaid federal taxes, plus penalties and interest, for the 2022 tax year.\n\nMizuhara's plea agreement was filed Wednesday.

Ohtani, who was born in Japan, was known as a two-way player (a hitter and a pitcher) and was signed to a 10-year, $700 million deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2023 -- considered one of the largest contracts in sports history. Before that, Ohtani made his American debut with the Los Angeles Angels in 2018, which is how he came to be associated with Mizuhara.\n\nMizuhara was hired to be a Japanese-language interpreter for Ohtani around the same time as the Angels signing. They had initially met in Japan in 2013. When Ohtani moved to the U.S., Mizuhara offered to be his interpreter. His duties also included driving and, prosecutors say, being \"a de facto manager and gatekeeper.\"\n\nAccording to court documents, on March 8, 2018, Mizuhara accompanied Ohtani to a bank in Phoenix, Arizona, to help him open a bank account to deposit his payroll salary. Importantly, Mizuhara also interpreted for Ohtani when the bank employee provided the login information for the account on the bank's website.\n\nBeginning in or about September 2021, Mizuhara started placing sports bets with an illegal bookmaker. He also began to lose. According to the complaint, he owed his bookmaker over one million dollars in losses. Remarkably, the bookmaker continued to increase his betting limits. On November 14, 2022, prosecutors say that Mizuhara texted his bookmaker, \"I'm terrible at this sport betting thing huh? Lol . . . Any chance u can bump me again?? As you know, you don't have to worry about me not paying!!\"\n\nMizuhara continued to place bets, and his bookmaker continued to give him bumps -- increases in limits -- despite the losses. On or about June 24, 2023, Mizuhara messaged his bookmaker, \"I have a problem lol. . . . Can I get one last last last bump? This one is for real. . . . Last one for real[.]\"\n\nHe often said it was the last time. Only it wasn't.\n\n(Notably, records do not reflect any bets on baseball games.)\n\nSince he couldn't pay his debts, Mizuhara took money from Ohtani's bank account. He also changed the registered email address and phone number online so that bank employees would call him and not Ohtani when attempting to verify wire transfers. To make the scheme work, he also contacted the bank pretending to be Ohtani on approximately 24 occasions. That allowed him to wire millions of dollars to the bookmaker.\n\nHe didn't just use the money for gambling. When he needed dental work -- $60,000 worth -- Ohtani agreed to pay for it and authorized a check. Mizuhara took the check and deposited it into his account, but he used Ohtani's debit card to pay for the dental work, pocketing the extra.\n\nAccording to the plea agreement, Mizuhara bought approximately $325,000 worth of baseball cards online using sites like Etsy. The cards were paid for using Ohtani's account and included Yogi Berra, Juan Soto, and, ironically, Ohtani. The complaint notes that when investigators took control of Mizuhara's briefcase and boxes, they found approximately 1,000 baseball cards (it isn't clear from the plea agreement whether all of the cards found were purchased using Ohtani's money, but they did confirm $325,000 in purchases).\n\nIn total, Mizuhara pleaded to fraudulently obtaining more than $16,975,010 from Ohtani's account.\n\nAt tax time, he told a different story. He reported to the IRS that, in 2022, his total taxable income was $136,865. By law, you have to report illegally gotten gains -- and he didn't report $4,100,000 that he stole that year. He also claimed that he was single when he was married. As a result of the false information on the return, Mizuhara owes additional taxes of approximately $1,149,400 for tax year 2022 (before interest and penalties).\n\nThe complaint against Mizuhara was filed on April 11, 2024. The plea shortens what would likely have been a lengthy -- and distracting trial -- involving Ohtani. Mizuhara could have been sentenced to 33 years in jail, but under the plea agreement, prosecutors will recommend a reduced sentence. The plea agreement also requires Mizuhara to pay full restitution to Ohtani.\n\nMizuhara is represented by Michael G. Freedman of Los Angeles, California. A request for comment made earlier this morning was not immediately returned.\n\nMizuhara also notified the court through his lawyers that his matter may be related to six additional cases previously assigned to Judge Dolly M. Gee. Those cases arise out of the same investigation of \"illegal sports bookmaking organizations operating in Southern California.\"\n\nIRS-Criminal Investigation (CI) was involved in the Mizuhara case. Chris Seymour, a Special Agent of CI since February 2001, provided the affidavit in the original complaint. According to the complaint, IRS-CI, as well as agents of the Department of Homeland Security -- Homeland Security Investigations -- have been investigating illegal sports bookmaking organizations operating in Southern California and the laundering of the proceeds of these operations through casinos in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nAs part of CI's investigation, Seymour also interviewed Ohtani and examined related evidence since Mizuhara initially suggested that Ohtani either knew about the debts or was somehow involved. As detailed in the complaint, CI concluded that Ohtani was not involved.\n\nPointedly, in a March 20, 2024, text, Mizuhara knew this was all about to blow up and texted the bookmaker, \"Have you seen the reports?\" The bookmaker responded, \"Yes, but that's all bullshit. Obviously you didn't steal from him. I understand it's a cover job I totally get it.\" Mizuhara replied, \"Technically I did steal from him. it's all over for me.\"", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

The interpreter allegedly lost more than $40 million across about some 19,000 wagers.\n\nAfter turning himself in April 12, Mizuhara made his initial court appearance in shackles.

Wednesday.\n\nIppei Mizuhara, 39, will plead guilty to one count of bank fraud -- punishable by up to 30 years in prison -- and one count of filing a false tax return, which carries a maximum sentence of three years, the Justice Department said.\n\nFederal prosecutors have said Mizuhara -- Ohtani's long-time friend and confidant -- plundered millions from the Los Angeles Dodgers ace's bank account to fund an \"insatiable appetite\" for gambling.\n\nMizuhara is expected to formally enter his guilty plea in the coming weeks, with arraignment scheduled to take place in Los Angeles on May 14.\n\n\"The extent of this defendant's deception and theft is massive,\" United States Attorney Martin Estrada said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\n\"He took advantage of his position of trust to

record-breaking $700 million deal -- the richest contract in North American sports history.\n\nTyler Hatcher, special agent in charge from the Internal Revenue Service's criminal investigation unit, said the probe had revealed Mizuhara \"not only stole from Mr Ohtani, but also that he lied to the IRS about his income.\n\n\"\n\n\"Mr Mizuhara exploited his relationship with Mr Ohtani to bankroll

season got under way in March, stunning the sports world and potentially embroiling Ohtani in scandal.\n\nProsecutors have repeatedly emphasized that Ohtani was an innocent victim of Mizuhara's deception, and that there was no evidence to suggest the Dodgers star was aware of or involved in illegal gambling.\n\nMajor League Baseball's gambling policy bars \"any player, umpire, or club or

He also wrote the 2019 book Billion Dollar Fantasy about the rise of FanDuel and DraftKings in the sports betting world.\n\nDelman's previous television credit was as a producer on the 2021 limited series Station Eleven.\n\nOhtani was at the center of a gambling scandal involving Mizuhara. In an interview with ESPN's Tisha Thompson, Mizuhara initially said Ohtani sat with him and transferred the money in $500,000 increments in several different settings.\n\nThompson noted a spokesman disavowed Mizuhara's account shortly before the story was set to publish and Mizuhara said he had not been truthful and Ohtani was not involved in any of the situation.\n\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers fired Mizuhara, who had been working as Ohtani's interpreter since his first MLB season in 2018, on March 20 amid questions surrounding at least $4.5 million in wire transfers from Ohtani's bank account to a bookmaking operation in Southern California that was under federal investigation.\n\nDuring his first press conference after the scandal broke, Ohtani said via interpreter Will Ireton he had no knowledge of Mizuhara's gambling.\n\nAn affidavit filed by federal authorities on April 11 stated Mizuhara stole more than $16 million from Ohtani over a two-year period. The complaint also noted Mizuhara was averaging 25 bets per day ranging from $10 to $160,000 per wager during a period from December 2021 to January 2024.\n\nA betting spreadsheet obtained by authorities showed a \"net balance of negative $40,678,436\" from $142 million in total winnings and total losses of $183 million.\n\nFederal authorities announced on April 11 that Ohtani was cleared of any wrongdoing and a victim in the case.\n\nProsecutors said on Wednesday that Mizuhara will plead guilty to bank and tax fraud in which he is alleged to have stolen close to $17 million from Ohtani. The charge of bank fraud carries a maximum sentence of 30 years in prison. The false tax return charge carries a prison sentence of up to three years.\n\nMizuhara will also be required to pay restitution to Ohtani and the IRS as part of his guilty plea.", "source": {"uri": "bleacherreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleacher Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adam_wells@bleacherreport.com", "name": "Adam Wells", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_betting", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sports betting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ippei_Mizuhara", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ippei Mizuhara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hollywood, Los Angeles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Rose", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pete Rose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionsgate_Television", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lionsgate Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports Illustrated"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenplay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Screenplay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DraftKings", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DraftKings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FanDuel", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FanDuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniseries", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miniseries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Film producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmaker_(gambling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bookmaker (gambling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_evasion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tax evasion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internal Revenue Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affidavit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Affidavit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Southern California"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://media.bleacherreport.com/image/upload/c_fill,g_faces,w_3800,h_2000,q_95/v1715267581/zgqiipudlysnru3iitp9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551167", "eventUri": "eng-9551167", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-20", "textStart": 1463, "textEnd": 1471}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-11", "textStart": 1843, "textEnd": 1851, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

agreed to plead guilty over charges of illegally transferring nearly $17 million from the baseball star's bank account in order to pay off gambling debts, the United States Justice Department said Wednesday.\n\nIppei Mizuhara, 39, will plead guilty to one count of bank fraud -- punishable by up to 30 years in prison -- and one count of filing a false tax return, which carries a maximum sentence of three years, the Justice Department said.\n\nFederal prosecutors have said Mizuhara -- Ohtani's long-time friend and confidant -- plundered millions from the Los Angeles Dodgers ace's bank account to fund an \"insatiable appetite\" for gambling.\n\nMizuhara is expected to formally enter his guilty plea in the coming weeks, with arraignment scheduled to take place in Los Angeles on May 14.\n\n\"The extent of this defendant's deception and theft is massive,\" United States Attorney Martin Estrada said in a statement on Wednesday.\n\n\"He took advantage of his position of trust to take advantage of Mr Ohtani and fuel a dangerous gambling habit,\" Estrada added.\n\nJapanese sensation Ohtani, currently the biggest star in baseball, joined the Dodgers last December in a record-breaking $700 million deal -- the richest contract in North American sports history.\n\nTyler Hatcher, special agent in charge from the Internal Revenue Service's criminal investigation unit, said the probe had revealed Mizuhara \"not only stole from Mr Ohtani, but also that he lied to the IRS about his income.\"\n\n\"Mr Mizuhara exploited his relationship with Mr Ohtani to bankroll his own irresponsibility,\" Hatcher said in a statement.\n\nMizuhara's guilty plea had been expected.\n\nAfter an initial court appearance last month, his lawyer said he wished to apologize to \"Ohtani, the Dodgers, and Major League Baseball\" for his actions and sought a swift resolution so he can \"take responsibility.\"", "source": {"uri": "urdupoint.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Mizuhara, who was friends with Shohei Ohtani for 11 years, faces a potential 33-year prison sentence and more than $1 million in fines. He will formally plead guilty and receive \"a reduced sentence,\" Lavigne added:\n\n\"A sentencing date has not been set. The total maximum sentence Mizuhara could receive for both crimes would be 33 years imprisonment and fines of $1.25 million, but in exchange for his plea -- outlined in the agreement released Wednesday -- prosecutors would recommend a reduced sentence. The plea agreement says Mizuhara will be required to pay full restitution, or $16,975,010, to Ohtani.\"\n\nThe news of Mizuhara's alleged involvement with an illegal bookmaker came out in March. The allegations became front-page news because many fans naturally began to wonder if Ohtani himself was engaged in illegal gambling activities.\n\nMizuhara was fired by the Dodgers, and Ohtani told reporters that he has never engaged in sports betting, nor has he asked anybody to do it for him. Ohtani told reporters that Mizuhara took his money and spread misinformation about the two-way star.\n\nAlso Read: Leaked Text Messages Expose Shocking Admission From Shohei Ohtani's Interpreter Ippei Mizuhara\n\nMizuhara allegedly gave the illegal bookmaker, Mathew Boyer, $4.5 million that came from Ohtani's bank account.

Ohtani is batting a ridiculous .355 (his career-high BA is .304 from last season) with 11 home runs, 27 RBI and an OPS of 1.103.\n\nOhtani, Mookie Betts, Freddie Freeman and Max Muncy have been practically unstoppable together at the top of the Dodgers' lineup.

The news broke following the Los Angeles Dodgers' first game of the season against the San Diego Padres in South Korea.\n\n\"Ippei Mizuhara, ex-interpreter of Major League Baseball star Shohei Ohtani, agreed to plead guilty to federal charges after illegally transferring $17 million from Ohtani's bank account and without his knowledge, to pay off Mizuhara's own gambling debts\" - @Reuters\n\nThe controversial former translator has reportedly agreed to plead guilty to one count of bank fraud. This comes with a maximum of 30 years in prison. He has also agreed to plead guilty to submitting a false tax return, which comes with a prison sentence of up to three years. It remains to be seen how long Mizuhara could be behind bars. However, it is clear that his punishment will be severe.\n\nThe once-beloved interpreter saw his reputation destroyed after the news of his illegal gambling and \"massive theft\" from Shohei Ohtani made headlines.

He was initially charged with one count of bank fraud, which carries a potential 30-year prison sentence.\n\nMizuhara exploited his personal and professional relationship with Ohtani to plunder millions from the two-way player's account for years, at times impersonating Ohtani to bankers, prosecutors said. Mizuhara's winning bets totaled over $142 million, which he deposited in his own bank account and not Ohtani's. But his losing bets were around $183 million, a net loss of nearly $41 million. He did not wager on baseball.\n\nThere was no evidence that Ohtani was involved in or aware of Mizuhara's gambling, and the player is cooperating with investigators, authorities said.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times and ESPN broke the news of the prosecution in late March, prompting the Dodgers to fire the interpreter and MLB to open its own investigation.\n\nMLB rules prohibit players and team employees from wagering on baseball, even legally. MLB also bans betting on other sports with illegal or offshore bookmakers.\n\nMizuhara has been free on an unsecured $25,000 bond, colloquially known as a signature bond, meaning he did not have to put up any cash or collateral to be freed. If he violates the bond conditions -- which include a requirement to undergo gambling addiction treatment -- he will be on the hook for $25,000.\n\nOhtani has sought to focus on the field as the case winds through the courts. Hours after his ex-interpreter first appeared in court in April, he hit his 175th home run in MLB, tying Hideki Matsui for the most by a Japan-born player, during the Dodgers' 8-7 loss to the San Diego Padres in 11 innings.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@aol.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ippei_Mizuhara", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ippei Mizuhara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_betting", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sports betting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_evasion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tax evasion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-way_player", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Two-way player"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmaker_(gambling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bookmaker (gambling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hideki_Matsui", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hideki Matsui"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Times"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/International", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/International", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/CudHZ4Mdl7JNOenvb3ejUQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD05MDE-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_associated_press_484/bf6bb159cc53c11124f8ce72c0faf588", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551167", "eventUri": "eng-9551167", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

Mizuhara's arraignment is scheduled for May 14.\n\n\"The extent of this defendant's deception and theft is massive,\" said United States Attorney Martin Estrada. \"He took advantage of his position of trust to take advantage of Mr. Ohtani and fuel a dangerous gambling habit. My office is committed to vindicating victims throughout our community and ensuring that wrongdoers face justice.\"\n\n\"Our joint investigation with Homeland Security Investigations clearly showed Mr. Mizuhara not only stole from Mr. Ohtani, but also that he lied to the IRS about his income,\" said Special Agent in Charge Tyler Hatcher, IRS Criminal Investigation, Los Angeles Field Office. \"Mr. Mizuhara exploited his relationship with Mr. Ohtani to bankroll his own irresponsibility. In cases where we are able to identify them, we make every effort to make things right for victims, and this is one of those cases.\"\n\nAccording to the plea agreement, Mizuhara helped Ohtani set up a bank account for the ballplayer in March 2018. In September 2021, Mizuhara started placing bets on various sporting events with an illegal bookmaker not named in the agreement but reported elsewhere as Orange County (CA)-based Mathew Bowyer. Mizuhara quickly ran up massive debts. He arranged to cover them by first accessing the bank account he helped Ohtani set up, then modifying the account information so any inquiries about activity regarding it would be directed to him, not Ohtani.\n\nMizuhara impersonated Ohtani when the bank where the account was located attempted to contact Ohtani regarding different actions.\n\nFor example, on or about February 2, 2022, Bank A denied an attempted wire transfer. Defendant then called Bank A to complete the wire transfer. During the call, defendant falsely identified himself as Victim A (Ohtani) and falsely stated that he was attempting to wire funds to an associate of the bookmaker for a car loan. The bank employee attempted to verify the caller by sending a six-digit code via text message to the registered phone number on the (bank) Account. Because defendant had already changed the registered phone number on the account, the bank's text message was sent to defendant. Defendant then read the six-digit code back to the Bank A employee and completed the wire transfer. In total, defendant called Bank A and impersonated Victim A (Ohtani) on approximately 24 occasions.\n\nMizuhara also charged $60K worth of dental work to Ohtani's bank account after Ohtani had given him a separate check for the amount, depositing the check in his bank account for personal use. Mizuhara also purchased $325K of baseball cards, including Ohtani's, from sellers such as eBay, using funds drawn from Ohtani's bank account to resell them later.\n\nNaturally, a story such as this will evoke gossip centered on Mizuhara taking the fall for Ohtani. That said, it is at best extremely difficult to envision this amount of evidence being detailed as part of a grand conspiracy on Ohtani's behalf. The story does point out an uncomfortable truth in the modern sports era, that being the increasing alliance between sports and gambling.\n\nA prime example is how if you look up the April 17, 2024 news story on the NBA's website regarding the league banning player Jontay Porter for gambling-related offenses, elsewhere on the site you can read NBA DraftKings & FanDuel DFS Primer: May 8.\n\nThis case raises serious concerns about the integrity of sports and the potential for exploitation by the gambling industry.

Furthermore, there will most likely be a significant reduction in sentence length.\n\nAsserting that Mizuhara \"exploited his relationship\" with Shohei Ohtani, the government will concede that Mizuhara transferred about $17 million of Ohtani's money covertly to settle gambling debts.

Reports say Boyajian and Bowyer would \"clean\" the illegal money at casinos in Las Vegas.\n\nOhtani, who is non-English speaking, depended on Mizuhara for almost everything when he first came to the United States from Japan.

The DOJ claims that Ippei started placing bets on athletic events in September 2021 and soon incurred a massive debt from a bookie but kept making bets.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\nIppei Mizuhara, the former interpreter for Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani, is expected to enter a guilty plea on one count of bank fraud and one count of subscribing to a false tax return, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California.\n\nMizuhara has been accused of embezzling millions of dollars and allegedly using the ill-gotten gains to cover gambling debts. He will likely formally enter the plea at some point in the next few weeks. Mizuhara is scheduled to be arraigned on May 14, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\n\"The extent of this defendant's deception and theft is massive,\" U.S. Attorney Martin Estrada said in a statement. \"He took advantage of his position of trust to take advantage of Mr. Ohtani and fuel a dangerous gambling habit. My office is committed to vindicating victims throughout our community and ensuring that wrongdoers face justice.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nFederal authorities discovered that Mizuhara stole an estimated $17 million. He will be required to pay full restitution to Ohtani as a condition of the plea agreement.\n\nJOHNNY DAMON WEIGHS IN ON SHOHEI OHTANI CONTROVERSY, CALLS FOR PETE ROSE TO BE IN HALL OF FAME\n\nFederal investigators filed a complaint against Mizuhara on April 11. One day later, he turned himself into law enforcement, the Department of Justice confirmed.\n\nU.S. Attorney Martin Estrada said Mizuhara was so intertwined in Ohtani's life and career that he became the star's \"de facto manager.\" The role enabled him to withdraw money from the account -- at times lying and impersonating Ohtani to bank employees -- to finance his \"insatiable appetite for illegal sports betting.\"\n\n\"Ippei Mizuhara surrendered this morning to the custody of the United States Marshals Service,\" federal authorities said Friday in a statement sent to Fox News Digital.\n\nOhtanti publicly addressed the gambling scandal in late March, saying that he had never placed a sports bet and that Mizuhara's story about paying off his $4.5 million gambling debt was entirely fabricated.\n\n\"I never bet on baseball or any other sports, or never have asked somebody to do that on my behalf,\" Ohtani said through a new interpreter prior to the Dodgers' final spring training game. \"And never went through a bookmaker to bet on sports.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOhtani, who is the highest-paid player in Major League Baseball, said he was still trying to find his emotions after learning about the scandal.\n\n\"To summarize how I'm feeling right now, I'm just beyond shocked,\" Ohtani said. \"It's really hard to verbalize how I'm feeling at this point.\n\n\"I'm very saddened and shocked that someone who I trusted has done this.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fox News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

My office is committed to vindicating victims throughout our community and ensuring that wrongdoers face justice.\"\n\nMizuhara agreed that he stole $16.975 million from Ohtani, and that he filed a false tax return for 2022 showing $136,865 million in revenue when he in fact made more than $4.1 million. He owes $1.149 million in unpaid taxes to the federal government.\n\nInitial reports of the situation sparked widespread speculation that Mizuhara was simply acting as an intermediary for Ohtani. An affidavit filed last month raised a few questions as to whether that rabbit hole had been fully and completely explored. If Mizuhara is in any way covering for Ohtani, however, Mizuhara will have a long time to think about it, while in prison.\n\nWhile he likely won't get 33 years, he probably won't get 33 days, either. He'll eventually be sentenced on these charges.\n\nThe situation continues to be covered here because this new age of gambling, both legal and illegal (Mizuhara did it illegally in California), raises plenty of potential concerns for pro athletes and the leagues that govern them. Beyond the various things that players can do to create direct problems for themselves, they also can be victimized by those close to them -- in a way that will ring a bell that becomes very hard to unring. Indeed, some will still believe that Ohtani knew or at least should have known what was happening.\n\nWhile the language issues seemed to help Mizuhara lay the foundation for his scheme, others who are lured by piles of cash can come up with other plans based on access to it. All players need to be sure that their accounts are secure and cannot be compromised by someone who can start peeling off a few bucks (or a few million) here and there.", "source": {"uri": "nbcsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ippei_Mizuhara", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ippei Mizuhara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_guy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fall guy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_interpretation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Language interpretation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deception", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Theft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rabbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affidavit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Affidavit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://nbcsports.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/57a5700/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5159x2902+0+517/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnbc-sports-production-nbc-sports.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F95%2F90%2F0890a13e4a67ae6ebc3d925a81f4%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2152125852", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551167", "eventUri": "eng-9551167", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 197, "relevance": 1}

The plea agreement reached between federal prosecutors and Ohtani's onetime confidante, Ippei Mizuhara, 39, was announced on Wednesday by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles, where the interpreter was charged in a criminal complaint last month.\n\nA 33-page record of the deal, in which Mizuhara agreed to plead guilty to one count of felony bank fraud and one count of subscribing to a false tax return, was filed on Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. He is expected to formally enter the plea at an arraignment set for May 14, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office.\n\nA federal bank fraud conviction carries a statutory maximum sentence of 30 years in prison, with the tax offense punishable by up to three years behind bars.

Martin Estrada stressed there was nothing to suggest any wrongdoing by Ohtani, a power-hitting pitcher who signed a record $700 million, 10-year contract to join the Los Angeles Dodgers this season. He became the highest paid player in Major League Baseball. The allegations of theft leveled against Mizuhara surfaced during the Dodgers' season-opening series in Seoul, South Korea.\n\nThe outcome of the investigation spared the Dodgers and the league a potential scandal of epic proportions, recalling the controversy stirred 35 years ago when Pete Rose was accused of gambling on baseball games, including those of his own team, while he played for and managed the Cincinnati Reds.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ippei_Mizuhara", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ippei Mizuhara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bank fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embezzlement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Embezzlement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Statute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arraignment", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arraignment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._Martin_Estrada", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "E.

Boyajian, 47, and Bowyer, 49, were friends and business associates for nearly 20 years, according to the report.\n\nThe report comes on the same day Mizuhara pleaded guilty to two counts of bank fraud and subscribing to a false tax return. According to Meghann Cuniff of the Washington Post, Mizuhara could face up to nine years in federal prison:\n\nThe revelations are the latest in a still-unfolding saga involving MLB's highest-profile player. The Dodgers fired Mizuhara one day into their season, after he addressed the team and Ohtani separately to take responsibility for the theft of more than $16 million from Ohtani's bank account.\n\nOff the field, the fallout has been difficult to understate. In a rare and extensive public press conference, Ohtani claimed he was the victim of theft, disavowing any knowledge of or involvement in Mizuhara's gambling. In April, the Department of Justice held a press conference of its own, and released a 37-page complaint against Mizuhara that detailed the breadth of Mizuhara's gambling activities -- most of which occurred during Ohtani's time with the Los Angeles Angels.\n\n\"I want to emphasize this point: Mr. Ohtani is considered a victim in this case,\" U.S. Attorney E. Martin Estrada said at the time. \"There is no evidence Mr. Ohtani authorized the over $16 million of transfers.\"\n\nMajor League Baseball also said it would investigate the scandal on its own; the league is expected to clear Ohtani of any wrongdoing. Betting on baseball is explicitly prohibited by MLB rules. The federal investigation surfaced no evidence that even Mizuhara used Ohtani's money to wager on major league games.\n\nUnder the terms of the plea agreement, Mizuhara will be required to pay full restitution to his victims, which includes $16,975,010 to Ohtani and $1,149,400 to the IRS.\n\nMeanwhile, Ohtani has been unfazed by any off-the-field distractions. He entered Wednesday's game against the Miami Marlins leading MLB in batting average (.365), home runs (11), doubles (14), and runs scored (32). Ohtani is simultaneously throwing before games as he looks to return to the mound as a pitcher in the 2025 season.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jon_paul_hoornstra@newsweek.com", "name": "Jon Paul Hoornstra", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmaker_(gambling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bookmaker (gambling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ippei_Mizuhara", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ippei Mizuhara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Real_Housewives_of_Orange_County", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Real Housewives of Orange County"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Angels", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Angels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami Marlins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Double (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internal Revenue Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Run (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2390138/shohei-ohtani-ippei-mizuhara.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=69577cbe02f9b5b4d80bd0b73baacc7b", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551167", "eventUri": "eng-9551167", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

My office is committed to vindicating victims throughout our community and ensuring that wrongdoers face justice.\"\n\nMizuhara will plead guilty to one count of bank fraud and one count of filing a false tax return. The bank fraud charge carries a maximum federal prison sentence of 30 years, while the tax return charge can carry a three-year prison sentence.\n\nThe news of Mizuhara entering a plea deal isn't surprising, as reports surfaced last month that he was negotiating a deal with federal prosecutors.\n\nAn ESPN report released Wednesday uncovered that Mizuhara wired \"Real Housewives of Orange County\" star Ryan Boyajian the stolen Ohtani funds to pay off his gambling debts. Boyajian is an associate of Mathew Bowyer, the illegal bookmaker associated with Mizuhara's wagering.\n\nAccording to ESPN's report, Boyajian \"received immunity in the investigation in return for his testimony.\"\n\nMizuhara fell into a gambling debt in the early portion of this decade when wagering through Bowyer. Mizuhara, who helped Ohtani open bank accounts and had access to passwords and account information, transferred funds belonging to Ohtani to cover gambling losses. Mizuhara even impersonated Ohtani to bank employees on 24 occasions, according to the Justice Department's press release.\n\nIn 2019, Bowyer sent a message to a bettor that he owed a gambling debt of approximately $15,972. Bowyer, in turn, instructed the bettor to wire the funds to an account of an acquaintance, described in court records as \"Associate 1.\" Boyajian, according to ESPN, transferred some of Mizuhara's losses to marker accounts at Resorts World Las Vegas and Pechanga Resort Casino in California.\n\nThe individual named in the complaint as \"Associate 1,\" is Boyajian, ESPN reported Wednesday. A reputed VIP whale player in Vegas sports betting circles, Bowyer is one of the nation's largest illegal bookmakers, multiple sources told Sports Handle last month.\n\n\"Mr. Mizuhara exploited his relationship with Mr. Ohtani to bankroll his own irresponsibility,\" said Special Agent in Charge Tyler Hatcher, IRS criminal investigation, Los Angeles field office, via press release. \"In cases where we are able to identify them, we make every effort to make things right for victims, and this is one of those cases.\"", "source": {"uri": "sportshandle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SportsHandle"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bennett_conlin@sportshandle.com", "name": "Bennett Conlin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "matt_rybaltowski@sportshandle.com", "name": "Matt Rybaltowski", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bank fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ippei_Mizuhara", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ippei Mizuhara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_betting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports betting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Theft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arraignment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arraignment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmaker_(gambling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bookmaker (gambling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_prison", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal prison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reality television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_County,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orange County, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orange County, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resorts_World_Las_Vegas", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Resorts World Las Vegas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Criminal investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Special agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internal Revenue Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casino", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Casino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://sportshandle.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-2092456544-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551167", "eventUri": "eng-9551167", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-14", "textStart": 478, "textEnd": 484}], "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

He was initially charged with one count of bank fraud, which carries a potential 30-year prison sentence.\n\nMizuhara exploited his personal and professional relationship with Ohtani to plunder millions from the two-way player's account for years, at times impersonating Ohtani to bankers, prosecutors said. Mizuhara's winning bets totaled over $142 million, which he deposited in his own bank account and not Ohtani's. But his losing bets were around $183 million, a net loss of nearly $41 million. He did not wager on baseball.\n\nMLB rules prohibit players and team employees from wagering on baseball, even legally. MLB also bans betting on other sports with illegal or offshore bookmakers.\n\nMizuhara has been free on an unsecured $25,000 bond, colloquially known as a signature bond, meaning he did not have to put up any cash or collateral to be freed. If he violates the bond conditions -- which include a requirement to undergo gambling addiction treatment -- he will be on the hook for $25,000.\n\nOhtani has sought to focus on the field as the case winds through the courts.

Just this week, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of California announced that Mizuhara had agreed to plead guilty in the scandal.\n\nWhat happened with Shohei Ohtani and his interpreter?\n\nIn March, an ESPN investigation uncovered wire transfers of $500,000 from Ohtani's bank account to an illegal bookmaking operation.\n\nThe transfers were initially said to be made by Mizuhara with Ohtani's permission to help him pay off debts, but it was later uncovered that Ohtani likely had no knowledge of the wire transfers or his interpreter/friend's gambling issues.\n\nFollowing more investigation, Mizuhara was charged with felony bank fraud and submitting a false tax return after authorities found out that he had stolen nearly $17 million from Ohtani to pay off debts.

Those amounts could change prior to sentencing.\n\nMizuhara will enter his guilty plea in the coming weeks and is set to be arraigned May 14, prosecutors said.\n\n\"The extent of this defendant's deception and theft is massive,\" United States Attorney Martin Estrada said in a statement. \"He took advantage of his position of trust to take advantage of Mr. Ohtani and fuel a dangerous gambling habit.\"\n\nMizuhara exploited his personal and professional relationship with Ohtani to plunder millions from the two-way player's account for years, at times impersonating Ohtani to bankers, prosecutors said. Mizuhara's winning bets totaled over $142 million, which he deposited in his own bank account and not Ohtani's. But his losing bets were around $183 million, a net loss of nearly $41 million. He did not wager on baseball.\n\nThere was no evidence that Ohtani was involved in or aware of Mizuhara's gambling, and the player is cooperating with investigators, authorities said.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times and ESPN broke the news of the prosecution in late March, prompting the Dodgers to fire the interpreter and MLB to open its own investigation.\n\nMLB rules prohibit players and team employees from wagering on baseball, even legally. MLB also bans betting on other sports with illegal or offshore bookmakers.\n\nMizuhara has been free on an unsecured $25,000 bond, colloquially known as a signature bond, meaning he did not have to put up any cash or collateral to be freed. If he violates the bond conditions -- which include a requirement to undergo gambling addiction treatment -- he will be on the hook for $25,000.\n\nOhtani has sought to focus on the field as the case winds through the courts. Hours after his ex-interpreter first appeared in court in April, he hit his 175th home run in MLB, tying Hideki Matsui for the most by a Japan-born player, during the Dodgers' 8-7 loss to the San Diego Padres in 11 innings.\n\nChristopher Weber And Stefanie Dazio, The Associated Press", "source": {"uri": "lethbridgenewsnow.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lethbridge News Now"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Estrada_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marco Estrada (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internal Revenue Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Theft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-way_player", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Two-way player"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmaker_(gambling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bookmaker (gambling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hideki_Matsui", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hideki Matsui"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Problem gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gambling", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Gambling", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://d2ksr9467jthww.cloudfront.net/20240508210512/663beacb023d1607a379b74bjpeg.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551167", "eventUri": "eng-9551167", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-14", "textStart": 289, "textEnd": 295}], "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

He was initially charged with one count of bank fraud, which carries a potential 30-year prison sentence.\n\nMizuhara exploited his personal and professional relationship with Ohtani to plunder millions from the two-way player's account for years, at times impersonating Ohtani to bankers, prosecutors said. Mizuhara's winning bets totaled over $142 million, which he deposited in his own bank account and not Ohtani's. But his losing bets were around $183 million, a net loss of nearly $41 million. He did not wager on baseball.\n\nThere was no evidence that Ohtani was involved in or aware of Mizuhara's gambling, and the player is cooperating with investigators, authorities said.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times and ESPN broke the news of the prosecution in late March, prompting the Dodgers to fire the interpreter and MLB to open its own investigation.\n\nMLB rules prohibit players and team employees from wagering on baseball, even legally. MLB also bans betting on other sports with illegal or offshore bookmakers.\n\nMizuhara has been free on an unsecured $25,000 bond, colloquially known as a signature bond, meaning he did not have to put up any cash or collateral to be freed. If he violates the bond conditions - which include a requirement to undergo gambling addiction treatment - he will be on the hook for $25,000.\n\nOhtani has sought to focus on the field as the case winds through the courts.

Martin Estrada stressed there was nothing to suggest any wrongdoing by Ohtani, a power-hitting pitcher who signed a record $700 million, 10-year contract to join the Los Angeles Dodgers this season. He became the highest paid player in Major League Baseball.\n\nThe allegations of theft leveled against Mizuhara surfaced during the Dodgers' season-opening series in Seoul, South Korea.\n\nThe outcome of the investigation spared the Dodgers and the league a potential scandal of epic proportions, recalling the controversy stirred 35 years ago when Pete Rose was accused of gambling on baseball games, including those of his own team, while he played for and managed the Cincinnati Reds.\n\n(Reporting by Steve Gorman in Los AngelesEditing by Bill Berkrot)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

His arraignment has been rescheduled to May 14.\n\nRyan Boyajian, a current cast member of Bravo's reality TV series \"The Real Housewives of Orange County,\" is the bookmaker's associate to whom Ippei Mizuhara wired money to pay his gambling debts, per Tisha Thompson of ESPN:\n\n\"As first reported by ESPN, and later detailed in the criminal complaint against Mizuhara, Mathew Bowyer, the illegal bookmaker under investigation, told the interpreter he could pay his gambling debts by wiring money into the account of Bowyer's associate, known in the complaint as \"Associate 1.\"\n\nThat associate is Boyajian, who used the account with Bowyer for their real estate projects, according to the sources. Boyajian, 47, and Bowyer, 49, have been close friends and business associates for nearly 20 years. When Bowyer declared bankruptcy in 2011, court records show Boyajian loaned him $245,000.\"\n\nMizuhara first met Ohtani in 2013 when Mizuhara served as an interpreter for one of Ohtani's Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters teammates. When Ohtani got ready make the move from Japan to MLB, Mizuhara became Ohtani's personal interpreter. From that point forward, the two became close friends, working closely during Ohtani's six seasons with the Los Angeles Angels.\n\nDespite the off-field distraction, Ohtani is raking for the Dodgers so far this season.\n\nOhtani would be in the MVP conversation without question if the season ended today. He is currently slashing .370/.434/.705/1.135. His batting average, slugging, and OPS all lead the league. Additionally, Ohtani leads the league with 11 home runs, 14 doubles, 54 hits, 103 total bases, and a 220 OPS-plus.\n\nDodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw believes Ohtani is playing even better with the Dodgers than he did with the Los Angeles Angels, and it is important to remember that Shohei won two MVP awards while in Anaheim.\n\n\"I don't remember him being even this good in Anaheim,\" Kershaw recently said on the Dodgers broadcast. \"You look up and you watch the highlights... I don't remember him ever being on this kind of tear. This is unbelievable. Every ball that he hits, he's just so strong. I don't get it, I don't think anybody does... It's just amazing.\"\n\nThe Dodgers currently sit at 25-13 and lead the National League West standings by 6.5 games over the San Diego Padres.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType":

Executive Max Elins is overseeing the project for Lionsgate Television.\n\n\"With a strong track record of creating daring, boundary-pushing series, Lionsgate Television is the perfect partner to bring this unbelievable story to the screen,\" Delman said in a statement. \"In addition, Albert's extensive sports journalism background will enable us to connect the dots to make sense of the startling turn of events we've seen play out on the world stage.\"\n\n\"This is major league baseball's biggest sports gambling scandal since Pete Rose - and at its center is its biggest star, one that MLB has hitched its wagon on,\" Chen said. \"We'll get to the heart of the story - a story of trust, betrayal and the trappings of wealth and fame.\"\n\nOhtani this offseason signed a 10-year, $700 million contract with the Dodgers, who play just up the highway from his old team, the Angels. The Japanese two-way phenom, already flush with cash because of countless international licensing deals even before he hit free agency, is notoriously private and only reveals so much of his personal life. We only just learned this year that he secretly got married.\n\nBut when the Dodgers faced the San Diego Padres in an early season series in South Korea this March, ESPN broke a bombshell story in which Ohtani's name had been found on gambling receipts from a bookie in Anaheim. Mizuhara told reporters Ohtani helped him pay off $4 million worth of gambling debt and did so across numerous $500,000 transactions in a span of months.\n\nNot a day later, Mizuhara changed his story and was fired.

The bank fraud charge carries a maximum of 30 years in federal prison, and the false tax return charge carries a sentence of up to three years in federal prison.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Mizuhara's winning bets totaled over $142 million, which he deposited in his own bank account and not Ohtani's. But his losing bets were around $183 million, a net loss of nearly $41 million. He did not wager on baseball.\n\nThere was no evidence that Ohtani was involved in or aware of Mizuhara's gambling, and the player is cooperating with investigators, authorities said.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times and ESPN broke the news of the prosecution in late March, prompting the Dodgers to fire the interpreter and MLB to open its own investigation.\n\nMLB rules prohibit players and team employees from wagering on baseball, even legally. MLB also bans betting on other sports with illegal or offshore bookmakers.\n\nMizuhara has been free on an unsecured $25,000 bond, colloquially known as a signature bond, meaning he did not have to put up any cash or collateral to be freed. If he violates the bond conditions -- which include a requirement to undergo gambling addiction treatment -- he will be on the hook for $25,000.\n\nOhtani has sought to focus on the field as the case winds through the courts. Hours after his ex-interpreter first appeared in court in April, he hit his 175th home run in MLB, tying Hideki Matsui for the most by a Japan-born player, during the Dodgers' 8-7 loss to the San Diego Padres in 11 innings.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The interpreter was allegedly involved in a multi-million gambling scheme, stealing millions of dollars from his former friend, Shohei Ohtani.\n\nMizuhara served as the interpreter and confidant of the Los Angeles Dodgers star player for years, accompanying him throughout his career. In fact, Mizuhara was something of a manager to Ohtani and was always by his side.\n\nUnbeknownst to the athlete, however, Mizuhara was leveraging his closeness to tap into Ohtani's money and use it to gamble and cover his gambling debts. According to earlier reports, the interpreter channeled a total of $16 million into an underground scheme run by Matthew Bowyer, a prominent figure in California gambling. Mizuhara is believed to have placed over 19,000 illegal bets between 2021 and 2024.\n\nMizuhara's gambling habits came to light in March, causing him to be fired. He now risks up to 30 years in prison.\n\nMizuhara's attorney, Michael Freedman agreed to the proposal to postpone the arraignment to May 14. As of the time of this writing, the move is yet to be officially approved.\n\nFor context, Mizuhara's arraignment is currently scheduled for May 9.\n\nThe authorities believe that Ohtani has been a victim of Mizuhara's betting scheme. During earlier press conferences, the athlete said that he was beyond shocked and disappointed to learn that he had been cheated by one of his closest allies.\n\nHowever, Ohtani didn't allow the drama to drag him down and continued to excel. According to the Dodgers' manager, Ohtani now seems much closer to the rest of the team and can be seen outside of the batter's box much more often.\n\nIn a statement, the baseball star praised his new interpreter and thanked the Dodgers for being so supportive.\n\nIn the meantime, MLB officials do not plan to intervene with their own investigation yet. According to commissioner Bob Manfred, the league prefers to allow the federals to do their job since they have better tools at their disposal.\n\nManfred added that his team is rarely in a position where it can allow such a process to play out without needing to intervene.", "source": {"uri": "gamblingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GamblingNews"}, "authors": [{"uri": "fiona_simmons@gamblingnews.com", "name": "Fiona Simmons", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arraignment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arraignment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Freedman", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michael Freedman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ippei_Mizuhara", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ippei Mizuhara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_and_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Track and field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Bowyer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matthew Bowyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_field", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_queen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drag queen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://www.gamblingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mlb-logo-major-league-baseball-news.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551167", "eventUri": "eng-9551167", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-14", "textStart": 92, "textEnd": 98, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 1382, "textEnd": 1387}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

Sources with knowledge of the situation confirmed to TMZ Sports that Major League Baseball was reportedly investigating Ohtani's involvement in the gambling scandal at the time of his denial.\n\nRepresentatives for Ohtani, 29, are reported to have contacted law enforcement authorities and asked them to investigate a \"massive theft\" of money from the two-way baseball player, a source with direct knowledge of the situation told ESPN on March 21. Mizuhara, a longtime friend of Ohtani, reportedly sent $4.5 million from Ohtani's bank account to a Southern California bookmaking operation currently under federal investigation.\n\nThe interpreter's firing came after reporters asked questions about the wire transfers. A spokesperson for Ohtani claimed the baseball player transferred the funds to cover Mizuhara's gambling debt and presented the interpreter, who went into detail about his actions to ESPN during a 90-minute interview on March 19.\n\nThe spokesman would later disavow Mizuhara's account of the incident and said Ohtani's lawyers would prepare a statement when ESPN published its story on March 20.\n\n\"In the course of responding to recent media inquiries, we discovered that Shohei has been the victim of a massive theft, and we are turning the matter over to the authorities,\" a statement obtained by ESPN from Berk Brettler LLP reads.\n\nOhtani, who spent his first six MLB seasons with the Los Angeles Angels, announced his decision to sign with the Dodgers in a post shared on his Instagram account on December 9. The Japanese native is arguably the biggest star in baseball as one of the leagues best starting pitchers and hitters.\n\nOhtani led his country to a World Baseball Classic last March, days before his second AL MVP season in which he hit for a .304 average with a league-best 44 home runs and 95 RBIs and recorded a 10-5 record with a 3.14 ERA and 167 strikeouts in 23 starts and 132.0 innings pitched in 2023. The Japanese star signed a record-setting $700 million deal to join the Dodgers this offseason -- having previously spent his entire MLB career with the Los Angeles Angels -- which included the team deferring $68 million of the $70 million annual salary in an effort to have more spending room.\n\n'World's Sexiest Athlete' Qualifies For the 2024 Paris Olympics\n\nReporter Gets Punished For Awkward

The potential series, which is in its early development stages and does not yet have a network or streaming home, will chronicle the rise of the Japanese superstar and his record-setting 10-year, $700 million contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers. A day after the 2024 MLB season opened -- and while the team was in Japan for a series against the San Diego Padres -- shockwaves went through the league after news broke that Mizuhara allegedly stole $16 million from Ohtani.\n\nThe pitcher and designated hitter who is fresh off winning two straight unanimous MVP awards has captivated U.S. fans as well as his Japanese diehards with his ability to be a two-way player in the vein of all-time great Babe Ruth.\n\nThe Dodgers fired Mizuhara immediately after the allegations surfaced. On May 8, Mizuhara agreed to plead guilty to federal charges of felony bank fraud and submitting a false tax return. Authorities found that he stole nearly $17 million from Ohtani to pay off gambling debts he incurred with an illegal sportsbook. Major League Baseball prohibits players and team employees from using illegal bookmakers. The gambling scandal has been the biggest to impact MLB since Pete Rose bet on the Cincinnati Reds during his time as the team's manager. (Rose remains banned from MLB.)\n\n\"With a strong track record of creating daring, boundary-pushing series, Lionsgate Television is the perfect partner to bring this unbelievable story to the screen,\" said Delman. \"In addition, Albert's extensive sports journalism background will enable us to connect the dots to make sense of the startling turn of events we've seen play out on the world stage.\"\n\nChen co-created the award-winning sports podcast All-American and has written for Time, Fortune and Sports Illustrated. He covered baseball and wrote more than a dozen cover stories during his time as a senior editor for SI and has been a contributor to MLB Network.\n\n\"This is major league baseball's biggest sports gambling scandal since Pete Rose -- and at its center is its biggest star, one that MLB has hitched its wagon on,\" Chen said. \"We'll get to the heart of the story -- a story of trust, betrayal and the trappings of wealth and fame.\"\n\nDelman, for his part, produced Broadway hits including The Book of Mormon, Death of a Salesman and The Ferryman, among others.\n\nThis is the first Ohtani scripted series to land in development after the global superstar broke out to be the face of Major League Baseball after arriving here from Japan when he signed with the Los Angeles Angels in late 2017. The famously private Ohtani is currently leading baseball in batting average and hits and is tied for second in home runs as he attempts to become one of the few players to win MVP in both the National League and American League.\n\nLionsgate TV, meanwhile, is also developing an English-language adapation of Park Chan-wook's film, Oldboy, among other projects. Lionsgate TV's senior vp scripted TV Max Elins will oversee the project for the studio; the company's television business affairs exec director Bryan Weiser negotiated the deal.", "source": {"uri":

Ohtani has officially been a member of the Dodgers organization since December of last year, but there has still been a constant buzz around his first season in L.A.\n\nSoon after word of his signing became official, the murals of Ohtani in the signature Dodger Blue began popping up across the city, and another was unveiled before Opening Day.\n\nThe latest mural dedicated to Ohtani was shown in its entirety on March 27, and was painted by local Los Angeles County artist Robert Vargas.\n\nVargas is an artist who has been honored by the city of Los Angeles with the dedication of an intersection in his hometown of Boyle Heights, and with Robert Vargas Day every Sept. 8 as recognition of his contributions to the cultural life of the city, to the arts, and as a leading example of creativity for the community.\n\nThe Miyako Hotel in Little Tokyo, located at First Street between Central and San Pedro, was the canvas on which the mural was painted on.\n\nSince signing with the Dodgers, Ohtani has set multiple records, including breaking manager Dave Roberts' franchise record for most home runs by a Japanese-born player. He also passed Hideki Matsui for the all-time MLB lead in the same category.\n\nOhtani also capped off his hot start by being named National League Player of the Week for the first week of May.\n\nThis has all come amid controversy surrounding his former interpreter and friend, Ippei Mizuhara, making his focus and start all the more noteworthy.\n\nOceanview Liquor: 3232 Manhattan Ave.,

Amazing how quickly that happened.\n\nTo be fair to Lionsgate, the story has had an incredible number of twists and turns over such a short time period. Initially, Mizuhara essentially dictated the public response, telling ESPN and Ohtani's representatives that he had amassed massive gambling debts that Ohtani agreed to pay off.\n\nThat story changed within just a few hours, with Mizuhara admitting Ohtani had no knowledge of the gambling debts or that Mizuhara had ever gambled on sports at all. Understandably, that disconnect created doubt and uncertainty around Ohtani's innocence and what he knew, and when.\n\nBut every release of information afterward confirmed that Ohtani was a victim of massive theft. After learning what was happening after one of the South Korea series games, Ippei was fired and a consistent version of events unfolded.\n\nAnd those events were certainly dramatic enough to warrant the television treatment.\n\n\"With a strong track record of creating daring, boundary-pushing series, Lionsgate Television is the perfect partner to bring this unbelievable story to the screen,\" said producer Scott Delman. \"In addition, Albert's extensive sports journalism background will enable us to connect the dots to make sense of the startling turn of events we've seen play out on the world stage.\"\n\n\"This is major league baseball's biggest sports gambling scandal since Pete Rose - and at its center is its biggest star, one that MLB has hitched its wagon on,\" said Albert Chen, another attached producer. \"We'll get to the heart of the story - a story of trust, betrayal and the trappings of wealth and fame.\"\n\nEven after Ohtani's explanation was made public, questions remained. Namely: how did Mizuhara access his bank account, complete wire transfers, or get lines of credit from a bookie on his interpreter salary?\n\nOhtani's camp also said they'd refer the matter to authorities, raising the stakes on whether or not he's telling the truth. Initially, some media personalities even doubted that there'd even been a case opened, suggesting Mizuhara was a fall guy.\n\nNot exactly.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Justice Department announced that Mizuhara had pled guilty to bank fraud covering nearly $17 million in theft, as well as filing a false tax return. And the announcement contained even more details that provide fodder for the dramatic series reenactment.\n\nREAD: Ippei Mizuhara Pleads Guilty To Bank Fraud, $17M Theft From Shohei Ohtani\n\nMore than 20 times, Mizuhara impersonated Ohtani on the phone with bank officials to authorize wire transfers. He pocketed $60,000 Ohtani had given him for dental work, purchased baseball cards with Ohtani's money to resell for his personal profit.\n\nEven text messages showed Mizuhara admitting to his bookie that he'd stolen from Ohtani.\n\nThere's plenty there to dramatize. And all the while, Ohtani's been the best player in baseball, somehow even improving from his previous results.\n\nFor those who have worked for or been around extremely wealthy people, the story wasn't surprising. And now the larger, non-sports fan world will get a chance to learn more about it.", "source": {"uri": "outkick.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OutKick"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ian_miller@outkick.com", "name": "Ian Miller", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionsgate", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionsgate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gambling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_betting", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sports betting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ippei_Mizuhara", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ippei Mizuhara"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_show", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Television show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_interpretation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Language interpretation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Theft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_producer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Film producer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Rose", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pete Rose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionsgate_Television", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lionsgate Television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire_transfer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wire transfer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sports journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_guy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fall guy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmaker_(gambling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bookmaker (gambling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guilt_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Guilt (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_card", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball card"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bank fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dentistry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dentistry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Job-Related", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2024/04/052eaf0a-GettyImages-1976113650.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551167", "eventUri": "eng-9551167", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 452991490, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 169, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 169}}}

His cult loves it, so it doesn't matter, but he's making too many smart people stupid.'\n\nProject Liberal cofounder Joshua Reed Eakle also wrote that 'Rogan is a testament to the dangers of going down the \"red pill\" rabbit hole.'\n\n'Avoid at all costs. It rots your brain.'\n\nAnother X user, meanwhile, said Rogan proved 'he was right to say he can't tell jokes anymore: just not in the way he meant.'\n\nIn the special, Rogan questions whether society had become too accepting of biological men identifying as trans women - a debate that has been reignited after Olympic boxer Imane Khalif failed a gender eligibility test.\n\n'I just want to be real clear. I believe in trans people,' Rogan told an audience in Austin. 'Because I think the world is strange and nature can throw you a curveball and you believe you're in the wrong body.\n\n'And I fully support your right as an adult to do whatever you want that makes you happy.\n\n'I believe in freedom and I believe in love. But I also believe in crazy people,' the podcaster continued.\n\nProject Liberal cofounder Joshua Reed Eakle said the special 'rots your brain'\n\nAnother X user said Rogan proved 'he was right to say he \"can't tell jokes anymore: just not in the way he meant'\n\n'I'm open-minded. I just want to know what happened.\n\n'It's almost like a pervert wizard waved a magic spell on the whole world. \"With a wave of this wand, you can walk into the women's locker room with a hard c***, and anybody who complains is a Nazi. Abracadabra!\" And it just works!'\n\nHe went on to say the 'new reality' is what is weird.\n\n'You can't just put lipstick on and now you can s*** in the women's room!'\n\nIn another clip that went viral, Rogan jokes that he's become more open to believing conspiracy theories following the COVID pandemic.\n\n'We lost a lot of people during COVID and most of them are still alive,' he joked.\n\n'Before COVID, I would have told you that vaccines are the most important invention in human history,' Rogan continued.\n\n'After COVID, I'm like, \"I don't think we went to the moon. I think Michelle Obama's got a d***. I think Pizzagate is real. I think there's direct energy weapons in Antarctica.\n\n'I'm just kidding - I don't think Michelle Obama's got a d***, but I do believe all of that other s***.'\n\nHe then hit out at media critics who claimed he was spreading misinformation.\n\n'But here's my take on that, sincerely: If you're getting your vaccine advice from me, is that really my fault?'\n\nHe made a joke at one point about Michelle Obama, saying he doesn't believe she's got a d***\n\nOther times, Rogan joked about not wanting to be 'surrounded by gay men.'\n\n'I think about gay men the same way I think about mountain lions: I'm happy they're real, but I don't want to be surrounded by them,' he said.\n\n'They're a bunch of dudes who f*** dudes. I don't like my chances, OK? They're not unicorns - they're just men who f*** men.'\n\nBut Rogan said he is 'not even remotely homophobic.'\n\n'I'm the opposite. I wish I was gay.'\n\nHe also recounted how a female TSA agent once asked for a 'male assist' to pat him down, and he asked, with mock judgment: 'Did you just assume my gender?'\n\nThe New York Times wrote that Rogan 'leans into stereotypes that have cracked up drunken club crowds for generations'\n\nThe Wrap also hit out at Rogan saying he 'fashioned himself as a conduit for anger'\n\nThose moments proved to be fodder for critics, with the New York Times writing that Rogan 'leans into stereotypes that have cracked up drunken club crowds for generations.'\n\n'Rogan has found a podcast audience that likes conspiracies and picking culture war battles wit the left,' columnist Jason Zinoman writes. 'And he gives it to them.\n\n'But he also indulges his own obsessions and eccentricities.'\n\nThe Wrap also hit out at Rogan, saying he 'fashioned himself as a conduit for anger,' and the Daily Beast said he 'fixated throughout the hour on men receiving sexual pleasure in ways the comedian felt were unnatural.\n\n'Rogan did not disclose how much of his Netflix paycheck he planned to donate for all of the slurs he used in his live hour,' columnist Sean L McCarthy wrote.\n\nDailyMail.com has reached out to Netflix for comment.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Rogan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Rogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Transgender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_pill_and_blue_pill", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Red pill and blue pill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Misinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rabbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cult"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michelle Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_men", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gay men"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incantation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Incantation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Beast", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Beast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magician_(fantasy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Magician (fantasy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_woman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trans woman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antarctica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Antarctica"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/08/06/05/88199165-0-image-a-30_1722918522899.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794360", "eventUri": "eng-9794360", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 228, "relevance": 1}

Kennedy Jr.,\" said Rogan, who praised Kennedy as \"the only one who makes sense to me.\"\n\nWhen Gymlan asked if Rogan was a fan of RFK Jr., he agreed.\n\n\"He is the only one who does not attack people, but actions and ideas, but he is much more reasonable and intelligent,\" he said.\n\nBut Rogan was forced to reverse his apparent support for RFK Jr. a day later after massive backlash from MAGA.\n\n\"For the record, this is not a recommendation,\" Rogan said wrote in a rare post on X on Friday. 'This is to say that I like RFK Jr. as a person, and I appreciate the way he discusses issues with civility and intelligence.'\n\nJoe Rogan at the Majestic Theatre in San Antonio, Texas for his Netflix special\n\nRogan also praised Trump for his response to the attempted assassination of him in Butler, Pennsylvania, after he was shot in the ear by a gunman.\n\n\"I also think Trump raising his fist in the air and yelling 'fight!' after he got shot is one of the most American f***ing things of all time,\" he said.\n\nRogan sparked outrage from angry Trump supporters after a clip from his show indicated he supported Kennedy for president.\n\nTrump questioned Rogan's apparent support on social media.\n\n\"It will be interesting to see how hard Joe Rogan gets booed the next time he steps into the UFC ring???\" Trump asked in a message on Truth Social -- even after Rogan attempted to clarify his position.\n\nRogan's praise for Kennedy and subsequent news articles about his \"support\" of Kennedy over Trump angered his supporters\n\n'So - I've never been a fan of Joe Rogan - I can't stand him - yeah, he has a popular podcast, but I've always thought he was completely politically stupid - he's very good at figuring things out two years later than we are,' wrote X.com user @catturd2 on social media to his 2.7 million followers.\n\nJoe Rogan in his podcast studio in Austin, TX\n\nHe pointed out that Rogan supported Senator Bernie Sanders in 2016.\n\n\"He's the podcast equivalent of a dumb blonde joke,\" @catturd2 concluded.\n\nJack Posobiec, editor of Human Events, said the moment proves why Rogan is quietly anti-Trump.\n\n\"Now you know why Rogan has a blacklist of pro-Trump people on his show,\" he wrote on social media, highlighting Rogan's praise for Kennedy.\n\nRogan's podcast attracts a large male audience, many of whom are Trump supporters.\n\nIn June 2023, he interviewed Kennedy, where they discussed his family's history, government censorship, and struggles with government measures regarding coronavirus lockdowns and vaccination mandates.\n\nAlthough Rogan has met and shaken hands with Trump during his UFC fight appearances, he has never invited the former president for an interview.\n\n\"Most people aren't really interested in your endorsement, we want you to have Trump on your platform,\" X.com user \"Johnny Maga\" wrote in response to Rogan's post.\n\nPodcaster Tim Pool, who previously announced that he wanted to vote for Trump, lamented that Trump's supporters were driving away like-minded people with their outrage.\n\n\"There is a reason they can't get a Rogan endorsement and it's this exact behavior,\" he wrote on social media. \"The best podcast, remarkably independent, honest and sincere and they decide to go to war with it instead of trying to build an alliance with it.\"\n\nOn July 9, Trump and Rogan were spotted shaking hands at the UFC 290 fight in Las Vegas -- and the 77-year-old presidential candidate has since pressed for an invitation to sit down and record with him\n\nWhen Gymlan asked if Rogan was a fan of RFK Jr., he agreed\n\nRogan made headlines last month when he predicted Kamala Harris would win, but he also said he was surprised by how quickly the media narrative shifted in her favor.\n\n\"I feel like we're in a bizarre time where people are giving in to the bullshit in a way that I never expected,\" Rogan argued. \"They just don't want Trump no matter what, and they're willing to manipulate themselves -- and by the way, I think Hillary could win.\"\n\nRogan has been widely critical of President Joe Biden for months for his apparent mental and physical decline, and he is generally critical of establishment politicians.\n\nHe has hosted Rep. Tulsi Gabbard on his show several times and even Sen. Bernie Sanders in August 2019.\n\nIn August 2023, podcaster Patrick Bet-David urged Rogan to interview Trump, despite Rogan's public reluctance to do so.\n\n\"I don't know -- maybe,\" Rogan said. \"At some point, it just is.

'This is me saying that I like RFK jr as a person, and I really appreciate the way he discusses things with civility and intelligence.'\n\nRogan also praised Trump for his response to the assassination attempt on his life in Butler, Pennsylvania after he was shot in the ear by a gunman.\n\n'I also think Trump raising his fist and saying 'fight!' after getting shot is one of the most American f***ing things of all time,' he said.\n\nRogan had sparked anger from fired up Trump supporters after a clip from his show indicated that he was supporting Kennedy for president.\n\nJoe Rogan at the Majestic Theatre in San Antonio, Texas for his Netflix special\n\nSpeaking about the election with YouTuber Sam Gymlan on Thursday, Rogan lamented that both the right and the left 'gaslight you, they manipulate you, they promote narratives.'\n\n'The only one who is not doing that is Robert F. Kennedy Jr.,' Rogan said, praising Kennedy as 'only one that makes sense to me.'\n\nRead More Liberal meltdown as Joe Rogan tears into transgender people and COVID vaccines\n\nWhen Gymlan asked if Rogan was a fan of RFK Jr. he agreed.\n\n'He's the only one -- he doesn't attack people, he attacks actions and ideas, but he's much more reasonable and intelligent,' he said.\n\nTrump questioned Rogan's apparent endorsement on social media.\n\n'It will be interesting to see how loudly Joe Rogan gets BOOED the next time he enters the UFC Ring???' Trump asked in a post on Truth Social -- even after Rogan tried to clarify his position.\n\nRogan's praise for Kennedy and subsequent news articles about his 'endorsement' for Kennedy over Trump drew anger from his supporters\n\n'So - I've never been a Joe Rogan fan - can't stand him - yes he has a popular podcast, but I've always thought he was absolutely politically dumb - he's great at figuring things out 2 years after we do,' wrote X.com user @catturd2 on social media to his 2.7 million followers.\n\nJoe Rogan in his podcasting studio in Austin, TX\n\nHe pointed out that Rogan supported Sen. Bernie Sanders in 2016.\n\n'He's the podcast Equivalent of a dumb blonde joke,' @catturd2 concluded.\n\nHuman Events editor Jack Posobiec said the moment was evidence of why Rogan was quietly anti-Trump.\n\n'Now you know why Rogan has a blacklist of pro-Trump people on his show,' he wrote on social media, highlighting Rogan's praise of Kennedy.\n\nRogan's podcast draws a large male audience, many of them Trump supporters.\n\nHe interviewed Kennedy in June 2023, where they spoke about his family's history, government censorship, and the struggles with the government's actions on the coronavirus lockdowns and vaccine mandates.\n\nWhile Rogan has met and shook hands with Trump during his appearances at UFC fights, he has never hosted the former president for an interview.\n\n'Most people don't actually care about your endorsement, we want you to have Trump on your platform,' wrote X.com user 'Johnny Maga' wrote in reply to Rogan's post.\n\nPodcaster Tim Pool, who previously announced his intention to vote for Trump, lamented that Trump's supporters tended to drive away likeminded individuals with their outrage.\n\n'There's a reason they can't get a Rogan endorsement and it's exactly this behavior,' he wrote on social media. 'The top podcast, markedly independent, fair and honest and they decide to go to war with it instead of trying to ally with it.'\n\nOn July 9, Trump and Rogan were seen shaking hands at the UFC 290 fight in Las Vegas - and the 77-year-old presidential candidate has since been pushing for an invitation to sit down and record with him\n\nWhen Gymlan asked if Rogan was a fan of RFK Jr. he agreed\n\nRogan made headlines last month after he predicted that Kamala Harris was going to win, even though he said was surprised by how quickly the media narrative turned in her favor.\n\n'I feel like we are in this very bizarre time where people are giving into the bullshit in a way that I never suspected people would before,' Rogan argued. 'They just want no Trump, no matter what, and they're willing to gaslight themselves -- and by the way, I think Hillary could win.'\n\nRogan has widely criticized President Joe Biden for months for his obvious mental and physical decline and typically sours on establishment politicians.\n\nHe has hosted Rep. Tulsi Gabbard on his show multiple times and even hosted Sen. Bernie Sanders in August 2019.\n\nIn August 2023, podcaster Patrick Bet-David urged Rogan to interview Trump despite Rogan's public reluctance to do so.\n\n'I don't know - maybe,' Rogan said. 'At a certain point in time, it's just like. It would be interesting to hear his perspective on a lot of things.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Rogan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Rogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

His cult loves it, so it doesn't matter, but he's making too many smart people stupid.'\n\nProject Liberal cofounder Joshua Reed Eakle also wrote that 'Rogan is a testament to the dangers of going down the \"red pill\" rabbit hole.'\n\n'Avoid at all costs. It rots your brain.'\n\nAnother X user, meanwhile, said Rogan proved 'he was right to say he can't tell jokes anymore: just not in the way he meant.'\n\nIn the special, Rogan questions whether society had become too accepting of biological men identifying as trans women - a debate that has been reignited after Olympic boxer Imane Khalif failed a gender eligibility test.\n\n'I just want to be real clear. I believe in trans people,' Rogan told an audience in Austin. 'Because I think the world is strange and nature can throw you a curveball and you believe you're in the wrong body.\n\n'And I fully support your right as an adult to do whatever you want that makes you happy.\n\n'I believe in freedom and I believe in love. But I also believe in crazy people,' the podcaster continued.\n\n'I'm open-minded. I just want to know what happened.\n\n'It's almost like a pervert wizard waved a magic spell on the whole world. \"With a wave of this wand, you can walk into the women's locker room with a hard c***, and anybody who complains is a Nazi. Abracadabra!\" And it just works!'\n\nHe went on to say the 'new reality' is what is weird.\n\n'You can't just put lipstick on and now you can s*** in the women's room!'\n\nIn another clip that went viral, Rogan jokes that he's become more open to believing conspiracy theories following the COVID pandemic.\n\n'We lost a lot of people during COVID and most of them are still alive,' he joked.\n\n'Before COVID, I would have told you that vaccines are the most important invention in human history,' Rogan continued.\n\n'After COVID, I'm like, \"I don't think we went to the moon. I think Michelle Obama's got a d***. I think Pizzagate is real. I think there's direct energy weapons in Antarctica.\n\n'I'm just kidding - I don't think Michelle Obama's got a d***, but I do believe all of that other s***.'\n\nHe then hit out at media critics who claimed he was spreading misinformation.\n\n'But here's my take on that, sincerely: If you're getting your vaccine advice from me, is that really my fault?'\n\nOther times, Rogan joked about not wanting to be 'surrounded by gay men.'\n\n'I think about gay men the same way I think about mountain lions: I'm happy they're real, but I don't want to be surrounded by them,' he said.\n\n'They're a bunch of dudes who f*** dudes. I don't like my chances, OK? They're not unicorns - they're just men who f*** men.'\n\nBut Rogan said he is 'not even remotely homophobic.'\n\n'I'm the opposite. I wish I was gay.'\n\nHe also recounted how a female TSA agent once asked for a 'male assist' to pat him down, and he asked, with mock judgment: 'Did you just assume my gender?'\n\nThose moments proved to be fodder for critics, with the New York Times writing that Rogan 'leans into stereotypes that have cracked up drunken club crowds for generations.'\n\n'Rogan has found a podcast audience that likes conspiracies and picking culture war battles wit the left,' columnist Jason Zinoman writes. 'And he gives it to them.\n\n'But he also indulges his own obsessions and eccentricities.'\n\nThe Wrap also hit out at Rogan, saying he 'fashioned himself as a conduit for anger,' and the Daily Beast said he 'fixated throughout the hour on men receiving sexual pleasure in ways the comedian felt were unnatural'.\n\n'Rogan did not disclose how much of his Netflix paycheck he planned to donate for all of the slurs he used in his live hour,' columnist Sean L McCarthy wrote.\n\nDailyMail.com has reached out to Netflix for comment.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Rogan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Rogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Liberalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Transgender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_pill_and_blue_pill", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Red pill and blue pill"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Misinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rabbit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cult"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_men", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gay men"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incantation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Incantation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Beast", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Beast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magician_(fantasy)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Magician (fantasy)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_woman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trans woman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columnist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Columnist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_phenomenon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viral phenomenon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michelle Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antarctica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Antarctica"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Jokes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Jokes", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Male_to_Female", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Male to Female", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Activism", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/08/06/04/88199165-13712687-image-a-2_1722915565740.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794360", "eventUri": "eng-9794360", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 227, "relevance": 1}

He's much more reasonable and intelligent.\"\n\nAfter the clip spread on social media, some news outlets, such as The Hill, The Daily Beast, and Variety reported that Rogan had endorsed Kennedy over former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. Rogan took to X on Friday to push back against those reports.\n\n\"For the record, this isn't an endorsement. This is me saying that I like RFK jr as a person, and I really appreciate the way he discusses things with civility and intelligence. I think we could use more of that in this world,\" Rogan wrote. \"I also think Trump raising his fist and saying 'fight!' after getting shot is one of the most American f***ing things of all time.\"\n\nWATCH THE TRAILER FOR 'AM I RACIST?' -- A MATT WALSH COMEDY ON DEI\n\nRogan then told his followers not to rely on him for \"political information.\"\n\n\"I'm not the guy to get political information from,\" he wrote. \"If you want that from a comic, go to @ComicDaveSmith. He actually knows what he's talking about.\"\n\nRogan has criticized the Biden administration and leftist policies on issues ranging from illegal immigration to gender procedures on children. The comedian has also been highly critical of Trump, saying in 2022 that he's turned down multiple offers from Trump's team for the former president to go on \"The Joe Rogan Experience.\"\n\n\"I'm not a Trump supporter in any way, shape or form. I've had the opportunity to have him on my show more than once, I've said no every time,\" Rogan told podcast host Lex Friedman. \"I don't want to help him, I'm not interested in helping him.\"\n\nIn the 2020 Democratic primary, Rogan said he would \"probably \" vote for Democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT).", "source": {"uri": "dailywire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Wire"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Rogan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Rogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

I'm not the guy to get political information from. If you want that from a comic, go to @ComicDaveSmith . He actually knows what he's talking about.\"\n\nRogan never \"endorsed\" RFK Jr. Rather, he said he supports how the independent presidential candidate treats people.\n\nHere were his exact words from a podcast episode earlier this week:\n\n\"That's just what they do. That's politics. They do it on the left, they do it on the right. They gaslight you, they manipulate you, they promote narratives, and the only one who is not doing that is Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\n\"I am a fan. He's the only one that makes sense to me. He's the only one -- he doesn't attack people, he attacks actions and ideas, but he's much more reasonable and intelligent. I mean, the guy was an environmental lawyer and he cleaned up the East River. He's a legitimate guy.\"\n\nA lengthy list of influential conservative accounts have since criticized Rogan for not endorsing Trump, even calling him a \"traitor.\" Notably, Catturd \u2122 called Rogan \"politically dumb\" in a viral post to his nearly 3 million followers.\n\n\"So - I've never been a Joe Rogan fan - can't stand him - yes he has a popular podcast, but I've always thought he was absolutely politically dumb - he's great at figuring things out 2 years after we do. What a legend.\n\n\"So did it surprise me when he endorsed idiot RFK jr today? LOL! No. We are talking about the same fucking idiot who endorsed Bernie Sanders right? \ud83d\ude02 He's the podcast Equivalent of a dumb blonde joke.\"\n\nThe outrage over Rogan shows a basic misunderstanding of who Joe Rogan is. Rogan is not MAGA. He's not even a conservative. He has never been a conservative.\n\nRogan is an admitted life-long Democrat who considers Barack Obama the \"greatest president of all time.\" He previously endorsed socialist Bernie Sanders and voted for Jo Jorgensen of the Libertarian Party in 2020.\n\nHowever, in 2020, Rogan was a vocal critic of Covid lockdowns, vaccine mandates, and mask requirements. He also - as he reiterated on his new Netflix special \"Joe Rogan: Burn the Boat\" - rejects the Democratic Party's stances on Black Lives Matter, open borders, and men competing in female sports in the name of transgenderism.\n\nAs a result, Rogan is a frequent target of left-wing media outlets (like CNN and NBC) which falsely depict him as a \"right-wing podcaster.\" He's not.\n\nSure, Rogan interviews conservatives, like his friend of 20 years Alex Jones. But he also interviews ardent leftists, like Bernie Sanders.\n\nRogan can be most accurately described politically as a disgruntled Democrat, someone who values common sense over partisanship.\n\nJoe Rogan is not an enemy of Donald Trump's. If anything, he's used his mass influence to pull liberals to the center. Still, any expectations that he'd use his platform to endorse Trump were foolishly misguided.\n\nAs Tim Pool argues, targeting Rogan over his friendship with RFK Jr. does not help Trump. \"The cringiest thing imaginable right now is MAGA die-hards shitting on Joe Rogan,\" Pool posts. \"Make more enemies, burn more bridges.\"\n\n\"There's no real argument against voting Trump but fuck me some of these die hard magas are as destructive as the leftists,\" Poll adds.\n\nThe \"shredding\" of Rogan, as the outrage is described, is yet another example of Trump influencers losing focus.\n\nKamala Harris is the most Marxian presidential candidate of this century. She did not earn her position as the presumptive Democratic nominee. Her running mate Tim Walz is a liar who put tampons in little boys' bathrooms.\n\nThe election is winnable for Donald Trump. He brings better policies to the table. He and his supporters have a handful of winning messages to spread - from the border to inflation, from ending endless wars to protecting Americans from surging crime rates.\n\nYet, members of right-wing Influencers are wasting time trying to discredit Joe Rogan.\n\nSurely, Kamala and Waltz appreciate the distraction.", "source": {"uri": "outkick.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OutKick"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bobby_burack@outkick.com", "name": "Bobby Burack", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Rogan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Rogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

I mean, the guy was an environmental lawyer and he cleaned up the East River. He's a legitimate guy.\"\n\nOn the Aug. 8 podcast, Rogan characterized Kennedy as a straight shooter, in contrast to the spin produced by Democrats and Republicans. \"That's just what they do. That's politics. They do it on the left, they do it on the right,\" Rogan said. \"They gaslight you, they manipulate you, they promote narratives -- and the only one who is not doing that is Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\"\n\nRogan and Kennedy are both vocal skeptics about the efficacy of vaccines -- and in particular COVID-19 vaccines. Spotify, which previously exclusively hosted Rogan's podcast, faced a backlash over the podcast host spreading misinformation about COVID. \"Before COVID, I would have told you that vaccines are the most important invention in human history,\" Rogan said in his recent comedy special on Netflix. \"After COVID, I'm like, 'I don't think we went to the moon. I think Michelle Obama's got a dick. I think Pizzagate is real. I think there's direct energy weapons in Antarctica.' I'm just kidding -- I don't think Michelle Obama's got a dick, but I believe all of that other shit.\"\n\nOf course, Rogan doesn't believe RFK Jr. will win the election. On his show last week, Rogan said he said he \"could see\" VP Kamala Harris beating Donald Trump. \"I'm saying it because she could,\" Rogan said. \"I'm not saying it because I think she's going to and I'm not saying it because I want her to. I'm just being honest. I could see her winning.\"\n\nKennedy is running as an independent candidate in the 2024 U.S. presidential election. He currently has about 5% support in a national polling average, down from 8% as recently as last month, per the New York Times. This week, he admitted that he once deposited a dead bear cub in New York City's Central Park and staged it to look as if the animal had been struck by a bicycle. Earlier this year, news emerged that Kennedy had said in a 2012 deposition that a doctor had told him that an abnormality in his brain scans was caused by \"a worm that got into my brain and ate a portion of it and then died.\"\n\nA grateful Kennedy posted a clip of Rogan's endorsement, saying, \"From one 'legitimate' guy to another, thank you @JoeRogan for always putting substance first.\"", "source": {"uri": "variety.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Variety"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Rogan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Rogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

(WARNING: Following the link will lead to a video that contains vulgar language that some readers may find offensive.)\n\nOne wouldn't think that a discussion about the study of fictitious animals would get particularly political, but as his show is wont to do, the wide-ranging episode absolutely touched on politics.\n\nWhile discussing the brewing November showdown between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, Rogan noted that he's quite sick of the nastiness of politics -- from all sides.\n\n\"That's just what they do,\" a demure Rogan began. \"That's politics. They do it on the left. They do it on the right. They gaslight you. They manipulate you. They promote narratives.\"\n\nSo far, so good. No conservative anywhere should have an issue with Rogan's comments that there are bad faith actors riddled across the political landscape.\n\nIt's his next remarks that caught the ear of the right.\n\n\"The only one who's not doing that is Robert F. Kennedy Jr.,\" Rogan said.\n\nHe'd continue: \"I am a fan. He's the only one that makes sense to me. He's the only one that -- he doesn't attack people.\n\n\"He attacks actions and ideas, but he's much more reasonable and intelligent.\"\n\n(It should be noted that both Rogan and Kennedy are outspoken and fierce critics of all things COVID-19 vaccine related, so they do have one big thing very much in common.)\n\nMany conservatives construed Rogan's remarks as some sort of endorsement for Kennedy -- a third-party candidate who has virtually no chance to win anything this coming election cycle -- and thus a waste of a vote.\n\nConservative pundit Collin Rugg took to X to post about the backlash.\n\n\"Right-wing X is shredding Joe Rogan for 'endorsing' Robert F. Kennedy Jr. during his podcast,\" Rugg posted.\n\nWhile responding to a commenter, Rugg made clear that he thought those attacking Rogan were jumping the gun and out of line -- then blamed conservatism's overzealousness as to why the ideology struggles to gain a foothold in America.\n\n\"But is this even an endorsement for president?\" Rugg mused. \"Everyone says they love Joe Rogan until he says one thing they disagree with.\n\n\"It's pathetic and why the right can never build bridges.\n\n\"There are other ways to bring people to your side instead of throwing rocks at them.\"\n\nRogan responded to this controversy by largely echoing what Rugg had posted.\n\n\"For the record, this isn't an endorsement,\" Rogan posted. \"This is me saying that I like [Kennedy] as a person, and I really appreciate the way he discusses things with civility and intelligence.\" (WARNING: Following the link will lead to a post that contains vulgar language that some readers may find offensive.)\n\n\"I think we could use more of that in this world.\n\n\"I also think Trump raising his fist and saying 'fight!' after getting shot is one of the most American f***ing things of all time.", "source": {"uri": "westernjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Western Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bryan_chai@westernjournal.com", "name": "Bryan Chai", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Rogan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Rogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigfoot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bigfoot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fandom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fandom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-left_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Far-left politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spotify"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Predictably, Rogan, who likes to be thought of as an unconventional guy, is going with someone similarly unconventional: Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nOn his podcast this week, Rogan said that Kennedy was the only candidate that \"makes sense.\" \"I am a fan. He's the only one to make sense to me,\" Rogan said. \"He's the only one that doesn't attack people. He attacks actions and ideas, but he's much more reasonable and intelligent.\" He added: \"He\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a legitimate guy.\"\n\nRogan also claimed that party politicians \"gaslight\" and \"manipulate\" voters and that the only candidate who was not doing that was RFK. \"That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s politics. They do it on the left, they do it on the right. They gaslight you, they manipulate you, they promote narratives, and the only one who is not doing that is Robert F. Kennedy Jr,\u00e2\u20ac Rogan reiterated.\n\nOn Friday, Kennedy responded to Rogan's endorsement. \"From one 'legitimate' guy to another, thank you @JoeRogan for always putting substance first,\" said the candidate, via X.\n\nOf course, Rogan is not alone. At least some percentage of the population is all in on Kennedy, FiveThirtyEight's national polling average has him pulling around 5 percent of the vote. Upon first glance, it may be sorta hard to understand why. The list of the candidate's foibles is long: He talks like a crow, is reputed to have once been a serial philanderer, has been caught (multiple times) posing with pictures of dead animals, hung out with Jeffrey Epstein and Bill Cosby, has admitted that a worm once ate part of his brain and then died, and, earlier this week, admitted that he keeps an entire freezer full of \"roadkill meat.\" Yeah, he's a weird guy. But the reasons for the strength of his candidacy go beyond the candidate himself.\n\nThe reason that third-party candidates are so appealing to voters is because our two-party system sucks. That Simpsons meme says it all. But the problem with voting for a third-party candidate is that they're not going to win. In modern history, no third party has ever managed to take the White House, which means that such candidates pretty much always function as a \"spoiler\" for one dominant party or another. Voting for them really just means that you're voting for the Democrat or Republican who is hurt least by their candidacy.\n\nThe ongoing question with RFK has been whether he'll take more votes away from Trump or Biden (now Harris). Though some polls claim Kennedy hurts Trump more, others show him chipping away at Democratic support in key battleground states. Kennedy has also received funding from the same people funding Trump, and was encouraged to run by Trump allies, like Steve Bannon. Kennedy recently discussed endorsing Trump and even floated the idea of taking a job in the next Trump administration, should he win. Kennedy's brand seems intentionally designed to appeal to disaffected Democrats; his status as the black sheep of a once great political dynasty seems geared towards left-leaning voters who feel alienated from the current Democratic Party.\n\nRogan's endorsement is easy to dismiss, but it's worth remembering that he has over 14 million Spotify listeners, many of which skew young and male. In a tight race where every vote counts, Rogan's influence isn't necessarily insignificant.\n\nIn 2020, Rogan endorsed Bernie Sanders for President. Later, after Sanders dropped out of the race, Rogan said that he would rather vote for Trump than Biden. Rogan later admitted that he had actually voted for Jo Jorgensen, the libertarian candidate. In 2016, Rogan also voted libertarian, tweeting: \"I voted for Gary Johnson, and I lean FAR more left than right.\" In 2009, Rogan tweeted that he had voted for Obama, but only \"because Ron Paul, a REAL republican wasn't on the ballot.\" Again, Ron Paul is broadly considered to be a libertarian and ran for President on the Libertarian Party line in 1988.\n\nIn short, Rogan may not follow a party line but without fail, he loves to pick a loser.", "source": {"uri": "gizmodo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gizmodo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lucas_ropek@gizmodo.com", "name": "Lucas Ropek", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Rogan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Rogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

This is me saying that I like RFKjr as a person, and I really appreciate the way he discusses things with civility and intelligence,\" Rogan wrote. \"I think we could use more of that in this world.\"\n\nRogan added that \"Trump raising his fist and saying 'fight!' after getting shot is one of the most American f****** things of all time\". But the podcaster did not say how he would vote come November.\n\nYet despite his kind words for Trump, the former president turned on Rogan in a Truth Social post on Friday.\n\n\"It will be interesting to see how loudly Joe Rogan gets BOOED the next time he enters the UFC Ring??? MAGA2024,\" Trump wrote.\n\nTim Pool, the right-wing podcaster who once suggested that under the Second Amendment Americans should be allowed to own nukes, faced similar MAGA backlash to Rogan when he said this week that he was \"voting for RFK Jr now\".\n\nMAGA follower, Catturd, lumped Pool into a group he called \"losers\" who \"switch candidates every time the wind blows.\"\n\n\"They'll say whatever gets them their next million dollars and more attention to their gigantic egos,\" he wrote.\n\nPool then also walked back his apparent endorsement on Friday, playing off his tweet as a joke.\n\n\"Oof, I really stepped in it this time hahaha,\" he wrote on X. \"Holy crap I'm voting for Trump wtf.\"\n\nHe later called \"MAGA die hards\" criticising Rogan the \"cringiest thing.\"\n\nIt's not all bad news for RFK Jr, though. Russell Brand, a British comedian who dabbles in vaccine skepticism and right-wing talking points, offered his endorsement on Friday. But Brand noted in a video clip that he is not eligible to vote in the US election.\n\nA few former MAGA darlings have also been backing away from Trump. Right-wing commentator Nick Fuentes has apparently defected from Trump, declaring a \"Groyper war\" -- groyper being a term he uses to describe his fans -- against the former president's campaign.\n\n\"Tonight I declared a new Groyper War against the Trump campaign. We support Trump, but his campaign has been hijacked by the same consultants, lobbyists, & donors that he defeated in 2016, and they're blowing it,\" Fuentes wrote on X. \"Without serious changes we are headed for a catastrophic loss.\"\n\nKyle Rittenhouse, who killed two protesters during a racial justice protest in Kenosha, Wisconsin and became a beloved figure on the right, also tried to distance himself from the Trump campaign.\n\nLast Friday, Rittenhouse posted on social media that he was no longer backing Trump due to the former president's \"advisers,\" saying \"unfortunately, Donald Trump has bad advisers, making him bad on the Second Amendment.\"\n\nRittenhouse said he planned to write in former Libertarian candidate Ron Paul on his 2024 ballot, which sparked MAGA fury online.\n\nLater in the day, he folded to the pressure, writing that over the previous 12 hours he had \"productive conversations\" with Trump's team, who he said restored his confidence in the former president's willingness to protect gun rights.\n\n\"My comments made last night were ill-informed and unproductive. I'm 100% behind Donald Trump and encourage every gun owner to join me in helping send him back to the White House,\" he wrote.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Rogan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Rogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

He told his San Antonio, Texas audience that adults could do whatever they wanted and that while they had the right to believe in their ideas, he could also believe \"in crazy people.\"\n\n\"I'm open-minded. I just want to know what happened,\" he said. \"It's almost like a pervert wizard waved a magic spell on the whole world. 'With a wave of this wand, you can walk into the women's locker room with a hard c*ck, and anybody who complains is a Nazi. Abracadabra!' And it just works!\"\n\n\"And everyone just accepts this new reality, and it's f*cking weird,\" he continued. \"I just think we need standards. You can't just put lipstick on and now you can sh*t in the women's room.\"\n\nRogan also touched on COVID-19 and the pandemic, joking that before 2020, he believed in vaccines, and after he questioned if we had been to the moon. At one point, he said that it would be funny if he died from Covid, saying that the \"memes would never end.\"\n\nRogan also called out his critics, who claim that he is spreading misinformation about COVID-19.\n\n\"But here's my take on that, sincerely: If you're getting your vaccine advice from me, is that really my fault?\" He asked.\n\nHe also joked about not wanting \"to be surrounded\" by gay men.\n\n\"I think about gay men the same way I think about mountain lions: I'm happy they're real, but I don't want to be surrounded by them,\" said Rogan.\n\nHis comments caused an uproar with liberals who watched the special, calling his remarks \"stupid,\" \"unfunny,\" and \"weird.\" Some leftists went as far as boycotting Netflix for hosting the comedian.\n\nRogan held nothing back, including taking shots at former first lady Michelle Obama, at one point calling her a man and taking it back after, which caused a liberal meltdown on social media.\n\n\"Just as I always thought, Joe Rogan is a f*cking piece of sh*t. F*ck him and f*ck @Netflix. Very hilarious to pay someone to say that our former first lady has a d*ck.

His work has been featured in such publications as Salon, The Advocate, Plus Magazine, George Takei Presents, The Huffington Post, Spoiled NYC, Towleroad, Distractify, Elite Daily, and 2 or 3 Things I Know About Film.\n\nPodcaster and comedian Joe Rogan is getting slammed after viewers of his Burn the Boats Netflix standup special couldn't help but call out his \"unfunny\" attempt at appealing to conservatives with jokes mocking transgender people and COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nThe jokes themselves are all the more egregious given Rogan has became the focus of a Spotify controversy after multiple artists threatened to cancel their contracts over his podcast The Joe Rogan Experience, which they said was spreading false information about vaccines.\n\nHe has also been criticized for platforming white nationalists and conspiracy theorists, including far-right transphobes like Matt Walsh of The Daily Wire, who once claimed on Rogan's show that \"millions\" of young children are on hormone blockers even though only a few thousand children in the United States have been placed on puberty blockers within the last five years.\n\nAt one point during his special, Rogan criticized transgender representation, suggesting the community has been accepted too quickly for comfort:\n\n\"I'm open-minded. I just want to know what happened. It's almost like a pervert wizard waved a magic spell on the whole world. With a wave of this wand, you can walk into the women's locker room with a hard c*ck and anybody who complains is a Nazi.\"\n\n\"And everyone just accepts this new reality, and it's fucking weird. I just think we need standards. You can't just put lipstick on and now you can shit in the women's room!\"\n\nOddly, Rogan went on to say that he does \"believe\" in transgender people and that they have the \"right as an adult to do whatever you want that makes you happy.\" However, he later joked that he does \"believe in crazy people!\" He later said he doesn't \"want to be surrounded by\" gay men in particular.\n\nHe also lashed out at critics who've accused him of promoting COVID-19 vaccine information, saying:\n\n\"If you're getting your vaccine advice from me, is that really my fault?\"\n\n\"After COVID, I'm like, 'I don't think we went to the moon. I think Michelle Obama's got a d**k. I think Pizzagate is real. I think there's direct energy weapons in Antarctica.' I'm just kidding -- I don't think Michelle Obama's got a d**k, but I believe all of that other s**t.\"\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, Rogan hasn't limited his vaccine conspiracies to COVID-19.\n\nIn 2022, he came under fire after tweeting a false story claiming that Ivermectin, a toxic anti-parasitic used to treat parasitic worms, lice, and skin problems mostly in livestock, was shown to be effective against COVID-19's Omicron variant in a Phase III clinical trial. Rogan, who had mere hours earlier apologized for spreading misinformation about COVID-19, later deleted the tweet.\n\nAdding to the litany of controversy that's surrounded Rogan since he became a conservative darling, that same year he was swiftly called out after a compilation video of him saying the N-word more than two dozen times went viral. Rogan, of course, insisted that his words were \"taken out of context.\"\n\nRogan claimed he's \"not racist,\" though critics might beg to differ considering the members of the far-right, many of them quite openly racist, he's featured on his program.", "source": {"uri": "comicsands.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Comic Sands"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Rogan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Rogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Transgender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Advocate_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Advocate (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distractify", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Distractify"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salon.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Salon.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "COVID-19 vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HuffPost", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "HuffPost"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_nationalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White nationalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Takei", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Takei"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spotify"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vaccine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_(supernatural)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Magic (supernatural)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puberty_blocker", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Puberty blocker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Walsh_(comedian)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matt Walsh (comedian)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hormone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nazism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michelle Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Wire", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Wire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigger", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nigger"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antarctica"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Antarctica"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://www.comicsands.com/media-library/screenshot-of-joe-rogan.png?id=53120595&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C28", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794360", "eventUri": "eng-9794360", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

But I also believe in crazy people.\"\n\n\"I just want to know what happened,\" he continued. \"It's almost like a pervert wizard waved a magic spell on the whole world. 'With a wave of this wand, you can walk into the women's locker room with a hard c**k, and anybody who complains is a Nazi. Abracadabra!' And it just works! And everyone just accepts this new reality, and it's f**king weird. I just think we need standards. You can't just put lipstick on and now you can s**t in the women's room!\"\n\nAt another point he insisted that he is not homophobic. \"I love gay men. But I think about gay men the same way I think about mountain lions: I'm happy they're real, but I don't want to be surrounded by them. They're a bunch of dudes who f**k dudes. I don't like my chances, OK? They're not unicorns -- they're just men who f**k men. And every man who's ever lived is a shifty c*m salesman, OK? 100 percent. Especially the ones who say they're not.\"\n\nElsewhere in the special, Rogan joked that he wished he was gay so he could continue to use homophobic slurs with impunity. Which he did anyway, using the word \"fa***t,\" to thunderous applause from his audience.\n\nCritics have been supremely unimpressed with the special, with Vulture's Kathryn VanArendonk describing Rogan's approach to cultural commentary as \"obnoxious\" and Burn the Boats as \"an underwhelming, exhausting, and lazily derivative hour of stand-up.\"\n\n\"It's a series of undigested thoughts dressed up as meaningful insight, a pure conduit to the ideas floating around in Rogan's head, expressed as though they're original conceits or surprising perspectives on the world,\" VanArendonk wrote, adding that \"Rogan is essentially a bad-boy-comedian cover band, playing the old hits that everyone already knows.\"\n\nIn his review, The New York Times' Jason Zinoman criticized Rogan's use of slurs to get \"cheap laughs.\" Rogan, Zinoman wrote, \"leans into stereotypes that have cracked up drunken club crowds for generations\" and described his stand-up as \"clich\u00e9.\"\n\nAt one point in Burn the Boats, Rogan joked that he won't use the N-word, but is more than happy to use another insensitive term to refer to people with developmental disabilities because he's \"more afraid of Black people than I am of r****ds.\"\n\n\"Duh!\" he added. \"Don't you know how jokes work, f****t? It's all just supposed to be funsies!\"\n\nIn a Substack post, comedian Michael Ian Black ripped the joke to shreds. \"We get it, Joe. White dudes want to be able to make fun of trans people and Black people and Asians and whoever they set their little eyes upon - not because they have a point to make - but because Mommy told them no and it makes them sad,\" Black wrote.\n\nBlack speculated that Rogan's rebellion against \"political correctness\" has to do with \"the idiotic notion that empathy is women's work. Therefore, to rebel against kindness is to assert one's masculinity.\"\n\n\"Rogan could use the opportunity to deconstruct the impotency of bigotry, and the power of language to harm others,\" Black wrote. \"If Rogan had taken his joke the next step and used it to explore his own internalized racism and homophobia, that might have been interesting. It might have been good.\"\n\n\"Burn the Boats isn't cutting-edge art,\" MSNBC columnist Jacques Berlinerblau wrote. \"It's not disruptive like the interventions of Jerrod Carmichael, or Hannah Gadsby, or Bo Burhham. Rather, Rogan's humor caresses a mass constituency, a ginormous 'we.' If his jokes reflect the sensitivities and anxieties of a huge swath of American men, then that's a gloomy prophecy.\"\n\nComedians and professional critics weren't the only ones unimpressed with Burn the Boats. As Buzzfeed noted, on Sunday X was full of withering criticism of Rogan's special from viewers.\n\n\"Joe Rogan proving he was right to say he 'can't tell jokes anymore' just not in the way he meant,\" one user wrote.\n\n\"I mean at least be funny if you're being ignorant and offensive,\" another commented. \"Joe Rogan's main crime during his comedy special was he wasn't funny.\"\n\nA common refrain from commenters on clips posted by the @NetflixIsAJoke account: \"Where's the joke?\"", "source": {"uri": "lgbtqnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LGBTQ Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri":

While all the focus is on Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, the UFC commentator decided to give Robert F. Kennedy Jr. some love.\n\n\"That's just what they do. That's politics. They do it on the left, they do it on the right,\" Rogan said. \"They gaslight you, they manipulate you, they promote narratives, and the only one who is not doing that is Robert F.

Rogan, however, made his opinion of RFK well-known.\n\n\"Yeah, I am a fan,\" Rogan replied. \"He's the only one that makes sense to me. He's the only one. He doesn't attack people, he attacks actions and ideas, but he's much more reasonable and intelligent.\"\n\nEven though it sounds like Kennedy has Rogan's vote this November, it doesn't sound like he's confident in him pulling off the upset. In fact, Rogan is predicting a win for Harris.\n\n\"She's gonna win,\" Rogan explained, via OutKick. \"I feel like we are in this very bizarre time where people are giving into the [expletive] in a way that I never suspected people would before. They just want no Trump, no matter what, and they're willing to gaslight themselves -- and by the way, I think Hillary could win. I would have thought that Trump getting shot would like -- that's it, election's over. But it's like, they memory-holed that so quick.\"\n\nThe presidential election will take place on Nov. 5.

Walsh responded to the backlash from some conservatives to reports of Rogan endorsing Kennedy, saying those \"disowning him today for saying nice things about RFK Jr are acting foolishly at best.\" Walsh has been a guest on Rogan's show, which remains the top podcast in the world on Spotify.\n\n\"Joe Rogan is one of the most powerful cultural forces in America and he is, at a minimum, very friendly to conservatives. He has repeatedly used his massive platform to amplify right wing voices that would not be able to find that kind of audience anywhere else.

Petty, stupid, overly emotional, shooting yourself in the foot just to prove a point,\" he added. \"There's way too much of this kind of s*** among certain right wing 'influencers' at the moment.

Rogan said Kennedy is different from politicians on the Right and the Left who \"gaslight,\" \"manipulate,\" and \"promote narratives.\"\n\n\"The only one who's not doing that is Robert F.

Ron DeSantis in 2022 also defended Rogan for using the \"n\" word.\n\nLast year Rogan announced he would support the Florida GOP governor's presidential campaign instead of \"a dead man as a president,\" referring to President Joe Biden. Back in 2020 Rogan supported Bernie Sanders for President.\n\nBut Rogan's also hosted top MAGA influencers, far-right extremists, and billionaire bros on his show.

Something is afoot.\"\n\nPool is a right-wing podcaster. In what appears to now have been deleted, Pool also wrote, according to NJ.com: \"\"I think trump is on track to lose and this is why Dems are a cult, will march in lockstep MAGA die hards can't form alliances properly Independents / post libs will say fuck that.

The former Fear Factor host and current UFC color commentator is known for discussing his often-controversial opinions on cancel culture and other topics on The Joe Rogan Experience, so with the release of his new Netflix special Joe Rogan: Burn the Boats, it's not surprising that his brand of humor is turning some people away. It is, however, a bit unexpected that both critics and the viewers looking for the best movies on Netflix seem to be walking away with the same opinion.\n\nFor Burn the Boats, Joe Rogan left behind the comfort of his recording studio to face a live audience in San Antonio, Texas, for an hourlong set. The comedy special aired live August 3 (and can now be streamed with a Netflix subscription), and it seems both critics and audiences alike are nonplussed with the show, calling it \"outdated\" and \"terrible.\" First, let's see what critics are saying. Matthew Creith of The Wrap says the comedian relies too heavily on unoriginal jokes about COVID and gay men. Creith writes:\n\nDaniel D'Addario of Variety agrees, calling the diatribes \"decades too late,\" saying it's the issues he discusses that garner him attention rather than any unique takes on them. Joe Rogan uses Netflix's live stream to get out all the slurs he longs to say but ultimately lacks courage and originality, the critic says, writing:\n\nJacques Berlinerblau of MSNBC says Joe Rogan's Netflix special is simply light on comedy but heavy on bro complaints. Fans of the media personality already know what to expect, and Burn the Boats won't change the minds of any of his detractors, the critic says. Berlinerblau continues:\n\nIt's certainly not unusual for the casual viewer to judge a project less harshly than critics, but when it comes to Joe Rogan: Burn the Boats, it seems that many Netflix viewers agree with the negative reviews. The standup special holds a less-than-stellar 58% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes, and even those who claim to like Rogan and his podcast are hitting Twitter with comments like:\n\nAnother couple of fans say they didn't get very far in before jumping ship, with one tweeting:\n\nOne viewer's opinion echoes those of the critics, saying Joe Rogan's material felt outdated. They say:\n\nYet another podcast fan finds that platform more appropriate than the standup stage, writing:", "source": {"uri": "cinemablend.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CINEMABLEND"}, "authors": [{"uri": "heidi_venable@cinemablend.com", "name": "Heidi Venable", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Rogan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Rogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancel_culture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cancel culture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_Factor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fear Factor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_commentator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Color commentator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Fighting_Championship", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ultimate Fighting Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TheWrap", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TheWrap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Variety (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Antonio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Antonio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Celebrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_Tomatoes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rotten Tomatoes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Gbsjv6djDsBn6VcBbGzMqf-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794360", "eventUri": "eng-9794360", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-03", "textStart": 777, "textEnd": 785}], "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

That would be the just and normal response to hearing the name \"Joe Rogan\" in 2024. Even Rogan himself seems to think so; on his new standup special Burn the Boats, he does a whole bit about the Fear Factor segment that got the show canceled - that is, actually canceled, as in when a show is taken off the air, like a fading reality show or a great five-season sitcom (RIP, Newsradio!). This is distinct from the Joe Rogan type of canceled, which is where you command an audience of millions, a salary of millions, and a Netflix standup special where you joke about being repeatedly \"canceled\" for your supposedly harmless antics - presumably also in front of millions.\n\nThis is a remarkable trajectory for someone who hosted a second-tier reality show 20 years ago. Hell, it's a remarkable trajectory for someone who was reliably amusing on Newsradio. It's hard to imagine Dave Foley, Andy Dick, or Vicki Lewis receiving 60-plus minutes on Netflix to say whatever's on their mind.\n\nWhat's on Rogan's mind would not be difficult to predict, though maybe the exact ratio might surprise you, in the sense that it's surprising to see anyone doing alien-abduction/anal probe jokes in 2024. There's some material on cancel culture, cultural sensitivity, snowflake culture ... whatever it is that makes some people speak somewhat more delicately about the idea of gender or avoid various slurs. Rogan doesn't seem as hardline anti-trans as fellow Netflix darling Dave Chappelle (at least in front of his standup audience), or maybe he's simply less stubborn about his prejudices than Chappelle, a vastly more talented comedian with a vastly bigger grudge over the perception that he's \"not allowed\" to say all the stuff that he says pretty regularly. Rogan is more apt to shrug things off, trying to make self-deprecating jokes about how absurd it is that anyone would listen to him about, say, vaccines while claiming to basically \"love everybody.\" For example, he purports to believe that, by and large, trans women are indeed women, and only asks that a small margin be allowed for the existence of \"crazy\", in that and other situations.\n\nA better comic could probably workshop this idea into something provocative, surprising and/or funny about the difficulty of making certain mental adjustments in your 50s, and/or attempting to find various loopholes, exceptions, or inconsistencies to social rules. A better comic could also probably find something funny to say about the idea that gay men might nonetheless possess the same cave man sexual drive as their straight counterparts. (It's a hacky premise, and other comics have probably done it better already, but it's possible!) Joe Rogan, however, is not that comic. He's not interested in developing bits, finessing them toward a comic revelation or a clever, surprising turn. He just wants to deliver them, as loudly as possible, and that delivery is frequently sloppy with his frantic urges. As the special goes on, he increasingly resorts to a few tired vocal tricks: bellowing punchlines with red-faced intensity, like the late Sam Kinson (supposedly one of his heroes), and doing a cutesy-swishy voice as a stand-in for any women or gay men. Maybe alien abductions are on his mind because only a genuine abductee, gone for at least three decades, could possibly find some of his this stuff fresh.\n\nOn its own, this would simply be a sub-mediocre standup special with reactionary overtones, by a comic coasting on his name recognition with very little technique to speak of. There are, regrettably, a lot of those. They are not all, however, given the Netflix spotlight. To be fair, there are so many Netflix comedy specials - they're currently releasing about one a week - that there is going to be some very bad comedy in there. But does one major streaming platform really need to lay claim to Chappelle, Ricky Gervais and Rogan, all complaining about being silenced by humorless scolds?\n\nAll three of them suffer from the tedious delusion that they are not mere comics, but bold, uncensorable gadflies whose responsibility it is to speak truth to trans people - er, power. The Rogan difference is that his career has reached cult leader levels without even really bothering with the comedy. (Gervais and Chappelle will always have past triumphs to their name, and at minimum, echoes of those triumphs will probably continue throughout their careers.) Standup was once Rogan's career; now it's more of a side hustle compared to his ultra-popular podcast which is, notably, not Rogan doing jokes for hours. Jokes are just Rogan's fallback - what he uses as an excuse when he's talking shit or using his huge platform to convince a bunch of listeners that they're getting something more akin to a thoughtful current events chat, instead of an ill-informed ex-comic spouting off.\n\nRogan gives away his feelings about what he uses jokes for on this very special. Under the apparent impression that only a bold, select few would dare joke about gay people, he notes how his ridicule is used to ferret people out: \"If we can't joke around you, we know you take yourself too fuckin' seriously.\" In other words: you better like my jokes, or else. It's a solipsistic worldview that nullifies his attempts at self-deprecation, too, because even qualities he pretends to denigrate in himself, he defines in his own weird terms. He seems to think intelligence, for example, is some nebulous combination of intelligence, and hanging out with him, Joe Rogan. It's hard to wring much (intentional) comedy from a just-asking-questions podcast host who unironically refers to Elon Musk as \"the smartest guy alive\".\n\nIt's equally difficult to buy Rogan's intimations that comedy is a great equalizer when he can't say a bad word about the world's richest man. To some extent, I believe Rogan when he implies he doesn't want to be seen as a leader or a deep thinker (though not when he claims that he doesn't think people should listen to him). In a deeply strange and backwards way, the hack-comic-to-podcaster-to-leader-of-men pipeline is all about a desire to reverse-engineer kind of standup clout that came naturally to figures like Richard Pryor or George Carlin, who cancellation-obsessed comics always say they admire. When Rogan tries to go Carlin Mode, however, the results are horrifically embarrassing: \"I think words are just supposed to be a sound that you make so I know what you're thinking,\" he says at one point, as part of an argument in favor of slurs, part of a mush-mouthed routine about how everyone knew what he meant when he'd throw around words like \"fag\" or \"retard\".\n\nAgain, there's probably a funny conceit that could be developed around the idea of words as no different than grunts or screams - but it would require Rogan to do some work, rather than just grunting, screaming, or miming masturbation. For all of his attempts to project a fun, laid-back image, and all of his protestations about the unifying joys of Just Kidding, Rogan's special is, at its core, astonishingly self-serious. Rogan's whole late-period career is an extended argument that comedians are so important, they shouldn't have to be talented, original, or funny to demand that you laugh.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancel_culture", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cancel culture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Rogan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Rogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Chappelle", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dave Chappelle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NewsRadio", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NewsRadio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_Factor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fear Factor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Reality television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_men", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gay men"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicki_Lewis", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vicki Lewis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Foley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dave Foley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Dick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andy Dick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_abduction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alien abduction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-deprecation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Self-deprecation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transphobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transphobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LGBT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anal_sex", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anal sex"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Perception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitcom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sitcom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_(norm)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Convention (norm)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactionary", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reactionary"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricky_Gervais", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ricky Gervais"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinson", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kinson"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kinson"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Pryor", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Richard Pryor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Carlin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Carlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/279591b3949884ce71502e40be7fd025458c5ad9/0_69_1962_1178/master/1962.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&s=429f18db5707814fbd87ffde00e85ee7", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794360", "eventUri": "eng-9794360", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

Democrats and Republicans, he told listeners, \"gaslight you, they manipulate you, they promote narratives - and the only one who is not doing that is Robert F Kennedy Jr\".\n\nRogan has hosted Kennedy, including an appearance highlighted by Oliver in which Kennedy endorsed a book, Cause Unknown: The Epidemic of Sudden Deaths in 2021 & 2022, which claims Covid vaccines kill young people and for which Kennedy wrote an introduction.\n\nRogan has also voiced vaccine conspiracy theories, causing controversy he references in a new Netflix comedy special, saying: \"Before Covid, I would have told you that vaccines are the most important invention in human history. After Covid, I'm like, 'I don't think we went to the Moon. I think Michelle Obama's got a dick. I think Pizzagate is real. I think there's direct energy weapons in Antarctica.'\n\n\"I'm just kidding - I don't think Michelle Obama's got a dick, but I believe all of that other shit.\"\n\nRogan has a huge audience, with more than 14.5 million listeners just on Spotify, which this year gave him a deal worth a reported $250m.\n\nAccepting Rogan's endorsement, Kennedy said: \"This election is not about left vs right. It's about Americans of goodwill coming together to end the tyranny of corruption in our system - so that we once again have a government and economy that works for all people.\"\n\nKennedy is a member of a famous Democratic family: his father was Robert F Kennedy, the US attorney general and New York senator who was killed in Los Angeles in 1968, his uncle John F Kennedy, the 35th president who was killed in Dallas in 1963.\n\nNow 70, Kennedy first ran for the Democratic presidential nomination before switching to be an independent.\n\nHe has struggled to gain ballot access and polling now gives him around 5% support: nowhere near enough to win the White House but enough to tip the result in battleground states that will decide a tight election between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.\n\nLast week, Rogan said he thought Harris could win, adding: \"I'm not saying it because I think she's going to, and I'm not saying it because I want her to.

Hate Netflix? Stop Taking the Rage Bait", "body": "The funniest thing to come out of Joe Rogan's new Netflix special is the social media mocking it, but don't kid yourself: CEO Ted Sarandos benefits from that, too.\n\nRogan, a 56-year-old podcaster (who, when picking out a shirt for his return to stand-up, chose a shade best described as Minion Vomit Yellow), has been called a lot of things since \"Burn the Boats\" streamed live on August 3. According to his critics on X, he's \"unfunny,\" \"a bigot,\" \"the dumbest man on the planet,\" \"like if Charlie Brown grew up, did steroids, finished balding, and never went to therapy,\" \"a lapdog for billionaires,\" \"adult Caillou,\" \"proof that those D.A.R.E. videos about the dangers of weed might have made some valid points,\" and \"the Cybertruck of comedians.\"\n\nMore from IndieWire\n\nThe progressive pile-on is objectively funny and, at first glance, looks like a welcome counterbalance to the millions of Rogan fans who make \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" the world's biggest podcast. In the special, Rogan aggressively mocks the LGBTQ community, punches down at the 7 million people who died of COVID, reminds fellow fearmongers about the asinine Pizzagate theory, and spreads plenty more misinformation -- all while claiming to be a good guy. It's grotesque, but par for the course for the data-driven streamer that proudly platforms transphobes like Dave Chappelle.\n\nAs home to the world's biggest stage in stand-up, Netflix has said it won't censor its talent no matter the cost. To his credit, Sarandos puts his money where his mouth is: Netflix signed nonbinary comedian Hannah Gadsby to a multi-year deal in 2022... after they called the company an \"amoral algorithm cult\" on Instagram. Playing both sides makes sense when the controversy is the product.\n\nThere's a recognizable press cycle around inflammatory Netflix specials: right-wingers flock to see their favorite mouthpieces pop off while angry progressives meet the moment online. Being funnier than the ignorant asshole on your phone or TV can feel like a big win for human decency in the moment -- but when does pushing back against something slide into giving it free publicity? In the age of ye olde algorithms, it might be sooner than you think.\n\nStreamers fight for eyeballs like any entertainment business. Netflix data remains one of the biggest mysteries in Hollywood (despite a new biannual report illuminating subscribers' most-watched content), but stand-up is an undeniable success story. Through-the-roof numbers for Chappelle's \"The Dreamer,\" released at the very end of December 2023, taught Netflix not only that the controversial comedian still had a loyal audience, but also that our addiction to outrage is still going strong. Chappelle's \"Sticks & Stones\" from 2019, which predates the notorious \"The Closer\" but included its own anti-trans rhetoric, remained the service's most-watched hour as of November 2023.\n\nPre-existing fan bases, even those much smaller than Rogan's, do well for Netflix. Take Matt Rife, who faced criticism for laughing at victims of domestic violence, children with intellectual disabilities, and other vulnerable groups. He also has 19 million followers on TikTok and saw his hour \"Natural Selection\" snag the title of most-watched Netflix special in 2023 with 13.5 million hours viewed.\n\nGoogle saw a predictable spike in searches for Joe Rogan the day \"Burn the Boats\" dropped (and a 40% increase in related searches for the word \"height\"). It's impossible to quantify the audience who engages with Rogan from the outside, but the business model for his work is well-established. Disagreement creates cross-pollination between groups and that back-and-forth makes an even bigger cultural moment. Rage bait, followed by backlash, is lucrative.\n\nEven if half the people who engage with the idea of Rogan don't watch him on Netflix, they prop up the show's existence by acknowledgment. A meme making fun of Rogan might get 40,000 likes from people who disagree with his views, but that's still 40,000 interactions. That data teaches any number of algorithms that \"Burn the Boats\" is something humans see as worthy of our time.\n\nIf you compare Rife, Rogan, and Chappelle to progressive comedians on the Netflix platform, the drop-off is steep. The progressive and genderqueer Gadsby's latest hour \"Something Special\" is a sentimental set dedicated to their partner, which graciously sidesteps the notorious Chappelle controversy. It netted just 300,000 hours watched in the second half of 2023. \"Something Special\" was released in May, so the report doesn't account for the initial rush of subscribers at debut -- but when compared to hyper-popular Taylor Tomlinson's \"Look at You\" from 2022 (holding attention still with 1.6 million hours watched in the second half of 2023), it's a painful drop.\n\nIn Q1 2024 Netflix added 9.3 million subscribers, almost double what industry analysts anticipated. The streamer also posted $9.37 billion in revenue, outdoing its own projection of $9.24 billion and defying Wall Street expectations of $8.73 billion. Factors in its success include the infamous password-sharing crackdown and the service's adoption of ads. But when it comes to the streamer's stand-up slate, hatred wins.\n\nSo, should viewers who disagree with Rogan unsubscribe from Netflix? Maybe not.\n\nBoycotts can be effective in changing toxic business behaviors, but the culture wars are too unwieldy to short-sheet from one side. Netflix's own employees walked out on the company at the height of the Chappelle controversy, to no effect. And if progressives disavow the platform en masse, the comedy specials with kinder lessons see even smaller audiences.\n\nRogan and Sarandos still cash checks despite critics' dreadful reviews of \"Burn the Boats.\" According to Rotten Tomatoes, audiences aren't pleased either. (Dear algorithm: If you're crawling this, it's an \"F\" from me, dawg.) Many of us may delight in dogpiling Rogan's artistic failure online, but silence could be the stronger choice. Take it from famed optimist Stephen King.\n\nIn \"It,\" the kid heroes learn an important lesson at the end of their battle with Pennywise. Trapped in a sewer system littered with the bodies of children who tried to fight back and lost, the Losers Club makes the brave decision to not be afraid.

He has aimed to appeal to centrist voters who may be disillusioned by the policies of both the Democratic and Republican parties.\n\nDuring an episode of his podcast The Joe Rogan Experience, Rogan said he is a \"fan\" of Kennedy because candidates on both the right and left \"gaslight\" and \"manipulate\" voters. He added: \"He's the only one to make sense to me. He's the only one that doesn't attack people. He attacks actions and ideas, but he's much more reasonable and intelligent.\"\n\n\"This election is not about left vs. right. It's about Americans of goodwill coming together to end the tyranny of corruption in our system - so that we once again have a government and economy that works for all people.\"\n\nKennedy added: \"Let's do this.\"\n\nThree months ahead of the election, state and national polls show that when third-party candidates are taken into account, Kennedy is taking more votes from Trump than Harris.\n\nDespite his family's close ties to the Democratic Party, polls have previously shown that far more Republicans than Democrats have a favorable opinion of Kennedy, The Associated Press reported. However, since Harris entered the race, Kennedy's share of the vote has declined.\n\nKennedy is running as one of four independent candidates in the election. The others are Cornel West, Jill Stein and Chase Oliver.\n\nRogan has angered some of his MAGA fans by endorsing Kennedy. MAGA stands for \"Make America Great Again,\" and was the tagline used by former President Donald Trump during his 2016 White House run, and has since become synonymous with his most fervent followers.\n\nSelf-described MAGA business analyst @jdopost wrote: \"Joe Rogan thinks RFK Jr. is the only candidate that 'makes sense to him' Tell me how TF [the f***] a man that wants to allow FULL TERM ABORTIONS Makes sense to anyone!? \ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\"\n\nAnd Gentry Gevers added, \"Joe Rogan has done so much for the truth movement because of his platform. I don't agree with his 'endorsement' of RFK, I think it's a throw away vote. I don't even think it's an endorsement. But this isn't the way to win him over to our side.\"\n\nEven though there was backlash from some people online, there were mixed reactions to Rogan's announcement, including from people who agreed with him and others who believed the endorsement would pull votes away from Trump.\n\nThe podcast host has a history of endorsing both Democratic and Republican candidates and has frequently made headlines over his political opinions.\n\nRogan previously said he did not vote for either Trump or President Joe Biden in the 2020 race. In February 2022, he said he couldn't vote for Biden because he \"can't talk right anymore.\"\n\nRogan endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders' campaign during the 2020 Democratic primary. In 2022, he floated Florida Governor Ron DeSantis as someone he believed would make a \"good candidate.\" DeSantis challenged Trump in the Republican primary races but ultimately fell short and dropped out.\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential race, Rogan voiced support for Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "billie_schwab_dunn@newsweek.com", "name": "Billie Schwab Dunn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Rogan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Rogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

He quipped, \"If you're getting your vaccine advice from me, is that really my fault?\"\n\nHowever, it was his jokes targeting the LGBTQ+ community and Michelle Obama that drew the most ire.

Many questioned the comedian's reliance on controversial topics to garner attention and expressed disappointment with his comedic choices.\n\nThis isn't the first time Rogan has faced public backlash.

Ron DeSantis in 2022 also defended Rogan for using the \"n\" word.\n\nLast year Rogan announced he would support the Florida GOP governor's presidential campaign instead of \"a dead man as a president,\" referring to President Joe Biden. Back in 2020 Rogan supported Bernie Sanders for President.\n\nBut Rogan's also hosted top MAGA influencers, far-right extremists, and billionaire bros on his show. Some of his best-known guests include conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, white nationalism-promoting Tucker Carlson, and billionaire Elon Musk (who reportedly has turned X into a pro-Trump/pro-MAGA platform.)\n\nIn a 2022 CNN opinion column, Peniel E. Joseph talked \"about exposing who Rogan really is and admitting that his brand of conversation, which at times traffics in conspiracy theories, cultural intolerance and blatant racism, attracts millions of avid listeners and corporate sponsors hungry to advertise their wares to such followers. Rogan is, in fact, an agent of these social ills, which he packages and sends out to his audience clothed in the language of moderation and moral equivalence.\"\n\n\"Rogan has horribly and deliberately misgendered a trans MMA fighter. He's discouraged young people from getting the Covid-19 vaccine, hosted guests who question its validity and given a platform to climate skepticism from controversial clinical psychologist Jordan Peterson.\"\n\nIn that light Rogan's endorsement of RFK Jr. over Trump makes sense despite declaring less than two weeks ago, \"She's gonna win,\" referring to Vice President Kamala Harris's presidential bid.\n\nRogan isn't alone.\n\nOn Friday, The Washington Spectator's Dave Troy, who tracks extremism and global trends, observed: \"Joe Rogan, Tim Pool, and Nick Fuentes have made public statements against Trump today. Something is afoot.\"\n\nPool is a right-wing podcaster. In what appears to now have been deleted, Pool also wrote, according to NJ.com: \"\"I think trump is on track to lose and this is why Dems are a cult, will march in lockstep MAGA die hards can't form alliances properly Independents / post libs will say fuck that. Registered dems outnumber GOP by almost 12m. ...

In it, the 56-year-old said he doesn't pay close attention to numbers and simply reaches out to those he's interested in talking to.\n\nNewsweek emailed a spokesperson for Rogan for comment on Tuesday.\n\n\"I don't look at the numbers, I don't pay attention.

He said it just started with him \"having fun\" with friends and morphed into what it is today thanks to listeners' support.\n\nAs Rogan and Ohler discussed the media, the host suggested people are \"far more skeptical\" about what they read now, \"particularly after the pandemic.\"\n\nRogan said: \"I think the pandemic shook things up to a point where it's much more difficult to pass off propaganda today than it was even just four years ago.\"\n\nOhler replied: \"That's why I was quite excited to come on this podcast, on this experience -- I think you have actually created a space where free thought is possible and free communication.\n\n\"I think it's quite an important artwork that you have established here. It's not so easy to create your own media that has a global reach.\"\n\nThanking his guest, Rogan said he thinks the show \"made itself.\"\n\n\"I think this thing wanted to be made and it made itself and it did in a very sneaky way. Originally, it was just me having fun with my friends, a webcam, me and Brian [Redban], then Eddie Bravo. We'd come over and just talk, have a good time,\" he said.\n\nRogan said that eventually when the show got \"enough downloads,\" he could get in contact with the likes of British writer Graham Hancock and chef Anthony Bourdain.\n\nHe added: \"Then it became much, much bigger...I genuinely believe [the show] tricked me into making it.\"\n\nWhen Ohler asked the podcast host about the point when he realized the show had become \"big,\" he said it was a \"gradual\" process before recalling a night in 2011 or 2012.\n\n\"I'll tell you when I realized it, I think it was like 2011 or 2012.

Case in point was recently when people got all upset over Kyle Rittenhouse saying he would support Ron Paul in the 2024 election, when just a day later he changed his mind after talking to representatives for former President Donald Trump.\n\nAnother example is how everyone jumped the gun on podcast host and comedian Joe Rogan when spoke positively about independent candidate for president, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nA lot of people concluded that Rogan was endorsing RFK Jr. even though Rogan never said the word \"endorse\" or \"vote\" when commenting on what he likes about the man.\n\nEven RFK Jr.'s people posted the Rogan comments to @TeamKennedy24's YouTube channel.\n\nRogan reposted the clip of his comments on X and clarified that \"this isn't an endorsement.\"\n\n\"This is me saying that I like RFKjr as a person, and I really appreciate the way he discusses things with civility and intelligence,\" Rogan wrote. \"I think we could use more that in this world. I also think Trump raising his fist and saying \"fight!\" after getting shot is one of the most American f**king things of all time.\"\n\n\"I'm not the guy to get political information from,\" Rogan continued.\n\nPeople put way too much stock in what celebrities and notable people think when they should concentrate on what they themselves think based on prudent information.\n\nRelated: Why Now?

I mean, the guy was an environmental lawyer and he cleaned up the East River. He's a legitimate guy.\"\n\nRogan was referring to Kennedy's work in the years before he became widely known as a vaccine conspiracy theorist - views which last weekend led John Oliver, host of Last Week Tonight on HBO, to call Kennedy \"a full-blown menace\".\n\n\"You don't get to say 'I'm not anti-vaxx' then wander around the woods telling people not to vaccinate their babies like you're some red-pilled version of Smoky the Bear,\" Oliver said, adding: \"The idea of RFK is appealing but so many of the reasons to support him do not stand up to the slightest of scrutiny.\"\n\nRogan disagrees. Democrats and Republicans, he told listeners, \"gaslight you, they manipulate you, they promote narratives - and the only one who is not doing that is Robert F Kennedy Jr\".\n\nRogan has hosted Kennedy, including an appearance highlighted by Oliver in which Kennedy endorsed a book, Cause Unknown: The Epidemic of Sudden Deaths in 2021 & 2022, which claims Covid vaccines kill young people and for which Kennedy wrote an introduction.\n\nRogan has also voiced vaccine conspiracy theories, causing controversy he references in a new Netflix comedy special, saying: \"Before Covid, I would have told you that vaccines are the most important invention in human history. After Covid, I'm like, 'I don't think we went to the Moon. I think Michelle Obama's got a dick. I think Pizzagate is real. I think there's direct energy weapons in Antarctica.'\n\n\"I'm just kidding - I don't think Michelle Obama's got a dick, but I believe all of that other shit.\"\n\nRogan has a huge audience, with more than 14.5 million listeners just on Spotify, which this year gave him a deal worth a reported $250m.\n\nAccepting Rogan's endorsement, Kennedy said: \"This election is not about left vs right. It's about Americans of goodwill coming together to end the tyranny of corruption in our system - so that we once again have a government and economy that works for all people.\"\n\nKennedy is a member of a famous Democratic family: his father was Robert F Kennedy, the US attorney general and New York senator who was killed in Los Angeles in 1968, his uncle John F Kennedy, the 35th president who was killed in Dallas in 1963.\n\nNow 70, Kennedy first ran for the Democratic presidential nomination before switching to be an independent.\n\nHe has struggled to gain ballot access and polling now gives him around 5% support: nowhere near enough to win the White House but enough to tip the result in battleground states that will decide a tight election between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.\n\nLast week, Rogan said he thought Harris could win, adding: \"I'm not saying it because I think she's going to, and I'm not saying it because I want her to. I'm just being honest. I could see her winning.\"", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "martin_pengelly@theguardian.com", "name": "Martin Pengelly", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Rogan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Rogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Hate Netflix? Stop Taking the Rage Bait", "body": "Rogan, a 56-year-old podcaster (who, when picking out a shirt for his return to stand-up, chose a shade best described as Minion Vomit Yellow), has been called a lot of things since \"Burn the Boats\" streamed live on August 3. According to his critics on X, he's \"unfunny,\" \"a bigot,\" \"the dumbest man on the planet,\" \"like if Charlie Brown grew up, did steroids, finished balding, and never went to therapy,\" \"a lapdog for billionaires,\" \"adult Caillou,\" \"proof that those D.A.R.E. videos about the dangers of weed might have made some valid points,\" and \"the Cybertruck of comedians.\"\n\nThe progressive pile-on is objectively funny and, at first glance, looks like a welcome counterbalance to the millions of Rogan fans who make \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" the world's biggest podcast. In the special, Rogan aggressively mocks the LGBTQ community, punches down at the 7 million people who died of COVID, reminds fellow fearmongers about the asinine Pizzagate theory, and spreads plenty more misinformation -- all while claiming to be a good guy. It's grotesque, but par for the course for the data-driven streamer that proudly platforms transphobes like Dave Chappelle.\n\nAs home to the world's biggest stage in stand-up, Netflix has said it won't censor its talent no matter the cost. To his credit, Sarandos puts his money where his mouth is: Netflix signed nonbinary comedian Hannah Gadsby to a multi-year deal in 2022... after they called the company an \"amoral algorithm cult\" on Instagram. Playing both sides makes sense when the controversy is the product.\n\nThere's a recognizable press cycle around inflammatory Netflix specials: right-wingers flock to see their favorite mouthpieces pop off while angry progressives meet the moment online. Being funnier than the ignorant asshole on your phone or TV can feel like a big win for human decency in the moment -- but when does pushing back against something slide into giving it free publicity? In the age of ye olde algorithms, it might be sooner than you think.\n\nStreamers fight for eyeballs like any entertainment business. Netflix data remains one of the biggest mysteries in Hollywood (despite a new biannual report illuminating subscribers' most-watched content), but stand-up is an undeniable success story. Through-the-roof numbers for Chappelle's \"The Dreamer,\" released at the very end of December 2023, taught Netflix not only that the controversial comedian still had a loyal audience, but also that our addiction to outrage is still going strong. Chappelle's \"Sticks & Stones\" from 2019, which predates the notorious \"The Closer\" but included its own anti-trans rhetoric, remained the service's most-watched hour as of November 2023.\n\nPre-existing fan bases, even those much smaller than Rogan's, do well for Netflix. Take Matt Rife, who faced criticism for laughing at victims of domestic violence, children with intellectual disabilities, and other vulnerable groups. He also has 19 million followers on TikTok and saw his hour \"Natural Selection\" snag the title of most-watched Netflix special in 2023 with 13.5 million hours viewed.\n\nGoogle saw a predictable spike in searches for Joe Rogan the day \"Burn the Boats\" dropped (and a 40% increase in related searches for the word \"height\"). It's impossible to quantify the audience who engages with Rogan from the outside, but the business model for his work is well-established. Disagreement creates cross-pollination between groups and that back-and-forth makes an even bigger cultural moment. Rage bait, followed by backlash, is lucrative.\n\nEven if half the people who engage with the idea of Rogan don't watch him on Netflix, they prop up the show's existence by acknowledgment. A meme making fun of Rogan might get 40,000 likes from people who disagree with his views, but that's still 40,000 interactions. That data teaches any number of algorithms that \"Burn the Boats\" is something humans see as worthy of our time.\n\nIf you compare Rife, Rogan, and Chappelle to progressive comedians on the Netflix platform, the drop-off is steep. The progressive and genderqueer Gadsby's latest hour \"Something Special\" is a sentimental set dedicated to their partner, which graciously sidesteps the notorious Chappelle controversy. It netted just 300,000 hours watched in the second half of 2023. \"Something Special\" was released in May, so the report doesn't account for the initial rush of subscribers at debut -- but when compared to hyper-popular Taylor Tomlinson's \"Look at You\" from 2022 (holding attention still with 1.6 million hours watched in the second half of 2023), it's a painful drop.\n\nIn Q1 2024 Netflix added 9.3 million subscribers, almost double what industry analysts anticipated. The streamer also posted $9.37 billion in revenue, outdoing its own projection of $9.24 billion and defying Wall Street expectations of $8.73 billion. Factors in its success include the infamous password-sharing crackdown and the service's adoption of ads. But when it comes to the streamer's stand-up slate, hatred wins.\n\nSo, should viewers who disagree with Rogan unsubscribe from Netflix? Maybe not.\n\nBoycotts can be effective in changing toxic business behaviors, but the culture wars are too unwieldy to short-sheet from one side. Netflix's own employees walked out on the company at the height of the Chappelle controversy, to no effect. And if progressives disavow the platform en masse, the comedy specials with kinder lessons see even smaller audiences.\n\nRogan and Sarandos still cash checks despite critics' dreadful reviews of \"Burn the Boats.\" According to Rotten Tomatoes, audiences aren't pleased either. (Dear algorithm: If you're crawling this, it's an \"F\" from me, dawg.) Many of us may delight in dogpiling Rogan's artistic failure online, but silence could be the stronger choice. Take it from famed optimist Stephen King.\n\nIn \"It,\" the kid heroes learn an important lesson at the end of their battle with Pennywise. Trapped in a sewer system littered with the bodies of children who tried to fight back and lost, the Losers Club makes the brave decision to not be afraid. By not believing in the monster, by not feeding the evil entity with the terror in their souls, they take away its power. When it comes to Joe Rogan, we don't need to sharpen our quips or ready our retorts. Instead, post about the good comics making specials you believe in -- and together, we'll turn our back on this clown.", "source": {"uri": "indiewire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IndieWire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alison_foreman@indiewire.com", "name": "Alison Foreman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Rogan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Rogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stand-up comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Chappelle", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dave Chappelle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Burn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_streamer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Online streamer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-binary_gender", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Non-binary gender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizzagate_conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pizzagate conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannah_Gadsby", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hannah Gadsby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Misinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caillou", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caillou"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steroid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steroid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Censorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cannabis (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_community", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LGBT community"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cult"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Rife", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matt Rife"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DREAM_Act", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DREAM Act"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cinema of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennywise_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pennywise (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_King", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen King"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Joe-Rogan-Clown.png?w=650", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794360", "eventUri": "eng-9794360", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-03", "textStart": 216, "textEnd": 224}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

During his live special, Burn the Boats, Rogan talked about all manner of subjects that might be familiar to his vast podcasting audience. Rogan also wore a shirt that looked very yellow on television, leading to multiple people on social media making what perhaps seemed like the obvious comparison -- to the Minions of the Despicable Me movies.\n\nLook, we all like to make our jokes on the internet, but there's something about this line of ridicule that's pretty ridiculous. The Minions and Joe Rogan are totally different.\n\nHere are things I know about the Minions:\n\nJoe Rogan, meanwhile, is not very yellow -- he just made a poor shirt choice on Saturday, which happens to the best of us. He is also... definitely taller than the Minions, who are between three feet five inches and three feet seven inches tall. (How tall is Rogan, exactly? Google says five feet eight inches, proof that the Google algorithm is unimpeachable and its future AI products are definitely reliable.)\n\nRogan also cares about and does things that Minions don't seem to be much concerned with. Here are some other things I know about Minions:\n\nThe theme of Rogan's comedy special, as Vulture's Kathryn VanArendonk writes in her review, was that yeah, he talks about a lot of stuff on his podcast, but you shouldn't take it seriously:\n\nRogan's aware of his enormous reach... Still, the message of Burn the Boats is that everyone should just be chill about this. It's boring that he should have to be careful about what he says just because he's enormously influential. \"Take this advice: Don't take my advice,\" he says. His quotes get taken out of context because people \"take things that I'd said drunk, high as fuck, and they'd just put it in quotes.\" Don't take his advice about COVID, he says. Don't listen to him about vaccines. Don't pay attention to anything he says that happens to sound racist, because he swears he isn't. \"'Joe Rogan's giving out dangerous vaccine misinformation,'\" he says, mimicking his detractors. \"Fuck. Did I?\" he asks. \"I might've!\" But at the same time, \"if you're getting vaccine advice from me, is that really my fault?\"\n\nOkay, actually, perhaps this is something he does have in common with the Minions, who aren't much for taking responsibility for their actions. They often, in fact, do their best to point the finger at other Minions when something goes wrong. It's not their fault when a rocket they're building explodes, much like how it's not Rogan's fault when the millions of people who listen to him take him seriously, especially when he goes in deep on complicated subject matter with real-world impact.\n\nBut beyond this one similarity, let's all get on the same page here: Minions and Joe Rogan, totally different entities.

But this isn't the way to win him over to our side.\"\n\nHowever, there were mixed reactions to Rogan's announcement, including from people who agreed with him and others who believed the endorsement would pull votes away from Trump.\n\n\"Honestly, I want Joe Rogan to go in HARD on RFK Jr. I want him to tell every one of his listeners to vote for RFK.

While Rogan called out the \"lockstep\" push of positive information on Harris and ripped Walz as \"radical,\" he stated fact checkers were \"lying and intentionally misrepresenting facts.\" (RELATED: Harris Campaign Quietly Scrubs 'Retired Command Sergeant Major' From Walz's Bio)\n\n\"Yeah, no, we're definitely being gaslit. Not only that -- here's the big one, right? She wasn't elected, right? She was appointed vice president, and then they didn't do primaries. They had no primaries for Joe Biden, and now all of a sudden, she is the nominee because he's stepping away. So then they bring in her, and they bring in this other guy who's radical from Minnesota -- that's the vice president who he believes a lot of wild things,\" Rogan said.\n\n\"One of them is transgender surgery for people who are under 13. Another one is abortion up until nine months,\" Rogan continued. \"Obviously, there's reasons why people medically would... but that stuff scares the fuck out of people. He changed the Minnesota state flag to make it look like a Somali flag.\"\n\nRogan then showed Gymlan a video of Walz changing the Minnesota state flag; however, as his producer, Jamie Vernon, searched for the video, he noted how fact checkers were claiming the design wasn't similar to a Somali flag. Rogan immediately pushed back, calling out some fact checkers as \"completely full of shit.\"\n\n\"Yeah, that's the problem with, like, fact checkers. Some of these fact checkers are completely full of shit, like you're just trying to debunk something, especially now, when there's all this scrutiny being paid attention to what this guy's done,\" Rogan said.\n\nVernon then listed out articles in defense of Walz, pushing Rogan to pull up a side-by-side picture of the new Minnesota state flag with the Somali flag as he called out their similarities. Walz previously announced the change in May, as state lawmakers claimed the new design was meant to avoid painful memories for the native Americans who were depicted on the flag.\n\n\"Yeah, fact checkers are fucking dangerous. And it's really, I mean, what you're seeing is kind of treason. It's kind of what it is if you're seeing that kind of fact checking,\" Rogan continued. \"You're lying and you're intentionally misrepresenting facts, and you're doing so because you want a specific result politically, and it should be illegal. Especially if people think of you as a fact checker, you know, and what does that mean? What does it mean to be a fact checker?\"\n\n\"The problem with facts is a lot of them are very subjective, and you can find one small inconsistency or one -- you could phrase a question in a certain way and have your answer false in a different way, because you're just finding some nitpicky way to look at things. I've seen a lot of that, to the point where, like, that's not fact checked at all. You guys just fucking -- you're gaslighting.

The attacker was falsely identified on social media as a Muslim and an asylum seeker, leading to far-right protests and widespread violence. The unrest has seen racist attacks, arson, and looting, marking the worst disorder in England since the 2011 riots.\n\nRogan criticised what he perceives as severe government overreach in the UK, especially concerning restrictions on free speech. He argued that the government is becoming increasingly authoritarian, noting, \"You're seeing it now in England where people are getting arrested for tweets.\" Rogan further highlighted the disparity in arrests for so-called \"thought crimes\" between the UK and other countries, stating, \"I think there's something like 4,000 people who have been arrested in England for thought crimes... and I think it's only 200 in Russia.\"\n\nHe expressed deep concern about the implications of these arrests, saying, \"The fact that they're comfortable with finding people who've said something that they disagree with and putting them in a cage in England in 2024 is really wild.\" Rogan also questioned the subjectivity of hate speech laws, warning, \"Even if you say, 'Yeah, well, people shouldn't tweet hateful things,' who's to decide what is a hateful thing?

However, Vice President Kamala Harris has surged in recent polls following Biden's withdrawal from the race on July 21. Harris, who Biden endorsed when he announced he was stepping down from this year's race, has renewed momentum among Democratic voters and has seen record-breaking fundraising.\n\nPolls still show a close race between the two, however some conservatives have expressed concerns about whether Trump will win in November as Harris, the presumptive Democratic nominee, continues to build momentum.\n\nPool, host of Timcast IRL, wrote in a post to X, formerly Twitter, that he believes Trump is on track to lose the election.\n\nHis comments come amid debate among conservatives about podcaster Joe Rogan's support for independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Pool posted Friday morning that the \"cringiest thing imaginable\" is Trump supporters \"s***ting on\" Rogan for backing Kennedy Jr.\n\nConservative X user Catturd responded to Pool, criticizing \"Podcast Bros\" who he believed were \"simping for Bernie Bro Joe Rogan.\"\n\nPool, who has supported Trump in the past including the 2020 election, responded with a warning for conservatives hoping Trump can return to the White House next year.\n\n\"I think Trump is on track to lose and this is why[.] Dems are a cult, will march in lockstep[.] MAGA die hards can't form alliances properly[.] Independents / post libs will say f*** that. Registered dems outnumber GOP by almost 12m,\" Pool responded.\n\nHe added: \"There's a reason they can't get a Rogan endorsement and it's exactly this behavior. The top podcast, markedly independent, fair and honest And they decide to go to war with it instead of trying to ally with it.\"\n\nNewsweek has reached out to Trump's campaign for comment via email.\n\nRogan, who has supported political candidates from the Democratic and Republican political parties in the past, announced that he is backing Kennedy Jr. for president during his podcast on Thursday.\n\n\"I am a fan. He's the only one to make sense to me. He's the only one that doesn't attack people. He attacks actions and ideas, but he's much more reasonable and intelligent,\" Rogan said during an episode of his podcast.\n\nRogan said he likes Kennedy Jr. because he believes he is the only candidate who is not trying to \"gaslight\" and \"manipulate\" voters.\n\nKennedy Jr. is not widely viewed as likely to win any Electoral College votes, as polls currently show him polling in the single digits. However, he could still play a pivotal role in the election if he siphons off enough voters from either candidate to give the opponent an advantage in the key swing states. Some polls suggest Kennedy Jr. may be more of a threat to Trump than to Harris.\n\nA Marist College poll, which surveyed 1,513 registered voters from August 1 to 4, found him winning 5 percent of the vote. The poll found Harris with a 3-point lead over Trump (48 to 45 percent). The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points.\n\nDuring a news conference at Mar-a-Lago on Thursday, Trump responded to recent polls, saying he is \"leading by a lot.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_stanton@newsweek.com", "name": "Andrew Stanton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Rogan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Rogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Party (UK)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John F.

After all, his career thrives on sharing polarising opinions and getting in the headlines - as it results in more clicks and therefore more money for him.\n\nHowever, the 56-year-old is now facing further backlash online, after one viewer made a comparison between a joke of his and a stand-up routine previously told by Evans.\n\nThe connection was made after viewers shared a clip from Rogan's show on TikTok, which sees him comparing alien invasions to fishing, saying: \"I think the dumbest argument that aren't real [is] people go 'if aliens are real, why don't they just land on the White House lawn' when you go fishing do you check in with the president of the lake?\n\n\"No you just trick those dummies with fake food, take pictures of them and then you drop them back in the water.\"\n\nThe routine then sees Rogan declare that fish are dropped back in the lake afterwards thinking 'what the f**k just happened'.\n\nThe routine didn't impress viewers, with one person writing: \"I listen to joe everyday. I watched this whole special with a complete straight face.\n\n\"And the crowd goes mild,\" a second person added.\n\nHowever, a third viewer made went beyond calling the routine boring or unfunny, by seemingly accusing Rogan of recycling a previous joke of Evans', stating: \"Lee Evans did the that fish bit in the 90s.\"\n\nThe particular routine the commenter is referring to is one of Evans' called 'Gone Fishing', which sees the comedian recount his confusion that fish are able to be repeatedly get caught and then thrown back into the water over and over again.\n\nWatch the clip of Evans' performance below:\n\nObviously the two routines aren't identical word for word - as Rogan's is making a direct parallel between human experiences and aliens, while Evans' only focuses how fish often caught and thrown back into the water, only to be caught again. However, both the jokes use the idea of the fish being 'abducted by aliens' as the punchline, which is likely the point the original commenter is making.\n\nLADBible has reached out to Joe Rogan's representatives for comment.", "source": {"uri": "ladbible.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LADbible"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Evans_(comedian)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lee Evans (comedian)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Rogan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Rogan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_comedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stand-up comedy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fishing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Extraterrestrial life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_invasion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alien invasion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_abduction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alien abduction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punch_line", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Punch line"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recycling", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recycling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Comedian"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Fishing", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Fishing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Fish_and_Aquaria", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Fish and Aquaria", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Fish", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Pets/Fish", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://images.ladbible.com/resize?type=webp&quality=70&width=1200&fit=contain&gravity=auto&url=https://images.ladbiblegroup.com/v3/assets/bltcd74acc1d0a99f3a/bltd5a4f1418a7f1568/66b235dedcb6f1a7ce3dab1d/Copy_of_Joe_Rogan_.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794360", "eventUri": "eng-9794360", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-03", "textStart": 263, "textEnd": 271}], "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

He also took aim at trans people at certain parts in the comedy special. Now, it is important to note that Joe Rogan has always been supportive of same-sex marriage and gay rights, but he's toed the line when discussing trans rights.\n\nAnd, trust me, I'm not naive to his other polarizing beliefs... like when he spread COVID misinformation.\n\nPinkNews was kind enough to transcribe some of his comments and I've included those below:\n\nI'm not even remotely homophobic. I'm the opposite. I wish I was gay. I miss saying faggot. I love gay men, but I think about gay men the same way I think about mountain lions. I'm happy they're real, but I don't want to be surrounded by them. They're a bunch of dudes who fuck dudes. I don't like my chances. They're not unicorns, they're just men who fuck men.\n\nI fully support your right as an adult to do whatever you want that makes you happy. I believe in freedom, and I believe in love. But I also believe in crazy people. It's almost like a pervert wizard waved a magic spell on the whole world. 'With a wave of this wand, you can walk into the women's locker room with a hard cock, and anybody who complains is a Nazi. Abracadabra.'\n\nHere's my question for Instinct Magazine readers... Obviously, Joe's comments about trans folks were out of line and probably fueled by some sort of prejudice. However, he has been a supporter of gay people. Where do we draw the line between comedy commentary and hate? Can a straight man make fun of the LGBT people on a grand stage if done in jest?\n\nJoe Rogan is famous for being a UFC commentator and interviewer since 1997 as well as the host of iconic reality series 'Fear Factor.'

It's why critics savaged his new Netflix comedy special, \"Joe Rogan: Burn the Boats.\" The press slammed every moment of the hour-long event, calling it homophobic, transphobic, and more.\n\nIt's like the reviews were written the day before.\n\nThe funniest caterwauling came from (where else?) MSNBC. The outlet published a \"think\" piece that not only savaged \"Burn the Boats\" but Rogan's fans.\n\nIt's not enough that Rogan is the Antichrist; it's his fans who deserve equal blame.\n\nIf Rogan is a mouthpiece for his audience's interests, then what did his special teach us about those who adore him? For starters, Roganites love \"boys will be boys\" humor.\n\nThe horror, the horror.\n\nImagine putting every comedian's joke, large or small, under the microscope until it echoes your far-left beliefs.\n\nNow, that's funny.\n\nBen Stiller has a powerful reason for voting for Vice President Kamala Harris this fall.

You can be more than one thing, it's incredible. I'm Jewish and Irish. I wish I was black -- every white, Jewish guy wishes he was black.\"\n\nVote Harris in 2024. She's ... everything! It's better than hope and change, no?\n\nThere's one valuable lesson from Stiller's pitch. You never go the full ... Simple Jack.\n\nJack Black's summer just got worse.\n\nIt didn't seem possible after his Tenacious D bandmate's birthday wish -- that the next Trump assassin shouldn't miss.\n\nThe band shuttered its tour, bandmate Kyle Gass lost his representation, and Black put a temporary hold on all future gigs. He essentially canceled himself.\n\nThat may pale compared to Black's latest indignity. He's about to star in a true Hollywood flop. \"Borderlands,\" opening Aug. 9, is based on the popular video game of the same name. Playing along with Black? Oscar winner Jamie Lee Curtis, Kevin Hart, and Cate Blanchett.\n\nSo far, so good. Very good, to be honest. Except the proverbial buzz is off the charts -- in the wrong direction.\n\nMajor reshoots. A new director brought in to finish the project. No critics' screenings.

Kennedy Jr., and then tried to backtrack and claim it wasn't an official endorsement, he drew the ire of Donald Trump.\n\nThe Republican presidential candidate and convicted felon took to Truth Social Friday afternoon to attack the conservative comedian, podcaster, and UFC commentator, speculating that UFC fans might not be happy with Rogan's stance.\n\nThe notoriously thin-skinned Trump has courted the UFC and mixed martial arts fans during his presidential campaign, even having UFC CEO Dana White introduce him at the Republican National Convention. Trump attended three UFC events in 2023 alone, and continued to show the organization his support in 2024. He has even floated the idea of UFC matches between migrants and native-born Americans.\n\nAttacking Rogan, who hosts one of the most popular podcasts in the country and one listened to by many on the right, is not the wisest decision for Trump. Rogan has survived criticism over his views on Islamophobia, vaccines, Covid-19, racism, and the LGBTQ+ community, particularly transgender people, among other controversies. Despite courting a nuclear level of criticism, he continues to retain millions of listeners, and his UFC fan base predates the podcast. And again, Rogan said he hasn't actually made his endorsement yet.\n\nRogan's following mostly consists of young men, just like that of Adin Ross, who recently interviewed Trump for his livestream. Trump wants and needs that audience to turn out and vote for him, and in recent weeks, young people, both men and women, have been flocking to the Harris-Walz campaign and helping to sell out rallies.

Imagine pitching either \"Wedding Crashers\" or \"Old School\" to a woke movie executive.\n\nSo much for white male privilege. Where are the nonbinary characters?\n\nIt explains why Vaughn transitioned to more dangerous roles, like his menacing turn in 2017's \"Brawl in Cell Block 99.\"\n\nNow, he's sharing why we don't see films like \"The Hangover\" any more.\n\nThe Hollywood suits are too cowardly and the woke mob won't let select jokes be told, he shared with the New York Times. Except he phrased the latter without the usual mealy-mouthed euphemisms.\n\n\"It's a crazy thing as human beings to think that my ideas are the best and if I can just force people to do what I believe, the world will be great,\" noted Vaughn.\n\nDisney finally got some good news. The flailing studio dropped bomb after bomb on unsuspecting consumers last year, capped by the disastrous MCU dud \"The Marvels.\"\n\nThis summer? Both \"Inside Out 2\" and \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" are rocking the box office.\n\nHow is the Mouse House thanking its fans? A price hike!\n\nYes, if you want to hate-watch \"The Marvels\" or \"The Acolyte,\" you'll have to pay two more dollars per month on both its ad and ad-free platforms.\n\nBob Dylan is coming down the chimney this Christmas.\n\n\"A Complete Unknown,\" director James Mangold's biopic of the folk legend, will debut December 25. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet stars as the mercurial singer in a film brimming with Oscar potential.\n\nThe only downside? The millions of Gen Z types currently Googling, \"Who or what is a Bob Dylan?\"\n\nJoe Rogan is an innocent man.\n\nThe podcast giant never slept with a White House intern, shot a cinematographer, or exposed himself to fellow comedians.\n\nTell that to the media. Journos loathe Rogan like the Trump son we never knew existed. It's why critics savaged his new Netflix comedy special, \"Joe Rogan: Burn the Boats.\" The press slammed every moment of the hour-long event, calling it homophobic, transphobic, and more.\n\nIt's like the reviews were written the day before.\n\nThe funniest caterwauling came from (where else?) MSNBC. The outlet published a \"think\" piece that not only savaged \"Burn the Boats\" but Rogan's fans.\n\nIt's not enough that Rogan is the Antichrist; it's his fans who deserve equal blame.\n\nIf Rogan is a mouthpiece for his audience's interests, then what did his special teach us about those who adore him? For starters, Roganites love \"boys will be boys\" humor.\n\nThe horror, the horror.\n\nImagine putting every comedian's joke, large or small, under the microscope until it echoes your far-left beliefs.\n\nNow, that's funny.\n\nBen Stiller has a powerful reason for voting for Vice President Kamala Harris this fall. Three, actually.\n\n\"She's going to be the first woman president, and that's incredibly exciting. And you know, she's Indian. She's black. She's everything. You can be more than one thing, it's incredible. I'm Jewish and Irish. I wish I was black -- every white, Jewish guy wishes he was black.\"\n\nVote Harris in 2024. She's ... everything! It's better than hope and change, no?\n\nThere's one valuable lesson from Stiller's pitch. You never go the full ... Simple Jack.\n\nJack Black's summer just got worse.\n\nIt didn't seem possible after his Tenacious D bandmate's birthday wish -- that the next Trump assassin shouldn't miss.\n\nThe band shuttered its tour, bandmate Kyle Gass lost his representation, and Black put a temporary hold on all future gigs. He essentially canceled himself.\n\nThat may pale compared to Black's latest indignity. He's about to star in a true Hollywood flop. \"Borderlands,\" opening Aug. 9, is based on the popular video game of the same name. Playing along with Black? Oscar winner Jamie Lee Curtis, Kevin Hart, and Cate Blanchett.\n\nSo far, so good. Very good, to be honest. Except the proverbial buzz is off the charts -- in the wrong direction.\n\nMajor reshoots. A new director brought in to finish the project. No critics' screenings. And now, predictions that a movie with a $120 million budget could open as low as $10 million this weekend.", "source": {"uri": "theblaze.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheBlaze"}, "authors": [],

I'm just kidding -- I don't think Michelle Obama's got a dick, but I believe all of that other shit.\"\n\nThe claim that Michelle Obama was a man or trans is part of a pattern of racist, anti-Black, and misogynistic hate that Black women have been dealing with forever.\n\nAnd the Obama reference wasn't the only jab he made against trans people, as he later directly attacked them as well.\n\n\"It's almost like a pervert wizard waved a magic spell on the whole world,\" he said. \"'With a wave of this wand, you can walk into the women's locker room with a hard cock, and anybody who complains is a Nazi. Abracadabra!' And it just works! And everyone just accepts this new reality, and it's fucking weird. I just think we need standards. You can't just put lipstick on and now you can shit in the women's room!\"\n\nBut Rogan's ultimate enemy, according to the special, are gay men, who he views as predators.\n\n\"I don't hate anybody. I love everyone,\" he claimed. \"And I love gay men. But I think about gay men the same way I think about mountain lions: I'm happy they're real, but I don't want to be surrounded by them.\"\n\n\"They're a bunch of dudes who fuck dudes. I don't like my chances, okay? They're not unicorns - they're just men who fuck men. And every man who's ever lived is a shifty cum salesman, okay? 100%. Especially the ones who say they're not.\"\n\nThe idea that gay men are predators who will pounce on any straight man they see is as old as homophobia itself.\n\nThis idea is behind the \"gay panic defense,\" a legal strategy that people have used to \"partially or completely excuse crimes such as murder and assault on the grounds that the victim's sexual orientation or gender identity is to blame for the defendant's violent reaction,\" according to the American Bar Association.\n\nThis legal defense is only prohibited in 19 states and Washington, D.C., meaning that in the majority of states, Rogan's belief that gay men are like mountain lions could be used as a defense if someone were arrested for assaulting, or even murdering, a gay man.\n\nWhile we're not particularly surprised that this level of homophobia still exists, especially in the world of comedy, it's still disappointing to see it get a huge platform.", "source": {"uri": "out.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

In what was nothing short of epic, the former President and current Republican nominee defiantly raised his fist and shouted \"Fight! Fight! Fight!\" with blood streaming down his face.\n\nIt's honestly nothing short of incredible that he had that reaction to getting shot, and I'd say the same about any other politician who did the same.\n\nRogan liked what he saw.\n\nRogan was in the news this week when people interpreted positive comments about RFK Jr. as an endorsement. He addressed the claims Friday, and shared some praise for Trump while doing it.\n\n\"For the record, this isn't an endorsement. This is me saying that I like RFKjr as a person, and I really appreciate the way he discusses things with civility and intelligence. I think we could use more of that in this world. I also think Trump raising his fist and saying 'fight!' after getting shot is one of the most American f*cking things of all time,\" Rogan said in a tweet.\n\nYou can check his full tweet out below, and let me know your thoughts at David.Hookstead@outkick.com.\n\nRogan certainly isn't alone in his praise for Trump. He's received praise from across the spectrum. Mark Zuckerberg called it \"badass,\" a former Delta Force operator praised his response and a SEAL Team 6 buddy of mine said the former President's reaction can't be taught.\n\nYou either have that in your soul or you don't. The man took a bullet to the ear and was able to keep his senses enough to hit his fans with a \"Fight!\" fist pump. Zuckerberg was 100 percent correct when he called it badass.\n\nIt's hard to believe it hasn't even been a month since Trump was shot in Butler. Feels like a lifetime ago, and it's already mostly out of the media. He's fortunate to be alive. There's really no other way to put it.

Almost fought Wesley Snipes in MMA but the actor backed out due to concerns about a mismatch. McCarthy suggested banning 12-6 elbows due to a misunderstanding about the technique's potential danger.\n\nThe UFC's main color commentator for over 20 years also happens to host the world's biggest podcast. The Joe Rogan Experience (JRE) first aired in December 2009. Starting out as a passion project from which Rogan had no expectations, the podcast now has over 10 billion downloads (200 million per month) and is available in 185 countries.\n\nWith more than 2,100 podcasts (and counting) in the JRE library, Joe has hosted guests from all walks of life. Naturally, plenty of fighters have made appearances. These conversations have revealed incredible insights that capture the attention of UFC fans.\n\n10 Joe Is A True Martial Artist\n\nRogan Has A Background In Taekwondo, Kickboxing, And BJJ\n\nJoe is a lifelong martial arts practitioner, starting out in Taekwondo. He has two BJJ back belts. As an amateur, he has a 2-1 kickboxing record.\n\nJoe is known for many things, from commentary to stand-up comedy. However, through the podcast, it has been revealed that he's a legitimate martial artist. He holds BJJ black belts from world champion practitioner, Jean Jacques Machado, and Tenth Planet founder, Eddie Bravo.\n\nRogan is also a black belt in Taekwondo and won the U.S. Open Taekwondo Championship (lightweight division) and Grand Championship when he was 19 years old. He fought in amateur kickboxing before hanging up his gloves due to concerns over concussions.\n\n9 Joe Rogan vs. Wesley Snipes Almost Happened\n\nRogan And Snipes Were In Advanced Negotiations To Fight In MMA\n\nSnipes was facing financial problems and was looking for a way to pay debts. The UFC's Campbell McLaren suggested that the actor challenge Rogan to an MMA bout. The Blade star's martial arts experience was no comparison to Rogan's.\n\nJoe Rogan was in serious talks to fight actor, Wesley Snipes, in 2010. This bombshell was first revealed in 2016 in an episode with George St-Pierre (GSP).\n\nOver the years, Joe revealed further details, giving a clearer picture of what went down. According to him, Snipes pulled out of negotiations after realizing the contest would be a mismatch.\n\nRelated\n\nJoe Rogan's UFC Salary And Contract Explored\n\nJoe Rogan is the iconic UFC color commentator and in well paid for his loyal service to the company.\n\n8 The Reason Behind The 12-6 Elbows Rule\n\nThe Downward Elbow Has Long Been A Controversial Rule\n\nThe no 12-6 elbow rule is commonly disputed in MMA. Former referee, \"Big\" John McCarthy was part of the original team that wrote the unified rules of MMA in April 2001. Jon Jones' only loss was a disqualification due to an illegal downward elbow.\n\nOn multiple podcasts, Rogan claimed that McCarthy suggested prohibiting downward elbows after seeing a late-night infomercial with karate practitioners breaking bricks with this technique.\n\nMcCarthy later made an appearance on JRE, where he told the real story. It turns out the commission wanted to ban elbows entirely. After John persuaded the panel to allow them, one doctor intervened and claimed he saw people break large blocks of ice with that technique. And so, they made a compromise.\n\nRelated\n\nJon Jones Reacts 12-6 Elbows Rule Change, Wants UFC Loss Removed\n\nJon Jones plans to appeal his only loss which was based on his use of the 12-6 elbow over 15 years ago.\n\n7 Yoel Romero Is a Freak Of Nature\n\n\"Soldier Of God\" Was Feared By Fellow Fighters\n\nRomero is a world champion freestyle wrestler and won a silver medal at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. He made his pro MMA debut at 32. Now approaching 50, he still competes at the highest level in the sport.\n\nMost MMA fans don't need help noticing that Yoel Romero is a physical specimen. However, on JRE episode 1,447, Joe shared a story about Romero that further demonstrates he is not a normal human being.\n\nAccording to Rogan, after injuring his orbital bone in a fight, Romero was taken to a specialist by the UFC. After his appointment, the doctor called up the UFC, asking \"Where did you get this guy?\". He went on to explain that Romero was already healing, and he had never seen a person like him in 40 years of practice.\n\nJoe went on to say that Romero's eye tendons are four times larger than a normal person's. It's no wonder he can still fight at the highest level while approaching 50 years of age.\n\nNote: Joe has recounted various versions of this story where the specifics differ somewhat.\n\n6 Donald Cerrone Almost Died While Scuba Diving\n\n\"Cowboy\" Is An Avid Extreme Sports Enthusiast\n\nCerrone is known for his wild lifestyle. After retiring from MMA, he transitioned into acting, racing, bull riding, and other extreme sports. Cowboy was inducted into the UFC Hall of Fame in 2023.\n\nCowboy has been a regular JRE guest, always entertaining listeners with fight tales. On the JRE MMA Show #39, his near-death scuba story was one of the most gripping in JRE history.\n\nWhile on vacation with his wife and baby in Mexico, Cerrone went cave diving with a friend. Although both had experience, they soon found themselves in a world of trouble. Cowboy's diving partner accidentally kicked the floor, sending silt everywhere. He then panicked and got wrapped around the guiding line, essentially leaving both divers blind.\n\nCerrone admitted to panicking too and, by a stroke of luck, he managed to follow the guideline through zero visibility to escape. He even managed to save his friend, which was a major risk.\n\nRelated\n\n10 Things UFC Fans Should Know About Donald \"Cowboy\" Cerrone\n\nA divisive figure in the industry, there are a lot of things that UFC fans should know about Donald \"Cowboy\" Cerrone.\n\n5 Jon Jones Confirms The Partying Rumors\n\nJones Has The Most Title Defenses In UFC History\n\nThe two-division champion was suspended multiple times while in the UFC. Jones has been arrested for substance-related offenses. In many people's eyes, he is the best MMA fighter ever.\n\nJon Jones made his long-anticipated JRE debut in 2016 when he revealed his pre-fight partying rituals. Arguably the greatest of all time, Jones' notorious out-of-the-cage lifestyle has marred his career somewhat, getting him into trouble on several occasions.\n\nIn this episode, he admitted to partying the weekend before every fight:\n\n\"I would party one week before every fight. And, I did it throughout my whole career. This was stupid but it was a mental crutch...I would go out and I would get blackout wasted.\"\n\nRelated\n\n10 Biggest Controversies Of Jon Jones' UFC Career\n\nOne of the MMA's greatest fighters Jon Jones has remained a constant enigma with a near perfect record shrouded in controversies.\n\n4 Pride FC's Lack Of PED Testing\n\nThe UFC Bought Pride In 2007\n\nPride's first rounds were 10 minutes. Fighters competed under different rule sets, usually in a boxing ring, and head stomps were allowed. The UFC bought Pride in 2007.\n\nOld-school MMA fans wax lyrical about the Pride Days. That said, most agree that the Pride era was the wild-west for performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs).\n\nEnson Inoue, Pride and UFC veteran, made a remarkable claim on JRE #511 that all but confirmed this. According to Inoue, Pride contracts specifically stated that they do not test for steroids.\n\nRelated\n\n10 Things MMA Fans Should Know About Pride FC\n\nPride FC was a historic MMA organisation and these are all the facts fans should know.\n\n3 GSP's Alien Encounters\n\nSt-Pierre Is Adored In And Out Of The Octagon\n\nGSP is one of the UFC's most-loved characters and has appeared on JRE several times. He claimed to be losing hours of his day. Joe later stated that he believed GSP's lost time was due to head trauma from fighting.\n\nOne of the most bizarre stories in JRE history comes from UFC Welterweight icon, George St-Pierre. GSP talked about losing time at various periods of the day. He claimed to wake up, look at the clock, take his eyes off it, and then look again, only to see that four hours had passed.\n\nGSP put this down to \"a third type of encounter.\" As it often does, this led to a discussion about aliens, which ended up extending into future podcasts.\n\nRelated\n\n10 Best Performances Of Georges St-Pierre's UFC Career, According To Stats\n\nThese are the best performances in Georges St-Pierre's historic UFC career.\n\n2 Francis Ngannou's Heroic Journey To Freedom\n\n\"The Predator\" Faced Extreme Adversity To Escape Africa\n\nNgannou's father was a fierce street fighter in Cameroon.

However, most MMA fans didn't know this until he described how he escaped from Africa to create a better life. His arduous journey is one that can't be summarized. Listen to every detail from Francis' mouth in this video.\n\n1 The Gracie Family Are The UFC's True Pioneers\n\nWithout The Gracies, MMA Would Look Very Different\n\nH\u00e9lio Gracie is widely regarded as the father of BJJ. His son, Royce won UFC 1, and revolutionized the sport of MMA. His other son, Rickson, competed in Pride 1 and enjoyed an undefeated MMA career.\n\nThe Joe Rogan Experience is a great resource for UFC fans to deepen their knowledge of the sport. Fortunately, Joe has hosted countless fighters, including MMA royalty, like the Gracie family, including Royce, Rickson, and Kron.\n\nAlthough the Gracie family is well known to MMA fans, Joe gave them even more exposure to share their stories and knowledge.", "source": {"uri": "thesportster.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheSportster"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Trump attended three UFC events in 2023 alone, and continued to show the organization his support in 2024. He has even floated the idea of UFC matches between migrants and native-born Americans.\n\nAttacking Rogan, who hosts one of the most popular podcasts in the country and one listened to by many on the right, is not the wisest decision for Trump. Rogan has survived criticism over his views on Islamophobia, vaccines, Covid-19, racism, and the LGBTQ+ community, particularly transgender people, among other controversies. Despite courting a nuclear level of criticism, he continues to retain millions of listeners, and his UFC fan base predates the podcast. And again, Rogan said he hasn't actually made his endorsement yet.\n\nRogan's following mostly consists of young men, just like that of Adin Ross, who recently interviewed Trump for his livestream. Trump wants and needs that audience to turn out and vote for him, and in recent weeks, young people, both men and women, have been flocking to the Harris-Walz campaign and helping to sell out rallies. If Trump alienates them, he might find himself at a disadvantage on election night.", "source": {"uri": "newrepublic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New Republic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "hafiz_rashid@newrepublic.com", "name": "Hafiz Rashid", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Abortion", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Media", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/6acff20e3ff0f5a1642781c6b7bca75aea35827b.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9794360", "eventUri": "eng-9794360", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 111, "relevance": 1}

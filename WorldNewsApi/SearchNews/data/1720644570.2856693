Solskjaer has not managed a club since leaving United in November 2021, turning down a number of roles with clubs and national teams since leaving Old Trafford. The Norwegian, though, appears to be looking to return to the dugout having just missed out the Besiktas job earlier in the week. Earlier in the year, Solskjaer hinted that he would consider one more club job and that opportunity could have presented itself after recently-promoted Leicester City contacted the 51-year-old, according to the Sun. The Foxes are looking for a new boss following the untimely departure of Enzo Maresca who jumped ship to become Chelsea\u2019s new head coach having guided Leicester back to the top flight at the first time of asking. Solskjaer is said to be highly rated by Leicester chairman Top Srivaddhanaprabha and was under consideration for the job last summer following the departure of Dean Smith. No concrete talks are said to have taken place, but the Norwegian is expected to feature on the club\u2019s shortlist of replacements for Maresca.

However, after overseeing five defeats in seven Premier League games, he was relieved of his duties following a 4-1 defeat against Watford. Since September last year, he has been working as a technical observer for UEFA. Leicester, meanwhile, have reportedly approached former Chelsea boss Graham Potter about their manager vacancy, while Steve Cooper is said to be another name under consideration.

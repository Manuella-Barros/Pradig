And some of them are scumbags. I mentioned a couple of them. There's probably a laundry list of folks,\" Gonzales said.He continued: \"Some of these people that are running throughout the country, they're not MAGA [Make America Great Again] folks....Bob Good, he's not a MAGA guy that's supporting my opponent, and some other people...they're basically libertarians or anarchists or they just want to see the place burn down.\"Amid months of party infighting, House Republicans ousted House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, battled over Mike Johnson's speakership and have seen massive divisions over foreign aid.\"Are we going to be the party that governs and gets things done in a conservative manner?\" Gonzales asked Sunday. \"Or are we going to be the party that has jesters that come up here and say wild and crazy outrageous things and just try to burn the place down?\"Newsweek reached out to Gonzales, Herrera, Gaetz and Good via email Sunday morning. This story will be updated with any provided statements.Gonzales' runoff against Herrera, which has seen nearly $8 million spent on TV ads according to CNN, is among several contested and contentious House Republican primaries during this election cycle.The large Texas district includes the town of Uvalde where 19 students and two teachers were killed in one of the worst school shootings in history in 2022. Herrera, known as \"The AK Guy\" with more than 3 million YouTube subscribers, has centered his fight against Gonzales around the incumbent's vote for a bipartisan gun safety bill following the deadly shooting.\"I don't regret any of my votes,\" Gonzales told CNN. \"Something has to change.\"However, that bipartisan vote and his comments last year about a GOP-backed border bill were among the issues that emboldened his critics within the party that are backing Herrera.\"He is a RINO [Republican in name only]-establishment moderate who is about to be voted out of office by his constituents who are going to vote for Brandon Herrera,\" Good, the chairman of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, told CNN.Gonzales said that if he's successful in his runoff, he plans to seek revenge by campaigning for the primary challengers facing Gaetz and Good.\"I plan to spend a lot of time in Pensacola,\" Gonzales told CNN, referring to the city in Gaetz's Florida Panhandle. \"I plan to spend a lot of time in Virginia and some of these other places. So I think my race is only the beginning, right? You can send everything you got at me. You're never going to beat me, right? You're just not.\"Gonzales and Herrera were the top two finishers in the five-candidate Republican primary on March 5, receiving 45.4 percent and 24.2 percent of the vote, respectively. The two will face off again in Tuesday's runoff because neither received more than 50 percent of the vote.", "summary": "Texas Representative Tony Gonzales said not all of his Republican colleagues are \"rewarding citizens\" and \"productive members of society.\"", "url": "https://www.newsweek.com/republican-tony-gonzales-probably-laundry-list-scumbags-gop-1904819", "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2399250/gonzales-dc.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 15:57:35", "author": "Gabe Whisnant", "authors": ["Gabe Whisnant"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.021}

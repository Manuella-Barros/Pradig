Stashing tomatoes in the fridge alongside other fruits and veggies might seem like the right move, but this can actually harm their flavour and texture. Kitchen Mason's very own Emma, a culinary whizz, has shared her insights on how to keep tomatoes tasting rich and juicy and it's all about room temperature. She advised: \"The best place to store tomatoes is on your kitchen worktop at room temperature. Although keep them away from your oven, or any other heat source.\" To avoid bruising these delicate fruits, it's recommended to lay them out in a flat dish rather than heaping them in a bowl, which allows for better air circulation, reports the Express. But why should you not store tomatoes in the fridge? Read more 'Genius' microwave cleaning hack has everyone asking 'why didn't I think of that' Cold storage is a no-go for tomatoes because it shuts down the enzymes that contribute to their taste, resulting in a lacklustre fruit. Refrigeration also stops tomatoes from ripening further, which not only impacts the flavour but can also make them mealy and mushy. The ideal time to refrigerate tomatoes is when they're at peak ripeness, but even then, it's crucial to let them return to room temperature on the countertop before tucking in to enjoy their full, delicious taste. Emma added a final tip: \"You shouldn't refrigerate tomatoes unless they've been cut. \"However, if your tomatoes are at their perfect ripeness, or the weather is particularly hot I actually DO recommend that you store your tomatoes in the fridge. Refrigeration inhibits a tomatoes natural ripening process. But if it's already at it's best, you don't need to worry about that!\" Once you've brought your tomatoes home from the supermarket, place them on a plate on the countertop, away from the oven, stove and anything hot in the kitchen. It's important to remove the vines and stems from the tomatoes as they can draw moisture away from the fruit, so getting rid of them will keep the fruit plumper for longer. The key to keeping tomatoes fresh is preventing moisture from leaving the fruit, which is why it is recommended to place the tomatoes upside down with the stem side on the plate to reduce air exposure and evaporation. Emma advised: \"When storing fresh tomatoes at room temperature, store them stem side down. This prevents them from losing moisture as quickly, and they will keep for much longer. A flat dish is better for this than a bowl.\" Storing tomatoes upside down protects the stem scar from bacteria as it minimises its exposure, reducing the risk of contamination and preventing the tomatoes from spoiling before their time.", "summary": "Most people put tomatoes in the fridge, but it turns out they can lose their flavour and texture if they're stored at cold temperatures, according to a cook and food expert", "url": "https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/uk-news/best-place-store-tomatoes-keep-29322207", "image": "https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/news/uk-news/article29322206.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_picture-of-red-tomatoes-on-a-plate.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 14:51:34", "author": "Katherine McPhillips,Katy Hallam", "authors": ["Katherine McPhillips", "Katy Hallam"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.047}

Following a competitive Dragon\u2019s Den-style pitch process to find this year\u2019s most innovative products, 13 suppliers across five counties were handpicked for the programme after an intensive application process which saw producers put through their paces with a business pitch to Lidl\u2019s buying team and a taste test to select the best in category. The successful producers will now see their artisan offerings, spanning 33 new products, on sale on Lidl\u2019s shelves across its 220 stores across the island of Ireland from September 19 for a limited time, while stocks last. From delicious overnight oats to farm shop meals and mouth-watering hot sauces, this year\u2019s assortment will have something for everyone, with a focus on protein packed products and showcasing the fruits of Northern Ireland\u2019s apple orchards, with cider, gin and spiced apple punch all in this year\u2019s mix. Now in its seventh year, Lidl Northern Ireland\u2019s Kickstart programme is backed by the Northern Ireland Food & Drink Association (NIFDA) and aims to support small and medium-sized local producers to boost their brand, enhance their supply and reach new customer audiences. Before the products hit the shelves, this six-month development programme offers suppliers dedicated business support from Lidl Northern Ireland\u2019s in-house experts, advancing their product, brand and business with practical guidance on how to scale production, drive production efficiency, as well as product development and packaging support, allowing them to optimise on-shelf opportunities in the autumn and scale for success. Since launching the programme in the region in 2018, Lidl Northern Ireland has showcased over 50 innovative home-grown products, offering small and medium sized producers the opportunity to reach over two million weekly Lidl customers across the island of Ireland and get a foot up in breaking into the competitive supermarket retail sector. This year\u2019s intake will see products from the following producers hit Lidl Northern Ireland stores this autumn: Kate O\u2019Driscoll, supplier development manager at Lidl Ireland, said: \u201cNorthern Ireland is a region famed for its food and drink and every year I\u2019m impressed by the innovation, quality and craftsmanship that suppliers clearly pour into their products. The standard is always incredibly high and this year was no exception. \u201cAfter a competitive application process, I\u2019m delighted to add 13 local suppliers to our Kickstart programme this year and bring 33 new, locally made products to shoppers across the region.\u201d", "summary": "A group of 13 Northern Ireland artisan suppliers have been chosen to showcase a range of innovative products through Lidl\u2019s store network.", "url": "https://www.northernirelandworld.com/news/people/here-are-the-new-artisan-offerings-from-13-suppliers-to-hit-the-shelves-in-lidl-northern-ireland-stores-4683916", "image": "https://www.northernirelandworld.com/webimg/b25lY21zOjE4NThhNzIzLWVlYzEtNGMwYS1hNzJiLWFiNzcwMDE2ODQzNjo0ZDYwNjEzZC0yMTczLTRhYmYtOGI0Ny04NTgxODNkNWU2ZDk=.jpg?width=1200&enable=upscale", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 05:23:24", "author": "Valerie Martin", "authors": ["Valerie Martin"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": 0.424}

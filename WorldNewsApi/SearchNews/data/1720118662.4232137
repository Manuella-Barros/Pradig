{"id": 227488516, "title": "Eric Clapton&#39;s 5 Children: All About His 4 Daughters and Late Son", "text": "Eric Clapton is known as one of the most influential guitarists in rock history. Between his 17 Grammy Awards and being a three-time inductee into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the musician has his fair share of achievements across his decades-long career. The Yardbirds guitarist\u2019s legacy, however, spans further than his chart-topping hits. Clapton is a father of five children: Ruth, Julie Rose, Ella May, Sophie Belle, and the late Conor, who died in 1991. Clapton fathered his first child, Ruth, with Yvonne Kelly in 1985. At the time, the musician was still married to his first wife, Pattie Boyd. Ruth was kept a secret from Boyd, and it was only after Conor\u2019s death at age 4 that the little girl's identity was revealed. In the 2007 biography, Clapton: The Autobiography, Clapton is quoted as crediting his daughter for helping him cope with his grief. \u201cYvonne knew that [being close to Ruth] would help and it was true. I was able to hold a child again, and to be held by a child,\u201d he said. Ruth has been a tremendous support. I had no idea how much power a child could have on an adult life, how much it can make you feel valid, unique and strong.\u201d Read on to learn more about the British guitarist\u2019s five kids. Ruth Clapton, 39 Clapton\u2019s first, Ruth, was born on Jan. 12, 1985. Although Clapton and Ruth were close during her childhood, the father and daughter spent a number of years estranged from each other. However, they have since mended their relationship and were on good terms by the time Ruth and her husband Dean Bartlett divorced in 2021. \u201cI\u2019ve gone through a really rough time,\u201d she told the Daily Mail of the divorce in 2021. \u201cI\u2019m about to navigate my way through a divorce \u2014 a decision that neither of us has taken lightly. All we want for each other is happiness, even if that can\u2019t be achieved together.\u201d When asked about her father, Ruth said, \u201cI\u2019m always checking in with him. He\u2019s doing really good, I\u2019m very grateful for that. He\u2019s itching to get back out there like all musicians.\u201d Ruth is a mom and shares two children with her ex-husband Bartlett: Isaac Eric Owen and Theodore Ivan. She often shares snaps of the youngsters of her children on her Instagram account, where she also posts fashion and beauty content.

Now living in London, she posts about her adventures and her everyday life on her Instagram account. A joint post from Julie and the Textile Arts Center in Brooklyn, New York, in May 2024 described Clapton's daughter as \"a Fiber artist from England, living and working in Brooklyn.

The pair confirmed the relationship after Ella posted a series of sweet snaps in honor of Fry\u2019s 21st birthday in August 2022. Captioning the photos with, \u201chappy birthday ?

Sophie Belle Clapton, 19 Sophie Belle is Clapton and McEnery\u2019s third child, born Feb. 1, 2005. Although very little is known about Sophie and she likes to stay out of the spotlight with no public online presence, her father dedicated a song to her and her two older sisters. The song, titled \"Three Little Girls,\" which was released alongside J. J. Cale on their joint 2006 album The Road to Escondido, speaks of how proud Clapton is of his children and the joy that they bring to his life. The lyrics read, \u201cJulie Rose and Ella May / Sophie Belle, you came to stay / You take my breath away / My three little girls.\u201d Conor Clapton Clapton welcomed son Conor Clapton with Italian television personality Lory Del Santo, on Aug. 21, 1986. He tragically died in New York City on March 20, 1991 after falling 49 stories out of an open window. According to a 1991 report from The New York Times, a window was left open after it was cleaned by a housekeeper. The guitarist has previously opened up in interviews about his son\u2019s death, recalling the moment that Del Santo called him to tell him the news. \u201cI remember putting the phone down and calmly walking from my hotel [in N.Y.C.] to that place as if nothing happened,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I walked past the street and, this is a terrible thing of shame for me, which I\u2019ll never, ever perhaps recover from and seeing that, seeing a crowd of people and a paramedic van and knowing that he was there [trying to be resuscitated] and walking by, I\u2019ll punish myself forever about why didn\u2019t I run? Why didn\u2019t I go to see him? \u2026 the truth is I couldn\u2019t. I was so frightened.\u201d Clapton's \"Tears in Heaven\" was inspired by Conor's tragic death and has become one of the musician\u2019s most popular and has resonated with many of his fans.", "summary": "Eric Clapton is the father of five children: Ruth, Julie Rose, Ella May, Sophie Belle, and the late Conor", "url": "https://people.com/all-about-eric-clapton-kids-8387107", "image": "https://people.com/thmb/oWrh4rkj4S3jgDzKVHw7OXaCK6A=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(997x566:999x568)/eric-clapton-kids-1-c67dc51eac3343c4967ab50df646a10e.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-02 12:00:00", "author": "Emma Kershaw", "authors": ["Emma Kershaw"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.612}

All odds are provided by our best-reviewed football betting sites. Odds are subject to change.\n\nBefore the Europa Conference League semi-finals got under way, Aston Villa were the favourites to win the tournament. After the first legs, they are now outsiders.\n\nVilla were stunned by Olympiacos in Birmingham last week. The Greek outfit raced into a 2-0 lead, only to be pegged back by the hosts. But Olympiacos steadied themselves thereafter, scoring twice more to win 4-2 at Villa Park.\n\nGiven they are fourth in the Premier League right now, it is not hard to see why Villa were so widely fancied going into the semis.\n\nBut for all Unai Emery's credentials, this is a team that still has relatively little experience of European football. Villa only squeezed past Lille on penalties in the last eight, while Olympiacos are used to competing on the continent season in, season out.\n\nFatigue also appears to be creeping in at Villa. They produced a limp and lethargic display in the Premier League on Sunday, going down 1-0 to Brighton & Hove Albion. Emery's men managed just two shots all game on the south coast.\n\nIf Villa are suffering from tiredness, it is understandable. The meeting with Brighton was their 53rd game of the season. Their Europa Conference League campaign began before the group stage with a two-legged play-off against Hibernian.\n\nInjuries have also taken a toll. Morgan Rogers was the latest Villa player to go down with an ailment at the weekend. He joins Emi Martinez, Emi Buendia, Boubacar Kamara, Tyrone Mings, Jacob Ramsey and Youri Tielemans on the treatment table.\n\nStill, Villa will dig deep into their reserves in a bid to overturn the two-goal deficit from the first leg.\n\nThe fact that Tottenham Hotspur lost to Liverpool on Sunday means Emery's side are on the brink of qualifying for the Champions League. That gives them the ability to go for it on Thursday in the knowledge that fourth place is almost assured.\n\nAston Villa have a mountain to climb in this Europa Conference League semi-final - can they produce an upset?\n\nOlympiacos fans will believe their side has done enough to advance to the Europa Conference League final, but Jose Luis Mendilibar - their third manager of a chaotic season - will be warning against complacency.\n\nCurrently fourth in the Greek Super League, Olympiacos are unlikely to win the domestic title this term. They will thus be fully focused on Thursday night.\n\nIt will be tough for Aston Villa to advance from here, but we fancy their chances of at least emerging victorious after 90 minutes.\n\nThe Karaiskakis Stadium produces a fantastic atmosphere when it gets going, but Villa will draw belief from the fact Freiburg and Maccabi Tel Aviv have won at Olympiacos' ground in previous rounds.\n\nThere is also a danger that Olympiacos will be caught between two stools. Should they aim to protect their aggregate advantage or seek to increase it?\n\nThere is greater clarity to Villa's task and that could enable them to come out on top on the night.\n\n\u26bd Back Aston Villa to win at 5/6 with Sky Bet \u26bd\n\nAston Villa will not go gung-ho from the first whistle on Thursday, since conceding the first goal would leave them with a mountain to climb. Indeed, it is vital that Emery's charges draw first blood in Piraeus.\n\nThe second leg may well follow the pattern of the first, which saw Villa and Olympiacos trade blows in a wonderfully open encounter.\n\nEven though they should not attack with abandon straight away, Villa will at some point need to take risks in their bid to restore parity on aggregate.\n\nThat in turn could present Olympiacos with opportunities. Mendilibar, who won the Europa League with Sevilla last term, is a wily coach. He will try to get his team to pick Villa off on the break if they leave too many gaps in behind.\n\nAll in all, it is difficult to envisage this being a dull, low-scoring affair.\n\n\u26bd Go for over 2.5 goals at 4/7 with bet365 \u26bd\n\nThis has been the best season of Ollie Watkins' career to date.\n\nHis 50 appearances in all competitions have yielded 27 goals, including eight in this competition (three of which came in the qualification play-offs). That return is even more impressive when you consider that Douglas Luiz, not Watkins, is Aston Villa's designated penalty-taker.\n\nEmery will need Watkins to be at his best if Villa are to turn this tie around. The England international was kept quiet by Brighton on Sunday, but he is more than capable of having a major impact on this semi-final second leg.\n\nEmery has helped to make Watkins a more complete centre-forward. His goal tally is impressive enough this term before you even consider that he has also provided 12 assists.\n\nWatkins has notched only one goal in his last five outings in all competitions, but that came against Olympiacos last week.\n\n\u26bd Tip Ollie Watkins to score any time at 6/5 with bet365 \u26bd\n\nCommercial content notice: Taking one of the bookmaker offers featured in this article may result in a payment to talkSPORT. 18+.

They'll be hoping to return here at the end of the month, but Unai Emery's side have a big task on their hands to overturn their deficit.\n\nBut this is not an insurmountable challenge for Villa. Here are just four reasons for optimism heading into Thursday night's second leg showdown at the Karaiskakis Stadium.\n\nREAD | Emi Buendia nears Aston Villa return after major injury update\n\nREAD | Aston Villa already have perfect case study as they undertake European rescue mission\n\nOLYMPIACOS' DEFENSIVE RECORD\n\nVilla are bound to make chances considering Olympiacos have shipped 20 goals in the 18 matches Jose Luis Mendilibar has taken charge of.\n\nOlympiacos have only kept one clean sheet in their last six home games in all competitions and have conceded four against Maccabi Tel-Aviv in the Europa Conference League quarter finals before then winning 6-1 away from home.\n\nThey've conceded two or more goals in eight of their last 21 home games in all competitions, including in both of their last two home matches in the Europa Conference League. Villa also scored twice without playing particualrly well at Villa Park last week and even missed a penalty.\n\nPOSSIBLE MARTINEZ RETURN\n\nThe possible return of Emi Martinez would give Villa a big boost. It's crucial that Villa do not concede the first goal and ideally, keep a clean sheet. Robin Olsen was excellent against Brighton on Sunday, but Martinez will give Villa a psychological advantage too.\n\nKnowing that they have the best goalkeeper in the world at facing penalties, fans at least would certainly take a win by two goals right now.\n\nLike Villa, Olympiacos also advanced to the semi-finals via a penalty shootout win away from home. Their 'keeper Konstantinos Tzolakis saved three spot kicks to book the Greek giants' place in the final four.\n\nVILLA KNOW THE JOB IN HAND\n\nVilla have to come out and play against Olympiacos and most importantly, score goals. It might even be a blessing in disguise that they need to be on the front foot.\n\nEmery's side will have to play perfect game to advance to the final by winning comfortably in the normal time to at least take the game to extra-time.\n\nOllie Watkins, Leon Bailey and Moussa Diaby all have the quality to produce a goal out of nothing. It will be interesting to see how Emery selects his side considering Morgan Rogers and Youri Tielemans are both doubts.\n\nWill he play Bailey on the left and Matty Cash on the right? Or might Tim Iroegbunam come into the side to allow McGinn to operate in a more advanced role? All will be revealed when the team news comes out at 6:45pm (BST) on Thursday.\n\nEMERY'S EXPERIENCES\n\nAnd finally, Villa have one of the most successful coaches in European football. With four UEFA titles, only two managers in history have won more.\n\nThis is his 16th season in Europe and among his many success stories, there have been moments of disappointment. Losing at home to Olympiacos is another, but this isn't the first time he has has been tasked with overcoming a two-goal deficit in an away second leg.\n\nBack in 2014, Emery's Sevilla side avenged a two-goal home defeat to Real Betis in the Europa League, winning 2-0 away from home in the second leg before advancing on penalties.\n\nWhat is your Olympiacos vs Villa prediction?

He laid it off to overlapping left-back Quini, whose pass to the back post evaded a stretching Pau Torres and found an unmarked El Kaabi.\n\nThe in-form striker gleefully made the most of this charitable opening to convert past Martinez to score his fourth goal in two games against Villa. Perhaps it won't be long until Premier League clubs come knocking for his services.\n\nIt was another example of Olympiacos using quick interchanges to get in behind their opponents and their high defensive line after they looked like scoring almost every time they attempted a similar attack at Villa Park.\n\nIt was simple but very effective and they surely would not have believed their luck when a similar progression of play worked just as well in the return leg against Villa, who failed to learn from last week's embarrassment and made it far too easy for their opponents' game plan to pay off.\n\nMORE ASTON VILLA COVERAGE ON F365...\n\n\ud83d\udc49 The Premier League lie has been exposed again in European disaster\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Postecoglou 3rd: Ranking every manager to leap from Scotland to the Premier League\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Coutinho and Ndombele in Premier League XI of big-name unwanted loanees heading back\n\nThis goal did not alter the momentum of the game too much as Villa continued to dominate possession and play some neat football in the build-up. But most importantly, they were left wanting when it came to the final pass and/or shot as goalkeeper Konstantinos Tzolakis was not tested anywhere near enough.\n\nVilla knew they were up against it ahead of Thursday night's game as there have only been three previous examples in UEFA's three cup competitions of a team losing a first leg at home by two (or more) goals before going on to advance to the next round.\n\nMendilibar said pre-match that a \"great weapon\" up the sleeve of his side's opponents is Emery \"100 per cent believes\" they can still knock Olympiacos out. But their defensive solidarity only added to Villa's frustrations and any remaining nervous energy among his players would have evaporated when El Kaabi struck yet again with ten minutes to go to grab his fifth goal (and his 32nd of the season) to make it a 6-2 aggregate victory.\n\nThis season has been very demanding for Villa. This is made clear by Emery having to name a reduced bench for the return leg, which included two goalkeepers and an influx of academy products.\n\nGiven how rapid Villa's growth has been under Emery, it's easy to forget that it's only around 18 months since Steven Gerrard was in the dugout at Villa Park.\n\nEmery's work at Villa has further asserted him as a modern managerial great and many expected his expertise in Europe would carry his blossoming side to a European trophy this season.\n\nBut the 52-year-old's squad is stretched thin, with this latest loss meaning they have won just one game in six across all competitions.\n\nVilla have consistently overachieved in the Premier League for most of this season so their end-of-season slump (and Tottenham Hotspur's more severe woes) mean they are still set to finish fourth and qualify for next year's Champions League.\n\nThis season's run in Europe is a tease of what's to come, but this Olympiacos tie was a step too far after they rode their luck in the previous round against Lille.\n\nFew managers have a better track record in European competitions than Emery, but Mendilibar - who won the Europa League with Sevilla last season - has got one over his respected managerial counterpart to etch his name into Olympiacos folklore by guiding the Greek giants into the first European final in their history.", "source": {"uri": "football365.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Football News -"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lewis_oldham@football365.com", "name": "Lewis Oldham", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Podence", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Podence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unai_Emery", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unai Emery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympiacos_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympiacos F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Villa_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aston Villa F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayoub_El_Kaabi", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ayoub El Kaabi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villa_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Villa Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_Conference_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa Conference League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emiliano_Mart\u00ednez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emiliano Mart\u00ednez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McGinn", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John McGinn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karaiskakis_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karaiskakis Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanguy_Ndombele", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tanguy Ndombele"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Coutinho", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philippe Coutinho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottish_Football_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scottish Football Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Torres", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fernando Torres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greece"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lille_OSC", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lille OSC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-legged_tie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Two-legged tie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sevilla_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sevilla FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Gerrard", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steven Gerrard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loan_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Loan (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.ps-aws.com/c?url=https%3A%2F%2Fd2x51gyc4ptf2q.cloudfront.net%2Fcontent%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F05%2F09220540%2FUnai-Emery-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548761", "eventUri": "eng-9548761", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Emery's men were eventually beaten courtesy of an 87th-minute header from Joao Pedro, who nodded home a rebound after his penalty was saved by Robin Olsen.\n\nVilla missed the chance to strengthen their hold on fourth place in the Premier League table, but they are still in the driving seat to secure Champions League football for next season as they sit seven points clear of fifth-placed Tottenham Hotspur, who have a game in hand.\n\nAhead of Villa's first-ever visit to Greece, Emery has admitted that Olympiacos \"are favourites\" to advance to the Conference League final, and the prospect of overturning a two-goal deficit could prove challenging for the Lions considering they have lost both of their previous two European ties in which they suffered a first-leg home defeat.\n\nIn addition, Villa - who need to score at least twice on Thursday to level the scores on aggregate - have netted no more than one goal in five of their last six away games across all competitions.\n\nOlympiacos Europa Conference League form: W L W W W W\n\nOlympiacos form (all competitions): W W W D W W\n\nAston Villa Europa Conference League form: D D W W W L\n\nAston Villa form (all competitions): W W W D L L\n\nTeam News\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nOlympiacos trio Ruben Vezo, Gelson Martins and Nelson Abbey are all ineligible to play in the Conference League, while Stevan Jovetic remains sidelined due to injury, but Andreas Ndoj and Georgios Masouras are available to return after serving suspensions last week.\n\nNdoj is in contention to replace David Carmo at centre-back, while Masouras is set to battle with Kostas Fortounis for a start on the right side of attack.\n\nAfter netting a hat-trick last week, El Kaabi has moved onto 30 goals in all competitions this season and has also drawn level with Eran Zahavi (eight) at the top of the Conference League scoring charts. The Moroccan is expected to continue up front on Thursday and could be supported in attack by Wolverhampton Wanderers loanee Daniel Podence.\n\nAs for Aston Villa, Boubacar Kamara, Tyrone Mings, Emiliano Buendia (all knee) and Jacob Ramsey (toe) are all nursing season-ending injuries, while Emery is sweating over the fitness of Morgan Rogers who was forced off with a muscle injury against Brighton.\n\nRogers has emerged as a doubt for Thursday's contest and the same can be said about Youri Tielemans (muscle), Alex Moreno (calf), Nicolo Zaniolo (back) and Emiliano Martinez (thigh), who will all be assessed ahead of kickoff - the latter is available, pending a late fitness test, after serving a suspension last week.\n\nEmery is unlikely to make too many changes to his starting lineup, but the potential absence of Rogers could see either Jhon Duran handed a start alongside Watkins up front, or Matty Cash recalled to operate on the right flank, with Leon Bailey moving over to the left.\n\nOlympiacos possible starting lineup:\n\nTzolakis; Rodinei, Ndoj, Restos, Ortega; Iborra, Hezze; Masouras, Chiquinho, Podence; El Kaabi\n\nAston Villa possible starting lineup:\n\nMartinez; Konsa, Carlos, Torres, Digne; Cash, Luiz, McGinn, Bailey; Diaby; Watkins\n\nWe say: Olympiacos 1-2 Aston Villa (Olympiacos to win 5-4 on aggregate)\n\nOlympiacos were not in domestic action over the weekend, so they have had an extra few days to rest and prepare for Thursday's crunch match, and if they play with the same fearless attacking verve from the first leg, they will fancy their chances of success in the second leg.\n\nA more conservative approach could be deployed by the hosts, though, as they bid to hold onto their two-goal advantage, and while Aston Villa have the potential to turn this tie around, their recent form suggested it could be a tall order, even if they were to win the second leg in Greece.\n\nFor data analysis of the most likely results, scorelines and more for this match please click here.\n\nID:543073:1false2false3false:QQ:: from db desktop :LenBod:collect17557:Previews by emailClick here to get Sports Mole's daily email of previews and predictions for every major game!", "source": {"uri": "sportsmole.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Mole"}, "authors": [{"uri": "oliver_thomas@sportsmole.co.uk", "name": "Oliver Thomas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_Conference_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa Conference League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayoub_El_Kaabi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ayoub El Kaabi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villa_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Villa Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympiacos_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympiacos F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Villa_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aston Villa F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Greece"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karaiskakis_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karaiskakis Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenerbah\u00e7e_S.K._(football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fenerbah\u00e7e S.K.

Though inspirational goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez returned from injury, Villa were underwhelming and never looked capable of securing a magical comeback.\n\nOlympiacos, meanwhile, have reached their first ever European final and will face Fiorentina in Athens later this month.\n\nDespite the disappointment of Villa's exit at such a late stage in the competition, there is so much room for optimism. Last season Villa were in danger of dropping into the Championship under Steven Gerrard. Now they are in contention for a place in next season's Champions League under Emery, their brilliant Basque coach. Victory over Liverpool at Villa Park on Monday night will be enough to secure a place in the competition.\n\nEmery said: \"Unfortunately we lost the opportunity in the first leg, we have to accept this and how we can improve.\n\n\"This is a difficult day but we have to react quickly. It is a process and the first objective was to compete in Europe.\n\n\"These are great experiences for us and it is difficult to win in these competitions, whether it is the Champions League or Conference League.\n\n\"We have two games left to get the fourth position, which is amazing motivation.\"\n\nEmery will also reflect on an alarming injury list that has decimated his squad.\n\nWith Tyrone Mings, Emiliano Buendia, Youri Tielemans, Boubacar Kamara, Jacob Ramsey, Morgan Rogers, Nicolo Zaniolo and Alex Moreno all absent, Villa's bench was almost an advertisement for the club's academy.\n\nClement Lenglet, the loan signing from Barcelona, was the only outfield player among the substitutes over the age of 21.\n\nWhile other managers use injuries as a reason for underachievement, Emery operates with a \"no excuses\" culture. So many key players missing proved insurmountable, however.\n\nJohn McGinn, the captain, said: \"You want everyone available, you want your best players there.\n\n\"When you are in the trenches, someone you can turn to in order to change the game or do something different.\n\n\"Of course we wanted to do better this year and get to a European final but we will do everything we can to get ourselves back into this position and get to a final.\"\n\nIt has been quite a journey. Villa's European adventure began way back on August 23 in the city of Edinburgh with a qualifier against Hibernian.\n\nThis second leg always felt like an uphill task after the 4-2 defeat at Villa Park last week, which also included a missed penalty late in the match from Douglas Luiz.\n\nVilla's social media account adopted the hashtag #Believe ahead of the rematch, but it always appeared a forlorn task.\n\nNot even Martinez could salvage this tie. The Argentina World Cup winner was inspired in Villa's win over Lille in the quarter-final second leg, saving two penalties in the shoot-out, and it was inevitable that the pantomime villain would return here after a recent thigh injury.\n\nYet the issues were in the final third for Villa, who never looked capable of scoring.\n\nWhile Villa were targeting a repeat of their 1982 European Cup win, this was also a huge occasion for Olympiacos.\n\nFans were congregating outside the Karaiskakis Stadium three hours before kick-off and club officials described it as the biggest game in their long history.\n\nThe first goal was always going to be crucial and came after 11 minutes. Villa had appeared in control but the poor defending from the first leg was in evidence again. Ayoub El Kaabi was the Olympiacos danger man after his hat-trick in the first leg and was completely unmarked to convert from close range after Quini's low cross caught out Pau Torres.\n\nEmery was imploring his players not to panic from the technical area.\n\nVilla controlled possession, with McGinn having an excellent night, but struggled to find the clinical edge.\n\nOllie Watkins has been a revelation this season and on course to be Harry Kane's deputy for England at this summer's European Championships, but it was a chastening evening.\n\nAs the spaces began to appear late in the match, Olympiacos suddenly looked more dangerous on the break.\n\nThe tie was finally killed off beyond doubt 12 minutes from time. El Kaabi burst clear after exposing Villa's high line to sweep the ball past Martinez. Initially flagged offside, the goal went before a VAR review and was upheld after a lengthy review to spark wild scenes of celebration.\n\nWhile Villa's departure from European competition at such a late stage will sting, they could still end the season on a glorious high.\n\nOlympiacos (4-3-3) Tzolakis 7; Quini 7 (Apostolopoulos 77), Carmo 7, Retsos 7, Rodinei 7: Chiquinho 7, Iborra 7 (Horta 73), Hezze 7; Fortounis 7, El Kaabi 8, Podence 7 (Masouras 64). Substitutes Paschalakis (g), Papadoudis (g), Horta, El-Arabi, Alexandropoulos, Jo\u00e3o Carvalho, Joveti&cacute;, Prekates, Ntoi. Booked: Rodinei, Podence, Quini.\n\nVilla (4-4-2) Martinez 6; Konsa 5, Carlos 6 (Iroegbunam 66), Torres 5, Digne 6 (Munroe 86); Cash 5 (Kesler-Hayden 86), McGinn 7, Douglas Luiz 5, Bailey 5 (Kellyman 86); Watkins, Diaby 5 (Duran 58). Substitutes Gauci (g), Olsen (g), Lenglet, Kesler-Hayden, Patterson, Young. Booked: Douglas Luiz, Iroegbunam.\n\nAfter their European journey was ended tonight, Aston Villa must now turn their attentions to the league. They currently sit in fourth, seven points ahead of Tottenham having played a game more. Aston Villa are next in action on Monday night, when they host Liverpool/\n\nAyoub El Kaabi dominated Aston Villa across both legs, scoring a hat-trick in the first leg and then scoring a double tonight.\n\nThe Conference League final will be the first European final Olympiacos will have played in.\n\nThat is it. Olympiacos have won 2-0 tonight and 6-2 on aggregate. They are through to the Europa Conference League final, where they will play Fiorentina.\n\nThat is a great back-pedaling saved from Tzolakis to deny Watkins with a diving header.\n\nThere will be four added minutes. Aston Villa's European journey this season is coming to an end.\n\nAston Villa have a corner. It is flicked on at the near post but Olympiacos clear their lines.\n\nThe longer the check the more you thought it was going to be given. Konsa in the middle was playing El Kaabi onside and he gets his fifth goal across the two legs. Olympiacos are going to be playing Fiorentina in the final.\n\nThis is taking quite a while and it looks like El Kaabi might be onside...\n\nEl Kaabi has the ball in the back of the net after being sent through one-on-one by Tzolakis but the offside flag goes up. VAR is checking...\n\nCash breaks into the Olympiacos box and tries to find Watkins centrally, but it is deflected behind for a corner. The visitors play it short but it goes out for a throw-in. Aston Villa waste a good chance there to send it in.\n\nOlympiacos break and Iroegbunam commits a tactical foul on Chiquinho and is therefore booked. Olympiacos have had to wait a little bit to make the change but now they make it:\n\nIborra has gone down twice in quick succession and it looks like he is going to have to be replaced.\n\nMartinez comes flying out of his goal and there is a collision between the Argentina goalkeeper and Masouras, but the offside flag goes up.\n\nQuini is booked for an elbow on Watkins as they went up for the header.\n\nA ball is sent in behind the Aston Villa defence and El Kaabi goes down under a challenge from Konsa but the referee, as he has done on a few occasions in this second half, waves the appeals away.\n\nWatkins is found over the top but Carmo steps in with a crucial interception.\n\nCash makes a good run into the box on the right but his cross is blocked behind for a corner by Iborra.\n\nBailey sends in the corner into a good area but Konsa heads over. Chance wasted by the visitors and time is running out for them quickly.\n\nOlympiacos should have scored there. Podence sends El Kaabi sprinting down the left. He has a simple cross to the far post to Hezze but it is overhit.\n\nDown the other end Duran, who has only just come on, has an effort spilled by Tzolakis which goes then behind for a corner.\n\nDiaby sends in a cross from the right but it ends up being a shot. Tzolakis has to back pedal a little to make the catch. He would have been panicking for just a moment there.\n\nPodence deliberately hacks down McGinn and rightly so is booked.\n\nBailey lifts a cross into the centre of the box and he finds Watkins, but his looping header goes over the bar. Aston Villa have to start taking these chances or they will have no chance of getting back into this tie.\n\nMore appeals for an Aston Villa free-kick as Cash goes down near the Olympiacos box but once again those appeals are waved away.\n\nThe ball is lifted in but the ball bounces too high for Cash and he cannot keep it in play.\n\nBailey is fouled midway into the Olympiacos half in a central position and Aston Villa will have a chance to send it into the box...\n\nWatkins wants a free-kick after running into the left channel after a push in the back by Carmo but the referee is having none of it. On first look it did look like a foul.\n\nWe are back under way. Aston Villa certainly have a huge mountain to climb, three goals behind with just 45 minutes remaining.\n\nHe scored a hat-trick at Villa Park a week ago and he scored the opener for Olympiacos tonight.\n\nThe corner is sent into a dangerous area but Olympiacos are able to clear. Luiz is then booked for a foul on Fortounis and that will be that for the first half. Olympiacos lead 1-0 on the night, 5-2 on aggregate.\n\nChance for Aston Villa right at the end of the half. Bailey's driven shot from just outside the box takes a deflection and Tzolakis is forced into a save. Aston Villa have a late corner...\n\nFor the duration of this first half Aston Villa have dominated possession but when it comes to the final third they have shown no clinical edge.\n\nThere will be four added minutes at the end of this first half.\n\nBailey fizzes a ball across the six-yard box but Cash cannot quite reach it. Had he been able to it would likely have been a simple tap-in.\n\nMcGinn sends in the free-kick but Carlos' header goes well wide.\n\nGood save from Martinez. From the left, Podence finds his captain Fortounis on the edge of the box. His first-time effort is well-saved by Martinez to his left.\n\nDown the other end, Aston Villa have a free-kick in a dangerous position on the right after Cash was fouled...\n\nIt took forever for the free-kick to be taken but finally it comes. Luiz lifts it over wall but he does not get the dip on it and it goes over the bar. Chance wasted for the visitors.\n\nBailey is back on his feet but still limping a little after knee-on-knee contact with Rodinei. Luiz looks the most likely to take it...\n\nBailey goes down just outside the Olympiacos penalty area and initially play goes on for Diaby to have a shot, which is saved by Tzolakis. The referee does go back though for the free-kick so this is a crucial chance for the visitors. Rodinei is booked for the foul and Bailey is still down, now receiving treatment.\n\nBailey and Watkins get in each others' way as they waste a chance on the edge of the Olympiacos box.\n\nDigne sends in a cross from the left which Bailey meets, but his header is off target.\n\nDigne tries to find a teammate in the centre of the box but a sliding interception from Retsos puts it behind for a corner. Konsa wins the header from Luiz's delivery but it is cleared away.\n\nAston Villa keep it alive and first Watkins has an effort blocked before Bailey also has a shot blocked.\n\nLuiz then tries his luck from distance but Tzolakis gets down to his right to make the save.\n\nBailey shoots from the edge of the box but it is blocked and loops into the grateful arms of Tzolakis. Aston Villa still having all of the ball but not really able to penetrate this Olympiacos defence so far.\n\nAston Villa may be dominating possession so far but that will mean nothing to Unai Emery at the moment. They are three goals behind on aggregate and are in desperate need of goals. It does not matter how much possession you have if you cannot put the ball in the back of the net. They are still yet to carve out a genuine clear-cut opportunity.\n\nHe scored a hat-trick last week at Villa Park and he is on the scoresheet again just 10 minutes into the second leg. Aston Villa have bene the better side so far but they are behind. Podence plays it into the path of the overlapping Quini. His cross from near the byline finds El Kaabi at the back post, who strokes home past Martinez. Aston Villa's mountain to climb has just got that bit higher. They now trail 5-2 on aggregate.\n\nIn possession Aston Villa are lining up with a back four but without the ball they are playing with a back five.\n\nThe ball is whipped into the centre of the Olympiacos box and it looks like Watkins is going to head it home. But before he can Carmo crucially wins the header and it goes behind for a corner.\n\nLuiz's delivery loops into the box and it is an easy catch for Tzolakis.\n\nAston Villa have the first corner of the night. You would imagine the visitors really need an early goal to put the pressure back onto the home side.\n\nBailey takes it short to Diaby. They exchange passes but Diaby's cross is blocked.\n\nChiquinho has the first effort of the night after a throw-in is flicked on. He drags his shot though from inside the box on the right-hand side into the side netting.\n\nWe are under way in Piraeus.\n\nBoth sides have emerged from the tunnel and we are just moments away from kick-off in Piraeus.\n\nOlympiacos: Tzolakis: Quini, Carmo, Retsos, Rodinei: Chiquinho, Iborra, Hezze; Fortounis, El Kaabi, Podence.\n\nSubstitutes: Paschalakis, Papadoudis, Horta, El-Arabi, Alexandropoulos, Masouras, Carvalho, Joveti&cacute;, Apostolopoulos, Prekates, Ntoi.\n\nAston Villa: Martinez; Cash, Diego Carlos, Konsa, Torres, Digne; Diaby, McGinn, Douglas Luiz, Bailey; Watkins.\n\nSubstitutes: Gauci, Olsen, Lenglet, Duran, Hayden, Iroegbunam.

The Italian side took a 3-2 lead into the second leg, which ended 1-1 meaning Fiorentina progressed through to the final which will take place in Athens, not far from tonight's match. Fiorentina were losing finalists last year against West Ham and will be hoping to go one step better in a few weeks.\n\nHaving a bet on today's match? First take a look at these free bets and betting offers\n\nOlympiacos had the weekend off and make just one change from the first leg. Quini replaces the injured Francisco Ortega at full-back.\n\nOlympiacos: Tzolakis: Quini, Carmo, Retsos, Rodinei: Chiquinho, Iborra, Hezze; Fortounis, El Kaabi, Podence.\n\nSubstitutes: Paschalakis, Papadoudis, Horta, El-Arabi, Alexandropoulos, Masouras, Carvalho, Joveti&cacute;, Apostolopoulos, Prekates, Ntoi.\n\nAston Villa make two changes from the side that lost 1-0 to Brighton at the weekend. Emiliano Martinez returns in goal, having been suspended for the first leg and he was not in the squad for Villa's Premier League loss on Sunday. Matty Cash is also in the starting XI, replacing the injured Morgan Rogers.\n\nAston Villa: Martinez; Cash, Diego Carlos, Konsa, Torres, Digne; Diaby, McGinn, Douglas Luiz, Bailey; Watkins.\n\nSubstitutes: Gauci, Olsen, Lenglet, Duran, Hayden, Iroegbunam. Patterson, Munroe, Kellyman, Young.\n\nUnai Emery is ready to recall Emiliano Martinez for Aston Villa's crunch semi-final as he plots another heroic European comeback. Emery will make a late decision on Martinez's return for the second leg against Olympiacos but the Villa goalkeeper is pushing to start after a recent thigh injury.\n\nMartinez was inspired in Villa's win over Lille in the quarter-final second leg, saving two penalties in the shoot-out, and Emery was remaining tight-lipped on the Argentina World Cup winner's availability for Thursday night. Villa's social media account posted a picture of Martinez and key defender Pau Torres after Tuesday's training session with the words \"ready to give everything\".\n\nSweden international Robin Olsen played in last week's chaotic 4-2 defeat at Villa Park, but it appears inevitable that Martinez will start in Greece.\n\n\"He [Martinez] is with us today, but I don't want to give information to you,\" said Emery. \"I will speak with him and the doctor on Thursday to see if he is 100% fit to play, but I believe in Olsen and I'm building the team not just with the players in the starting XI.\n\n\"If he is available 100% he will play but if not then he will play. If Olsen plays he has all of our respect to play.\"\n\nEmery is targeting a fifth trophy in European competition but admits overcoming the Greek giants in their own stadium will be Villa's most significant test of the season. Fortunately for Villa, their Basque manager does have previous experience of upsetting the odds. In 2014 his Sevilla team were beaten 2-0 by Real Betis in the Europa League round of 16 but eventually triumphed in the second leg after a penalty shootout.\n\nWith Arsenal, Emery's team were beaten 3-1 by Rennes in the same competition but produced an outstanding performance in the second leg with a 3-0 win to move into the quarter-finals.\n\n\"Experiences can always help you be successful but we have to create a new way,\" said Emery. \"This is the biggest challenge we are going to face this year. They are the favourites and we have to accept it. Thursday will be difficult to come back but we expect to do better than the first leg. It's a really good moment to watch how we react.\"\n\nVilla are seeking silverware for the first time in 28 years, and have been the favourites to win the competition this season. Olympiacos were the first team to beat them at Villa Park in the competition, with Douglas Luiz missing a penalty late in the game. That felt like a significant moment, but the Villa midfielder is ready to step up again and says his team still believe.\n\n\"Missing the penalty was my responsibility but if we have another one on Thursday I will take it. I am mentally strong,\" he said. \"It's a huge game for the football club and we want to get into a European final. That gives us the extra motivation to keep fighting. The season has been great for us and we are confident that we can win this game and go through.\"", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [],

Listen to the It's All Kicking Off! Man United Crisis Special podcast\n\nEmiliano Martinez will hold talks with Unai Emery and the club's medical team on Thursday as he strives to help Aston Villa's bid to reach the Europa Conference League Final.\n\nThe Argentina goalkeeper has travelled to Athens for the second leg of the semi-final against Olympiacos, with Villa 4-2 down from the first leg, despite missing the last two-and-a-half games with a hamstring problem.\n\nThough Emery declared his faith in Martinez's deputy Robin Olsen, Martinez is arguably Villa's most important player and they are not the same without him.\n\nEmery said: 'He's with us today. He was injured last week in the match against Chelsea 10 days ago. Before the game I will speak with him and the doctor to see if he is 100 per cent fit to play.\n\n'But I believe in Olsen and I'm building the team not just with the players in the starting XI. If we did that we would be finished now because we've had a lot of players injured. If Martinez is available 100 per cent he will play but if not then Olsen will play.'\n\nAston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez took part in training before Olympiacos clash\n\nAston Villa must overturn a two-goal deficit at the Georgios Karaiskakis Stadium on Thursday\n\nPodcast All episodes PODCAST: Listen to the latest episode of 'It's All Kicking Off!'

With Champions League qualification within touching distance, Emery knows his team need to learn to handle the heat of hostile matches in unfamiliar surroundings.\n\nEven though Villa have reached the semi-finals of the Europa Conference League, their progress has been based on strong home displays. The 4-1 win at AZ Alkmaar last October is Villa's only victory on their travels in the competition proper, and they were poor in the 0-0 draw at Ajax and the 2-1 defeat at Lille, when Villa were lucky to squeeze through on penalties.\n\n'They are favourites and we have to accept it,' said Emery. 'This is the biggest challenge we are going to face this year. Hopefully the game will go long, beyond 90 minutes. If it does it's good news for us.\n\n'We are really enjoying what we are doing this year. It's been tough but really amazing and I told the players I want to enjoy it more. I want to see how we can react against Olympiacos.\n\n'I'm very proud of how we've done this year. Our reaction to defeats has been fantastic and the players have always followed our instructions. I don't know how many matches we have still to play this season but we have to find our best level of performance.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Olsen", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Robin Olsen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unai_Emery", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unai Emery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Villa_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aston Villa F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emiliano_Mart\u00ednez", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Emiliano Mart\u00ednez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympiacos_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Olympiacos F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_Conference_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa Conference League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karaiskakis_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karaiskakis Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Tuchel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Tuchel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Athens"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Athens"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_London_derby", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North London derby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_De_Bruyne", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin De Bruyne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moussa_Diaby", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moussa Diaby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Podence", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Podence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McGinn", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John McGinn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kostas_Fortounis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kostas Fortounis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezri_Konsa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ezri Konsa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AZ_Alkmaar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AZ Alkmaar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicente_Iborra", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vicente Iborra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_Digne", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lucas Digne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lille_OSC", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lille OSC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Torres", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fernando Torres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Ajax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AFC Ajax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Formation (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/05/08/19/84627583-0-image-m-63_1715194176878.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548761", "eventUri": "eng-9548761", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-01", "dateEnd": "2024-04-01", "textStart": 2041, "textEnd": 2048}], "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

Even with their inspirational goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez returning from injury, Villa were second best and never looked capable of pulling off a huge upset.\n\nDespite the disappointment of a semi-final exit, there is so much room for optimism for the future. Last season Villa were in danger of dropping into the Championship under Steven Gerrard. Now they are in contention for a place in next season's Champions League under Emery, their brilliant Basque coach.\n\nVictory over Liverpool at Villa Park on Monday night will be enough to secure a place in the competition.\n\nOlympiacos, meanwhile, have reached their first ever European final and will face Fiorentina in Athens later this month.\n\nAfter their European journey was ended tonight, Aston Villa must now turn their attentions to the league. They currently sit in fourth, seven points ahead of Tottenham having played a game more. Aston Villa are next in action on Monday night, when they host Liverpool/\n\nAyoub El Kaabi dominated Aston Villa across both legs, scoring a hat-trick in the first leg and then scoring a double tonight.\n\nThe Conference League final will be the first European final Olympiacos will have played in.\n\nThat is it. Olympiacos have won 2-0 tonight and 6-2 on aggregate. They are through to the Europa Conference League final, where they will play Fiorentina.\n\nThat is a great back-pedaling saved from Tzolakis to deny Watkins with a diving header.\n\nThere will be four added minutes. Aston Villa's European journey this season is coming to an end.\n\nAston Villa have a corner. It is flicked on at the near post but Olympiacos clear their lines.\n\nThe longer the check the more you thought it was going to be given. Konsa in the middle was playing El Kaabi onside and he gets his fifth goal across the two legs. Olympiacos are going to be playing Fiorentina in the final.\n\nThis is taking quite a while and it looks like El Kaabi might be onside...\n\nEl Kaabi has the ball in the back of the net after being sent through one-on-one by Tzolakis but the offside flag goes up. VAR is checking...\n\nCash breaks into the Olympiacos box and tries to find Watkins centrally, but it is deflected behind for a corner. The visitors play it short but it goes out for a throw-in. Aston Villa waste a good chance there to send it in.\n\nOlympiacos break and Iroegbunam commits a tactical foul on Chiquinho and is therefore booked. Olympiacos have had to wait a little bit to make the change but now they make it:\n\nIborra has gone down twice in quick succession and it looks like he is going to have to be replaced.\n\nMartinez comes flying out of his goal and there is a collision between the Argentina goalkeeper and Masouras, but the offside flag goes up.\n\nQuini is booked for an elbow on Watkins as they went up for the header.\n\nA ball is sent in behind the Aston Villa defence and El Kaabi goes down under a challenge from Konsa but the referee, as he has done on a few occasions in this second half, waves the appeals away.\n\nWatkins is found over the top but Carmo steps in with a crucial interception.\n\nCash makes a good run into the box on the right but his cross is blocked behind for a corner by Iborra.\n\nBailey sends in the corner into a good area but Konsa heads over. Chance wasted by the visitors and time is running out for them quickly.\n\nOlympiacos should have scored there. Podence sends El Kaabi sprinting down the left. He has a simple cross to the far post to Hezze but it is overhit.\n\nDown the other end Duran, who has only just come on, has an effort spilled by Tzolakis which goes then behind for a corner.\n\nDiaby sends in a cross from the right but it ends up being a shot. Tzolakis has to back pedal a little to make the catch. He would have been panicking for just a moment there.\n\nPodence deliberately hacks down McGinn and rightly so is booked.\n\nBailey lifts a cross into the centre of the box and he finds Watkins, but his looping header goes over the bar. Aston Villa have to start taking these chances or they will have no chance of getting back into this tie.\n\nMore appeals for an Aston Villa free-kick as Cash goes down near the Olympiacos box but once again those appeals are waved away.\n\nThe ball is lifted in but the ball bounces too high for Cash and he cannot keep it in play.\n\nBailey is fouled midway into the Olympiacos half in a central position and Aston Villa will have a chance to send it into the box...\n\nWatkins wants a free-kick after running into the left channel after a push in the back by Carmo but the referee is having none of it. On first look it did look like a foul.\n\nWe are back under way. Aston Villa certainly have a huge mountain to climb, three goals behind with just 45 minutes remaining.\n\nHe scored a hat-trick at Villa Park a week ago and he scored the opener for Olympiacos tonight.\n\nThe corner is sent into a dangerous area but Olympiacos are able to clear. Luiz is then booked for a foul on Fortounis and that will be that for the first half. Olympiacos lead 1-0 on the night, 5-2 on aggregate.\n\nChance for Aston Villa right at the end of the half. Bailey's driven shot from just outside the box takes a deflection and Tzolakis is forced into a save. Aston Villa have a late corner...\n\nFor the duration of this first half Aston Villa have dominated possession but when it comes to the final third they have shown no clinical edge.\n\nThere will be four added minutes at the end of this first half.\n\nBailey fizzes a ball across the six-yard box but Cash cannot quite reach it. Had he been able to it would likely have been a simple tap-in.\n\nMcGinn sends in the free-kick but Carlos' header goes well wide.\n\nGood save from Martinez. From the left, Podence finds his captain Fortounis on the edge of the box. His first-time effort is well-saved by Martinez to his left.\n\nDown the other end, Aston Villa have a free-kick in a dangerous position on the right after Cash was fouled...\n\nIt took forever for the free-kick to be taken but finally it comes. Luiz lifts it over wall but he does not get the dip on it and it goes over the bar. Chance wasted for the visitors.\n\nBailey is back on his feet but still limping a little after knee-on-knee contact with Rodinei. Luiz looks the most likely to take it...\n\nBailey goes down just outside the Olympiacos penalty area and initially play goes on for Diaby to have a shot, which is saved by Tzolakis. The referee does go back though for the free-kick so this is a crucial chance for the visitors. Rodinei is booked for the foul and Bailey is still down, now receiving treatment.\n\nBailey and Watkins get in each others' way as they waste a chance on the edge of the Olympiacos box.\n\nDigne sends in a cross from the left which Bailey meets, but his header is off target.\n\nDigne tries to find a teammate in the centre of the box but a sliding interception from Retsos puts it behind for a corner. Konsa wins the header from Luiz's delivery but it is cleared away.\n\nAston Villa keep it alive and first Watkins has an effort blocked before Bailey also has a shot blocked.\n\nLuiz then tries his luck from distance but Tzolakis gets down to his right to make the save.\n\nBailey shoots from the edge of the box but it is blocked and loops into the grateful arms of Tzolakis. Aston Villa still having all of the ball but not really able to penetrate this Olympiacos defence so far.\n\nAston Villa may be dominating possession so far but that will mean nothing to Unai Emery at the moment. They are three goals behind on aggregate and are in desperate need of goals. It does not matter how much possession you have if you cannot put the ball in the back of the net. They are still yet to carve out a genuine clear-cut opportunity.\n\nHe scored a hat-trick last week at Villa Park and he is on the scoresheet again just 10 minutes into the second leg. Aston Villa have bene the better side so far but they are behind. Podence plays it into the path of the overlapping Quini. His cross from near the byline finds El Kaabi at the back post, who strokes home past Martinez. Aston Villa's mountain to climb has just got that bit higher. They now trail 5-2 on aggregate.\n\nIn possession Aston Villa are lining up with a back four but without the ball they are playing with a back five.\n\nThe ball is whipped into the centre of the Olympiacos box and it looks like Watkins is going to head it home. But before he can Carmo crucially wins the header and it goes behind for a corner.\n\nLuiz's delivery loops into the box and it is an easy catch for Tzolakis.\n\nAston Villa have the first corner of the night. You would imagine the visitors really need an early goal to put the pressure back onto the home side.\n\nBailey takes it short to Diaby. They exchange passes but Diaby's cross is blocked.\n\nChiquinho has the first effort of the night after a throw-in is flicked on. He drags his shot though from inside the box on the right-hand side into the side netting.\n\nWe are under way in Piraeus.\n\nBoth sides have emerged from the tunnel and we are just moments away from kick-off in Piraeus.\n\nOlympiacos: Tzolakis: Quini, Carmo, Retsos, Rodinei: Chiquinho, Iborra, Hezze; Fortounis, El Kaabi, Podence.\n\nSubstitutes: Paschalakis, Papadoudis, Horta, El-Arabi, Alexandropoulos, Masouras, Carvalho, Joveti&cacute;, Apostolopoulos, Prekates, Ntoi.\n\nAston Villa: Martinez; Cash, Diego Carlos, Konsa, Torres, Digne; Diaby, McGinn, Douglas Luiz, Bailey; Watkins.\n\nSubstitutes: Gauci, Olsen, Lenglet, Duran, Hayden, Iroegbunam. Patterson, Munroe, Kellyman, Young.\n\nFiorentina took on Club Brugge in the second leg of the other semi-final last night in Belgium. The Italian side took a 3-2 lead into the second leg, which ended 1-1 meaning Fiorentina progressed through to the final which will take place in Athens, not far from tonight's match. Fiorentina were losing finalists last year against West Ham and will be hoping to go one step better in a few weeks.\n\nHaving a bet on today's match? First take a look at these free bets and betting offers\n\nOlympiacos had the weekend off and make just one change from the first leg. Quini replaces the injured Francisco Ortega at full-back.\n\nOlympiacos: Tzolakis: Quini, Carmo, Retsos, Rodinei: Chiquinho, Iborra, Hezze; Fortounis, El Kaabi, Podence.\n\nSubstitutes: Paschalakis, Papadoudis, Horta, El-Arabi, Alexandropoulos, Masouras, Carvalho, Joveti&cacute;, Apostolopoulos, Prekates, Ntoi.\n\nAston Villa make two changes from the side that lost 1-0 to Brighton at the weekend. Emiliano Martinez returns in goal, having been suspended for the first leg and he was not in the squad for Villa's Premier League loss on Sunday. Matty Cash is also in the starting XI, replacing the injured Morgan Rogers.\n\nAston Villa: Martinez; Cash, Diego Carlos, Konsa, Torres, Digne; Diaby, McGinn, Douglas Luiz, Bailey; Watkins.\n\nSubstitutes: Gauci, Olsen, Lenglet, Duran, Hayden, Iroegbunam. Patterson, Munroe, Kellyman, Young.\n\nUnai Emery is ready to recall Emiliano Martinez for Aston Villa's crunch semi-final as he plots another heroic European comeback. Emery will make a late decision on Martinez's return for the second leg against Olympiacos but the Villa goalkeeper is pushing to start after a recent thigh injury.\n\nMartinez was inspired in Villa's win over Lille in the quarter-final second leg, saving two penalties in the shoot-out, and Emery was remaining tight-lipped on the Argentina World Cup winner's availability for Thursday night. Villa's social media account posted a picture of Martinez and key defender Pau Torres after Tuesday's training session with the words \"ready to give everything\".\n\nSweden international Robin Olsen played in last week's chaotic 4-2 defeat at Villa Park, but it appears inevitable that Martinez will start in Greece.\n\n\"He [Martinez] is with us today, but I don't want to give information to you,\" said Emery. \"I will speak with him and the doctor on Thursday to see if he is 100% fit to play, but I believe in Olsen and I'm building the team not just with the players in the starting XI.\n\n\"If he is available 100% he will play but if not then he will play. If Olsen plays he has all of our respect to play.\"\n\nEmery is targeting a fifth trophy in European competition but admits overcoming the Greek giants in their own stadium will be Villa's most significant test of the season. Fortunately for Villa, their Basque manager does have previous experience of upsetting the odds. In 2014 his Sevilla team were beaten 2-0 by Real Betis in the Europa League round of 16 but eventually triumphed in the second leg after a penalty shootout.\n\nWith Arsenal, Emery's team were beaten 3-1 by Rennes in the same competition but produced an outstanding performance in the second leg with a 3-0 win to move into the quarter-finals.\n\n\"Experiences can always help you be successful but we have to create a new way,\" said Emery. \"This is the biggest challenge we are going to face this year. They are the favourites and we have to accept it. Thursday will be difficult to come back but we expect to do better than the first leg. It's a really good moment to watch how we react.\"\n\nVilla are seeking silverware for the first time in 28 years, and have been the favourites to win the competition this season. Olympiacos were the first team to beat them at Villa Park in the competition, with Douglas Luiz missing a penalty late in the game. That felt like a significant moment, but the Villa midfielder is ready to step up again and says his team still believe.\n\n\"Missing the penalty was my responsibility but if we have another one on Thursday I will take it. I am mentally strong,\" he said. \"It's a huge game for the football club and we want to get into a European final. That gives us the extra motivation to keep fighting. The season has been great for us and we are confident that we can win this game and go through.\"\n\nTeam news to follow shortly.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Ayoub El Kaabi bagged a double to take his tally across both legs to five goals, having scored a hat-trick at Villa Park in the first leg.\n\n\"I was more or less comfortable with the way we played the first half today,\" Emery admitted. \"They scored one goal and were more clinical than us. The second half progressively we were feeling less comfortable and the second goal more or less finished the match.\n\nREAD | John Townley's Villa player ratings from Euro defeat\n\nREAD | Villa have a masterplan to overcome FFP spending limits\n\n\"It's our process. Thankfully for our fans, we have got to the semi-final, but we have to accept it's not enough. At the start of the season, I said our first process was to compete in Europe and we go next year to playing in Europe. We are improving and we still have the opportunity to get the fourth position [in the Premier League], which is amazing motivation.\n\n\"We have to be disappointed a little bit, and frustrated a little bit, and be quick to focus on Monday. But everything we are taking in. Today was more difficult. I knew with my experience that they [Olympiacos] were playing with confidence, but we were focusing as well on the opportunity here and chances to get closer to them, but we didn't do it and we have to accept it and try to understand our process and how we can improve after the experiences we are having. It is a difficult night, but we're in Europe again next season.\"\n\nVilla's hopes of a comeback were effectively ended after just 10 minutes when El Kaabi extended Olympiacos' lead to the sound of a near-deafening noise. The Premier League side were sliced open by a long ball, former Wolves attacker Daniel Podence teed up Quini, and his cross was bundled home by El Kaabi.\n\nAnd El Kaabi's fifth goal of the tie in the 81st minute killed it as he raced clear and powered past Emiliano Martinez. It was initially ruled out for offside but VAR overturned the decision.\n\nEmery added: \"The summary of the season is that there is still too much to play in Premier League. We were very motivated because for a long time Villa didn't play in Europe, but to win is very difficult. I know to win in Europe is very difficult.\n\n\"I will have to accept getting here and getting experiences and information. Experience is trying to manage different moments, and the first leg we played was the moment we didn't manage the way we wanted to. But even here we tried to get a good result.\n\n\"They have experience themselves and a coach with experiences from different countries. I will try to get better. This year we struggled playing with other teams in other countries, and Olympiacos have some experiences as well.

Doron Leidner and Andreas-Richardos Ntoi are also missing for the Greek side, while Ruben Vezo, Nelson Abbey and winger Gelson Martins are all ineligible to play.\n\nAndreas Ndoj and Georgios Masouras will return from suspension, but they may not feature from the start against Villa.\n\nOlympiacos predicted lineup vs Aston Villa (4-3-2-1): Tzolakis; Rodinei, Retsos, Carmo, Richards; Hezze, Iborra, Chiquinho; Fortounis, Podence; El Kaabi.\n\nAston Villa's extensive injury list and busy schedule has started to catch up with them in recent weeks, with Emery missing some key contributors.\n\nThe quartet of Boubacar Kamara, Tyrone Mings, Emiliano Buendia and Jacob Ramsey are all out for the remainder of the season, while January recruit Morgan Rogers may well be unavailable for Thursday's encounter.\n\nBoth Nicolo Zaniolo and Youri Tielemans have a good chance of being involved in Piraeus, while Emiliano Martinez, who missed the first leg through suspension and injury, could return from a hamstring concern that also kept him out of the weekend defeat to Brighton.\n\nAston Villa predicted lineup vs Olympiacos (4-4-2): Martinez; Cash, Carlos, Konsa, Moreno; Bailey, Luiz, McGinn, Zaniolo; Diaby, Watkins.\n\nWhile Aston Villa have been mightily impressive domestically and in Europe this season, they will find it incredibly tough to overturn a two-goal deficit in Greece on Thursday. They are beginning to run out of energy at the climax of a hectic season and their tired legs may be exposed.\n\nOlympiacos have been in strong form of late and have enjoyed a week of rest between the two legs. That extra time away from the pitch may do them the world of good this week.", "source": {"uri": "90min.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "90min.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

But this is a not a challenge the Spaniard hasn't overcome previously.\n\nBack in 2014, Emery's Sevilla side avenged a two-goal home defeat to Real Betis in the Europa League, winning 2-0 away from home in the second leg before advancing on penalties. Emery also overcame a two-goal deficit while manager of Arsenal after winning the reverse leg of a Europa League round of 16 clash against Rennes 3-0 in 2019 following a a 3-1 defeat in France.\n\n\"Experiences can always help, being successful or not,\" Emery explained in his pre-match press conference at the Karaiskakis Stadium. \"But we have to create and build a new way and we lost the first leg clearly. Tomorrow will be difficult to come back but we must play tomorrow thinking to stand after the first 90 minutes, the game plan we had that didn't work well but expect tomorrow to do better.\n\nREAD | Emi Martinez injury update as Aston Villa handed boost for Olympiacos clash\n\nREAD | Vicente Iborra fires Unai Emery warning and explains how Aston Villa can overcome Olympiacos\n\n\"It's going to be very difficult here with the atmosphere, it could be more difficult with the supporters pushing a lot but focusing like we can with my experience before and building a new experience here with our players and idea and our experiences this year. This is the challenge tomorrow, the biggest challenge we are going to face this year, playing in this semi-final.\n\nAsked if he spoke to his group specifically about when his Sevilla team overturned Real Betis away from home after being two goals behind, Emery said: \"Not specifically about that moment, we are speaking about our experiences and how we reacted to losing some matches, even in Premier League or even how we reacted to Carabao Cup or FA Cup or even how we reacted in Conference League playing some matches.\n\n\"More thinking or something similar. Trying to prepare the match with them to try to help them with my expectation about how we can react tomorrow, with the result and emotions. It's a good moment to see how we can react, how we can focus on our game plan and how we can progressively do good things and the things we need to do and with the respect we have of them.\"\n\nThe thousands of Villa fans who have flocked to Athens over the last 48 hours know that whatever happens on Thursday night, they'll have more European trips to come next season and likely beyond that under Emery. Few managers in world football boast his tremendously consistent record on the continent.\n\n\"We are in a process,\" Emery continued. \"We can be very demanding but never feel we are under pressure, we're in a process as a team and as a club. We enjoyed getting here and to win a trophy in Europe is very difficult and we can watch behind us.\n\n\"To get here is only when you're being consistent and successful. But if we don't win tomorrow the process is clear, how we're trying to get there is being demanding and be a contender for a trophy.\n\n\"Maybe we could be favourites before the first leg but then to show it on the field and they showed their power and how they want to be contender as well and they are favourites now. I'm very demanding and will prepare the match tomorrow to try and come back but we are not playing under pressure we are playing under our demands.\n\n\"We have to try and enjoy both competitions until we are finished, hopefully not tomorrow but if we do finish tomorrow we need to be proud.\"\n\nBefore Emery arrived at the stadium, Mendilibar disagreed with one reporter during his press conference, who suggested that Olympiacos were now favourites to reach the final ahead of Villa given their two-goal advantage.\n\n\"After the first leg they are favourites,\" Emery claimed. \"It's not a surprise for me [how they played in the first leg], everything I watched they delivered. It was how they were competing previously.\n\n\"They have more or less being successful in Europe and when we were playing 90 minutes there and some circumstances happened it was not a surprise but some circumstances against us we are always making some mistakes and they were clinical and they were very competitive and we couldn't stop them in some tactical ways that we usually can.\n\n\"Tomorrow is a challenge to be clinical and stop them and try and control them in 90 minutes and if we create chances and being clinical we could be close to draw the match and then hopefully it's going long more than 90 minutes, it would be good news for us.\"\n\nWill Villa progress to the final?

Emery will make a late decision on Martinez's return for the second leg against Olympiacos but the Villa goalkeeper is pushing to start after a recent thigh injury.\n\nMartinez was inspired in Villa's win over Lille in the quarter-final second leg, saving two penalties in the shoot-out, and Emery was remaining tight-lipped on the Argentina World Cup winner's availability for Thursday night. Villa's social media account posted a picture of Martinez and key defender Pau Torres after Tuesday's training session with the words \"ready to give everything\".\n\nSweden international Robin Olsen played in last week's chaotic 4-2 defeat at Villa Park, but it appears inevitable that Martinez will start in Greece.\n\n\"He [Martinez] is with us today, but I don't want to give information to you,\" said Emery. \"I will speak with him and the doctor on Thursday to see if he is 100% fit to play, but I believe in Olsen and I'm building the team not just with the players in the starting XI.\n\n\"If he is available 100% he will play but if not then he will play. If Olsen plays he has all of our respect to play.\"\n\nEmery is targeting a fifth trophy in European competition but admits overcoming the Greek giants in their own stadium will be Villa's most significant test of the season. Fortunately for Villa, their Basque manager does have previous experience of upsetting the odds. In 2014 his Sevilla team were beaten 2-0 by Real Betis in the Europa League round of 16 but eventually triumphed in the second leg after a penalty shootout.\n\nWith Arsenal, Emery's team were beaten 3-1 by Rennes in the same competition but produced an outstanding performance in the second leg with a 3-0 win to move into the quarter-finals.\n\n\"Experiences can always help you be successful but we have to create a new way,\" said Emery. \"This is the biggest challenge we are going to face this year. They are the favourites and we have to accept it. Thursday will be difficult to come back but we expect to do better than the first leg. It's a really good moment to watch how we react.\"\n\nVilla are seeking silverware for the first time in 28 years, and have been the favourites to win the competition this season. Olympiacos were the first team to beat them at Villa Park in the competition, with Douglas Luiz missing a penalty late in the game. That felt like a significant moment, but the Villa midfielder is ready to step up again and says his team still believe.\n\n\"Missing the penalty was my responsibility but if we have another one on Thursday I will take it.

Following a 4-2 defeat at Villa Park last week, Unai Emery's side were unable to turn the tie around at the Karaiskakis Stadium and lost 2-0 on the night.\n\nDespite an encouraging start from Villa, Olympiacos took the lead against the early run of play leg as Ayoub El Kaabi - who bagged a hat-trick at Villa Park - opened the scoring by tapping in from close range. Villa played some good football in the first half and didn't deserve to trail at the break given their control in the game and dominance in the final third.\n\nEmery opted to play a back three and use wing-backs Matty Cash and Lucas Digne to stretch the pitch, allowing Leon Bailey and Moiussa Diaby to pick up dangerous positions inside the pitch. Villa had 80 per cent of possession in the first half, but lacked that cutting edge which they needed to progress to the final given their deficit from the home leg.\n\nREAD | Chris Heck makes Holte End point as he predicts future of Villa Park\n\nREAD | Villa have a masterplan to overcome Financial Fair Play spending limits\n\nVilla rallied in the second half, but struggled to make any clear-cut opportunities to put any fear in the hosts that their place in the final was at risk. Jhon Duran came on just before the hour mark for Diaby, who after missing Villa's best chance of the first half was largely ineffective.\n\nEmery had very few options to turn to on the bench, but did bring on Tim Iroegbunam for Diego Carlos to allow John McGinn to operate further forward, while Luiz dropped into a deep role alongside Pau Torres and Ezri Konsa. Olympiacos added a second through El Kaabi with 10 minutes remaining and will go on to play Fiorentina in the Europa Conference League final on Wednesday, May 29.\n\nVilla must switch their focus to Premier League duties with two games remaining to secure qualification for the Champions League.\n\nPlayer ratings\n\nEmi Martinez\n\nMartinez passed a late fitness test to start ahead of Robin Olsen, who put in his best performance for Villa against Brighton last weekend. Villa progressed the ball well and played some good stuff in the first period, which Martinez was key to. When he has the ball Villa essentially have a spare man playing against the opponent's 10 outfielders. 5\n\nEzri Konsa\n\nKonsa operated at right centre-back in a back three. It was a tricky task for him because Villa were always going to be vulnerable from counter-attacks. 5\n\nDiego Carlos\n\nCarlos battled with El Kaabi, but the striker had the better of Villa's backline, scoring five goals across both games. He was replaced in the 65th minute as Emery went for the jugular. 5\n\nPau Torres\n\nTorres lost El Kaabi at the back post inside in the 10th minute, allowing the striker to tap in for the opener. The Spaniard is key to how Villa play with the ball and his quality in possession was on show tonight as Villa pinned their opponents back throughout. 5\n\nLucas Digne\n\nDigne was a threat for Villa down the left, hugging the flank and putting balls into the box which asked questions of the Olympiacos backline. 5\n\nJohn McGinn\n\nHe made a good interception in the box just before Olympiacos managed to take the lead. McGinn left nothing on the pitch and was a driving force to many of Villa's attacks. 6*\n\nDouglas Luiz\n\nLuiz used the ball well and helped Villa sustain pressure in the final third in the first half. The Brazilian lost confidence as the game went on after a couple of stray passes. 4\n\nMatty Cash\n\nCash came back into the XI for the injured Morgan Rogers and played at right-wing back. He offered energy behind Bailey and had the beating of 34-year-old Quini. 5\n\nLeon Bailey\n\nAfter struggling to make an impact against Brighton after being shifted to the left following Rogers' substitution, Bailey looked more comfortable on the right tonight. He nearly scored from distance on the cusp of half-time, but Tzolis saved his effort well. 5\n\nMoussa Diaby\n\nMissed Villa's first big chance of the second leg after Bailey picked him out inside the box. Tzolis rushed out to thwart Diaby at a tight angle. He was replaced before the hour mark. 4\n\nOllie Watkins\n\nWatkins had few chances to get among the goals tonight. His full focus will now be on becoming the first Villa player to bag 20 goals in a Premier League season in the final two games against Liverpool and Crystal Palace. 5\n\nSUBS\n\nJhon Duran (for Diaby, 58'): He was a presence in the box, but Villa were resigned to losing the tie by the time he entered the match.\n\nTim Iroegbunam (for Carlos, 65'): Iroegbunam came on to allow McGinn to operate further forward.

Stevan Jovetic and Mady Camara are sidelined through injury while Francisco Ortega was hurt in the first leg and is unlikely to be fit.\n\nGeorgios Masouras and Andreas Ndoj can be added to the home squad after being suspended for the first match.\n\nVilla's biggest concern is goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez, who is able to be selected again after being suspended for the first leg but is still bothered by a hamstring injury and will be assessed before the game.\n\nYouri Tielemans is also set to return and Alex Moreno was back in the team for the league game against Brighton, but Morgan Rogers is unlikely to feature due to injury and Jacob Ramsey, Emiliano Buendia and Tyrone Mings are long-term absentees.\n\nOlympiacos have scored 28 goals in their last 10 games.\n\nThe Greek team's last three home games have all been wins with both teams scoring.\n\nAston Villa have won only one of their last six away fixtures.\n\nBoth teams have scored in six of Olympiacos' last seven games.\n\nBoth teams have scored in seven of Villa's last nine matches.\n\nOlympiacos' Ayoub El Kaabi has scored 19 goals in his last 20 appearances.\n\nOlympiacos enjoyed some good fortune in their 4-2 first-leg win over Aston Villa but they look a good price at 2/1 with LiveScore Bet to make it a double over the Premier League team in front of their own fans.\n\nThe final goal of the Villa Park contest took a wicked deflection and Villa's Douglas Luiz failed to convert a penalty which would have given Unai Emery's team a much better chance of turning the tie around, but many of Villa's errors were forced by an effervescent Greek team.\n\nWith Villa having to take a positive approach in the second leg, they could be vulnerable to further mistakes in what will be a hostile atmosphere.\n\nOlympiacos have won 13 of their 17 home league games in Greece this season and have the man to punish any errors from Villa in Ayoub El Kaabi, who netted a hat-trick in the first match and has scored an impressive 19 goals in his last 20 games.\n\nThe home side have had a whole week to prepare for this match, while Villa were in league action at Brighton on Sunday, when they failed to give themselves a confidence boost by losing 1-0.\n\nOlympiacos had also scored four goals in their last match before travelling to England and have plenty of firepower to respond to anything Villa can throw at them.\n\nThey will be desperate to reach their first European final and 2/1 with LiveScore Bet for a home win in the second leg is attractive.", "source": {"uri": "livescore.com",

In what can only be described as anything but a banner year for the English Premier League, just one of its clubs remains in action as the top European footballing competitions are moving to the semi final stages.\n\nIn quarterfinal matches, reigning champion Manchester City and Arsenal were bounced from the UEFA Champions League. City went out via Real Madrid, while the Gunners were gunned down by Harry Kane and Bayern Munich.\n\nLiverpool, the third club battling with those two sides for the EPL title, were ousted from the Europa League by Italian side Atalanta. West Ham United also went out of the Europa League quarter finals at the hands of Bayer Leverkussen.\n\nOnly Aston Villa, which survived against French club Lille 4-3 on penalties, remains in the hunt. They'll carry the UK hopes onward into the Europa Conference League semifinals against Greek side Olympiakos.\n\nOddsmakers are listing Villa as the -245 betting favorite in the moneyline for the first leg of their semifinal with Olympiakos on May 2. If you're new to sports betting and are wondering how you win a moneyline bet, it's really quite simple.\n\nMoneylines are the most common and most frequently placed wager in online sports betting. You are simply making a straightforward bet on which club you think will win the match.\n\nAston Villa were 2-1 losers to Lille in the away leg of the Europa Conference League quarter final on Thursday. In fact, were it not for an 87th minute goal by Villa defender Matty Cash, they would have also been ousted from Europe 3-2 on aggregate.\n\nHowever, Cash's goal would ultimately send the match to penalties when neither club could find the back of the net in extra time. Aston Villa won with goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez stopping a pair of spot kicks. Martinez was able to continue into penalties even after being issued a second yellow card for gamesmanship during penalties. Luckily for Martinez, cautions do not carry forward into penalties, so he wasn't sent off, which would've left Aston Villa without a goalkeeper.\n\nMartinez is proving to be a French nightmare when it comes to penalties. He was also between the sticks for Argentina when his country beat France on penalties in the 2023 World Cup final.\n\nMartinez is known as a penalty-saving savant. Over his career, he's stopped over 30 percent of the penalties the Argentine goalkeeper has faced. On the international stage, Martinez has a 50 percent success rate (seven of 14 penalties stopped) when playing for Argentina.\n\nVilla manager Unai Emery is no stranger to Europa League success. He's won the Europa League four times as a manager - three times in a row with Sevilla (2013-14, 2014-15, 2015-16) and once with Valencia (2020-21).\n\nVilla Stirring European Cup memories\n\nTheir club's success in Europe this season has long-time Villa supporters fondly recollecting the days when their squad ruled over European football. In 1981-82, Aston Villa were shock winners of the European Cup, the forerunner to the current UEFA Champions League.\n\nUnder manager Tony Barton, Aston Villa defeated Bayern Munich 1-0 in the European Cup final that year, which was played in Rotterdam. Peter Withe's goal in the 67th minute was the difference, enabling Villa captain Dennis Mortimer the opportunity to hoist aloft the top prize in European club football.\n\nBrian Moore's call of the match-winning goal is displayed on a giant banner across the north stand of Villa Park.\n\n\"Shaw, Williams, prepared to venture down the left. There's a good ball in for Tony Morley. Oh, it must be and it is! It's Peter Withe.\"\n\nVilla would win despite losing first choice goalkeeper Jimmy Rimmer to injury just 10 minutes into the final. Rimmer fell victim to a recurring neck injury. He gave way to understudy Nigel Spink and the duo would share the honour of the clean sheet in the match. It was only the second first-team appearance for Spink, his previous match coming on Boxing Day in 1979.\n\nBeating a star-studded Bayern squad that had won the European Cup in 1976, the German lineup included legendary players such as captain Paul Breitner, Klaus Augehthaler and Karl-Heinz Rummennige. Villa were the fourth English side to win the European Cup, following Manchester United, Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.\n\nAston Villa would follow up by defeating Barcelona 3-1 in the 1982 European Super Cup. Amazingly, just five years after their European Cup success, Villa would be relegated from England's top flight.\n\nVilla Positioned For Champions League In 2024-25\n\nIn EPL play it's also proving to be a rewarding year for Aston Villa. A chance to return to play in European club football's top cup competition is looming for the club.\n\nCurrently, Aston Villa is fourth in the Premier League table, taking 63 points from 33 matches. They are three points clear of fifth place Tottenham Hotspur. The top four finishers in the table are assured of spots in the 2024-25 UEFA Champions League. It would be their first appearance in this elite competition since 1982-83.\n\nIn EPL matches, Only Manchester City's Erling Haaland and Chelsea's Cole Palmer, each with 20, have netted more goals than the 19 scored by Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins. The Villa striker is giving as good as he gets. Watkins, Brighton and Hove Albion's Pascal Grob and Newcastle United's Kieran Trippier all share the EPL assists lead with 10 each.\n\nWatkins is also third in shots (95) and tied for third in shots on target (43). His five headed goals also give Watkins a share of the lead in that category. On the unfortunate side of the ledger, Waktkins has also hit the woodwork five times this season. That's the second most in the league. Martinez is fourth in the EPL with eight clean sheets.", "source": {"uri": "vanguardngr.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Vanguard"}, "authors": [{"uri": "akintayo_eribake@vanguardngr.com", "name":

Listen to the It's All Kicking Off! Man United Crisis Special podcast\n\nIf Aston Villa are serious about rejoining the elite of European football then they must show they can deliver on nights like these.\n\nTo keep alive their dream of lifting a first major trophy since 1996, on Thursday Unai Emery's men must overturn a two-goal deficit at the Georgios Karaiskakis Stadium - the home of Olympiacos and one of the most intimidating venues in European football.\n\nOnly 1,600 Villa supporters will be there to cheer on their team among a capacity crowd of about 33,000 and their noise will be largely drowned out. Every Villa touch will be whistled, their every pass jeered. If Olympiacos supporters learn the location of Villa's hotel, the squad may be in for a disturbed night's sleep.\n\nYet these are the games Emery has pinpointed to take Villa to the next level. With Champions League qualification within touching distance, Emery knows his team need to learn to handle the heat of hostile matches in unfamiliar surroundings.\n\nEven though Villa have reached the semi-finals of the Europa Conference League, their progress has been based on strong home displays. The 4-1 win at AZ Alkmaar last October is Villa's only victory on their travels in the competition proper, and they were poor in the 0-0 draw at Ajax and the 2-1 defeat at Lille, when Villa were lucky to squeeze through on penalties.\n\nGoalkeeper Emi Martinez was due to have a fitness test before the squad fly to Athens\n\nPodcast All episodes PODCAST: Listen to the latest episode of 'It's All Kicking Off!'

'He's reaching De Bruyne levels' listen now Play on Apple Spotify\n\nOlympiacos' 4-2 win at Villa Park last Thursday means Villa will have to go one step beyond with a tired, injury-hit squad.\n\nBut Emery has instilled a 'no excuses' culture at the club and these are precisely the situations in which he wants to test his team's mettle.\n\nA four-time Europa League winner as a coach, Emery knows what it takes to succeed in these contests. It is now up to his players to prove they do, too.\n\nGoalkeeper Emi Martinez was due to have a fitness test on Wednesday before the squad fly to Athens and his return would be crucial. Though John McGinn is the captain, Martinez is the natural leader of this team, especially in the absence of Tyrone Mings.\n\nAfter Martinez was substituted at half-time against Chelsea on April 27, Villa threw away a two-goal lead to draw 2-2 at home to Chelsea and then lost to Olympiacos and Brighton. Without him, they have conceded seven times, scoring only twice.\n\nMartinez makes his presence felt off the pitch as well as on it and without him the changing room is a quieter place, something Emery has been trying to correct.\n\n'I'm pushing Ezri Konsa to lead in different moments,\" said Emery. 'I like to explain in the dressing room in front of everyone, they are doing that.\n\n'Even Leon Bailey likes to speak and Ollie Watkins is usually one step ahead trying to share our thoughts in front of other players.\n\nAston Villa must overturn a two-goal deficit at the Georgios Karaiskakis Stadium on Thursday\n\n'We are building our mentality. We were progressively getting better, being responsible and mature.\n\n'There's still work to do because we need to keep control of emotions when we are under pressure and are struggling in some moments. The maturity of the players is getting better.\n\nVilla's players are about to take a crash course in mental resilience. If they can come through it, it will mean so much more for their future than reaching a major European final.

Villa head to Greece knowing that they'll have to reverse a two-goal deficit in the second leg with Olympiacos, if they're to return to Athens for the showpiece at the end of the month.\n\nVilla trail 4-2 after the first leg at Villa Park last week; despite the efforts of Ollie Watkins and Moussa Diaby in front of goal, the Lions were found wanting at the back and missed a golden opportunity through a missed Douglas Luiz penalty to drag the aggregate score back further before full time.\n\nIt means that, in this era where the away goal rule has been eradicated, Villa must be two goals ahead inside the original 90 minutes in order to level things up and force extra time - better yet, if they can settle the tie in the original leg then they'll need three goals without reply. It's a sizeable task, against a side who have won 19 of their 26 matches on home soil in all competitions this season.\n\nInterestingly, of those seven matches which Olympiacos have failed to win on home soil this term, one fixture in particular stands out as a result in which Villa can take heart from and. There's no reason at all why they can't match what Maccabi Tel Aviv did in Greece back in February.\n\nREAD: 'Begged' to stay and 'tapped up' by Gerrard - Ashley Young reveals all about Villa exit\n\nREAD: Monchi's transfer remit is clear after Aston Villa problem exposed\n\nGranted, it was the first leg, and Olympiacos duly pulled the tie back in Israel having clearly learned lessons, but Maccabi pulled off something of a shock in the last 16 when they touched down in Greece and inflicted a comprehensive 4-1 defeat on their hosts, in a leg overseen by English referee Craig Pawson.\n\nThe key on that particular night? Strike early and hit the front quickly. That day, Maccabi raced into a 2-0 lead inside the opening ten minutes (what Villa would give for a similar scenario to play out this Thursday) thanks to goals from Eran Zahavi and Ido Shahar. Although Ayoub El Kaabi, who Villa are well versed in the exploits of, pulled one back promptly, Maccabi struck again through Zahavi. They rounded it off in the second half through Dor Peretz.\n\nVilla could be forgiven for feeling sorry for themselves. It's not been a great week. Since dropping two points when previously comfortable against Chelsea, things clearly didn't go according to Unai Emery's plan in Europe and then they were deservedly beaten by Brighton on Sunday. Perhaps it's the punishing schedule taking its toll, but Villa need one last push - and they have the perfect case study as they target a continental turnaround.\n\nWhat is your Olympiacos vs Villa prediction?

run comes to sorry end", "body": "Aston Villa players were visibly distraught as they crashed out of the Europa Conference League against Olympiacos.\n\nUnai Emery's side travelled to Greece having to overturn their 4-2 aggregate deficit from the first leg but two goals from Ayoub El Kaabi proved too much for them.\n\nThe Moroccan, who scored a hat-trick at Villa Park, quickly dashed Villa's hopes of a comeback when he netted unmarked after just ten minutes.\n\nVilla dominated possession for much of the match in search of a reply to potentially inspire what would've been a monumental turnaround.\n\nBut the killer blow was dealt in the 80th minute when El Kaabi scored another close-range finish, with the goal being awarded following a VAR check for offside.\n\nIt wasn't to be for Villa and their emotion could be clear to see at the full-time whistle after their exit in a 6-2 aggregate defeat.\n\nThey looked despondent on the pitch as Olympiacos players sparked jubilant scenes with their home crowd.\n\nVilla's stars were then seen applauding the hundreds of fans that made the trip from Birmingham to the away end, applauding their support on a disappointing night.\n\nWhilst semi-final defeat will come as a cruel blow to Villa, reaching such a stage shows the progress they're making under Emery.\n\nThey topped their group having won four for their six matches and therefore advanced straight to the round of 16.\n\nVilla thrashed Ajax 4-0 on aggregate before beating Lille on penalties in a dramatic quarter-final clash that saw Emi Martinez save two of the spot-kicks.\n\nNext season currently looks set to see them play in the Champions League instead as they sit fourth in the Premier League table with two games left to play.\n\nWith Tottenham seven points behind them with a game in hand, victory against Liverpool on Monday would seal a top four finish.\n\nIt would mark a significant achievement for a club who were playing in the Championship as recent as 2017, as well as a return to the top of European football for the first time since 1983.\n\nBut this season's European journey has now come to an end and winners Olympiakos will face

An Ayoub El Kaabi hat-trick was the difference but strikes from Ollie Watkins and Moussa Diaby in each half have given Emery's team a lifeline they will be clinging on to ahead of tonight's game.\n\nOlympiacos will be no pushovers as they aim to become only the second Greek team to reach a major UEFA competition final, and the first since Panathinaikos in 1970/71. Olympiacos have been impressive in European action at their home ground of late, winning four of their last five such fixtures.\n\nVilla were without Emi Martinez for the first leg, who was suspended, but he is also currently carrying a small hamstring injury though he could return as could Youri Tielemans. Alex Moreno returned from injury last weekend in the 1-0 defeat against Brighton and may also feature.\n\nVilla will be confident and despite Olympiacos' decent home record, they have shipped 20 goals in the 18 matches and speaking of last week's defeat, skipper John McGinn said: \"Everything that could have gone wrong, did. It's up to us to go to Athens and turn it around, because I know we're capable.\"\n\nVilla will know they're capable and will fancy their chances but it will take belief and then some to turn it around in Greece and make it a night to remember.\n\nWhen is Olympiacos vs Aston Villa?\n\nVilla take on the Olympiacos at the Stadio Georgios Karaiskakis, Piraeus on Thursday, May 9 with kick-off set for 8pm UK time.\n\nHow can you watch it?\n\nTNT Sports is \u00a330.99 a month, but you can cancel at any time.

We got to be in Europe at the end of last year and this year we enjoyed it but to win is very difficult and we are in the process [of developing]. .... This is an experience for us at Aston Villa after a long time [of not being in Europe] and the process we have here. Again we are going to compete in Europe next year.\"\n\nOn why Villa lost: \"We have to accept it because [Olympiakos] deserve to play in the final. We lost it in the first 90 minutes at home and there we were not competitive. Today we started well in the first half well, they scored but we controlled the game but we were not clinical. For the rest, the tie was fighting with us. We lost today but we are in a process. Congratulations to get to here.\"\n\n\"Of course we are a little bit disappointed, a little bit frustrated, but we have to move on quick.\"\n\nOn what Villa will take moving forward: \"Experiences. Keep being consistent all season and we are playing 90 minutes over two legs as well. We lost the control of our emotion in the first leg a little bit and they were clinical and competing very well. We started the first leg and maybe we were favorites but after the first leg we weren't the favorites.\"\n\n\"We went into this competition as favorites,\" McGinn said. \"We handled that through the competition. I think it has been a huge learning curve for us. It's not been a smooth journey. We got to the semi-final and were down to the bare bones a bit. However those of us that were out there over the two legs lost to the better team and I think the scoreline proves that.\n\nOn Villa's long injury list contributing to loss: \"Possibly. The manager drills into us that is is a no excuse environment. Obviously you want your best players available, you want your everyone there. When you are in the trenches, someone to turn to in order to change the game or do something different.\"\n\nOn what Villa can learn: \"For us going into more European competition next season we've got to manage moments a lot better. Of course we are extremely disappointed from everyone involved who wanted to do better this year and get to a European final but we will do everything we can to get back into this position and get to a final. \"\n\n\"Our instant feeling is absolutely gutted. We all wanted to be back here for the final. Olympiacos gave it absolutely everything, played out of their skin. Overall the score line proves it. Of course we can be proud of the journey. We need to apologize to the supports who traveled here and traveled the whole campaign. We're all bitterly disappointed but we need the big push the last two games to get Champions League over the line.

Unai Emery's side were beaten heavily by Newcastle United on the opening day of the campaign before improving significantly and achieving continental qualification. Sir Alex Ferguson's comments about Aston Villa in August confused many football fans, but make a lot of sense now, proving the genius of the legendary boss.\n\nAston Villa find themselves on the verge of Champions League qualification for the 2024-25 season as Unai Emery continues to work miracles at Villa Park. Sir Alex Ferguson's surprisingly positive comments after the Villans were thrashed by Newcastle United on the opening weekend of the campaign prove the legendary Scottish manager is still in a league of his own.\n\nThe trip to the north-east for the first game of the season brought hope and expectations for a club that had been on an upward trajectory towards the end of the previous campaign. However, a clinical Newcastle side put Villa to the sword, picking up all three points in a shock 5-1 demolition.\n\nIt was a hugely disappointing start to the season for everyone associated with Aston Villa - and positives appeared to be virtually non-existent. However, Ferguson thought otherwise and took viewers by surprise by singing Villa's praises following their heavy defeat, which came across as bizarre analysis at the time.\n\nSir Alex Ferguson's Aston Villa Comments The Man United icon's assessment raised eyebrows in August\n\nThe 82-year-old Scot, winner of 38 trophies during his glittering 26-year spell as Man Utd manager, told NBC Sports that Aston Villa were excellent during the game despite falling to a heavy defeat in the end against a strong Newcastle side. The retired manager said:\n\n\"To be honest with you, I watched Aston Villa vs Newcastle and I can't believe the scoreline. Honestly, Aston Villa played fantastic football and just lost to bad goals. Newcastle are going to be very difficult to beat, in their own ground in particular, and their manager has done a great job there. It's a surprising game, football. You can play teams off the pitch and not score - that's what happened to Aston Villa.\"\n\nNobody appeared to share Ferguson's opinion about Villa at the time, but arguably the greatest manager in football history wasn't afraid to voice his honest views. He'd watched the game closely and wasn't fooled by the scoreline. Watch the clip below:\n\nSome football fans even mocked Ferguson on social media for his eyebrow-raising comments in August, but they're certainly not laughing now. He might be in his early 80s and retired for over 10 years, but the 11-time Premier League Manager of the Season clearly still possesses a football brain that is unrivalled by the vast majority.\n\nRelated Ranking the 8 Managers with the Most Trophies in History Some managers could not stop winning trophies in their career from Sir Alex Ferguson to Luiz Felipe Scolari to Valeriy Lobanovskyi. Aston Villa's Rise to the Champions League Unai Emery has brought success back to Villa Park\n\nAston Villa haven't appeared in the Champions League since the competition was rebranded in 1992. The last time the club sat at the table of Europe's elite was when they took part in the European Cup, as it was called back then, during the 1981-82 season.\n\nRemarkably, this last foray into the best continental competition on offer saw the English club lift the trophy following a 1-0 victory over Bayern Munich in the final. Emery has fans dreaming of similar success in the future as his side look set to compete in the newly formatted Champions League in the 2024-25 campaign.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Statistic: Aston Villa are set to compete in the top European competition for the first time in over 40 years.\n\nThe east Midlands outfit have had a wonderful year, beating the likes of Manchester City and Arsenal at home and going far in the Europa Conference League. Ferguson's comments from August now look like a stroke of genius from the greatest manager in Premier League history.\n\nTo the standard fan, alarm bells would have been ringing if a team lost their opening fixture by a four-goal margin. However, Emery has managed to turn things around in order to take his club above teams such as Chelsea, Man United and Tottenham. There was even a point in the season where Aston Villa were seen as potential title contenders which was incredible.\n\nRelated Ranking the 20 Best Managers in World Football Right Now Jurgen Klopp, Pep Guardiola and Carlo Ancelotti feature among the 20 best managers in world football in 2024.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villa_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Villa Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unai_Emery", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unai Emery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcastle_United_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Newcastle United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Ferguson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alex Ferguson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Villa_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aston Villa F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_Conference_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa Conference League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League_Manager_of_the_Season", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Premier League Manager of the Season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luiz_Felipe_Scolari", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luiz Felipe Scolari"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlo_Ancelotti", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carlo Ancelotti"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J\u00fcrgen_Klopp", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pep_Guardiola", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pep Guardiola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/fergie-villa.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548761", "eventUri": "eng-9548761", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3725490196078431, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

Here is the full match report.\n\nAston Villa bowed out of the Europa Conference League after failing to overcome Olympiacos in Piraeus.\n\nThe Midlands club arrived in Greece needing to overturn a two-goal deficit having lost 4-2 at Villa Park but things went from bad to worse after Ayoub El Kaabi scored 11 minutes in to stretch his side's lead to three goals.\n\nCheck out our other stories here:\n\nRashford and Martinez back in training for Manchester United\n\nFive unlucky stars snubbed in Premier League Player of the Season\n\nVinicius Junior focused on Real Madrid amid Ballon d'Or claims\n\nLeon Bailey and Matty Cash had Villa's best opportunities of the first half but it appeared to be a frustrating night in front of goal.\n\nOlympiacos were happy to sit back and absorb the pressure and they looked incredibly dangerous on the counter-attack.\n\nTheir third came from another long ball over the top, with El Kaabi beating Villa's formidable offside trap and bearing in on goal, finishing past Emiliano Martinez with ease.\n\nIt was another impeccable performance from the Greek side who had their opponent's number across both legs.\n\nThey will go on to face Fiorentina in the final on 29 May.\n\nIt was going to need a quick start from the Villa boys if they were to overturn the huge deficit and they got straight onto the front foot in the opening 10 minutes.\n\nOllie Watkins got on the end of a dangerous cross and looked to steer his header into the top corner but for some brilliant defending from David Carmo to nick the ball away at the last moment.\n\nAs expected, Olympiacos were opting to sit with most of their team behind the ball and hit on the counter-attack and they did exactly that 11 minutes in.\n\nEl Kaabi - who scored a hat-trick in the first leg - managed to put the ball in the net for the opener despite scuffing his strike from a Quini cross.\n\nIt was Daniel Podence on loan from Wolves who started the attack, threading the ball through to the full-back who had no problem picking out the only red and white shirt in the box.\n\nWhat was always going to be a tough night for the Premier League side got tougher with the goal against the run of play but it was early enough in the game to leave Villa with some hope that they could somehow pull off a miracle.\n\nThey did fight back following the opener although there was some concern for Leon Bailey who was caught on an already strapped-up knee on the edge of the box, presenting the visitors with a free-kick in a dangerous opportunity.\n\nDouglas Luiz stepped up but had no real power or precision on his strike.\n\nKostas Fortounis was teed up at the other end by Podence and his first-time strike looked destined for the bottom corner but for a good save from Emiliano Martinez.\n\nFor all of Villa's possession, they were struggling to break Olympiacos down.\n\nMatty Cash had a good chance after the ball was played across the box to him but he lost his footing and was unable to turn it home to reduce the deficit.\n\nBailey's fierce strike was the last good chance of the first half and the Jamaican forced a good save out of Konstantinos Tzolakis, who tipped the ball around the post.\n\nEmery made changes for the second half with Jhon Duran coming on in place of Moussa Diaby.\n\nThe striker almost had an instant impact after driving into the box and firing towards goal, causing the keeper to spill his shot but Olympiacos were able to clear their lines.\n\nThe home side had their third with ten minutes to go, with no way back for Villa after El Kaabi drove in on goal and fired past Martinez.\n\nIt was another long ball over the top for the striker who had the pace over Villa's defenders and he gave the World Cup-winning goalkeeper the eyes before sending his shot in the opposite direction.\n\nFor as dominant as Villa were, Olympiacos were good value for their win, with the English side unable to ever get going away from home.\n\nThey were content to just go through the motions in the final few minutes and Emery threw on a few youngsters for good measure.\n\nTzolakis was never really tested by anyone in blue and he was more than happy to join in with the celebrations as the final whistle went.\n\nOlympiacos march on to the final in their native homeland with the match being held at AEK Arena in Athens, which is about 15 kilometres away from their home ground.\n\nThey will face Serie A side Fiorentina who are looking for revenge having lost to West Ham in the final last season.\n\nVilla will return to Premier League action on Monday, they welcome Liverpool in their penultimate game of the season with the chance to confirm their place in the Champions League for 2024-25.\n\nShould Tottenham lose to Burnley on Saturday, the result against Jurgen Klopp's Reds will not matter as the North London club will no longer be able to close the seven-point gap.\n\nIt would likely put the painful Conference League loss out of their minds and the prospect of playing in Europe's most elite competition is a brilliant result for Unai Emery and Co.", "source": {"uri": "101greatgoals.com", "dataType": "news",

In fact, Iborra was even present in each of Emery's squads to have won the UEFA Europa League title, three times with Sevilla and once with Villarreal having reunited with him following a spell at Leicester City.\n\nHis experience has been key for Olympiacos during their turnaround under Jose Luis Mendilibar, who won the Europa League with Sevilla last season, but Iborra claims what he himself has won in the past will have little bearing on Thursday night's Europa Conference League semi-final second leg against Villa.\n\nREAD | Emi Buendia nears Aston Villa return after major injury update\n\nREAD | Four reasons for Aston Villa optimism and why they can reach Europa Conference League final\n\n\"It means nothing to win things in the past,\" he claimed. \"It is very important to win this trophy. It is the first time for the club to go this far and I want to celebrate with everyone. We have to use passion, desire and the thirst to add to our history. We want to celebrate with them [the fans].\"\n\nOlympiacos host Villa at the Karaiskakis Stadium with a two-goal advantage having won the first leg 4-2 at Villa Park last week. Iborra insists that Emery will have full belief that his players are fully capable of going through to the final despite their uphill task.\n\n\"How he boosts his team will be his main thing,\" Iborra said of Emery. \"You need little help to get motivated for a European semi-final. He will mainly emphasise on breaking details down and making sure everything is under control.\n\n\"He will convert his plan and anticipate what will happen in the match. Tactics will be the focal point, not just to boost their mood and give them incentives. Himself and his staff break the details down and they will do this to prepare for tomorrow. They will have to try a bit more because of the first leg result. Emery will concentrate most of his time on tactics.\n\n\"We don't know how they will play and they don't know how we will play. We will see how it turns out on the pitch. Surprises happen in football. Unai, I'm sure he has studied every detail that could determine the outcome of the match. I'm sure they want to win and go to the final.\n\n\"I have learned many things from Mr Emery, but one thing I will never forget from him, in order to find yourself in a final, in order to experience this great moment in your lifetime, one truly has to want that, one has to long for it, I believe the team that makes it to the final will be the one who wants it the most, who will strive the most.\n\n\"You have to have a very positive outlook. They have great players, we have great players, we will do everything in our possibilities to make it. What matters is that we want it more.\"\n\nIborra added: \"It is one thing to be carried away, it's another thing to have the first-leg result in your mind. We will have it in our mind because the result was of our making, so it is important to consider.\n\n\"We want to go out and out-perform our opponents, score early. That should be a driving force to make it to the final. It is just one match we have to win to secure our position in the final.

Mart\u00ednez, who returned to training this week following a thigh problem, has travelled to Athens but Emery confirmed he will speak to the club doctor before making a final decision on the morning of the game. Robin Olsen will again deputise if Mart\u00ednez is not deemed fit enough to start.\n\nMart\u00ednez was withdrawn at half-time against Chelsea last month but the goalkeeper, whose penalty-shootout heroics in Lille helped Villa into the semi-finals, could make a timely comeback in Greece.\n\n\"I will speak with him and the doctor to see if he is 100% fit to play, but I believe in Olsen and I'm building the team, not just with the players in the starting XI,\" Emery said. \"If we did that we would be dead now because we've had a lot of players injured. If he is available 100%, he is going to play. If not, Olsen has played fantastic in the moments we have needed him.\"\n\nRelated: Brighton's Jo\u00e3o Pedro stuns Aston Villa to stall their Champions League charge\n\nEmery has stressed the importance of his players keeping their emotions in check when they face their \"biggest challenge\" of the season, as they seek to overturn a first-leg defeat to Olympiakos to reach a major European final for the first time since 1982, when they won the European Cup in Rotterdam. Villa, who trail 4-2, need to turn things around in Piraeus but Emery knows the severity of the test that awaits.\n\n\"The atmosphere, [Olympiakos fans] supporting the home team, it couldn't be more difficult,\" the Villa manager said. \"The supporters here push them a lot to help them. We have to focus on how we can react. We have to build a new experience with our players ... it is the biggest challenge we are going to face this year, playing here in a semi-final.\"\n\nEmery urged his players to learn from the first-leg defeat at Villa Park and maintain their focus, even if they concede early. \"That experience we had is very important and tomorrow we have to try to keep the balance even if we are not scoring, even if they are scoring 1-0 because in 90 minutes we can impose our plan and we can get chances and get clinical in one moment during the match,\" he said. \"We have to try and be competitive like they were at home against us. We have to be in the same idea, improving some things we didn't do like we prepared before.\"\n\nThe Olympiakos head coach, Jos\u00e9 Luis Mendilibar, who won the Europa League with Sevilla last season, cited his current side's 4-1 last-16 defeat at home to Maccabi Tel Aviv as a prime reason why they cannot assume the tie is over despite their two-goal cushion. Olympiakos won the return leg, played in Serbia, 6-1 to tee up this semi-final. \"This is quite a telling example, we have to be very focused, despite the fact we scored four goals at their home,\" Mendilibar said. \"Tomorrow's match is going to be different and we have to be concentrated and serious about it.\"\n\nOlympiakos are bidding to become only the second Greek team to reach a major European final since Panathinaikos in 1970-71. The final will be played across town at the Agia Sophia Stadium, the home of AEK Athens built in 2022, at the end of May.\n\nDouglas Luiz, the Brazil midfielder who has played 54 matches this season, said he hopes the season continues for a while yet. \"It is true that this season has been very difficult for us in terms of the amount of games, the lack of time to rest and the amount of games,\" Douglas Luiz said. \"It is a semi-final, an opportunity to bring Aston Villa into a final and to reach the final is something that brings extra motivation to keep fighting. I feel it will be a really special game for Aston Villa and I want to try my best to bring them all to the final.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo

Villa were eyeing a first European final since 1982, but like the ancient Acropolis in the background of the Stadio Georgios Karaiskakis, their hopes are now in ruins after a 6-2 aggregate defeat.\n\nVilla travelled to Athens needing a Herculean effort to overturn a 4-2 deficit from the first leg, but limped to a 2-0 defeat on the night, with last week's hat-trick hero Ayoub El Kaabi scoring the goals which sent the Greek side through to their first-ever European final.\n\nDespite their European dreams ending with a whimper rather than a bang, Aston Villa supporters have reflected on a tough season for their team as tiredness and injuries finally take their toll.\n\nREAD MORE: John Townley's player ratings as Villa are eliminated from Europe\n\nREAD MORE: Chris Heck makes Holte End point as he predicts future of Villa Park\n\nBut with the prospect of finishing the season in the Premier League top four still likely, Villa fans were feeling proud this evening. Here is what some of them have had to say on social media...\n\nDale Pomeroy: As gutting as it is, no one can take away the fact we played some of the most games this season. Unlike these teams we've been playing, our league doesn't give us weekends off to rest and prioritise European competitions. I'd take a semi-final loss and 4th place in the Prem any day.\n\nHolly: I'm trying to keep my chin up. This team have bought so much joy to me over the past season. Let's get that CL spot and I hope they all have a great summer. They deserve it.\n\nKieran: We can be proud, but conceding 6 goals to this side is nothing short of comical, no matter how you spin it.\n\nAndrew Julian: Think we have finally run out of players. Think we need City to beat Spurs as can't see us getting another point now this season. We are out on our feet.\n\nNick Moss: It's fair enough being (rightly) proud of our achievements this season, but it's also true that losing 6-2 to Olympiacos is embarrassing.\n\nLuke: The best season of my life. Always was going to be a struggle with the depth and injuries we have. Looking forward to what's to come, UTFV VTID\n\nJason Freeman: It's been a great journey - well done to all involved. We can't go through the next season with such a threadbare squad - a little more strength in depth and we'll be unstoppable.\n\nJohn Blewitt: A woeful semi final. Injuries and fatigue has played a part, plus really poor football at 2-2 at home. We need better quality in depth and better luck with injuries to compete on numerous fronts next season.\n\nJames Hale: It wasn't to be, but what a season we have had. We will learn from this and go again next season with more depth to our squad. Proud of my team.\n\nStan86: Congrats to Olympiacos.

One more win, or one more defeat for Tottenham, will seal Champions League football next season.\n\nAnd while recent injuries to Emiliano Martinez, Youri Tielemans and Morgan Rogers have Villa sputtering and lighter than they have been all term, there has been a weekly relief since mid-April that Spurs have not taken advantage in the Premier League.\n\nSpurs seemingly took control of the top-four race when beating Villa 4-0 away in March, but a four-game losing run has since gifted the initiative back to Unai Emery's side.\n\nMost recently a 4-2 defeat for Spurs at Liverpool on Sunday came just hours after Villa lost at Brighton themselves, where Emery spoke of the need for rest and potentially leaving out players against Olympiakos, who they trail 4-2 on aggregate.\n\nThat home defeat to Olympiakos last week was another indication Villa are running out of steam, but Emery has been eager to impress that the club are progressing, even if a first major trophy since 1996 now appears out of their grasp.\n\n\"We have to try to understand our progress and our progression. Always I'm trying to learn with the players, with the club and try to use my experiences with them,\" Emery said.\n\n\"We're doing a very good season, enjoying Europe for the first time in a long time, we're in a semi-final, sometimes we're making some mistakes and losing. We have to think about the circumstances we have.\"\n\nFor Villa the task of reversing a two-goal deficit at Olympiakos seems possible only if they score the first goal.\n\nOlympiakos won their previous home tie in the quarter-final 3-2 against Fenerbahce - then sneaking through on penalties - but Villa can take solace from a wilder tie for their Greek opponents in the round of 16.\n\nOn that occasion, Olympiakos lost their home leg against Maccabi Tel Aviv 4-1 before remarkably turning it around with a 6-1 away win of their own - advancing 7-5 on aggregate.\n\nThe ebbs and flows of last week's first leg between Villa and Olympiakos therefore bring the promise of more goals and utter unpredictability as to the final score at the Georgios Karaiskakis Football Stadium on Thursday night, where 1,600 travelling supporters should be in attendance.\n\nThey head there carrying a slither of hope, but no more than that, having lost their grip early doors in their first European semi-final since 1982 last week.\n\nOlympiakos took a shock 2-0 lead at Villa Park, only for the hosts to respond either side of half-time through Ollie Watkins and Moussa Diaby.\n\nVilla were in the ascendency, believing at half-time and then buoyed further by that Diaby equaliser, but that lasted for all of four minutes as a penalty gifted Olympiakos their third as Ayoub El Kaabi completed an impressive hat-trick.\n\nDouglas Luiz would go on to miss a penalty of his own late on that would have made it 4-3, making Villa's mission in Greece that little bit harder.\n\nNevertheless, Villa will feel like going down fighting, and if the chaos of that first leg is anything to go by, nothing can be ruled out.\n\nThe dream is silverware at long last, but Olympiakos will be favourites to advance, knowing they have the shortest of trips should they make their first-ever European final. On 29 May, the Agia Sophia Stadium - home of rivals AEK Athens - plays host.\n\nVilla's chances of returning to Greece a second time are slim, but while their supporters wander Athens before heading to Olympiakos's stadium in Piraeus, they may as well offer a prayer to Tyche - the Greek goddess of success, fortune, and most importantly, luck.", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "inews.co.uk"}, "authors": [{"uri": "michael_hincks@inews.co.uk", "name": "Michael Hincks", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezri_Konsa", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ezri Konsa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympiacos_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympiacos F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Rogers", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Morgan Rogers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Luiz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Douglas Luiz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McGinn", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John McGinn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emiliano_Mart\u00ednez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Emiliano Mart\u00ednez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFL_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "EFL Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youri_Tielemans", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Youri Tielemans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-legged_tie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Two-legged tie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Villa_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aston Villa F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ollie_Watkins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ollie Watkins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton_&_Hove_Albion_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brighton & Hove Albion F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unai_Emery", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unai Emery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agia_Sophia_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agia Sophia Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moussa_Diaby", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moussa Diaby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayoub_El_Kaabi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ayoub El Kaabi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karaiskakis_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Karaiskakis Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fenerbah\u00e7e_S.K._(football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fenerbah\u00e7e S.K.

Mart\u00ednez, who returned to training this week after a thigh problem, has travelled to Athens but Emery confirmed he will speak to the club doctor before making a final decision on the morning of the game. Robin Olsen will again deputise if Mart\u00ednez is not deemed fit enough to start.\n\nMart\u00ednez was withdrawn at half-time against Chelsea last month but the goalkeeper, whose penalty-shootout heroics in Lille helped Villa into the semi-finals, could make a timely comeback in Greece.\n\n\"I will speak with him and the doctor to see if he is 100% fit to play, but I believe in Olsen and I'm building the team, not just with the players in the starting XI,\" Emery said. \"If we did that we would be dead now because we've had a lot of players injured. If he is available 100%, he is going to play. If not, Olsen has played fantastic in the moments we have needed him.\"\n\nEmery has stressed the importance of his players keeping their emotions in check when they face their \"biggest challenge\" of the season, as they seek to overturn a first-leg defeat to Olympiakos to reach a major European final for the first time since 1982, when they beat Bayern Munich 1-0 in Rotterdam to win the European Cup. Villa, who trail 4-2, need to turn things around in Piraeus but Emery knows the severity of the test that awaits.\n\n\"The atmosphere, [Olympiakos fans] supporting the home team, it couldn't be more difficult,\" the Villa manager said. \"The supporters here push them a lot to help them. We have to focus on how we can react. We have to build a new experience with our players ... it is the biggest challenge we are going to face this year, playing here in a semi-final.\"\n\nEmery urged his players to learn from the first-leg defeat at Villa Park and maintain their focus, even if they concede early. \"That experience we had is very important and tomorrow we have to try to keep the balance even if we are not scoring, even if they are scoring 1-0 because in 90 minutes we can impose our plan and we can get chances and get clinical in one moment during the match,\" he said. \"We have to try and be competitive like they were at home against us. We have to be in the same idea, improving some things we didn't do like we prepared before.\"\n\nThe Olympiakos head coach, Jos\u00e9 Luis Mendilibar, who won the Europa League with Sevilla last season, cited his current side's 4-1 last-16 defeat at home to Maccabi Tel Aviv as a prime reason why they cannot assume the tie is over despite their two-goal cushion. Olympiakos won the return leg, played in Serbia, 6-1 to tee up this semi-final. \"This is quite a telling example, we have to be very focused, despite the fact we scored four goals at their home,\" Mendilibar said. \"Tomorrow's match is going to be different and we have to be concentrated and serious about it.\"\n\nOlympiakos are trying to become only the second Greek team to reach a major European final, after Panathinaikos were runners-up in the 1970-71 European Cup. The final will be played across town at the Agia Sophia Stadium, the home of AEK Athens built in 2022, at the end of this month.\n\nDouglas Luiz, who has played 54 matches this season, said he hopes the season continues for a while yet. \"It is true that this season has been very difficult for us in terms of the amount of games, the lack of time to rest and the amount of games,\" the Brazil midfielder said. \"It is a semi-final, an opportunity to bring Aston Villa into a final and to reach the final is something that brings extra motivation to keep fighting.

Yet one wonders whether pictures of owner Evangelos Marinakis and his entourage signalling the 4-2 scoreline with their fingers might have done the rounds of the Villa dressing room this week.\n\nRegardless, Diaby is confident Unai Emery's team have what it takes to produce another memorable performance - in a season which has featured numerous - and overturn a two-goal deficit to reach the Europa Conference League final.\n\n\"We have the mentality of winners and I want to get to the final,\" he said. \"We've lost, OK, we've got a second leg there.

His second, ten minutes from time sparked a red and white party in the stands.\n\nAnd despite a spirited effort - Villa undoubtedly left it all out there on the pitch in Pireaus - it's now 28 years and counting since Brian Little led his club to triumph in the League Cup.\n\nOlympiakos themselves were looking to break a 53-year hoodoo for Greek clubs. Not since the 1971 European Cup final, when Ajax beat Panathinaikos have they landed any silverware.\n\nAnd what will make it sweeter for the fans of the club, based in Piraeus, is the fact that the final is being played at the home of rivals AEK Athens. There has been chatter in the capital about whether it can be moved.\n\nWith a two-goal advantage to protect from the first leg, the approach from the hosts, led by one of Emery's contemporaries - Jose Luis Mendilibar - would be key.\n\nIt quickly became clear that they would funnel back into a shape 30 yards from their own goal and look to hit Villa on the break. It was a tactic that worked well in the first leg.\n\nAnd it took just ten minutes for it to do so again. Mendilibar cracked the code at Villa Park in the first leg. Emery's team have prospered this year through playing a high line and challenging teams to break it.\n\nAston Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez sits dejected after Olympiakos' Ayoub El Kaabi scores the opener\n\nOlympiakos managed it through Ayoub El Kaabi - who grabbed a hat-trick inside an hour - with some intelligent running and with their first real charge forward, scored.\n\nIt owed plenty to former Wolves man Daniel Podence. A crossfield pass had set the little winger on his way down the left. He made tracks and his first cross was blocked the ball was returned to him.\n\nThis time, left-back Quini charged to support and a disguised pass to his colleague allowed the defender to cross to the far post where El Kaabi forced it over the line.\n\nA wave of euphoric relief swept around the stadium.\n\nDON'T SCRAP REPLAYS! Join our petition to keep the magic of the FA Cup alive!\n\nVilla's attacks became more frantic. As did the defending. A long-range Douglas Luiz effort was collected before Leon Bailey was taken out half-a-yard outside the area by Rodinen. Referee Felix Zwayer booked the defender but with Emery protesting furiously on the touchline, no further action was taken.\n\nBut while Villa continued to press for a route back into the game after the break, they failed to truly test Konstantinios Tzolakis in the hosts' goal. And with just over 10 minutes to go, all hope was gone when El Kaabi's effort - initially ruled out for offside - was given after a lengthy VAR check.\n\nEmery, acknowledging their race was run, then brought on a host of the club's talented youngsters.

Their so-often fruitful high line came unstuck when a VAR review deemed Ayoub El Kaabi onside as Olympiakos doubled their lead on the night in the 78th minute, rattling in from close range.\n\nLucas Digne lifted a cross straight down the throat of the Olympiakos goalkeeper Kostas Tzolakis at 1-0 down. Earlier in the second half Emiliano Mart\u00ednez and Douglas Luiz both sent simple passes straight out of play.\n\nEmery had raised the potential scenario of Villa conceding when discussing the psychology around the tie, stressing they would need to keep their counsel and retain confidence in the gameplan, but knew doing so made a tough task at the outset considerably harder.\n\nIt is fair to say Villa will be delighted to see the back of El Kaabi, who built on his hat-trick at Villa Park by opening the scoring after 10 minutes here. Daniel Podence hovered on the ball, waiting before rolling a pass into the overlapping Olympiakos left-back Quini, who sent a low cross into the box.\n\nEl Kaabi, who spent last season playing in Qatar, lurked at the back post, free from Pau Torres, and converted off-balance to register his 33rd goal in 52 appearances this season. The fit-again Mart\u00ednez, back after a thigh injury, dashed across his goal but the ball was already in the Villa net.\n\nFor Villa, it was a leg-up that only further empowered Olympiakos, now 5-2 up on aggregate and for only so long could Emery preach calm to his players from the sidelines. Olympiakos could smell their first major European final. If Villa had aspirations of a lighting-fast start and hacking away at the two-goal deficit evaporated, their problems soon multiplied.\n\nIt was always going to be an almighty challenge - Emery said this trip to Piraeus represented their biggest test of the season - and the excitable, boisterous locals hardly required extra motivation to make a din. Villa were booed by a vociferous home support the moment they emerged for the warmup and their every touch was jeered.\n\nWhen Villa's starting lineup was read aloud 10 minutes before kick-off, the stadium announcer's words were indistinguishable, drowned by the deafening noise.\n\nThe Olympiakos midfielder Chiquinho fired wide inside two minutes and though Ollie Watkins got a glimpse of goal soon afterwards, he was well marshalled by David Carmo, his header blocked.\n\nEmery made three changes from the first leg, Mart\u00ednez's return a major boost. He opted for a five-man defence with Matty Cash and Digne tasked with playing wing-back, Watkins a lone striker, supported by Moussa Diaby and Leon Bailey. Villa saw plenty of the ball but more often than not they were faced with 10 red-and-white striped shirts behind the ball.\n\nPanagiotis Retsos cut out a smart cross from Digne to avert danger midway through the first half and Douglas Luiz saw a shot dribble into the hands of Tzolakis. The closest Villa came to equalising in the first half was in the final of four minutes of stoppage time, Bailey sending a rasping left-foot shot at goal. Bailey's strike skidded off the right boot of Rodinei, who was earlier booked for a foul on the Jamaica forward, but Tzolakis pawed his effort over for a corner.\n\nEmery had limited options on the bench, with centre-back Cl\u00e9ment Lenglet the only outfield substitute over the age of 21.\n\nThe Villa manager introduced Jhon Dur\u00e1n before the hour mark and the midfielder Tim Iroegbunam midway through the second half in place of defender Diego Carlos but by then it was impossible to escape the sense they had left themselves to much to do.\n\nIroegbunam's first touch was to cannon a pass meant for Bailey straight out of play. Dur\u00e1n blasted a shot straight at Tzolakis and Watkins sent a header on to the roof of the net. Villa saw plenty of the ball but could not break Olympiakos's resistance.\n\nAt one point Podence stymied Villa's flow with a cynical tackle on John McGinn on halfway to abruptly halt a counterattack. At the other end Santiago Hezze could have killed the tie but failed to connect with an El Kaabi cross.\n\nThe Morocco striker El Kaabi would do the damage himself, racing on to a through ball and, not for the first time, displaying a clinical edge. \"Dear Aston Villa fans, please remain seated at the end of the match,\" said the stadium announcer approaching full-time. There was little chance of much else after this.", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Guardian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_fisher@theguardian.com", "name": "Ben

This trip will take the total distance travelled by Villans in the competition this season to over 12,000 miles - easily enough to get to Australia.To make all these matches from Poland to Bosnia some fans have taken extreme measures.\n\nSam Sheers, a homeless officer at Solihull Council, has taken on extra work to do it.She said: \"Every six weeks I basically work 24 hours a day just to be able to afford to pay for this.\n\nI've also bought extra annual leave from work because we don't just come out for two days, we have a little holiday while we're out here\".\"Was it worth it?

Have you tapped into that experience specifically?\n\n\"Experiences can always help, being successful or not. But we have to create and build a new way and we lost the first leg clearly.

This is the challenge tomorrow, the biggest challenge we are going to face this year, playing in this semi-final.\"\n\nHave you spoken to the players about that specific game 10 years ago against Betis?\n\n\"Not specifically about that moment, we are speaking about our experiences and how we reacted to losing some matches, even in PL or even how we reacted to CC or FA Cup or even how we reacted in conference league playing some matches. More thinking or something similar.\n\n\"Trying to prepare the match with them to try to help them with my expectation about how we can react tomorrow, with the result and emotions. It's a good moment to see how we can react, how we can focus on our game plan and how we can progressively do good things and the things we need to do and with the respect we have of them.\"\n\nIs it crucial that your players control their emotions?\n\n\"When we're losing we're making mistakes like other teams. Before the team we want to analyse and don't make mistakes, we made more mistakes than normal. Even doing mistakes we came back to draw when we were 2-0 but again we weren't progressing enough emotionally after our draw and they responded very well, scoring two more.\n\n\"Emotionally it's difficult to keep the balance because we were very excited and the match changed in a small minute. Tomorrow we have to keep the balance. In 90 minutes we can play imposing ourselves on the pitch and be clinical in one moment during the match and we have to try to be competitive like they were at home against us, we have to be in the same idea, improving some things that we didn't do.\"\n\nOlympiacos' Mendillabr and Iborra both know you well - will that impact the match?\n\n\"They know me and I know them. He is always a successful coach in Spain and the performance they get was I showed it always in his teams and Iborra competes fantastic, he's a very competitive man, he won my titles in the EL with me. I appreciate him a lot. He showed us how he is competing and be successful in Europe. We have to use our experiences as well. We have players like Carlos and players who have the capacity to grow up as a player playing in Europe for the first time this year.\"\n\nDid Olympiacos surprise you in the first leg?\n\n\"After the first leg they are favourite. It's not a surprise for me, everything I watched they delivered. It was how they were competing previously. They have more or less being successful in Europe and when we were playing 90 minutes there and some circumstances happened it was not a surprise but some circumstances against us we are always making some mistakes and they were clinical and they were very competitive and we couldn't stop them in some tactical ways that we usually can.\n\n\"Tomorrow is a challenge to be clinical and stop them and try and control them in 90 minutes and if we create chances and being clinical we could be close to draw the match and then hopefully it's going long more than 90 minutes would be good news for us.\n\n\"It has been tough and difficult but we have an amazing moment and I told the players this morning I want to enjoy more. I want to enjoy today and tomorrow and be motivated for tomorrow. I'm ambitious and very proud of how we've done this year, even when we have lost our reaction has always been fantastic and the players were following the messages.\n\n\"There are still matches to play and I will find the best performances tomorrow and really be competitive like we can, we weren't competitive like we can be in the first leg. We lost concentration and if we do that the same thing could happen. But we can react quick and in 90 minutes we have to be focused with everything tactically and control our emotions, set pieces, everything.\"\n\nWhat's the latest on Martinez?\n\n\"He's with us today. He was injured last week after the match against Chelsea. 10 days. Tomorrow I will speak with him and the doctor to see if he is 100% fit to play, but I believe in Olsen and I'm building the team not just with the players in the starting XI. If we did that we would be dead now because we've had a lot of players injured. Tomorrow if he is available 100% he will play but if not then he will play.\"\n\nVilla fans are all desperate for a trophy...\n\n\"We are in a process. We can be very demanding but never feel we are under pressure, we're in a process as a team and as a club. We enjoyed getting here and to win a trophy in Europe is very difficult and we can watch behind us. To get here is only when you're being consistent and successful. But if we don't win tomorrow the process is clear, how we're trying to get there is being demanding and be a contender for a trophy.\n\n\"Maybe we could be favourite before the first leg but then to show it on the field and they showed their power and how they want to be contender as well and they are favourite now. I'm very demanding and will prepare the match tomorrow to try and come back but we are not playing under pressure we are playing under our demands. We have to try and enjoy both competitions until we are finished, hopefully not tomorrow but if we do finish tomorrow we need to be proud.\"\n\nWhat do you make of Emery's comments?

The club had enjoyed European success during those years, though with the growing financial might of others meant the task of qualification was becoming no easier.\n\nSo, there was a decision to make when United and others swooped for his signature, and the rest is history. Appearing as a guest on Sky Sports Monday Night Football to analyse his former club's 4-0 loss to Crystal Palace, the winger-turned-full-back has just now disclosed some of the details around the move away from Villa Park.\n\nREAD MORE: Emi Martinez posts Instagram photo as Aston Villa sweat on injury for Olympiacos\n\nREAD MORE: Darwin Nunez sparks fan frenzy as Liverpool begin Aston Villa preparations\n\n\"I spoke to [chairman] Randy Lerner and he begged me to stay for my final season and said 'listen, if we don't do anything this season you have my blessing to go',\" he explained.\n\n\"To be fair, he was exactly right with what he said and I had so much respect for him. He even called me to come over and sit down with me. We were not able to get Aston Villa to where we felt we could have gone, and then I was able to move from there.\n\n\"I heard of United's interest the season before I left Aston Villa.\"\n\nAt this point regular pundit Jamie Carragher enquired: \"Did they [Man United] tap you up?\"\n\n\"No, definitely not,\" the 38-year-old replied. \"I'd heard of the interest and you hear from your agent talking about interest and there was interest from others as well.\n\n\"I tell you who did try to tap me up - Stevie [Steven Gerrard] tried to tap me up. He rang me up and said, 'are you leaving Aston Villa?' And I said yeah. He told me that I should come to Liverpool and I said 'yeah, I'll come back to you'. I had already spoken to United at that time and I was already going, so sorry Stevie.\"\n\nAs well as the former Villa boss up to behind-the-scenes tricks during his playing days, he revealed Manchester City made their interest known. \"But for me,\" Young concluded, \"the factor of going to Manchester United was the size of the club, and who I call the boss now, Sir Alex [Ferguson]. It was the pull and to be able to go and speak to him, he was the one who got me to the club. It was everything I wanted to hear and go and play for them.\"\n\nYoung went on to make 261 appearances for United over a nine-year period, winning six major trophies. He would depart for Inter Milan in 2020 before returning to Villa between 2021 and 2023, and is now part of Sean Dyche's Everton squad having moved to Goodison Park last summer.\n\nIs this a good explanation from Ashley Young?

I don't think we should ever leave. Villa Park is iconic.

We are going to put in rail seating and we're going to put in new seats, but we are not going to change any of the banners or anything else, other than just cleaning things up a little bit.\n\n\"Over the next two summers, we are going to continue to clean it up and reimagine all of our premium seating. We are working on a concert venue that is for pre- and post-game, and we're going to have an entertainment zone. You'll also have a new superstore. That's the vision.\"\n\nPressed again by Agbonlahor on the future of Villa Park, Heck added: \"I have spent time watching the Holte End every single game and it is truly extraordinary. What they bring to Villa Park makes this place so unique and so special, and what I've learned is that you know leave it alone.\n\n\"So we haven't had that conversation [about moving].

As a professional, he is an amazing character with us. It is hard to compete with the best goalkeeper in the world, but always he is ready, always he is positive and respectful with his situation.\"\n\nOn whether he can use his previous experiences of coming from two goals down in European games: \"Experience can always help you, being successful or not successful.

Whilst it was a move nobody from the West Midlands side wanted to see happen, the bargain has worked out well for all concerned as Villa raised \u00a3100m to fund a team now on the rise, Grealish has excelled personally as a footballer and Man City have dominated world football by winning the treble, UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup last year.\n\nHis form was originally questioned during a slow bedding in period but now 28-years-old, the attacking talent is in the peak years of his career and flourishing under the tutelage of Pep Guardiola. The current campaign has come with new injury problems, but not ones that tarnish his time in Manchester, Agbonlahor assesses.\n\nREAD MORE: Damian Vidagany fuels rumours of \u20ac60m Aston Villa summer transfer\n\nREAD MORE: Aston Villa must take note of Eddie Howe's warning with Champions League qualification in sight\n\n\"I look at when he left, I was devastated,\" the retired former Villa striker admitted on the Ben Heath podcast. \"I think he was devastated as well if I'm being honest, because it's one of them ones where you have to go. Even though you're Villa through and through, you can't turn down guaranteed trophies and that's what he's went and achieved.\n\n\"He's had a great start to his time there. A lot of people asked me a question of this season, how has he been and has he been at his best this season? He will say no, he found it hard with injuries and getting the same injury again. He'll look at [Jeremy] Doku coming in who has done well at times and his game this season has probably been spread out a bit more.\n\n\"What I say to people is knockout football, Real Madrid, who started both games? Jack. he's trustworthy, he plays the Pep way and I think he's enjoying his time there. He's playing with superstars.\n\n\"He knows at Villa he could go and receive the ball wherever he wanted, you can't do that with Pep. You've got your set way, set positions you've got to play in and he's gonna look back when he retires at this amount of league titles, he won the treble, playing regularly for England, so for me it has gone well for him.\"\n\nAcross his three years as a Man City player, he has made 125 appearances and in that time has registered 14 goals and 18 assists. He has an equal length of time remaining on his deal to replicate or better those numbers, having signed a six-year deal upon his arrival.\n\nGrealish would be 31 when the expiry date finally comes into view, so there will be a decision to make. Instead of renewing or seeking out fresh pastures, it is Agbonlahor's belief a return to Villa is on the cards as long as the conditions are right.\n\nHe stated: \"It wouldn't surprise me, him coming back. At a later stage in his career, depending on where Villa are at and where his feelings are, but he's definitely still Villa through and through. He will look back at amazing times at Villa, captained his boyhood club and went on to do amazing things with City.\"\n\nWould you like Jack Grealish to return to Aston Villa?

It was only during the season before that Eddie Howe was named manager and he was able to steer them away from relegation.\n\nThis rise was foreseen by all given the club's Saudi Arabian ownership, but not by any means at this rate. And so the Tyneside club embarked on their European adventure, only to see it ended at the first stage as part of a tough group containing eventual finalists Borussia Dortmund, plus Paris Saint-Germain and AC Milan.\n\nREAD MORE: Damian Vidagany fuels rumours of \u20ac60m Aston Villa summer transfer\n\nREAD MORE: Martinez, Tielemans, Rogers - Aston Villa injury latest and return dates ahead of Olympiacos\n\nReflecting on the experience speaking to Gary Neville on The Overlap, Howe explained: \"For us, fourth was never in our eyes last year - it was a case of could we build from the previous season? Could we continue to firstly not have a relegation battle on our hands and grow the team forwards?\n\n\"We hit fourth and when we hit fourth, it was almost a case of 'oh, we've climbed so quickly so early where do we go from here?'\"\n\nThis is the question Villa will be pondering themselves - almost certainly, at least - as Champions League qualification beckons for them. If Unai Emery's side win one of their remaining two fixtures whilst Tottenham Hotspur lose one of their three, then a place amongst Europe's elite for the first time since the competition's rebranding will be the reward.\n\nIt was only a few months after the Magpies began their stampede to fourth that Villa replaced Steven Gerrard in charge of a struggling team with their current manager, whose pedigree has elevated the club in a similarly short space of time.\n\nBut still using Newcastle as a marker, glory can come at a cost.\n\n\"For us we're hugely ambitious, never take a step back. It's like can we improve not so much on the league position, but in terms of our general performance,\" Howe reflected, before making further comment that Villa must take as a warning if heading into the Champions League. \"At times we have and at times we haven't this year, it has been quite up and down. December in particular was quite a difficult month for us but we managed to sort of weather that period.\"\n\nOver the festive period, a balance of league, European and cup action saw Howe's side enter a run of four wins in 13 matches. They crashed out of the Champions League and Carabao Cup, whilst severely falling behind in a race for Europa League qualification they are only now managing to salvage with little time remaining.\n\nHowe concluded: \"Since New Year I think we've done okay. We have been consistent in our own way and if we could maintain our position I think it would be a great season.\"\n\nVilla's task next season will also be made all the more difficult by a change in format to UEFA competitions. Group stages will now include eight matches, with a maximum number of 17 fixtures in the whole of the Champions League for a team that reaches the final including via a play-off round.\n\nThe challenge for the club will be to remain one step ahead of rivals like Newcastle, as well as Tottenham, Manchester United, Chelsea who all continue their rebuilding projects. Emery is thankfully a coach with vast European experience to call upon when traversing this new ground, but this reflection from a fellow Premier League boss is one certainly worth listening to.\n\nWill Aston Villa wrap up Champions League qualification ahead of Spurs?

When the trailing team is away in the second leg, they are scarcer still.\n\nOnly once, for example, has it been achieved in the Europa League but that single case, from Villa's perspective, provokes optimism.\n\nA decade ago Sevilla lost 2-0 at home to city rivals Real Betis in a last-16 tie but came back to win the second leg by the same scoreline and go through on penalties. Sevilla's manager that night? Unai Emery, of course.\n\nThrow in the fact Olympiacos themselves pulled off one of the biggest fightbacks in the history of European competition less than two months ago, after losing the first leg 4-1 at home to Maccabi Tel Aviv and you can understand why many observers, despite the statistics, suspect this Europa Conference League semi-final tie is far from over.\n\n\"Experiences can always help, being successful or not. But we have to create and build a new way and we lost the first leg clearly,\" said Emery in Greece last night.\n\n\"Tomorrow will be difficult to come back but we must play tomorrow thinking to stand after the first 90 minutes, the game plan we had didn't work well but tomorrow I expect to do better.\n\n\"It's going to be very difficult here with the atmosphere. It could be more difficult with the supporters pushing a lot but focusing like we can with my experience before and building a new experience here with our players and idea and our experiences this year.\n\n\"This is the challenge tomorrow, the biggest challenge we are going to face this year, playing in this semi-final.\"\n\nConcern for Villa can be found in some rather average away form through the competition.\n\nTake out the 5-0 qualifying round cruise at Hibernian and Emery's team have won just one of five matches on their travels, albeit in emphatic fashion 4-1 at AZ Alkmaar.\n\nOtherwise there was a 3-2 defeat at Legia Warsaw, in an atmosphere similar to the one they will face tonight, a 1-1 draw at Zrinjski Mostar, admittedly with a changed starting XI, along with an uninspiring 0-0 at Ajax and last month's 2-1 defeat in Lille when they were a whisker away from going out before Matty Cash's late goal levelled the tie on aggregate.\n\nEmery views the latter as an example of his team's strong mentality and said he had spoken to his team about the other occasions this season they have bounced back from adversity.\n\n\"We are speaking about our experiences and how we reacted to losing some matches,\" he said. \"Even in Premier League or even how we reacted to going out of the Carabao Cup or FA Cup, or even how we reacted in the Conference League playing some matches.\n\n\"I am trying to prepare the match with them to try to help them with my expectation about how we can react tomorrow, with the result and emotions. It's a good moment to see how we can react, how we can focus on our game plan and how we can progressively do good things and the things we need to do and with the respect we have of them.\"\n\nPerhaps the biggest question which surrounds Villa is whether, after a gruelling season which has already see them play 53 matches and cope with chronic injury troubles, they have the energy for the kind of big performance.\n\nBrazil international Douglas Luiz, who has played 54 times for club and country, admitted it has not been easy in recent weeks but added: \"It's a semi-final and a chance for a final and that gives us extra motivation.\n\n\"It's a plus for us and we need to keep fighting. I'm also grateful to Villa for giving me the chance to play in the Premier League and every time I get on the pitch I want to show how grateful I am.\n\n\"Tomorrow is a really special game and I want to do my best to get them to the final.", "source": {"uri": "expressandstar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Express & Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_maher@expressandstar.com", "name": "Matt Maher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unai_Emery", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Unai Emery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_Conference_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa Conference League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maccabi_Tel_Aviv_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Maccabi Tel Aviv F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sevilla_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sevilla FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympiacos_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympiacos F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Betis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real Betis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AZ_Alkmaar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AZ Alkmaar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legia_Warsaw", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Legia Warsaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hibernian_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hibernian F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Greece"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Greece"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Luiz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Douglas Luiz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFL_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "EFL Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H\u0160K_Zrinjski_Mostar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "H\u0160K Zrinjski Mostar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matty_Cash", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matty Cash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lille_OSC", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lille OSC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-legged_tie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Two-legged tie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Ajax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AFC Ajax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FA Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brazil national football team"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.expressandstar.com/resizer/5wEDmA0B8G5IS9UxrmMCqwdcBr8=/1200x800/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/mna/SLQKTD7LG5DLDADN4MSV5XDXRA.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548761", "eventUri": "eng-9548761", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

Maybe they were tired.\n\n\"I can understand better than a lot of other people because they played on Thursday evening.\n\n\"They are playing in the Premier League and the Conference League and they have a lot of injuries.\n\n\"For that, I think they could not be the true Aston Villa.\n\n\"We are suffering in the last two months because we wanted to have different results from Rome until now.\n\n\"We can see Aston Villa paid what we are paying from Rome - and before Rome.\n\n\"From October, November, we are playing without seven, eight, sometimes ten, like today, injured players.\n\n\"For Brighton it is so tough to compete without this number of injured players.\"\n\nAn Aston Villa reporter waiting for a player interview at the Amex felt it was the first time he had seen the team looking jaded this season.\n\nIt was the first time he could remember the effects of a Thursday night being seen the following Sunday afternoon.\n\nWhich perhaps, in turn, throws some credit back on Albion and De Zerbi.\n\nThey made a team who never look tired look tired Villa did not lose only because they had played on Thursday. There was more to it than that.\n\nIt was, in fact only their second defeat in 13 games which have quickly followed a European commitment on the Thursday.\n\nThe previous was way back in early season, when they went down 3-0 at Anfield after the formality of the second leg of their qualifying round at home to Hibs.\n\nIt is a record made even better by the fact most of those Prem games in question have been away from home.\n\nThey won 2-0 at Arsenal three days after the first leg of their quarter-final with Lille.\n\nThe 1-0 success at Chelsea was on a post-Euro Sunday.\n\nAt home, they have won three out of four such fixtures. The exception was a 4-0 defeat by Tottenham just after they had drawn 0-0 at Ajax.\n\nVilla's post-Europe record is seven wins, four draws and two defeats from 13 games, so a shade under two points per game.\n\nAlbion took nine points from seven such fixtures, of which five were at home.\n\nVilla have greater resources than the Seagulls.\n\nIt is probably fair to suggest they have had less demanding European opposition.\n\nAnd they have the greater experience in the technical area of guiding a club through those challenges in Unai Emery.\n\nDe Zerbi has made it clear he needs to learn as well.\n\nHe has not only put the onus on his chairman, although that was the headline-grabbing bit.\n\nSpeaking last Friday, he said: \"I have learned a lot of things. You can learn in every day and every situation, when you win or when you lose. But I think when you lose the improving you make is more important, it's stronger.\"\n\nHe made the point a few weeks ago that Premier League clubs under-perform in Europe because of the intensity of domestic competition.\n\nIt was an argument spelt out by Jurgen Klopp last week.\n\nSo, when he made his point against Villa early in his press conference, it was to underline, not undermine. The plan now must be to reap rewards of that hard-gained experience next season.", "source": {"uri": "theargus.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Argus"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_De_Zerbi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Roberto De Zerbi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Villa_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aston Villa F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Bournemouth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AFC Bournemouth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falmer_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Falmer Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympiacos_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympiacos F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sky Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brighton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brighton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lille_OSC", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lille OSC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unai_Emery", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Unai Emery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Ajax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AFC Ajax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hibernian_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hibernian F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.theargus.co.uk/resources/images/18056465/", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548761", "eventUri": "eng-9548761", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

His boss enrolled him in the academy, which teaches legacy owners and managers best practices for running a dealership.\n\n\"It's something I've wanted to do for a long time -- the ability to add to my list of accomplishments, the knowledge from all the instructors -- and then I always hear about the connections people make in class and the kind of lifelong friendships people lean on for information,\" said Villa, 42. \"I was really looking forward to that.\"\n\nVilla, sponsored by his bosses, is partly through the yearlong program. When he is in Virginia for an NADA Academy session, he stays at a nearby hotel with other classmates. He expects classes for his group to be done in October. Class subjects run the gamut, and sessions about technology cover practical areas such as inventory metrics, website efficiency and dealer marketing, he said.\n\nLike many in auto retailing, Villa grew up in the industry.\n\nHis grandfather Anthony Villa owned a used-car lot and body shop. His father, Fred Villa, and uncle Jim Dieffenwierth were both dealers. Twin brother Jason is general manager at a suburban Dallas Volkswagen store, and sister Toni Villa is a finance director at an Oklahoma dealership.\n\nJustin Villa hopes to take the skills he learns from the NADA Academy and use them to boost the success of the dealership and eventually run multiple stores with a better awareness of how all the different parts of the business work together. As much as he learned from family, Villa said the academy takes it to a different level.\n\n\"You get the ability to learn from other people who are at the top of their game,\" he said.\n\nThe program also helps to spur creativity, Villa said.\n\n\"It's a chance to break the cycle and get some fresh ideas,\" he said. \"I look at it as a tremendous opportunity.\"", "source": {"uri": "autonews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Automotive News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_hollmer@autonews.com", "name": "Mark Hollmer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democratic_Alternative_(Serbia)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Democratic Alternative (Serbia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nissan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Automotive industry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hotel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toni_Villa", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toni Villa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volkswagen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Retail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oklahoma"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Online_Training", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Online Training", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Marketing_and_Advertising", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Marketing and Advertising", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Machine_Learning", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Software", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Software", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Education_and_Training/Education", "label": "dmoz/Business/Education and Training/Education", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://s3-prod.autonews.com/s3fs-public/styles/1024x512/public/JUSTIN-VILLA-MAIN_i.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548761", "eventUri": "eng-9548761", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 126, "relevance": 1}

in Greece", "body": "ASTON VILLA'S great European adventure was left in ruins here in Athens as England's last remaining hope finally bowed out.\n\nThe Premier League may be the greatest show on earth but there will be no English representation at any of Uefa's three showpiece finals.\n\nDespite enjoying the vast bulk of possession this was one match too many for the Spaniard's weary squad.\n\nWhile Olympiakos were given the weekend off, Villa lost at Brighton and looked leggy here.\n\nAnd so, just a stone's throw from the ancient ruins of the Acropolis and the Parthenon Villa's Euro dream turned to rubble.\n\nOn Monday night it's Liverpool when they will hope to summon up the energy to seal fourth place and Champions' League football.\n\nBut they will need to get off their knees to do so after this gut-wrenching disappointment.\n\nAll credit to Olympiakos, who have waited 53 years to finally end their fierce city rivals Panathinaikos' boast of being the only Greek club to reach a major European final.\n\nBEST FREE BET SIGN UP OFFERS FOR UK BOOKMAKERS\n\nFerenc Puskas's Pana lost 2-0 to Johan Cruyff's Ajax at Wembley in 1970-71 and Jose Luis Mendilibar's men were determined to eclipse that - especially with this month's final taking place in Athens.\n\nOlympiakos' Under-19's showed the seniors the way by beating AC to win the UEFA Youth League - the first Greek club side to win any UEFA tournament.\n\nAll the stars now appear to be aligning for the hosts who will face Fiorentina in the final.\n\nVilla had hoped the Greeks two-goal first-leg lead might make them over-cautious - or better still, complacent.\n\nSadly, that wasn't the case as Olympiakos, roared on by their frenzied fans, seized control of the tie by grabbing the early goal they craved.\n\nThe sight of Emi Martinez taking his usual place between the sticks was a welcome one for the 1,600 travelling army of Villa fans, as was the return of Pau Torres and Diego Carlos in defence.\n\nBut there was an early scare for the visitors when the ball glanced off Diego Carlos's head from an Olympiacos throw and landed at Chiquinho who slashed his shot into the side netting.\n\nVilla responded by pressing Olympiakos back and they forced a hat-trick of corners which all fizzled out.\n\nThen came the moment Emery must have dreaded as Olympiakos picked his side off on the counter-attack - just as they had at Villa Park.\n\nOnce again Villa's high backline imploded as one long ball out of defence picked out Daniel Podence on the left.\n\nHis initial cross was blocked by John McGinn but the ball flew back to the former Wolves man who fed overlapping left back Quini.\n\nHe drilled in a low cross and Pau Torres failed to cut out the threat.\n\nUnfortunately the ball landed at the feet of the last man Villa wanted it to.\n\nDeadly hitman Ayoub El Kaabi had stunned Villa with a hat-trick in Birmingham and there was no way he was going to miss the open goal gaping in front of him.\n\nHe calmly slotted home his 31st goal of the season to break Villa's hearts again.\n\nEmery's team now needed three goals just to force extra-time!\n\nOllie Watkins and Leon Bailey both had shots blocked by a red and white wall of defenders.\n\nDouglas Luiz's long ranger lacked the power to trouble Kostas Tzolakis in the Greek goal and Bailey headed over at full stretch.\n\nVilla were having plenty of possession - 75% in a dominant first period - but Olympiakos were digging in, encouraged by their fanatical fans and ultras.\n\nRodinei crashed into Bailey at the edge of the box but Douglas Luiz curled his free kick well over.\n\nMartinez held Fortouni's 25-yarder before a moment which summed up Villa's first 45 minutes.\n\nWatkins fed Bailey who played in a tempting low delivery but Matty Cash stumbled in front of a gaping goal.\n\nWhen your luck's out, it really is out!\n\nBailey then crashed in a ferocious effort which Tzolakis pushed over and a frustrating half ended with a booking for Douglas Luiz for hauling down Fortounis.\n\nThe locals have a tradition of smashing crockery and Emery must have been tempted to hurl a few tea cups at the break.\n\nHis side certainly continued to fight.\n\nWatkins headed over before Emery sent on striker Jhon Duran for Diaby.\n\nThe Colombian kid fired in a shot which Tzolakis spilled before Konsa headed over from a Bailey corner.\n\nHowever Villa's night of misery was complete when El Kaabi raced clear onto a long clearance from Tzolakis to beat Martinez.\n\nAt first glance the Moroccan looked well offside but after a lengthy VAR check the Stadio Karaiskakis erupted as Konsa was judged to have marginally played him onside and the goal was awarded.\n\nIn truth Villa simply couldn't turn silver into gold at the birthplace of the Olympics.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "graeme_bryce@thesun.co.uk", "name": "Graeme

Finishing in the top four guarantees a spot in Europe's elite and most lucrative club competition and would mark a major step forward for the club, which is preparing to mark its 150th season anniversary.\n\n\"We're knocking on the door of the Champions League. That level is where we want to be and that's where we want to stay,\" added Heck, who previously held senior roles at the Philadelphia 76ers basketball franchise and the New York Red Bulls soccer team.\n\nAlthough the club narrowly avoided relegation in 2020, it has since re-established itself as a force to be reckoned with.\n\nLed by Spanish head coach Unai Emery, who signed a new contract at the club last month, Villa for now, is the last English men's team standing in any European competition this year. In the Uefa Europa Conference League, the club will on Thursday try to overturn a 2-4 deficit from the first leg of the semi-final against Greek team Olympiacos.\n\nQualification for the Champions League is the big prize for Villa, boosting its revenue growth and pitting the club against European heavyweights such as Real Madrid and AC Milan. Villa won the European Cup, the precursor to the Champions League, in 1982.\n\nSpeaking at the club's new London offices, Heck said it was vital to increase revenues to compete, highlighting opportunities in merchandise, sponsorship and expanding the club's home stadium from roughly 42,600 seats to about 50,000.\n\nLast month, Villa said that betting brand Betano would replace BK8 as its front-of-shirt sponsor from next season. Heck declined to comment on the value of the sponsorship but the new deal is worth about \u00a320mn a year, according to a person briefed on the matter, up from about \u00a38mn previously.\n\n\"If we're not generating the revenue we're not able to play in the game,\" Heck said. \"I have an opportunity to flip the switch: globalisation of the club and the brand.\"\n\nClubs are under pressure to increase their commercial revenues to stay in line with financial regulations that the Premier League is now enforcing vigorously.\n\nVilla has proposed an increase to the losses allowed under the league's profitability and sustainability rules, from \u00a3105mn to \u00a3135mn over three years, according to a person with knowledge of the club's position. Heck declined to comment.\n\nThe loss limit, which allows exceptions for investments such as infrastructure and women's football, had not been updated to take into account inflation since it was introduced in 2013, according to people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nSeparately, the UK government also plans to introduce an independent football regulator for English football because of the scale of losses and reliance on owner funding throughout the game.\n\nVilla was in a financially precarious situation in 2018, when Edens and Sawiris took control. The following year, Villa earned promotion back to the Premier League having been relegated from the top flight of English football in 2016 for the first time since 1987.\n\nThe club, which is owned by V Sports, a joint venture between Sawiris and Edens, swung to a net loss of almost \u00a3120mn in the year to May 2023, from a small profit a year earlier. Revenues grew by more than a fifth to \u00a3217mn, powered by double-digit percentage increases across ticketing, broadcasting, sponsorship and commercial.\n\nHowever, the club's wage bill leapt by more than 40 per cent to \u00a3194mn, driving operating expenses to \u00a3357mn.\n\nV Sports, which also owns shares in Portuguese side Vit\u00f3ria, in December sold a minority stake to investment company Atairos, which has ties to broadcasters Comcast, NBCUniversal and Sky. The deal valued Villa at more than \u00a3500mn.\n\nAlong with the likes of Saudi-backed Newcastle United, Villa is now among the wider field of contenders for the top of the Premier League as well as for commercial deals.\n\n\"I actually like the term, 'the Great Eight', and you can decide who you want to throw in there with us\", Heck said, adding: \"I respect all of those clubs but that 'Big Six' name may go away sooner than you think.\"", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wes_Edens", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wes Edens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassef_Sawiris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nassef Sawiris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortress_Investment_Group", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fortress Investment Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Villa_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aston Villa F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_City_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester City F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_Conference_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa Conference League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unai_Emery", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unai Emery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympiacos_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympiacos F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Red_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Red Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A.C._Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A.C.

He told The Financial Times: \"I came down here to kick the door down of the Big Six and be a part of something that is really special.\"\n\nUnder Egypt's wealthiest individual, Nassef Sawiris, and US billionaire Wes Edens, Villa is fiercely competing for a place among the elites. Positioned fourth in the Premier League table, Unai Emery's side eyes qualification for the UEFA Champions League.\n\nIt is a milestone that would signify a significant breakthrough for the club as it approaches its 150th season anniversary. Heck emphasizes their aspiration, stating, \"We're knocking on the door of the Champions League. That level is where we want to be and that's where we want to stay.\"\n\nThe team may have escaped relegation in 2020 by the skin of its teeth. However, it has since regained its prominence. Villa is now the only English side that has made it to the semifinals in any European tournament this campaign.\n\nThursday will see the club's attempt to recover from a two-goal deficit in the first leg of the UEFA Europa Conference League semifinal vs Olympiacos of Greece. But the main objective for Villa will be to qualify for the Champions League via a fourth-place finish in the Premier League.\n\nMatching up against European powerhouses like Real Madrid and AC Milan will help the club's income growth. In 1982, Villa won the European Cup, the predecessor to the modern Champions League.\n\nA key aspect of their strategy involves revenue growth, crucial for sustaining competitiveness in the modern soccer landscape. Heck has highlighted the importance of expanding revenue streams through avenues like merchandise, sponsorship, and stadium expansion.\n\nRecent partnerships include a lucrative deal with betting brand Betano. These underscore Villa's commitment to financial sustainability and global brand expansion. However, Villa faces financial challenges, notably navigating the stringent financial regulations of the Premier League.\n\nThe club has proposed adjustments to the league's profitability and sustainability rules, reflecting the evolving financial dynamics of football. Despite financial setbacks in the past, their valuation has soared.

In order to continue their rise, though, money inevitably must be spent.\n\nFFP rules dictate that Villa cannot spend freely, as they'd like to. Money must be raised and as the club's profile continues to grow on a global scale, the bigger the budget Emery will have.

We use the analogy with FFP that we have a train which is the football side, and a train on the business side.\n\n\"The train on the football side is going lightning fast and that's a good thing. The business side has to catch that train. We're working around the clock trying to do sponsorship deals, changing the stadium to be beneficial to Financial Fair Play, find new revenue streams, take in our merchandise in-house and things of that nature.\n\n\"The growth of sponsorship has doubled, in the sense of our three big assets - the front of shirt, the kit provider and the sleeve sponsor. Those deals are massive. We're really excited about getting those deals going in the summer, and we'll have a foundation to build on this business with those sponsors. As we add on more sponsors, we add on more nuances with the stadium and premium seating and merchandising.\n\n\"It's been a learning experience. I do a lot of listening and there's still more to come from the listening factor. It's been a lifetime of thrills, of watching this team evolve and this coach orchestrate something really special, and getting to appreciate how unique our fans are. They're like no other.\n\n\"Nassef Sawiris and Wes Edens have set their sights on the top. We've been talking about how our performance has been amongst the best, not only in the Premier League but in the world. That isn't something that is a one and done - it's a long-term plan. Unai is executing that plan. Our players are playing magnificent football and we need to follow that trend on the business side and continue to support them. Their growth and success has been so strong and earlier than we expected.\"\n\nVilla supporters were the subject of a 15% increase in season ticket prices last summer, something which produced plenty of disgruntlement initially from supporters who eventually sold out the tickets by mid-July, as the club sought to raise funds in-keeping with FFP rules.\n\nDo you believe Villa will progress to the final?

battling for Aston Villa teenager?", "body": "An Aston Villa prospect is reportedly attracting widespread interest from Germany ahead of next season.\n\nThe West Midlands outfit have had one of the best academy setups in the Premier League for some time, mixing using the talent in their senior ranks and cashing in some starlets to bolster their financial position.\n\nAs well as Carney Chukwuemeka joining Chelsea in 2022 for a \u00a320m fee, Villa generated \u00a335m through the sales of Jacob Ramsey, Jaden Philogene and Cameron Archer during the last summer transfer window.\n\nMore recently, the likes of Kaine Kesler-Hayden and Tim Iroegbunam have been used in the first-team setup, as has winger Omari Kellyman.\n\nHowever, it appears that Villa are currently more inclined to allow another academy player go out on loan rather than remain at the club for 2024-25.\n\nBundesliga clubs admirers of Young\n\nAccording to Football Insider, there are clubs in Germany who hold an interest in loaning Kadan Young.\n\n\u00a9 Reuters\n\nWhile the 18-year-old is yet to make his debut under Unai Emery, the winger has been included in a number of first-team squads this season.\n\nIn terms of academy action, Young has made a total of 14 appearances across games in the U18 Premier League, Premier League 2 and the PL2 Playoffs.\n\nAlthough just one goal and two assists have come from those outings, Young has three strikes and six assists from 27 matches for Villa Under-23s.\n\nHe is also a four-cap England Under-17 international, each of his appearances coming at last year's Euro 2023 where he got on the scoresheet in the fifth-placed match against Switzerland.\n\nVilla prefer loan exit\n\nThe report claims that Young has already been told that he will spend next season plying his trade at another club.\n\nWith the consensus being that he is ready for regular first-team football, Villa must now find a team that can deliver on that front.\n\nRealistically, a lower-end Bundesliga outfit is the most likely option should the decision be made to facilitate a temporary switch to Germany.\n\nVilla do have a history of engineering successful loan stints in the Championship, an alternative that cannot be ruled out at this stage.\n\nID:543116:1false2false3false:QQ:: from db desktop :LenBod:collect4014:", "source": {"uri": "sportsmole.co.uk", "dataType":

Even UEFA's website summary stated \"Maccabi take full control of tie,\" after Eran Zahavi's brace and goals for Ido Shahar and Dor Peretz.\n\nAyoub El Khabi's goal gave Olympiacos at least something to cling to and the switching of the return leg to Serbia, necessitated by the conflict on the Gaza Strip, negated Maccabi's home advantage.\n\nEl Kaabi scored twice more, with Daniel Podence and Kostas Fortounis also on target as a reciprocal 4-1 win forced extra-time - where substitutes Stevan Jovetic and Youssef El-Arabi completed a 6-1 scoreline, a 7-5 aggregate and a stunning turnaround.\n\nManchester United v Paris St Germain, Champions League, 2019\n\nGoals from Presnel Kimpembe and Kylian Mbappe at Old Trafford had PSG on course for the quarter-finals, especially after United's France midfielder Paul Pogba was sent off in the closing stages and suspended for the trip to his homeland.\n\nRomelu Lukaku had other ideas, scoring twice in the first half-hour to sandwich Juan Bernat's goal for PSG and keep United in the tie. After Kimpembe was penalised for handball, Marcus Rashford stepped up in the fourth minute of stoppage time to beat Gianluigi Buffon from the penalty spot and send United through on away goals.\n\nThe only comeback from a two-goal home defeat in European Cup history was to no avail, though, as they lost 4-0 on aggregate to Barcelona in the last eight and had to watch rivals Liverpool go on to win the trophy.\n\nSevilla v Real Betis, Europa League, 2014\n\nEn route to their first of three straight Europa League titles, Emery's Sevilla trailed their local rivals 2-0 after first-leg goals from Leo Baptistao and, aptly enough, Salva Sevilla.\n\nThe short return trip to the Estadio Benito Villamarin brought a 2-0 win of their own, Jose Reyes and Carlos Bacca on target, before Betis' Alfred N'Diaye and Nono missed in the penalty shoot-out.\n\nWins over Porto, Valencia and Benfica, in another shoot-out in the final, marked the start of Emery's love affair with the competition.\n\nRare achievement\n\nOnly 16 teams have ever progressed in the Champions League, Europa League or Conference League after any first-leg loss at home.\n\nFiorentina overturned a one-goal deficit to Basel in last year's Conference League semi-final with a 3-1 second-leg win, as did Sheriff against Partizan Belgrade earlier in the competition.\n\nAjax have twice achieved the feat in the Champions League but were also on the receiving end against Tottenham in 2019. Bayern Munich, against Inter Milan in 2011, and Paris St Germain in this year's quarter-final with Barcelona complete the list.\n\nThe most recent Europa League example was Bayer Leverkusen beating Monaco on penalties last season. Olympiacos came back from a 1-0 defeat to beat Arsenal on away goals in 2020 but suffered the same fate themselves against Metalist Kharkiv in 2012.", "source": {"uri": "irishnews.com", "dataType":

Even UEFA's website summary stated \"Maccabi take full control of tie,\" after Eran Zahavi's brace and goals for Ido Shahar and Dor Peretz.\n\nAyoub El Khabi's goal gave Olympiacos at least something to cling to and the switching of the return leg to Serbia, necessitated by the conflict on the Gaza Strip, negated Maccabi's home advantage.\n\nEl Kaabi scored twice more, with Daniel Podence and Kostas Fortounis also on target as a reciprocal 4-1 win forced extra-time - where substitutes Stevan Jovetic and Youssef El-Arabi completed a 6-1 scoreline, a 7-5 aggregate and a stunning turnaround.\n\nManchester United v Paris St Germain, Champions League, 2019\n\nGoals from Presnel Kimpembe and Kylian Mbappe at Old Trafford had PSG on course for the quarter-finals, especially after United's France midfielder Paul Pogba was sent off in the closing stages and suspended for the trip to his homeland.\n\nRomelu Lukaku had other ideas, scoring twice in the first half-hour to sandwich Juan Bernat's goal for PSG and keep United in the tie. After Kimpembe was penalised for handball, Marcus Rashford stepped up in the fourth minute of stoppage time to beat Gianluigi Buffon from the penalty spot and send United through on away goals.\n\nThe only comeback from a two-goal home defeat in European Cup history was to no avail, though, as they lost 4-0 on aggregate to Barcelona in the last eight and had to watch rivals Liverpool go on to win the trophy.\n\nSevilla v Real Betis, Europa League, 2014\n\nEn route to their first of three straight Europa League titles, Emery's Sevilla trailed their local rivals 2-0 after first-leg goals from Leo Baptistao and, aptly enough, Salva Sevilla.\n\nThe short return trip to the Estadio Benito Villamarin brought a 2-0 win of their own, Jose Reyes and Carlos Bacca on target, before Betis' Alfred N'Diaye and Nono missed in the penalty shoot-out.\n\nWins over Porto, Valencia and Benfica, in another shoot-out in the final, marked the start of Emery's love affair with the competition.\n\nBenfica v Ajax, European Cup, 1969\n\nThe Portuguese champions, featuring the great Eusebio, seemed to have taken control of their quarter-final by winning 3-1 in Amsterdam.\n\nBut Inge Danielsson followed up on his goal in the first leg with an early second in Lisbon and 21-year-old Johan Cruyff scored twice to make it 3-0 by half-time.\n\nBenfica did hit back through Jos\u00e9 Torres but lost a subsequent play-off in Paris 3-0.\n\nAjax were beaten 4-1 in the final by Milan but bounced back to win the cup three times in a row from 1971 to '74.\n\nRare achievement\n\nOnly 16 teams have ever progressed in the Champions League, Europa League or Conference League after any first-leg loss at home.\n\nFiorentina overturned a one-goal defi cit to Basel in last year's Conference League semi-final with a 3-1 second-leg win, as did Sheriff against Partizan Belgrade earlier in the competition.\n\nAjax have twice achieved the feat in the Champions League but were also on the receiving end against Tottenham in 2019. Bayern Munich, against Inter Milan in 2011, and Paris St Germain in this year's quarter-final with Barcelona complete the list.\n\nThe most recent Europa League example was Bayer Leverkusen beating Monaco on penalties last season. Olympiacos came back from a 1-0 defeat to beat Arsenal on away goals in 2020 but suffered the same fate themselves against Metalist Kharkiv in 2012.", "source": {"uri": "rte.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "RTE.ie"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Europa_Conference_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Europa Conference League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maccabi_Tel_Aviv_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Maccabi Tel Aviv F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unai_Emery", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Unai Emery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympiacos_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympiacos F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tel Aviv"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dor_Peretz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dor Peretz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karaiskakis_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Karaiskakis Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eran_Zahavi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eran Zahavi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-legged_tie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Two-legged tie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hat-trick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Villa_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aston Villa F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presnel_Kimpembe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presnel Kimpembe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Podence", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daniel Podence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Rashford", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Rashford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youssef_El-Arabi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Youssef El-Arabi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kostas_Fortounis", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kostas Fortounis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_kick_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penalty kick (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Football_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French Football Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sevilla_FC", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sevilla FC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gianluigi_Buffon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gianluigi Buffon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Ajax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AFC Ajax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Betis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real Betis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liverpool F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romelu_Lukaku", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Romelu Lukaku"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.L._Benfica", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S.L.

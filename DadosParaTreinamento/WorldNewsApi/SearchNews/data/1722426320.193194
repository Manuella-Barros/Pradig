{"id": 243339614, "title": "France Set For Most Feral Right-Wing Regime Since the Nazis", "text": "PARIS\u2014The French political system, casually referred to as the \u201cRepublic of Friends,\u201d is in the throes of one of its humiliating nervous breakdowns. Now, a few weeks before an estimated 15 million baffled visitors, 10,500 bemused athletes and more than a billion bewildered TV viewers tune into Paris for the Summer Olympics, there\u2019s an odds-on chance the government will be run by the sort of feral right-wing regime not seen in France since the Vichy administration ruled the country in cahoots with the Nazis between 1940 and 1944. Time and nostalgia are a double-edged sword in France. What ended here 80 years ago with 567,600 corpses has been resurrected with such fiendish intensity that President Emmanuel Macron immediately drew a line in the sand, scheduling needless legislative elections on June 30 and July 7. The Eiffel Tower is no longer the center of attention. Is Paris Burning? No, but Macron\u2019s surprise call to the ballot box has ignited the most ruthless firestorm I\u2019ve witnessed during my 35 years living here. In the event you dropped French class to avoid wrestling the language\u2019s 21 verb tenses, the most important linguistic law in the land of Brigitte Bardot, L\u00e9a Seydoux and Paul C\u00e9zanne is that the French, in principle, rarely distinguish between fact and impression. \u201cFrance is a relatively small and eternally quarrelsome country, fountainhead of political manias, militarily impotent, historically inglorious during the past century, democratically bankrupt, communist-infiltrated from top to bottom,\u201d was how William F. Buckley Jr., the French-speaking intellectual father of the Conservative cause, described the place. Buckley, like all visitors, loved the grub, but remained suspicious of an electorate that\u2019s grown into 50 million registered voters who reflect 99 separate political persuasions that we in the media for convenience identify as individual political parties. Three of France\u2019s rump ideologies (let\u2019s tag them center-left, center-right and center) have imperially managed the country alone or as a majestic ensemble for the past eight decades, each one altering their party\u2019s official name with the regularity of a parent who only changes a toddler\u2019s diaper when it stinks. Outside France, these clean ups\u2014calculated to make the public forget the previous stench and usher a new generation into fragrance-free voting booths\u2014are normally boring, perfunctory and less combative than serving a croissant baked by the Pillsbury Doughboy. Thanks to social media, youth unemployment, an uptick in asylum seekers, ballooning energy prices and oodles of nationalist right-wing cash, Macron is no longer the only politician with the regal ability to play Jupiter on TV. There are now a record 4,005 candidates running in the first round, with many fabled divinities to choose from. One of the new godlings is the extreme-right parliamentary candidate Guillaume Bigot, doppelg\u00e4nger of the fascist leader Marine Le Pen. The aptly-named Bigot over the years has accused his ideological rivals of being a \u201cmenopausal Greta Thunberg\u201d and an \u201cexpert in wet t-shirt competitions,\u201d respectively. \u201cI\u2019m here and I intend to stay,\u201d Bigot bullied. It\u2019s true, he isn\u2019t going away. Macron and his echo chamber of B\u00e9ni Oui-Oui (Yes Men) called the snap parliamentary vote because the collective right clobbered their friends in the recent European parliamentary elections. Under the 70-year-old ham-fisted management by the Le Pen family and their freshly minted 28-year-old TikTok superstar stuntman Jordan Bardella, France\u2019s collective right wing finished first in 93 percent of the country\u2019s 36,000 villages, towns and cities. Yet the bigots of France are different from their relatives in America and elsewhere. Le Pen and her collaborators are descendants of the jacqueries, 14th century peasant gangs who terrified Paris, burning, looting, raping women and torturing babies. The political turbulence, further fueled by the French Revolution, never really dissipated and eventually rematerialized as the strikes, boycotts, road barriers and car burnings that cause France Tourism Development Agency officials to hallucinate. \u201cOur ancestors beheaded a king for doing far less than those masturbators, fags, phonies and piles of shit are doing today,\u201d the far-right\u2019s revered forefather and 1956 Time magazine cover boy Pierre Poujade told his congregates. \u201cAfter the Liberation they closed all the brothels in France except the biggest one\u2014the National Assembly.\u201d French football megastar Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, currently playing in the European Championships in Germany, has asked his legions of fans to exorcize the country\u2019s primal demons and refuse to ratify the malignant history of fanaticism in France. \u201cI\u2019m calling to vote against extremists that want to divide the country,\u201d said the new Real Madrid recruit. \u201cI don\u2019t want to represent a country that doesn\u2019t represent my values.\u201d But the war-whooping from Le Pen\u2019s camp clearly indicates that violence is in the air. \u201cThe people who govern us and who hope to buy appeasement at the price of dishonor will reap both dishonor and civil war!\u201d is how Bigot\u2019s pinned Tweet describes the ideology he wants to bring to France\u2019s 577-member parliament. Gassing Jews is apparently back in vogue. \u201cGas rendered justice to the victims of the Shoah,\u201d enthused ultra-right candidate Joseph Martin. When asked about Martin\u2019s position, National Rally boss Bardella refused to remove his man from the ballot. And then there\u2019s this. The celebrated Nazi hunter and French moral beacon Serge Klarsfeld recently went on TV to defend Le Pen\u2019s party, which counts among its founders a former Nazi paramilitary soldier and Marine\u2019s father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, who got his start bushwhacking minorities as Poujade\u2019s bodyguard. This way for the gas chambers, ladies and gentlemen. Perhaps the American political lyricist H.L. Mencken was dead-on: The costliest of all follies is to believe passionately in the palpably not true. Indeed, the polls indicate Le Pen\u2019s awkward and aggrieved racist coalition\u2014along with the inventively loony left-wing anti-Israel alliance dubbed the New Popular Front\u2014is positioned to form a government that could defenestrate Macron\u2019s Ensemble! coalition in the 2027 presidential election. \u201cThe National Rally supports Jews, supports the state of Israel,\u201d Klarsfeld said. \u201cWhen there is an anti-Jewish party and a pro-Jewish party, I will vote for the pro-Jewish party,\u201d the 88-year-old said, explaining how a historian of the Holocaust could fall into line behind a party with such a wretched past. The French malaise, known locally as inquietude, is back in vengeance, and Macron is determined to obliterate those he sees as gormless vigilantes seeking to leech votes from the public\u2019s dissatisfaction, regardless of the political cost. If the National Rally and its mish-mash of candidates emerge as the largest party, as the polls suggest, Macron might be boxed into appointing a prime minister from the Le Pen camp, probably Bardella. \u201cWith the resurgence of fascism around the world, immediate actions must be taken to protect democracy, economic stability, individual rights and the global order, as imperfect as it might be,\u201d is how long-time Democratic Party political and policy advisor Peter Emerson in Washington soberly decodes Macron\u2019s provocative gambit to launch an unanticipated snap election as a full-frontal attack against Le Pen. Emerson reckons the biggest motivation behind Macron\u2019s surprise move was money; specifically, France\u2019s 154-billion-euro deficit and 3 trillion euros of debt. If elected, both political extremes say they\u2019ll greatly increase spending money the French Treasury doesn\u2019t have. The ratings agency Standard & Poor\u2019s gulped and, earlier this month, downgraded France as the risk of political instability rises. Moody\u2019s is considering a similar demotion in the coming weeks. \u201cI do not intend to hand the keys of power to the extreme right in 2027,\u201d Macron, who is term limited, blustered, referring to the next presidential election. But the polls indicate voters don\u2019t give a hoot what Macron, fretting Olympic officials or Wall Street hedge funders think. All the samplings pretty much agree the public has no interest in reigning in the deficit. Macron is running a distant third going into the first round, with Le Pen\u2019s populist federation ultimately positioned to score 225-250 seats in the National Assembly. The magic number for a fascist majority is 289. And yet the president still won\u2019t brand the lady and her cronies fascists. \u201cPresident Macron would never suggest that of Marine Le Pen,\u201d an \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace insider scoffs. He prefers to use the more gentle and euphemistic \u201cfar-right demagogue.\u201d Macron also warned that a far-left or far-right victory in the legislative election \"pushes people towards civil war,\" he said, adding that polices \"reduces people to their religion or their origin.\" And with the self-confidence of a 3-star Michelin chef staring into a tub of rancid Normandy butter, Macron served up a primetime TV performance seasoned with Francit\u00e9, the untranslatable, otherworldly ingredient that makes everything from a ubiquitous 20 cent wedge of Laughing Cow cheese to a $35,000 Herm\u00e8s Birkin Bag indefinably desirable. \u201cTo be French is to rise to the challenge of the epoch when necessary,\u201d Macron told the country. \u201cIt\u2019s to know what a vote is worth and how liberty feels; to act, whatever the circumstances, with responsibility is fundamentally to write history rather than be its victim. That moment is now.\u201d The moment was also reminiscent of a close encounter of the Francit\u00e9 kind I had in 2001 with French President Jacques Chirac at an award ceremony in the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace salon named after King Louis XV\u2019s chief mistress. \u201cI\u2019m genetically void of Francit\u00e9 and adamantly refuse to distinguish between masculine and feminine nouns,\u201d I told Chirac as we paced Madame de Pompadour\u2019s bedroom. \u201cSo why have you made me a chevalier in the French Order of Arts and Letters? Another one of your bureaucratic blunders?\u201d Chirac guffawed. \u201cYou comprehend French sensibilities,\u201d he explained, recalling the time he called his own snap election believing opinion polls that said his party would win. \u201cYou said that France is the only democracy where it\u2019s the voters who consistently lie to the politicians, and you are correct.\u201d Macron is gambling that\u2019s true.", "summary": "<figure><img src=\"https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1688,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_585/fl_lossy,q_auto/062824-france-hero_jrvkkv\"/><figcaption>Artur Widak/NurPhoto via Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>PARIS\u2014The <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/france\">French </a>political system, casually referred to as the \u201cRepublic of Friends,\u201d is in the throes of one of its humiliating<a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-let-them-eat-cake-legacy-of-emmanuel-macron?ref=author\"> nervous breakdowns</a>.</p><p>Now, a few weeks before an estimated 15 million baffled visitors, 10,500 bemused athletes and more than a billion bewildered TV viewers tune into Paris for the <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/olympics\">Summer Olympics</a>, there\u2019s an odds-on chance the government will be run by the sort of feral right-wing regime not seen in France since the <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/keyword/vichy-france\">Vichy administration</a> ruled the c", "url": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/france-set-for-most-feral-right-wing-regime-since-the-nazis", "image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1688,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1719513310/062824-france-hero_jrvkkv", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 05:12:22", "author": "A.

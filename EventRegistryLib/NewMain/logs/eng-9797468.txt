Reeves wants the UK market to achieve the scale of the megafunds operated in Canada by the so-called \"Maple 8\".\n\nThe chancellor said on Tuesday: \"The size of Canadian pension schemes means they can invest far more in productive assets like vital infrastructure than ours do.\" Achieving this consolidation is a key challenge for Reeves.\n\nFormer Conservative chancellor Jeremy Hunt also wanted to build a Canadian-style pensions model in Britain, but progress has been slow.\n\nReeves has announced a review, overseen by the new pensions minister Emma Reynolds, looking at how to achieve scheme consolidation and put pension funds to use in promoting UK growth.\n\nAn ally of the chancellor said a new pensions schemes bill would create a \"value for money framework\" to promote better outcomes for savers.\n\nThe chancellor has so far not supported \"mandating\" UK funds to invest in certain asset classes. Her allies said there was a \"live debate\" on the issue, but noted the fiduciary duty on schemes to invest on behalf of their members.\n\nReeves said last year, while in opposition, that regulators could intervene to force the merger of smaller schemes.\n\nShe said she believed retirement plans with less than \u00a3200mn in assets may be failing in their fiduciary duty to savers. \"It's hard to see how some of the smallest funds are delivering value for money,\" she added.\n\nBut translating the Canadian model, which includes the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan and Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec, may not be the panacea envisaged by politicians across the political divide in the UK.\n\nCanada's \"Maple 8\" funds are noted for their deployment of assets into infrastructure schemes across the world and Reeves has shied away from the idea of compelling UK funds to invest in Britain.\n\nTheir investment in \"productive assets\" has not always gone smoothly. In May, a Singapore-registered subsidiary of Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System that held a 31 per cent stake in Thames Water wrote off its investment in the troubled utility.\n\nBut Reeves told a round table of US investors in New York on Tuesday she wanted to see pension fund assets used to buy listed and unlisted equities as well as to back infrastructure projects, offering better returns to savers.\n\n\"I want British schemes to learn lessons from the Canadian model and fire up the UK economy, which would deliver better returns for savers and unlock billions of pounds of investment,\" she said.\n\nReeves will also meet Mark Carney, former Bank of England governor, in Toronto to discuss how best to deploy investment in Britain's clean technology sector.\n\nMeanwhile, the chancellor revealed that her set piece City of London speech at Mansion House in the autumn will focus on the partnership she wants to see between government, industry and regulators to deliver growth.\n\nSeparately, Reeves has in effect ruled out using her Budget in October to change the rules so that pensioners working beyond the state retirement age of 66 should pay national insurance contributions.\n\nThe idea has been mooted as a way for the chancellor to close a hole in the public finances but Reeves, speaking on her visit to the US and Canada, said there were \"no plans\" to make pensioners pay NICs.\n\nAllies of the chancellor said that in this case \"no plans\" meant she would not make the change because it would defeat her objective of keeping people in the workplace.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Reeves", "type": "person",

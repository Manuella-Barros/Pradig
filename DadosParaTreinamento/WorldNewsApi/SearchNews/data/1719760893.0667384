The three-and-a-half-month-long empowerment and oral transmission is being presided over by Shechen Rabjam Rinpoche. The initiation began today. In the 8th century, Buddhist teachings imparted by Guru Rinpoche and his consort Yeshi Tshogyel, and their primary disciples were hidden as treasures. These texts, later unearthed by Tertoens or treasure discoverers, were meticulously gathered and compiled in the 19th century by Nyingma masters Jamgon Kongtrul Lodro Thaye and Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo. This compilation is known as the Rinchen Terzoe, and its Jaglung refers to the practice of reading and oral transmission. \u201cGenerally, there are two forms of Buddha\u2019s teachings known as Kama and Terma. Terma is the compilation of sacred scriptures revealed as treasures by treasure discoverers starting from Terton Sanye Lama till Terton Chojur Lingpa. The collection or the summary of these texts is called Rinchen Terzoe. So in these three and half months, there will be approximately 700 Wang or empowerment,\u201d said Khenpo Ngawang Jamtsho, Principal of Shechen Thekchok Chokyi Gatshel Monastery in Paro. \u201cShechen Rabjam Rinpoche will empower the Wang and the Lung will be initiated by Azom Gasey Jurmi Dorji Chothruel Rinpoche,\u201d said Khenpo Thinley Dorji, Principal of Ugyen Pema Woeling Zangdo Pelri Monastery in Paro. Buddhist practitioners from various countries and especially from India and Nepal have also gathered at the venue. Khentruel Karma Jigme is organising the religious event. It will end by the mid of September.

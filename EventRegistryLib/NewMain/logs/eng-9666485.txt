Located in the heart of Kuala Lumpur's new Tun Razak Exchange (TRX) central business district, the new store will deliver the magic of Apple in the country like never before. Customers can discover and buy Apple's innovative lineup of products and services, receive exceptional service from knowledgeable team members, and learn how to get the most out of their devices through free Today at Apple sessions.\n\n\"We live for moments when we can surprise and delight our customers, and we're excited to do that in Malaysia with the opening of our first store in the country, Apple The Exchange TRX,\" said Deirdre O'Brien, Apple's senior vice president of Retail. \"Being able to support and directly connect with a new community is always a special experience for our retail teams, and we can't wait to welcome customers to this beautiful space designed for discovery, creativity, and shopping for the world's most innovative products.\"\n\nAt Apple The Exchange TRX, more than 160 team members are ready to help customers shop for their favorite Apple products -- from the iPhone 15 lineup to the MacBook Air with M3 and the latest iPad models, including the redesigned iPad Air and incredibly thin iPad Pro with M4.\n\nApple The Exchange TRX will be an inspiring hub for education, offering customers free in-store sessions through Today at Apple.

The store is designed with a refined palette of high-quality materials, including natural stone walls, polished stainless-steel columns, light terrazzo floors, and a timber ceiling.\n\nVisitors are invited to explore the surrounding display tables and avenues, and shop the new iPad Air with M2, the iPhone 15 lineup, and the latest Apple Watch lineup -- Apple's first-ever carbon neutral products.

Located in the heart of Kuala Lumpur's new Tun Razak Exchange (TRX) central business district, the new store will deliver the magic of Apple in the country like never before. Customers can discover and buy Apple's innovative lineup of products and services, receive exceptional service from knowledgeable team members, and learn how to get the most out of their devices through free Today at Apple\u00ae sessions.\n\n\"We live for moments when we can surprise and delight our customers, and we're excited to do that in Malaysia with the opening of our first store in the country, Apple The Exchange TRX,\" said Deirdre O'Brien, Apple's senior vice president of Retail. \"Being able to support and directly connect with a new community is always a special experience for our retail teams, and we can't wait to welcome customers to this beautiful space designed for discovery, creativity, and shopping for the world's most innovative products.\"\n\nAt Apple The Exchange TRX, more than 160 team members are ready to help customers shop for their favorite Apple products -- from the iPhone\u00ae 15 lineup to the MacBook Air\u00ae with M3 and the latest iPad\u00ae models, including the redesigned iPad Air\u00ae and incredibly thin iPad Pro\u00ae with M4.\n\nApple The Exchange TRX will be an inspiring hub for education, offering customers free in-store sessions through Today at Apple. Led by Apple Creatives, the events will empower attendees to tap into their creativity and learn how to get the most out of their devices, with topics ranging from basics and how-to lessons, to iPhone photo and video tours that take advantage of the beautiful store location.\n\nTo celebrate the opening, a special Today at Apple series, \"Jom Discover,\" will run from Saturday, June 22, through Saturday, July 6. Bringing together some of Malaysia's most celebrated creators, the sessions will offer a glimpse into the creative process while showcasing Apple's full range of products and services.\n\nSessions in the \"Jom Discover\" series include:\n\nApple The Exchange TRX connects the mall's central atrium to a lush rooftop park that wraps around the store's upper level. Emitting a warm glow at night, the three-dimensional layered roof consists of horizontal glass panels and shading blades to reduce the sun's rays. A central glazed oculus brings daylight into the interior and includes a dynamic artificial-lighting feature.\n\nInside the store, a sculptural quartz and glass staircase connects the three levels where customers can explore, learn, and shop. The Forum, home to Today at Apple programming, is located on a floating deck that joins up with the mall, while the upper level directly connects with the edge of the park, bringing daylight and greenery into the store through a continuous glass fa\u00e7ade.\n\nLike all Apple facilities, the Apple The Exchange TRX runs on 100 percent renewable energy and is carbon neutral. The store is designed with a refined palette of high-quality materials, including natural stone walls, polished stainless-steel columns, light terrazzo floors, and a timber ceiling.\n\nVisitors are invited to explore the surrounding display tables and avenues, and shop the new iPad Air with M2, the iPhone 15 lineup, and the latest Apple Watch lineup -- Apple's first-ever carbon neutral products. Apple Specialists are excited to connect with the local community through personalized setup and support, switching to iOS, and Apple Trade In, where customers can get credit toward a new device by trading in their current one.\n\nJust in time for back to school, students and families can save on a Mac or iPad with Apple Education Pricing available exclusively through Apple Retail. In-store or online, eligible customers can also take advantage of the university student offer running through September 30, and receive AirPods\u00ae when they buy an eligible Mac, or an Apple Pencil\u00ae when they buy an eligible iPad.\n\nApple The Exchange TRX also offers a dedicated Apple Pickup counter, making it even easier for customers to place an order online and pick up products when it's most convenient for them.

Customers can discover and buy Apple's innovative lineup of products and services, receive exceptional service from knowledgeable team members, and learn how to get the most out of their devices through free Today at Apple sessions.\n\n\"We live for moments when we can surprise and delight our customers, and we're excited to do that in Malaysia with the opening of our first store in the country, Apple The Exchange TRX,\" said Deirdre O'Brien, Apple's senior vice president of Retail. \"Being able to support and directly connect with a new community is always a special experience for our retail teams, and we can't wait to welcome customers to this beautiful space designed for discovery, creativity, and shopping for the world's most innovative products.\"\n\nAt Apple The Exchange TRX, more than 160 team members are ready to help customers shop for their favorite Apple products - from the iPhone 15 lineup to the MacBook Air with M3 and the latest iPad models, including the redesigned iPad Air and incredibly thin iPad Pro with M4.\n\nApple The Exchange TRX will be an inspiring hub for education, offering customers free in-store sessions through Today at Apple. Led by Apple Creatives, the events will empower attendees to tap into their creativity and learn how to get the most out of their devices, with topics ranging from basics and how-to lessons, to iPhone photo and video tours that take advantage of the beautiful store location.\n\nTo celebrate the opening, a special Today at Apple series, \"Jom Discover,\" will run from Saturday, June 22, through Saturday, July 6. Bringing together some of Malaysia's most celebrated creators, the sessions will offer a glimpse into the creative process while showcasing Apple's full range of products and services.\n\nSessions in the \"Jom Discover\" series include:\n\nPerformance: De FamWorkshop: Capture Portraits on iPhone with Jason smashpopSpotlight: Video Magic on Mac with Adam LoboWorkshop: Turn Ideas Into Action on iPad with Iman AzmanSpotlight: Live Well with Nana Mohd and Apple Watch\n\nApple The Exchange TRX connects the mall's central atrium to a lush rooftop park that wraps around the store's upper level. Emitting a warm glow at night, the three-dimensional layered roof consists of horizontal glass panels and shading blades to reduce the sun's rays. A central glazed oculus brings daylight into the interior and includes a dynamic artificial-lighting feature.\n\nInside the store, a sculptural quartz and glass staircase connects the three levels where customers can explore, learn, and shop. The Forum, home to Today at Apple programming, is located on a floating deck that joins up with the mall, while the upper level directly connects with the edge of the park, bringing daylight and greenery into the store through a continuous glass fa\u00e7ade.\n\nLike all Apple facilities, the Apple The Exchange TRX runs on 100 percent renewable energy and is carbon neutral. The store is designed with a refined palette of high-quality materials, including natural stone walls, polished stainless-steel columns, light terrazzo floors, and a timber ceiling.\n\nVisitors are invited to explore the surrounding display tables and avenues, and shop the new iPad Air with M2, the iPhone 15 lineup, and the latest Apple Watch lineup - Apple's first-ever carbon neutral products. Apple Specialists are excited to connect with the local community through personalized setup and support, switching to iOS, and Apple Trade In, where customers can get credit toward a new device by trading in their current one.\n\nJust in time for back to school, students and families can save on a Mac or iPad with Apple Education Pricing available exclusively through Apple Retail. In-store or online, eligible customers can also take advantage of the university student offer running through September 30, and receive AirPods when they buy an eligible Mac, or an Apple Pencil when they buy an eligible iPad.\n\nApple The Exchange TRX also offers a dedicated Apple Pickup counter, making it even easier for customers to place an order online and pick up products when it's most convenient for them. And for hands-on technical and hardware support, customers can make a reservation at the Genius Bar and get help from an expert.\n\nApple The Exchange TRX opens Saturday, June 22, at 10 a.m. MYT. Customers are invited to check out curated content celebrating the essence of creativity in Malaysia across Apple TV+, Apple Music, and the App Store, and sign up for upcoming Today at Apple sessions.\n\n/Public Release.

The iPhone giant showcased its first store in Malaysia, Apple The Exchange TRX, on Thursday. It opens Saturday in Kuala Lumpur. It will employ a staggering 160 team members offering the full array of Apple products and services in a dramatic location.\n\n\"We live for moments when we can surprise and delight our customers, and we're excited to do that in Malaysia with the opening of our first store in the country, Apple The Exchange TRX,\" said Deirdre O'Brien, Apple's senior vice president of Retail.\n\n\"Being able to support and directly connect with a new community is always a special experience for our retail teams, and we can't wait to welcome customers to this beautiful space designed for discovery, creativity, and shopping for the world's most innovative products,\" she added.\n\nLocated in the heart of Kuala Lumpur's new Tun Razak Exchange (TRX) central business district and named for the Exchange TRX mall it occupies, the new store will deliver Apple's retail magic for the first time in Malaysia, including products and services. And the location couldn't be cooler. Initially, we were impressed by the first look's design rendering, but the actual photographs are even better.\n\nSo the store connects the mall's central atrium to a lush rooftop park that wraps around the store's upper level. And the three-dimensional layered roof, which emits a warm glow at night, \"consists of horizontal glass panels and shading blades to reduce the sun's rays. Then a central glazed oculus brings daylight into the interior and includes a dynamic artificial-lighting feature,\" Apple said.\n\nAnd the interior contains other dramatic features, too:\n\nInside the store, a sculptural quartz and glass staircase connects the three levels where customers can explore, learn and shop. The Forum, home to Today at Apple programming, is located on a floating deck that joins up with the mall, while the upper level directly connects with the edge of the park, bringing daylight and greenery into the store through a continuous glass fa\u00e7ade.\n\nMakes you wish the Apple Store in your local mall was this stunning, eh?\n\nAnd the store is impressive in not only design, but in size and staffing. More than 160 team members will help customers shop for everything from the iPhone 15 lineup to the MacBook Air with M3 and the latest iPad models.\n\nBut staff doesn't just sell products. Led by Apple Creatives, Today at Apple sessions will help users tap into their creativity and learn how to get the most out of their devices. Some sessions, like photography-related ones, will take advantage of the store's striking design and location.\n\nHere's the special opening Today at Apple session:\n\nTo celebrate the opening, a special Today at Apple series, \"Jom Discover,\" will run from Saturday, June 22, through Saturday, July 6.

A central glazed oculus brings natural daylight into the interior and contains a dynamic artificial-lighting system that adjusts based on the time of day. The building connects the mall's central atrium to a rooftop park that wraps around the store's upper level.\n\nInside, a sculptural quartz and glass staircase connects the three levels. The main floor is a floating deck that sits above the primary display area. The Forum, where Today at Apple sessions take place, is located on this floating deck, providing a central location for workshops and events. The upper level, which connects directly to the rooftop park, brings natural light and greenery into the store through a continuous glass facade. The interior features high-quality materials such as natural stone walls, polished stainless-steel columns, light terrazzo floors, and a timber ceiling.\n\nApple The Exchange TRX runs on 100% renewable energy and is carbon neutral, in line with Apple's broader environmental goals. The store contains a Genius Bar, a dedicated Apple Pickup counter, and more than 160 retail employees to help customers.\n\nTo celebrate the store's opening, Apple will run a special series of Today at Apple sessions called \"Jom Discover,\" running from June 22 through July 6. These sessions will feature some of Malaysia's most celebrated creators, offering insights into their creative processes and showcasing Apple's products and services. Highlights include a performance by De Fam, workshops on iPhone photography with Jason smashpop, video editing on Mac with Adam Lobo, productivity on iPad with Iman Azman, and health and wellness sessions with Nana Mohd focusing on the Apple Watch.\n\nApple The Exchange TRX opens on Saturday, June 22, at 10 a.m. MYT.\n\nArticle Link: Apple Unveils Stunning Kuala Lumpur Store", "source": {"uri": "forums.macrumors.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MacRumors Forums"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oculus_(architecture)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oculus (architecture)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tun_Razak_Exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tun Razak Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Three-dimensional space"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fa\u00e7ade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fa\u00e7ade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrium_(architecture)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atrium (architecture)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stainless_steel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stainless steel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartz", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quartz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunlight", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sunlight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kuala Lumpur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kuala Lumpur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wolf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100%_renewable_energy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "100% renewable energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Watch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Watch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_in_Malaysia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Time in Malaysia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrazzo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrazzo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_neutrality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carbon neutrality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genius_Bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genius Bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumber", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lumber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Productivity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IPad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Photography"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Retail_Trade", "label": "dmoz/Business/Retail Trade", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Retail_Trade/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Retail Trade/Retailers", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/apple-trx-exterior.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666485", "eventUri": "eng-9666485", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-22", "dateEnd": "2024-07-06", "textStart": 1662, "textEnd": 1684}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-22", "textStart": 2145, "textEnd": 2152}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

The Specialist\n\nApple Specialists are not only friendly but also highly curious.\n\nImage via Apple Malaysia\n\nThe Specialist will be the first Apple team member who will greet you as you enter the Apple Store.\n\nThey're extremely helpful, knowledgeable about Apple devices, and extremely curious. They're there to help you choose the best Apple product that would solve to your needs and cater to your preferences.\n\nAs you browse the first floor of the Apple Store, you'll notice them close by (they're in navy blue t-shirts with the Apple logo on their chests). Feel free to call them over to ask any questions about the devices that are on display.\n\nYou also get to enjoy personalised setup and support to get your new devices up and running smoothly.\n\nThe Specialists will also help you when switching to iOS. There's also an Apple Trade-In programme that allows customers to trade in their current devices for credit towards a new purchase, making it easier to upgrade to the latest device.\n\n2. The Creative Pro\n\nThe Creative Pro is the best person to ask for iPhone photography tips.\n\nImage via Apple Malaysia\n\nThe Apple Store at The Exchange TRX Mall features a Forum Space on the floating deck that joins up with the mall.\n\nThis space is designed for workshops and sessions for people to learn more about Apple devices.\n\nThe Creative Pro is the Apple team member who will be sharing the potential of Apple devices at the Today at Apple sessions.\n\nToday at Apple sessions will feature tips, pop-up studios, get-started sessions, and more. The Creative Pro can be found on this floor and they'll help you expand your skill in art, photography, videography, and coding via workshops.\n\nIn fact, in conjunction with the launch of Malaysia's first Apple store, over 20 Today at Apple sessions have been planned from 20 June to 6 July.\n\n3. The Genius\n\nThe Genius knows everything and anything to help fix your Apple devices.\n\nImage via Apple Malaysia\n\nThe Genius can be found at the Genius Bar, and with their years of experience in handling and fixing Apple devices, they're your go-to for any tech-related issues with your Apple devices.\n\nYou can also make reservations at the Genius Bar for hands-on technical and hardware support alongside assistance from the Geniuses available.\n\nThe Genius Bar is located at the lowest level.\n\nThe Apple Store at the The Exchange TRX will open its doors to Malaysians on 22 June at 10am\n\nThe store is accessible through The Exchange TRX mall or via a rooftop park above.\n\nImage via Apple Malaysia\n\nApart from Today at Apple sessions, students and teachers also get to enjoy discounts on a Mac or iPad with Apple Education Pricing available exclusively at the Apple store in The Exchange TRX.\n\nThere's also an offer for university students, who stand to get AirPods when they buy a Mac, or an Apple Pencil when purchasing an iPad.\n\nThere's also a dedicated Apple Pickup counter where you get to pick up your online Apple purchases.\n\nFollow SAYS Tech on Facebook, Instagram, & TikTok for the latest in tech in Malaysia and the world!\n\nRead more #tech stories:\n\nDon't miss out!

The interior features high-quality materials such as natural stone walls, polished stainless-steel columns, light terrazzo floors, and a timber ceiling.\n\nTo celebrate the store's opening, Apple will run a special series of Today at Apple sessions called \"Jom Discover,\" running from June 22 through July 6.

While not yet open to the public just yet, the company has invited Lowyat.NET along with other local media to preview the new establishment, as well as brief us on what visitors would expect this weekend.\n\nFor starters, the Apple store at The Exchange TRX is vast, and consists of three floors for visitors to explore. Much like its other outlets across the globe, everything is laid out in a minimalist approach, with plenty of breathing room. What sets this particular store apart from the rest is its unique windowed roof, which also provides generous natural lighting for the second and third floors during the daytime.\n\nInterestingly, Apple claims that the store is powered by 100% renewable energy, which is quite intriguing. This is especially given the fact that it is located within the The Exchange TRX mall which, by right, uses its own power generators to power all stores. It is unclear whether Apple uses its own source of energy, and it did not elaborate further when we asked for more details regarding this.\n\nThe store's first level is where you'll find the first set of experience zones. These are divided into multiple islands for different products including iPhones, iPads, Macs, AirPods, and Apple Watches, as well as their respective accessories. Additionally, showcases for the company's subscription services (the ones available in Malaysia, that is) such as Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade can be found on the left and right sides of the store, whereas a pickup point for items ordered online is also situated on this floor.\n\nThe second batch of experience zones is located on the second floor, but to a lesser extent. Reason being that most of the space is allocated for a space called The Forum, where Apple will hold its Today at Apple presentations and workshops that are hosted by staff and content creators. As for the third floor, there isn't much here except for a windowed area with an elevator and a flight of stairs that connects all three floors, as well as a door which you can use to enter the store through the TRX park.\n\nOver a hundred on-location staff, known as Geniuses, will be present to help you out with a variety of things. This could range from tech support, as well as product introduction, demonstrations, and recommendations. Apple says these individuals are well versed in all of its devices and services, with some fluent in 10 different languages to assist customers that hail from different parts of the world.\n\nAdditionally, the Apple store at The Exchange TRX offers customers a 14-day returns and refunds policy for its products. It is also a direct way to purchase its devices at educational prices, which was previously only available exclusively via the brand's website.\n\nBesides offering a customer-friendly retail experience, the tech giant's first ever Malaysian retail store is also designed to be a space for learning. As mentioned earlier, The Forum space located on the second floor is intended to host Today at Apple workshops and presentations, with the first few scheduled to happen this Saturday. All sessions are free of charge to visitors.\n\nFirst, a disclaimer. All of the following are just speculations, so don't take our word for it.\n\nOne of the few things that could happen, now that Malaysia has its own Apple store, are local product launches. Not the keynote-style approach that we usually see in the company's virtual events, but rather the \"day one\" drops where customers would line up for hours just to be one of the earliest in the country to own a shiny new Apple device.\n\nThe next one is more likely, but only if Malaysia makes the cut. The thing we're referring to is the Apple Vision Pro, and where else can you try out the new RM16K mixed reality headset other than an official Apple store? With its US and select European outlets as examples, interested visitors are given a 30-minute guided demonstration to experience what the Vision Pro has to offer. Whether or not you'll walk out of the store with one all depends on you.\n\nApart from those are the more wishy-washy types of speculations, such as an official visit by Apple CEO Tim Cook and so on. Unlikely, but not entirely impossible.\n\nUnfortunately, there won't be special offers or promotions happening on opening day, but visitors who do plan to purchase products this Saturday will walk away with a limited edition Apple The Exchange TRX tote bag. It's not much, but it is a nice memento to commemorate the occasion.\n\nThen there's the special Today at Apple sessions mentioned earlier, dubbed the \"Jom Discover\" series, which will run daily from 22 June to 6 July 2024.

Apple last month officially announced that the building is indeed its latest retail store, and that it will open on June 22.\n\nApple has now showed off photos of the interior, and says that the most dramatic design feature isn't just for looks.\n\nApple The Exchange TRX connects the mall's central atrium to a lush rooftop park that wraps around the store's upper level. Emitting a warm glow at night, the three-dimensional layered roof consists of horizontal glass panels and shading blades to reduce the sun's rays. A central glazed oculus brings daylight into the interior and includes a dynamic artificial-lighting feature.\n\nWhat looks like the main floor of the store, above, is actually a \"floating deck\" above the main display floor below.\n\nInside the store, a sculptural quartz and glass staircase connects the three levels where customers can explore, learn, and shop. The Forum, home to Today at Apple programming, is located on a floating deck that joins up with the mall, while the upper level directly connects with the edge of the park, bringing daylight and greenery into the store through a continuous glass fa\u00e7ade.\n\nApple is marking the opening with a number of workshops with leading Malaysian creators.\n\nCheck out more photos below (tap/click on each to enlarge).", "source": {"uri": "9to5mac.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "9to5Mac"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_lovejoy@9to5mac.com", "name": "Ben Lovejoy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Store", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kuala Lumpur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kuala Lumpur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shopping_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shopping center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pyramid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrium_(architecture)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atrium (architecture)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three-dimensional space"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Retail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oculus_(architecture)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oculus (architecture)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kia_Forum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kia Forum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fa\u00e7ade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fa\u00e7ade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartz", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quartz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Retail_Trade", "label": "dmoz/Business/Retail Trade", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Retail_Trade/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Retail Trade/Retailers", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Retail", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Retail", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/06/Apple-Store-TRX-in-Kuala-Lumpur.jpg?resize=1200%2C628&quality=82&strip=all&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666485", "eventUri": "eng-9666485", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-22", "textStart": 717, "textEnd": 724}], "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

He vividly remembered walking into his bandmate's studio and seeing the iMac G3.\n\n\"It looked like a spaceship,\" Adam recalled to SAYS, referring to the Bondi Blue version of the iMac G3.\n\nThe unique design and the rounded hockey puck mouse were unlike anything he had seen before, making a lasting impression on him. However, he was only able to afford his first Apple product several years later.\n\nImage via Adam Lobo TV\n\nAdam purchased his first MacBook in 2006, a decision that was influenced by his late business partner who described Apple's device as the \"BMW of laptops\"\n\nDespite initial hesitations due to the cost, Adam made the switch, and it marked a significant turning point in his tech journey.\n\n\"The sleek, white MacBook not only appealed to my aesthetic sense but also proved to be a reliable workhorse for my event management business and music production,\" he said, adding that his creative endeavours greatly benefited from Apple's user-friendly software.\n\nHe extensively used GarageBand to add electronic sounds to his music, enhancing his rap metal band's productions.\n\nAdditionally, iMovie became his go-to for editing behind-the-scenes videos, which he started uploading to YouTube even before Google acquired it. These tools were intuitive and powerful, allowing Adam to focus more on his creativity rather than grappling with complex software.\n\nAdam mentioned features like Hot Corners and multiple desktops alongside seamless integration of software like Adobe Photoshop on Mac as small yet significant aspects that enhance his daily workflow. These factors, Adam said, reinforced his loyalty to the brand.\n\nThe upcoming launch of Malaysia's first Apple Store at the Tun Razak Exchange in Kuala Lumpur is a monumental event for Adam and many Apple enthusiasts\n\nImage via Apple Malaysia\n\nAccording to Adam, Malaysians will now be able to enjoy the advantages of having an official Apple Store once it opens its doors on 22 June 2024.\n\n\"The perks include having quicker access to new products and Apple Care Plus services,\" he said, adding that he's particularly excited about the store's aesthetics, inspired by Steve Jobs' vision, and the enhanced customer experience it promises.\n\nAdam added that the opening of the Apple Store is more than just a retail milestone; it represents a new era for Malaysian consumers and content creators.\n\n\"The Apple Store at TRX will now offer Apple fans the opportunity to be part of a global community, access the latest technology, and receive unparalleled customer support,\" he said.\n\nAdam will be part of the Today at Apple sessions, held from 20 June to 6 July as part of the launch of Malaysia's first Apple Store.

The store will be closed next week and will reopen later this month in a new location.\n\nA Bloomberg report last year revealed the company's plans to relocate its retail store in Milton Keynes. As noted by The Apple Post, the store is one of the few yet to be updated with a more modern design, as it currently still operates in a \"narrow two-floor unit from where it has been based for several years.\"\n\nNow the mystery is over. Apple has confirmed via its website that the current store in Milton Keynes will close from June 25. The company says that a \"brand new Apple Store is coming soon\" on Saturday, June 29.\n\nThe store is moving to a larger space in the Midsummer Place shopping center. Midsummer Place even shared an image of the new store facade on Instagram this afternoon.\n\nEarlier today, Apple shared photos of its new store in Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital, ahead of the opening on Saturday. The store has a unique design with a floating deck inside and looks like a pyramid from the outside.\n\nApple The Exchange TRX connects the mall's central atrium to a lush rooftop park that wraps around the store's upper level. Emitting a warm glow at night, the three-dimensional layered roof consists of horizontal glass panels and shading blades to reduce the sun's rays. A central glazed oculus brings daylight into the interior and includes a dynamic artificial-lighting feature.\n\nAs for the reopening of Apple Milton Keynes next Saturday, it will take place at 10 a.m. local time.", "source": {"uri": "9to5mac.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "9to5Mac"}, "authors": [{"uri": "filipe_esposito@9to5mac.com", "name": "Filipe Esp\u00f3sito", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milton_Keynes", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milton Keynes"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milton Keynes"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_L.P.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bloomberg L.P."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Retail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Store", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Store"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shopping_mall", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shopping mall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oculus_(architecture)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oculus (architecture)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pyramid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atrium_(architecture)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atrium (architecture)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_space", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-dimensional space"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kuala Lumpur"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kuala Lumpur"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Malaysia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Systems/Apple", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Retail_Trade", "label": "dmoz/Business/Retail Trade", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Retail_Trade/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Business/Retail Trade/Retailers", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Food_and_Related_Products/Retail", "label": "dmoz/Business/Food and Related Products/Retail", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Hardware/Retailers", "wgt": 22}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/9to5mac.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/06/Apple-Milton-Keynes.jpg?resize=1200%2C628&quality=82&strip=all&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666485", "eventUri": "eng-9666485", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-25", "textStart": 693, "textEnd": 700}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-29", "textStart": 778, "textEnd": 785}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 130, "relevance": 1}

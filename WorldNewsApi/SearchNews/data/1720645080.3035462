The former Take That singer, 50, has admitted to having Botox, fillers as well as hair transplants in a bid to stay looking young. He has also shared his numerous weight struggles, heartbreakingly admitting he could \"write a book about self-loathing where my body image is concerned\". After a series of attempts to dodge the aging process, Robbie says he is now ready to \"embrace\" his years as he accepts his hair loss. He was known for his luscious locks during the band's heyday and admitted it was a struggle to see it go. Robbie hasn't always been kind on his body image and once likened himself to comic book character Desperate Dan. Here is a look at everything Robbie has candidly shared about his changing appearances... Cosmetic work The singer revealed that he'd had Botox and fillers in 2016 as he stated he could no longer move his forehead. Speaking to the Daily Mail, Robbie commented: \"I've had some fillers, and some Botox, and I've had something done to my chin which means I can't even move my f***ing forehead.\" Last year, he likened himself to the comic book character Desperate Dan. Robbie made the admission as he shared some artwork on Instagram. \u201cOne time I had a few things done, botox, fillers and something done to my chin that made me look like desperate Dan. Perhaps [about] 5 years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing since then. It was when I was on the Graham Norton Show with Justin Timberlake, Daniel Radcliffe and Anna Kendrick.\u201d Hair loss In 2022, Robbie admitted he was ready to \"embrace\" losing his hair following a series of hair transplants. The former Take That star had a hair transplant back in 2013 - which he said he didn\u2019t even need at the time. He put it down to \u201cliving in LA\u201d with wife Ayda Field saying: \u201cIf you live in Los Angeles for long enough, you\u2019re going to get some surgery.\u201d However, his hair started to go in 2020 and he was told he couldn\u2019t have another procedure as by that point it was too thin. He also tried having pricey follicle growth injections, but that didn\u2019t work either. Robbie admitted he was even considering wearing a wig for one of his tours due to his hair loss. In a radio interview in Australia, he said: \u201cI\u2019m thinking of getting a hairpiece. There are these great wigs that you can get now. You have to shave all your hair off and then you have it placed on with glue and it sticks on for a couple of weeks. I might actually do it just for touring.\u201d He also opened up to BBC Radio 2\u2019s Zoe Ball about his once luscious locks. \u201cWe\u2019ve both lived long enough to see me losing my hair,\u201d the Rock DJ singer joked. \u201cIt\u2019s getting thinner and thinner. No one will give me a thatch job [hair transplant] because they say my hair is too thin. I can\u2019t take any pills because they depress me. I\u2019m just going to have to embrace Robbie Williams losing his hair.\u201d Weight struggles Robbie has been extremely honest about his body dysmorphia over the years and recently decided to address his weight loss after fans noticed his slimmed-down physique. He shared: \u201cSo, If a genie appeared and said you can either have your superpower be the ability to fly or eat what you want and remain at your goal weight? I would go for goal weight eating every day. What about you?\u201d He continued: \u201cI could write a book about self-loathing where my body image is concerned. Like pure self-hatred, The ugliness of feeling ugly. I\u2019m body dysmorphic and on top of being dysmorphic at times, I can be 40+ pounds overweight. So you can imagine what my mind sees. Or maybe you can\u2019t either way it\u2019s a f*****g disaster. \u201cAt the moment I\u2019m skinny... But me being me, my mind is going, \u2018F*****g great Rob, you managed to get skinny and now your old, congrats, golf clap. The struggle is real, the sadness shocking. I\u2019ve had it all my life. And it won\u2019t abate.\u201d He previously shared how he went on a diet before going on tour, but lost a drastic amount of weight. He explained in 2016: \"Months ago, I went on this diet and it worked but it's kind of extreme. I lost seven pounds in five days. And then, seven days in, I woke up one morning and I thought, 'That's odd, there's a polaroid image in my head with me and some grapes and some peanut butter. That's strange, 'cos that didn't happen.' The second day I woke up and I went to the loo and there were crumbs in the bath. The third night, I woke up at the fridge and I'd been night eating every night. I put on nine pounds in the middle of the night, without knowing. That being said, I'm looking after myself. I'm carb-less, sugar-less, fun-less. I'm in those clothes I used to wear in the 90s.\" Follow Mirror Celebs on TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTubeand Threads.", "summary": "Former Take That heartthrob Robbie Williams has been extremely open about his body image over the years as he admitted to getting botched Botox, hair transplants and experiencing body dysmorphia", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/robbie-williams-changing-looks-botox-32982829", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article10757147.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Marc-OPolo-Celebrates-Its-50th-Anniversary.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 16:30:00", "author": "Mia O'Hare", "authors": ["Mia O'Hare"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": -0.19}

It has since grown to incorporate several major U.S. cities, including San Francisco, New York City and, until this year, Fort Lauderdale.\n\nAfter more than three decades at Port Everglades, South Florida's Fleet Week moved to Miami this year.\n\nU.S. Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro, Miami-Dade County Mayor Daiella Levine Cava and other officials made the announcement last summer at PortMiami.\n\nPort Everglades, located just north of Miami-Dade County, had been home to South Florida's Fleet Week since 1990.\n\nFleet Week had a modern renaissance when it became an annual tradition in New York City in the early 1980s. It is generally scheduled to coincide with the Memorial Day holiday weekend.\n\nSan Diego's Fleet Week typically takes place in November.\n\nFor civilians, Fleet Week is a celebration of U.S. sailors and their contributions to defending the nation's coasts.

It represents a chance to serve something bigger than yourself,\" said Secretary Del Toro. \"We recognize the desire of Americans from all walks of life to use their talents to better our great Nation, to be part of a legacy of courage and honor that stretches back to the very founding of our nation -- and beyond.\"\n\nAs the 78th Secretary of the Navy, Del Toro leads a department of nearly one million Sailors, Marines, and civilians who provide direct and indirect support to the economic and national security of our Nation, as well as international commerce.\n\n\"And no matter how you serve, you'll be part of a team working together toward a shared goal,\" said Secretary Del Toro. You'll learn invaluable skills and gain leadership experience. Collectively, as a Sailor, Marine, or civilian, you will take part in tackling the world's toughest challenges whiles preserving America's advantage across several cutting-edge technologies.\"\n\nBorn in Havana, Cuba, Secretary Del Toro immigrated to the United States at ten months old with his parents in 1962 to escape the Castro regime. Like thousands of other Cuban refugees, the Freedom Tower in Miami was their first stop on the road to freedom. Eventually, they relocated to a tenement building on 42nd Street and 10th Avenue in Hell's Kitchen, New York.\n\n\"Throughout my childhood, both of my parents sacrificed and labored for the sake of their children. They wanted to give us a better life in America, a life unattainable back in Cuba. Their service and sacrifice instilled in me a desire to give back to this great Nation which took us in at a time when we were most vulnerable,\" said Secretary Del Toro.\n\nIn 1983, Secretary Del Toro graduated from the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, and served on active duty in the Navy for 22 years. His is just one of many stories of Sailors, Marines, Coast Guardsmen and women, and civilians who answered the call to defend the values that define our Nation, and to make a lasting impact on the world.\n\n\"I encourage all Floridians to come out this week and engage with Sailors, Marines, Coast Guardsmen and women, and all the civilians who support them,\" said Secretary Del Toro. Come listen to their stories of service during Fleet Week Miami and see where you can fit into the story.\"\n\nFleet Week Miami runs through May 12. During the week, visitors can interact with nearly 7,000 Sailors, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen and women.

We thank you for your leadership as the Ranking Member on the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction and Veteran Affairs!\n\nThank you to the Honorable Franklin Parker, Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Manpower and Reserve Affairs, for the incredible work you have done to ensure the personnel readiness of our Sailors, Marines, civilians, and family members within the Department of the Navy.\n\nAnd I also want to thank the Honorable Oliver Gilbert and the Honorable Danielle Cohen Higgins for your work within the Miami-Dade Board of County Commissioners.\n\nGeneral Richardson, thank you for your leadership of the service men and women in US Southern Command.\n\nAnd I also thank Admiral Caudle, for your service and leadership of US Fleet Forces.\n\nI welcome and thank Mr. Lewis, Norwegian Cruise Lines Senior Vice President and Chief Security Officer -- and also a Navy Veteran! Thank you for your service as a Navy seal, sir.\n\nTo our flag officers, general officers, senior enlisted leaders, and other distinguished guests with us here today -- welcome, and thank you for your unwavering support of our maritime services and this incredible event that will take place this week.\n\nLast year, on July 14 2023, here at PortMiami, on a very hot but beautiful day, Mayor Levine Cava and I announced the inaugural Fleet Week in this great city.\n\nAnd now, we celebrate the beginning of a new tradition of service in Miami-Dade County -- Fleet Week Miami.\n\nThousands of our Sailors, Marines, Coast Guardsmen and women, and civilian employees will take part in events across the greater Miami-Dade area, engaging with the American public they serve and standing ready to share their stories and motivations for their careers in public service.\n\nMiami holds a special place in my heart -- it was where the first chapter of my American story began.\n\nMy story began in Havana in the early 1960s.\n\nThe Castro Regime imprisoned my father, Raul Del Toro, for \"counter-revolutionary activities.\"\n\nWhen I was ten months old, my father was paroled while he awaited trial.\n\nDuring this time, our emergency visas into the U.S. came through, and with what we could carry on our backs, we fled to America.\n\nAnd America greeted us with a warm welcome in Miami.\n\nLike thousands of other Cuban refugees, we called the Freedom Tower, our first stop on the road to freedom, home until we relocated to a tenement building on 42 Street and 10 Avenue in Hell's Kitchen, New York, where I grew up.\n\nI often tell people that growing up in Hell's Kitchen was just like the play West Side Story without the music or the dancing!\n\nThroughout my childhood, both of my parents sacrificed and labored for the sake of their children -- they wanted to give us a better life in America, a life unattainable back in Cuba.\n\nI watched as they both worked two jobs to support our family.\n\nTheir service and sacrifice instilled in me a desire to give back to this great Nation which took us in at a time when we were most vulnerable.\n\nIn 1979, I left New York to attend the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland.\n\nThis began my career of service to this country.\n\nService to our nation is ingrained in the very fabric of this country.\n\nAnd service does not only mean putting on a uniform -- service can be defined in a multitude of other ways.\n\nThis week, as a part of Fleet Week Miami, I am proud to announce the Department of the Navy's \"National Call to Maritime Service\" campaign.\n\nService in the Navy and Marine Corps is more than just a job -- it represents a chance to serve something bigger than yourself.\n\nTo be part of a legacy of courage and honor that stretches back to the very founding of our nation -- and beyond.\n\nThe Navy offers unparalleled benefits, free education and training, cutting-edge technology, and -- best of all -- the chance to see the world.\n\nBecoming a Marine will push you to your limits, and in the process, you will learn you're capable of more than you ever dreamed of.\n\nOur Sailors and Marines are more than just service members -- they are diplomats, humanitarians, and leaders.\n\nEvery one of the thousands of Sailors and Marines in their Navy Dress Whites and Marine Dress Blues this week chose to serve their nation, and it is my hope that you will consider it too.\n\nAnd this is not the only way you can serve.\n\nThe Department of the Navy also provides numerous opportunities for public service beyond serving in uniform.\n\nBy choosing a career working as a civilian within our Department, you also have an opportunity to be a part of something greater than yourselves.\n\nAnd no matter how you serve, you'll be part of a team working together toward a shared goal.\n\nYou'll learn invaluable skills and gain leadership experience.\n\nAs a Department of the Navy civilian, you have an opportunity to leverage your education, skills, and talents across a variety of disciplines -- from healthcare to Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics -- from human resources to program analysis.\n\nCollectively, as a Sailor, Marine, or civilian, you will take part in tackling the world's toughest challenges while promoting peace and preserving democracy around the world.\n\nAnd in return, the Navy and Marine Corps offer stable careers, great salaries, comprehensive healthcare benefits, world-class education and training, opportunities to live and travel around the world, and a sense of tremendous pride and satisfaction in support of a noble cause.\n\nWe recognize the desire of Americans from all walks of life to use their talents to better our great Nation.\n\nOur Navy and Marine Corps Team is the most powerful, capable, and lethal Force this world has ever seen.\n\nI encourage all Floridians to come out this week and engage with Sailors, Marines, Coast Guardsmen and women, and all the civilians who support them -- come listen to the stories of service and see where you can fit into the story.\n\nAnd if what you hear inspires you to answer the call and join our ranks -- we look forward to welcoming you aboard our naval family.\n\nThank you again, Mayor Levine Cava, for hosting our Sailors and Marines here in beautiful Miami -- we look forward to an incredible week that will strengthen the bonds between our naval services and all of you who call Miami and South Florida home.\n\nMay God bless you and our Sailors, Marines, and service members all over the world.", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz",

{"id": 231262808, "title": "&#8216;Presumed Innocent&#8217;:  Everything To Know So Far About Jake Gyllenhaal&#8217;s Legal Thriller Series On Apple TV+", "text": "Plot The set up of this show from executive producers David E. Kelley and J.J. Abrams vaguely resembles another Apple TV+ series, Defending Jacob (2020). That show starred Chris Evans as a prosecutor whose son was accused of murder, and plenty of ethical fallout was involved as Evans\u2019 character wrestled with whether his competing interests for the district attorney\u2019s office and his family could be reconciled. In Presumed Innocent, Gyllenhaal portrays a prosecutor who is accused of murdering a colleague. Even messier? Oh yes. The eight-part series is based upon Scott Turow\u2019s same-named book (previously adapted in an 1990 movie starring Harrison Ford), which paints an incredibly damning portrait of this prosecutor as a married man who was having an affair with that now-murdered colleague. (David E. Kelley loves doing these dirty-dog shows, doesn\u2019t he?) We shall see whether Kelley and Co. adhere to the outcomes that Rusty must deal with following revelations of his affair in the book. The show\u2019s trailer doesn\u2019t shy away from dragging the dude, but Kelley is also a master at pulling off twists, and not everything in a trailer is necessarily as it seems. Heck, even Gyllenhaal wasn\u2019t sure whether his character was really guilty or innocent, as detailed in his recent Hollywood Reporter interview: During the making of the eight-episode series, Gyllenhaal\u2019s first TV show, the actor didn\u2019t know, he says, whether Rusty was actually guilty. \u201cYou\u2019re waiting to know which way to turn, playing the potential variations of what possibly could be,\u201d he says. Also, Gyllenhaal\u2019s filming for Roadhouse overlapped with this Apple TV+ series, so he\u2019s more fit than he should be for the role: At points in the show, Rusty runs on a treadmill to deal with his stress. Because Gyllenhaal is an avid runner in his downtime, and was still in the midst of shooting Road House during the Presumed Innocent production, Rusty\u2019s level of fitness does strain credulity a bit for a middle-aged lawyer with two kids. \u201cThey\u2019re like \u2018OK, we\u2019re going to get you on a treadmill and we need you to be really out of breath and sweating,'\u201d Gyllenhaal recalls of a particular scene. \u201cWe waited a long time for me to be out of breath. I was like, \u2018I\u2019m so sorry.\u2019 They\u2019re like, \u2018Well, turn it up to a sprint.'\u201d So, there\u2019s sprinting Gyllenhall to enjoy. From the show\u2019s synopsis: Starring Gyllenhaal in the lead role of chief deputy prosecutor Rusty Sabich, the series takes viewers on a gripping journey through a horrific murder that upends the Chicago Prosecuting Attorney\u2019s office when one of its own is suspected of the crime. The series explores obsession, sex, politics, and the power and limits of love, as the accused fights to hold his family and marriage together. Cast Gyllenhaal will be accompanied by Ruth Negga, Bill Camp, Elizabeth Marvel, Peter Sarsgaard, O-T Fagbenle, and Renate Reinsve.", "summary": "<figure class=\"post-thumbnail\">\n\t\t<img width=\"1600\" height=\"660\" src=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/presumed-innocent-lg.png?w=1600&amp;h=660&amp;crop=1\" class=\"attachment-article-featured size-article-featured\" alt=\"Presumed Innocent Jake Gyllenhaal\" decoding=\"async\" fetchpriority=\"high\" srcset=\"https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/presumed-innocent-lg.png?resize=1600,660 1600w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/presumed-innocent-lg.png?resize=1200,495 1200w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/presumed-innocent-lg.png?resize=852,351 852w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/presumed-innocent-lg.png?resize=1024,422 1024w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/presumed-innocent-lg.png?resize=720,297 720w, https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/presumed-innocent-lg.png?resize=420,173 420w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) calc(100vw - 20px), (max-width: 1024px) calc(100vw - 40px), (min-width: 1025px) 1024px, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-captio", "url": "https://uproxx.com/tv/presumed-innocent-scott-turow-jake-gyllenhaal-season-1-release-info-trailer/", "image": "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/presumed-innocent-feat.png?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 14:00:55", "author": "Kimberly Ricci", "authors": ["Kimberly Ricci"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.333}

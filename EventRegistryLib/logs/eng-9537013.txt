physical contact, the infection is not highly contagious.\n\nIt is believed to be spread chiefly by coughing or sneezing.\n\nDr Sarah Inskip, a bioarchaeologist at the the University of Leicester,

squirrels linked to spread of leprosy during medieval times", "body": "By Stephen Beech via SWNS\n\nRed squirrels spread a deadly disease to people in medieval England, reveals new research.\n\nEvidence from archaeological sites in Winchester, Hampshire, shows that the nut-loving rodents once served as an important host for Mycobacterium leprae strains that causes leprosy in humans.\n\nStudy senior author Professor Verena Schuenemann said: \"With our genetic analysis we were able to identify red squirrels as the first ancient animal host of leprosy.\n\n\"The medieval red squirrel strain we recovered is more closely related to medieval human strains from the same city than to strains isolated from infected modern red squirrels.\n\n\"Overall, our results point to an independent circulation of M. leprae strains between humans and red squirrels during the Medieval Period.\"\n\nCo-author Dr. Sarah Inskip said: \"Our findings highlight the importance of involving archaeological material, in particular animal remains, into studying the long-term zoonotic potential of this disease, as only a direct comparison of ancient human and animal strains allows reconstructions of potential transmission events across time.\"\n\nLeprosy is one of the oldest recorded diseases in human history and is still prevalent today in Asia, Africa, and South America.\n\nScientists have traced the evolutionary history of the mycobacterium that causes it, but didn't know how it may have spread to people from animals in the past beyond some hints that English red squirrels may have served as a host.\n\nFor the new study, published in the journal Current Biology, the research team studied 25 human and 12 squirrel samples to look for M. leprae at two archaeological sites in the historic city of Winchester.\n\nThe city was known for its leprosarium - a hospital for people with leprosy - and connections to the fur trade.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, squirrel fur was widely used to trim and line garments.\n\nMany people at the time also kept squirrels, trapping them in the wild and raising them as pets.\n\nThe research team sequenced and reconstructed four genomes representing medieval strains of M. leprae, including one from a red squirrel.\n\nAn analysis to understand their relationships found that all of them belonged to a single branch on the M. leprae family tree.\n\nThe researchers also showed a close relationship between the squirrel strain and a newly constructed one isolated from the remains of a medieval human.\n\nThey say that the medieval squirrel strain is more closely related to human strains from medieval Winchester than to modern squirrel strains from England, indicating that the infection was circulating between people and animals in the Middle Ages in a way that hadn't been detected before.\n\nProf Schuenemann, of the University of Basel, Switzerland, said: \"The history of leprosy is far more complex than previously thought.\n\n\"There has been no consideration of the role that animals might have played in the transmission and spread of the disease in the past, and as such, our understanding of leprosy's history is incomplete until these hosts are considered.\n\n\"This finding is relevant to today as animal hosts are still not considered, even though they may be significant in terms of understanding the disease's contemporary persistence despite attempts at eradication.\"\n\nDr. Inskip, of the University of Leicester, added: \"In the wake of Covid-19, animal hosts are

infection was circulating between people and animals in the Middle Ages in a way that hadn't been detected before.\n\nProf Schuenemann, of the University of Basel, Switzerland, said: \"The history of leprosy is far more complex than previously thought.\n\n\"There has been no consideration of the role that animals might have played in the transmission and spread of the disease in the past, and as such, our understanding of leprosy's history is incomplete until these hosts are considered.\n\n\"This finding is relevant to today as animal hosts are still not considered, even though they may be significant in terms of understanding the disease's contemporary persistence despite attempts at eradication.\"\n\nDr. Inskip, of the University of Leicester, added: \"In the wake of Covid-19, animal hosts are now becoming a focus of attention for understanding disease appearance and persistence.\n\n\"Our research shows that there is a long history", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType":

Indeed the study reports that in 1384 alone, 377,200 squirrel skins were imported to England from Scandinavia and other places.\n\nHowever squirrels were also widely kept as pets, offering another route of contact with humans.\n\n\"Both mechanisms are possible. And they're not mutually exclusive either,\" said Inskip.\n\nInskip said the study also had implications for people suffering from leprosy today.\n\n\"Maybe we need to go and look at the animals that are around these communities,\" she said. \"Because perhaps it's possible that some of these animals maybe have the bacteria and that's maybe why the disease is hanging around.\"", "source": {"uri":

While scientists have traced the evolutionary history of the mycobacterium that causes it, they didn't know how it may have spread to people from animals in the past beyond some hints that red squirrels in England may have served as a host.\n\nIn the new study, the researchers studied 25 human and 12 squirrel samples to look for M. leprae at two archaeological sites in Winchester. The city was well known for its leprosarium (a hospital for people with leprosy) and connections to the fur trade. In the Middle Ages, squirrel fur was widely used to trim and line garments. Many people also kept squirrels trapped wild squirrels as kits in the wild and raised them as pets.\n\nThe researchers sequenced and reconstructed four genomes representing medieval strains of M. leprae, including one from a red squirrel. An analysis to understand their relationships found that all of them belonged to a single branch on the M. leprae family tree. They also showed a close relationship between the squirrel strain and a newly constructed one isolated from the remains of a medieval person. They report that the medieval squirrel strain is more closely related to human strains from medieval Winchester than to modern squirrel strains from England, indicating that the infection was circulating between people and animals in the Middle Ages in a way that hadn't been detected before.\n\n\"The history of leprosy is far more complex than previously thought,\" Schuenemann said. \"There has been no consideration of the role that animals might have played in the transmission and spread of the disease in the past, and as such, our understanding of leprosy's history is incomplete until these hosts are considered. This finding is relevant to today as animal hosts are still not considered, even though they may be significant in terms of understanding the disease's contemporary persistence despite attempts at eradication.\"\n\n\"In the wake of COVID-19, animal hosts are now becoming a focus of attention for understanding disease appearance and persistence,\" Inskip said. \"Our research shows that there is a long history of zoonotic diseases, and they have had and continue to have a big impact on us.\"\n\n###\n\nThis work was supported by the Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation SERI funded ERC Consolidator Project \"RESERVOIR,\" the University of Zurich's University Research Priority Program \"Evolution in Action: From Genomes to Ecosystems,\" and the Fondation Raoul Follereau and the Heiser Program of the New York Community Trust for Research in Leprosy.\n\nCurrent Biology, Urban, Blom, and Avanzi et al.: \"Ancient Mycobacterium leprae genome reveals medieval English red squirrels as animal leprosy host.\" https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(24)00446-9\n\nCurrent Biology (@CurrentBiology), published by Cell Press, is a bimonthly journal that features papers across all areas of biology.

Accounts of the disease, which primarily affects the skin and peripheral nervous system, appear in ancient writings across various civilizations, but you may be surprised to learn that the World Health Organization still records over 200,000 new cases every year.\n\nNowadays, leprosy is treatable with a long course of three antibiotics, but if people are unable to access this treatment the condition can progress to cause permanent disability. And it's not just the physical effects - leprosy patients have always endured stigma and discrimination, and this continues even though we now understand that it's much less contagious than our forebears believed.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, it was still thought best to isolate those with leprosy from the rest of the population, and one way of doing that was to build special \"hospitals\" called leprosariums. One such facility was located in Winchester, a small city in the South of England, which also had strong connections to the fur trade. This is where the team sourced the archaeological samples for their analysis.\n\nThey studied 25 human and 12 red squirrel samples, identifying, sequencing, and reconstructing the genomes of four strains of M. leprae - including one from a squirrel. Looking more closely at the genomes, the scientists found they all belonged to the same branch of the M. leprae family tree, and that the medieval squirrel strain showed greater similarity to medieval human strains than to modern squirrel strains.\n\n\"The medieval red squirrel strain we recovered is more closely related to medieval human strains from the same city than to strains isolated from infected modern red squirrels. Overall, our results point to an independent circulation of M. leprae strains between humans and red squirrels during the Medieval Period,\" Schuenemann explained.\n\nThis is an important step forward in our understanding of a disease that has been with us for pretty much as long as we have had written records.\n\n\"There has been no consideration of the role that animals might have played in the transmission and spread of the disease in the past, and as such, our understanding of leprosy's history is incomplete until these hosts are considered,\" Schuenemann added, noting that looking to potential animal reservoirs will also be important in continuing efforts to control the disease.\n\nBeyond leprosy, spillover events - when diseases jump from animals into humans and become what we call zoonotic - are on people's minds more than ever these days. It's widely accepted that COVID-19 started like this, and people are anxiously watching to see if H5N1 avian flu might be heading the same way.\n\nAs co-author Sarah Inskip of the University of Leicester said, \"Our research shows that there is a long history of zoonotic diseases, and they have had and continue to have a big impact on us.\"", "source": {"uri": "iflscience.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IFLScience"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_squirrel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Red squirrel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leprosy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Leprosy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fur", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squirrel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Squirrel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Middle Ages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_leprae", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mycobacterium leprae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Genetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bacteria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recorded_history", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Recorded history"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antibiotic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fur_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fur trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peripheral nervous system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Basel", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Basel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Archaeology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Skin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stigma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social stigma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civilization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winchester", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Winchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Winchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Leicester", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Leicester"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Child_Health/Immunizations", "label": "dmoz/Health/Child Health/Immunizations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Wildlife", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Wildlife", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://assets.iflscience.com/assets/articleNo/74057/aImg/75982/red-squirrel-meta.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537013", "eventUri": "eng-9537013", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 225, "relevance": 1}

Leprosy is mainly caused by Mycobacterium leprae, a type of bacteria that uses a few species as hosts, including humans, nine-banded armadillos, and red squirrels.\n\nIn their research -- published today in Current Biology -- the researchers studied 25 human samples and 12 squirrel samples from two sites in Winchester, enabling them to reconstruct four medieval genomes of M. leprae, one of which came from a squirrel. Winchester is in Hampshire and became the capital of Wessex in 871, at the beginning of the reign of King Alfred the Great.\n\nOne of the archaeological sites the team investigated in Winchester was St Mary Magdalen's leprosarium, a hospital for leprosy patients. The team found a close relationship between the strains in the squirrel and the humans.\n\n\"With our genetic analysis we were able to identify red squirrels as the first ancient animal host of leprosy,\" said Verena Schuenemann, an archaeologist at the University of Basel in Switzerland and the senior author of the study, in a Cell release. \"The medieval red squirrel strain we recovered is more closely related to medieval human strains from the same city than to strains isolated from infected modern red squirrels.\"\n\nSchuenemann specializes in the genomics of ancient pathogens. In the study, the team found that the bacterial strain in the medieval squirrels is more closely related to some of the strains in the medieval residents of Winchester than the strains present in modern red squirrels.\n\nAs noted by the team in the study, squirrels were regularly kept as pets in England in medieval times and squirrel fur was widely used in garments across Europe during the Middle Ages, many of which made their way to England through trade. In 1384, the English customs accounts reported some 15,000 animal skin imports that weren't squirrels. Meanwhile, 377,200 squirrel skins were imported. If English customs was playing a numbers game to reduce the amount of leprosy in the country, they weren't doing themselves any favors.\n\nThough the transmission between the two species couldn't be made explicitly certain, the strains in the squirrel and in the humans were closely related and \"its presence in both species from the same city and time suggests cross-species infection,\" the team wrote.\n\n\"This research, along with recent findings of leprosy in modern wild armadillos in the Americas, wild red squirrels in the UK, and potential insect vectors, could open the medical debate to more seriously consider the possible role of animal hosts in leprosy persistence today,\" the team added.\n\nAnimals still host zoonotic diseases that can wreak havoc in humans (remember covid-19?). There's now a flurry of concern about H5N1 -- a strain of bird flu that has recently been found in goats, cows, and humans. Understanding the transmission of such diseases in even centuries-old instances can help scientists understand how transmission occurs, whether in squirrels or other critters.", "source": {"uri":

Both sets of bones contained evidence of a strain of Mycobacterium leprae, the bacterium that causes leprosy.\n\n(CN) -- The history of leprosy has been rewritten, thanks to a study published Friday in Current Biology. Now, the humble red squirrel plays a major role in the narrative.\n\n\"The history of leprosy is far more complex than previously thought,\" senior author Verena Schuenemann, from Switzerland's University of Basel, said in a press release. \"There has been no consideration of the role that animals might have played in the transmission and spread of the disease in the past, and as such, our understanding of leprosy's history is incomplete until these hosts are considered.\"\n\nAs one of the earliest diseases identified by humans, leprosy was widely feared, and for a good reason: The disease can cause nerve damage, lesions and severe deformations. Those infected were often confined to leper colonies, or leprosariums, to stop the spread of the disease.\n\nHowever, researchers have discovered that medieval men and women had more to worry about than infected people. A newly published genetic analysis suggests that the disease was spread by a common rodent.\n\n\"With our genetic analysis we were able to identify red squirrels as the first ancient animal host of leprosy,\" said Schuenemann.\n\nThe researchers analyzed 12th-century human and squirrel bones recovered from around the St. Mary Magdeleine leprosarium in Winchester, UK. Both sets of bones contained evidence of a strain of Mycobacterium leprae, the bacterium that causes leprosy.\n\n\"Overall, our results point to an independent circulation of M. leprae strains between humans and red squirrels during the Medieval Period,\" said Schuenemann.\n\nIn medieval England, there were more than enough opportunities for red squirrels to spread leprosy to humans. This is especially true in Winchester, a city that served as a center for processing and trading the pelts of red squirrels, which were used to trim and line clothing.\n\nThese pelts were so highly sought-after that the checkered pattern of a processed form, known as Vair, became a common pattern in medieval heraldry. Red squirrels were also commonly captured and raised as pets.\n\n\"Our findings highlight the importance of involving archaeological material, in particular animal remains, into studying the long-term zoonotic potential of this disease, as only a direct comparison of ancient human and animal strains allows reconstructions of potential transmission events across time,\" said Sarah Inskip of the University of Leicester, UK, a co-author on the study.\n\nIn all, researchers reconstructed the genomes of four medieval-era strains of M. leprae: three from human remains and one from a red squirrel. All four strains were found to be from the same branch of the bacterial family tree.\n\n\"The medieval red squirrel strain we recovered is more closely related to medieval human strains from the same city than to strains isolated from infected modern red squirrels,\" said Schuenemann.\n\nThe researchers contend that this discovery is more than a historic curiosity. They say scientists should consider whether animals are spreading leprosy to humans in the modern day. Leprosy has been discovered recently in armadillos and ticks, both of which could be vectors for the disease.\n\nTheir findings can apply to more than just leprosy.

Overall, our results point to the circulation of leprosy bacteria strains between humans and red squirrels during the medieval period.\"\n\nSarah Inskip, of the University of Leicester, UK, who also worked on the study, added: \"In the wake of Covid-19, animal hosts are now becoming a focus of attention for understanding disease appearance and persistence.\n\n\"Our research shows that there is a long history of zoonotic diseases, and they have had and continue to have a big impact on us.\"\n\nWinchester was well known for its leprosarium - a hospital for people with leprosy - and connections to the fur trade.\n\nIn the Middle Ages, squirrel fur was widely used to trim and line garments. Many people also kept squirrels trapped wild squirrels as kits in the wild and raised them as pets.\n\nThe animals are likely to pose the biggest threat while living although it's possible they could have been contagious after death, especially in the early stages, for example through fur products, the researchers said.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Cell Press, involved researchers from Leicester University who analysed 25 human and 12 squirrel samples to look for Mycobacterium leprae, a bacteria that causes leprosy, at two archaeological sites in Winchester.\n\nThe researchers sequenced and reconstructed four genomes representing strains of M leprae from the 10th and 11th centuries, including one from a red squirrel. An analysis to understand their relationships found that all of them belonged to a single branch on the M. leprae family tree.\n\nThis is not the earliest known case of animals infecting humans (or the other way round) with tuberculosis being one earlier example.\n\nFor example, humans are thought to have acquired tubercolosis (TB) from cattle during the Neolithic revolution around 10,000 years ago, when people first took up farming.\n\nOther examples of animals infecting humans include the Black Death, around AD1350, which originated from marmots in Asia and was likely transmitted by infected flea bites.\n\nThe 1918 Spanish flu is also thought to have come from birds.\n\nMore recently, Covid has been linked animals that were being sold for meat at the Huanan wildlife market in Wuhan, China. Most recent studies suggest raccoon dogs could be behind the outbreak of Covid-19 in humans - though investigations into the source of the pandemic continue.\n\nConcerns that bird flu could mutate into the next human pandemic are never far away.\n\nLeprosy is one of the oldest recorded diseases in human history and is still prevalent to this day in Asia, Africa, and South America.\n\nThe last case of leprosy in humans in Britain was in 1798, although the disease is still in squirrels in Britain today - albeit it has only been found in a handful of isolated populations. While transmission to humans in the is feasible it is very unlikely, the researchers say because \"people just don't have that kind of prolonged contact with red squirrels in the UK anymore\".\n\nWhile scientists have traced the evolutionary history of the mycobacterium that causes it, they didn't know how it may have spread to people from animals in the past beyond some hints that red squirrels in England may have served as a host.\n\n\"The history of leprosy is far more complex than previously thought.

For hundreds of years, society's elites stitched red-squirrel pelts into luxurious floor-length capes and made the animals pets, cradling them in their lap and commissioning gold collars festooned with pearls. Human lives were so intertwined with those of red squirrels that one of history's most cursed diseases likely passed repeatedly between our species and theirs, according to new research that Walker-Meikle contributed to.\n\nUncomfortable questions about medieval squirrels first came up about a decade ago, after another group of researchers stumbled upon three populations of red squirrels -- one in Scotland, two on different English islands -- with odd-looking features: swollen lips, warty noses, skin on their ears that had grown thick and crusty. A search for microbial DNA in some of those squirrels' tissues revealed that they had leprosy. \"What's it doing in red squirrels?\" John Spencer, a microbiologist at Colorado State University, recalled thinking at the time. Scientists had long thought that leprosy affected only humans, until the 1970s, when they began to find the bacterium that causes it in armadillos too, Daniel Romero-Alvarez, an infectious-disease ecologist and epidemiologist at Universidad Internacional SEK, in Ecuador, told me. But that was in the Americas; in Europe, dogma held that leprosy had essentially vanished by about the 16th century. The most plausible explanation for the pathogen's presence in modern squirrels, Spencer told me, was that strains of it had been percolating in the rodents unnoticed for hundreds of years.\n\nBacterial genomes extracted from several of the infected British squirrels suggested that this was the case: Those sequences bore a strong resemblance to others previously pulled out of medieval human remains. The next step was proving that medieval squirrels carried the bacterium too, Verena Sch\u00fcnemann, a paleogeneticist at the University of Zurich, in Switzerland, and one of the new study's authors, told me. If those microbes were also genetically similar to ones found in medieval people, they'd show that leprosy had probably regularly jumped between rodents and humans.\n\nRead: Tuberculosis got to South America through ... seals?\n\nSch\u00fcnemann teamed up with Sarah Inskip, an archaeologist at the University of Leicester, in the U.K., and set out to find an archaeological site in Britain with both human and squirrel remains. They zeroed in on the medieval city of Winchester, once famous for its fur-obsessed market patrons, as well as a large leprosarium. After analyzing dozens of samples from around Winchester, the team was able to extract just four leprosy genomes -- three from humans, one from the tiny foot bone of a squirrel. But those turned out to be enough. All four samples dated to about the High Middle Ages -- the oldest detection so far of leprosy in a nonhuman animal, Inskip told me. The genomes also all budded from the same branch of the leprosy family tree, sharing enough genetic similarities that they strongly indicated that medieval humans and squirrels were swapping the disease-causing bugs, Sch\u00fcnemann told me.\n\nStill, Sch\u00fcnemann wasn't sure exactly how that would have happened, given that transmitting a leprosy infection generally requires prolonged and close contact. So, hoping to fill in the blanks, she reached out to Walker-Meikle, who has extensively studied medieval pets.\n\nWalker-Meikle already had the exact type of evidence that Sch\u00fcnemann and her colleagues were looking for: medieval artwork depicting people cradling the animals, documents describing women taking them out for walks, financial accounts detailing purchases of flashy, rodent-size accessories and enclosures of the sort people today might buy for pet dogs, Walker-Meikle told me. Squirrels were so popular at the time that she found written references to the woes of a 13th-century archbishop who, despite years of pleading, couldn't get the nuns in his district to stop doting on the creatures. They were essentially akin, she said, to tiny lapdogs. Fur processing, too, would have provided ample opportunity for spread. In the High and Late Middle Ages, squirrel fur was the most popular fur used to trim and line garments, and clothes made with it were considered as high fashion as a Prada bag now, Sch\u00fcnemann told me. In a single year in the 14th century, the English royal household purchased nearly 80,000 squirrel-belly skins. Contact between squirrels and humans was so intimate that, throughout much of the Middle Ages, leprosy likely ping-ponged back and forth between the two species, Inskip told me.\n\nBut the team's work doesn't say anything about the origins of leprosy, which entered humans at least thousands of years ago. It also can't prove whether leprosy infiltrated humans or red squirrels first. It does further dispel the notion that leprosy is a problem only for humans, Romero-Alvarez told me. Armadillos may have picked up leprosy from humans relatively recently, after Europeans imported the pathogen to South America. The scaly mammals are now \"giving it back to humans,\" Spencer told me, especially, it seems, in parts of South America and the southern United States, where some communities hunt and eat the animals or keep them as pets.\n\nHuman-to-human transmission still accounts for the majority of leprosy spread, which remains uncommon overall. But Romero-Alvarez pointed out that the mere existence of the bacterium in another species, from which we and other creatures can catch it, makes the disease that much more difficult to control. \"Everybody believes that leprosy is gone,\" Claudio Guedes Salgado, an immunologist at Par\u00e1 Federal University, in Brazil, told me. \"But we have more leprosy than the world believes.\" The barriers between species are porous. And once a pathogen crosses over, that jump is impossible to fully undo.", "source": {"uri": "theatlantic.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Atlantic"}, "authors": [{"uri": "katherine_j_wu@theatlantic.com", "name": "Katherine J.

Now, the humble red squirrel plays a major role in the narrative.\n\n\"The history of leprosy is far more complex than previously thought,\" senior author Verena Schuenemann, from Switzerland's University of Basel, said in a press release. \"There has been no consideration of the role that animals might have played in the transmission and spread of the disease in the past, and as such, our understanding of leprosy's history is incomplete until these hosts are considered.\"\n\nAs one of the earliest diseases identified by humans, leprosy was widely feared, and for a good reason: The disease can cause nerve damage, lesions and severe deformations. Those infected were often confined to leper colonies, or leprosariums, to stop the spread of the disease.\n\nHowever, researchers have discovered that medieval men and women had more to worry about than infected people. A newly published genetic analysis suggests that the disease was spread by a common rodent.\n\n\"With our genetic analysis we were able to identify red squirrels as the first ancient animal host of leprosy,\" said Schuenemann.\n\nThe researchers analyzed 12th-century human and squirrel bones recovered from around the St. Mary Magdeleine leprosarium in Winchester, UK. Both sets of bones contained evidence of a strain of Mycobacterium leprae, the bacterium that causes leprosy.\n\n\"Overall, our results point to an independent circulation of M. leprae strains between humans and red squirrels during the Medieval Period,\" said Schuenemann.\n\nIn medieval England, there were more than enough opportunities for red squirrels to spread leprosy to humans. This is especially true in Winchester, a city that served as a center for processing and trading the pelts of red squirrels, which were used to trim and line clothing.\n\nThese pelts were so highly sought-after that the checkered pattern of a processed form, known as Vair, became a common pattern in medieval heraldry. Red squirrels were also commonly captured and raised as pets.\n\n\"Our findings highlight the importance of involving archaeological material, in particular animal remains, into studying the long-term zoonotic potential of this disease, as only a direct comparison of ancient human and animal strains allows reconstructions of potential transmission events across time,\" said Sarah Inskip of the University of Leicester, UK, a co-author on the study.\n\nIn all, researchers reconstructed the genomes of four medieval-era strains of M. leprae: three from human remains and one from a red squirrel. All four strains were found to be from the same branch of the bacterial family tree.\n\n\"The medieval red squirrel strain we recovered is more closely related to medieval human strains from the same city than to strains isolated from infected modern red squirrels,\" said Schuenemann.\n\nThe researchers contend that this discovery is more than a historic curiosity. They say scientists should consider whether animals are spreading leprosy to humans in the modern day. Leprosy has been discovered recently in armadillos and ticks, both of which could be vectors for the disease.\n\nTheir findings can apply to more than just leprosy. For instance, evidence shows that Covid-19 may have originated from racoon dogs.\n\n\"In the wake of Covid-19, animal hosts are now becoming a focus of attention for understanding disease appearance and persistence,\" Inskip said. \"Our research shows that there is a long history of zoonotic diseases, and they have had and continue to have a big impact on us.\"", "source": {"uri": "tittlepress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "tittlepress.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leper_colony", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Leper colony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_squirrel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Red squirrel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leprosy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Leprosy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Middle Ages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Genetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_leprae", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mycobacterium leprae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_Biology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Current Biology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fur", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lesion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winchester", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Winchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Winchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Switzerland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rodent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squirrel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Squirrel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bacteria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease_vector", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Disease vector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraldry", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heraldry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoonosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zoonosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armadillo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Armadillo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tick", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Leicester", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Leicester"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raccoon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Raccoon"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Wildlife", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Wildlife", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://imagedelivery.net/wKQ19LTSBT0ARz08tkssqQ/www.courthousenews.com/2024/05/Red-Squirrel-in-England.jpg/w=800", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537013", "eventUri": "eng-9537013", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-19", "textStart": 3293, "textEnd": 3299}], "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 222, "relevance": 1}

This indicates that the infection probably spread back and forth between squirrels and people in England in the Middle Ages.\n\n\"There were a lot of opportunities for transmission in medieval Winchester,\" says Verena Sch\u00fcnemann at the University of Basel, Switzerland, who also worked on the study.

Further results revealed a link between the pathogens found in the medieval rodents and those in the local human population during that period.\n\nSkin spots, deformed noses, ulcers: leprosy, is an infectious disease that can bring about some serious symptoms. The bacterium responsible, Mycobacterium leprae, which still infects around 200,000 people each year especially in the Global South, also has a long history in Europe. The international research group led by paleogeneticist Professor Verena Sch\u00fcnemann (University of Basel, formerly University of Zurich) used archaeological findings to identify red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris) as hosts for M. leprae in medieval England. The researchers also discovered that the leprosy bacteria in medieval squirrels were closely related to those isolated from medieval human skeletons from the same region. The results were published in the journal \"Current Biology\".\n\nFrom squirrels to humans or vice versa?\n\n\"This similarity shows us that leprosy bacteria were probably transmitted between animals and humans at that time,\" says Sch\u00fcnemann. However, she stresses that, based on current knowledge, it is not clear how this took place. \"We don't know whether the squirrels infected humans or whether humans were the ones to introduce the disease to the animals,\" says Sch\u00fcnemann.\n\nThere were certainly a number of points of contact between humans and squirrels during the Middle Ages. One key aspect was fur trade, which provided the highly sought-after squirrel fur for the upper echelons of society. Especially in the 11th and 12th centuries, for example, entire coats made of squirrel fur were produced for the various royal families. Furthermore, squirrels were also kept as pets, in royal courts as well as nunneries.\n\nGenetic analysis from 20 milligrams\n\nFor their study, the researchers focused on the city of Winchester in southern England. The material necessary for the genetic analysis originates from two different archaeological sites within the city. The human remains were extracted from the location of a former leprosarium, a care facility specifically for people suffering from leprosy. The researchers were able to examine the medieval squirrels thanks to hand and foot bones found at a former skinner's shop. \"We carried out the genetic analyses on the squirrels' tiny hand and foot bones, which weigh between 20 and 30 milligrams. That is not a lot of material,\" explains Christian Urban, first author of the study.\n\nFor the researchers, the results are particularly important for predicting leprosy in the future. Because to this day, it is not completely clear how the disease spreads. \"Our One Health approach prioritizes finding out more about the role animals played in the spread of diseases in the past\", says Sch\u00fcnemann. \"A direct comparison between ancient animal and human strains enables us to reconstruct potential transmission events over time and helps to form conclusions about the long-term zoonotic potential of the disease\", she adds.\n\nThe results are therefore relevant for today, as animals still receive very little attention as hosts of leprosy, even though they may be important for understanding the current persistence of the disease despite all attempts to eradicate it.\n\n/Public Release.

medieval strains of M. leprae, including one from a red squirrel.\n\n\"The medieval red squirrel strain we recovered is more closely related to medieval human strains from the same city than to strains isolated from infected modern red squirrels,\" says Schuenemann.\n\n\"Overall, our results point to an independent circulation of M. leprae strains between humans and red squirrels during the Medieval Period.\n\n\"This finding is relevant to today as animal hosts are still not considered, even though they may be significant in terms of understanding the disease's contemporary persistence despite attempts at eradication.\"\n\nToday M. leprae is known to infect wild armadillos in the Americas, wild chimpanzees in West Africa, and red squirrels from Brownsea Island in the county of Dorset, England.\n\nGreater insight into animal hosts' contributions to the transmission of leprosy is essential to one day eradicating it.", "source": {"uri": "cosmosmagazine.com", "dataType":

Some strains matched those discovered in humans living in England 700 years ago, per Gizmodo.\n\nBased on this discovery, Sarah Inskip and her University of Leicester team investigated 25 skeletons from a medieval leprosy hospital site in Winchester and 12 red squirrels from a local fur business from the 11th to 13th centuries.\n\nMost human bones had leprosy-like lesions, whereas squirrel bones showed inflammation, suggesting the condition. After a genetic examination of the bones, M. leprae DNA was found in three humans and one red squirrel, making it the first non-human carrier of leprosy.\n\nThe three medieval humans and the medieval red squirrel's M. leprae strain were more closely related than they are to modern red squirrels, suggesting a transfer between squirrels and humans in medieval England.\n\nMedieval Winchester's leprosy hospital, fur trade, and squirrel pets allowed transmission, according to Verena Sch\u00fcnemann of the University of Basel, Switzerland.\n\nModern squirrel leprosy strains and medieval specimens may be unrelated, suggesting multiple transmission episodes between humans and squirrels.\n\nAccording to former US Public Health Service official Richard Truman, certain present red squirrel populations contain leprosy, although the danger of transmission to people is low, underscoring the need to understand M. leprae's ecological history.\n\nToday, few people are vulnerable to leprosy, and prolonged contact with an infected animal is needed to get infected, according to Dr. Sarah Inskip.\n\nBritain's natural red squirrel population is just 160,000, limiting the risk of illness.\n\nRead Also: Biologists Observe Orangutan Using Healing Plants to Treat Wound, Hinting at Animal Self-Medication\n\n(Photo: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images) A red squirrel feeds in the Trosssachs on September 28, 2018 in Aberfoyle, Scotland.\n\nThe crew investigated Winchester's St. Mary Magdalen's leprosarium, a medieval leprosy hospital. Their investigation established a link between red squirrels and human strains.\n\nSenior author Verena Schuenemann, an archaeologist at the University of Basel in Switzerland, told Cell, \"With our genetic analysis, we were able to identify red squirrels as the first ancient animal host of leprosy.\"\n\nAs per a New Scientist report, she said that medieval red squirrel disease is genetically closer to Winchester's medieval population than current red squirrels.\n\nSchuenemann and her team, who investigate ancient pathogen genomes, found that medieval England kept squirrels as pets and used their fur in European clothes. The fur frequently arrived via trade channels. In 1384, squirrel skins outnumbered other animal skin imports to England.\n\nEnglish norms did little to reduce the flood of squirrel goods, which may have spread leprosy in the region.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, leprosy appears in over 120 countries annually, with over 200,000 new cases. Less than 1 case per 10,000 people are targeted to eliminate leprosy as a public health hazard worldwide.\n\nPer World Health Assembly decision 44.9, this milestone was accomplished internationally in 2000 and in most countries by 2010.\n\nLowering new instances has been gradual worldwide and in WHO areas. Brazil, India, and Indonesia reported over 10,000 new cases in 2019.\n\nAdditionally, 13 nations, including Bangladesh, Ethiopia, and Nigeria, reported 1,000-10,000 additional cases.

And that's not just because squirrel fur was the most widely-use for garment trimmings in the High and Late Middle Ages - they were also kept as pets.\n\nBut a new study may explain why the two species have fallen out over the years: a deadly disease known as leprosy.\n\nJust who infected who first remains a mystery, but it now appears both humans and red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris) living around Winchester, England, between the 9th and 14th century carried the same strain of the leprosy-causing bacterium Mycobacterium leprae.\n\nZoonotic disease transfer has become a hot topic thanks to the interspecies spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in seriously bad PR for bats, a nation-wide mink cull, and grave concerns for our pets.\n\n\"There has been no consideration of the role that animals might have played in the transmission and spread of the disease in the past, and as such, our understanding of leprosy's history is incomplete until these hosts are considered,\" says archeologist Verena Sch\u00fcnemann from the University of Basel in Switzerland.\n\nThe medieval city of Winchester was well-known for its squirrel fur trade, and also for St Mary Magdalen's leprosarium (active between the 11th and 15th centuries), making it an ideal place to hunt for the genetic bridge linking leprosy in both medieval squirrels and humans.\n\nHuman remains with genetic markers of leprosy were an easy find, buried in the yard of St Mary Magdalen's. Genetic analysis on 25 human bones, some with lesions and some without, were used to create a reference for medieval strains of M. leprae.\n\nRed squirrel remains were found at Staple Gardens, an historic street in the city's center just two miles west of the leprosarium. Many kinds of animal foot bones were buried at what was once a medieval furrier. These were often discarded by skinners, because as you can imagine, the feet are generally a bit too fiddly to bother with.\n\nOnly one of twelve squirrel samples had sufficient evidence of leprosy to be used for comparison. But the strain of leprosy it had was a strong match for the three complete M. leprae genomes profiled from human remains.\n\n\"With our genetic analysis we were able to identify red squirrels as the first ancient animal host of leprosy,\" says Sch\u00fcnemann.\n\nHumans are the main hosts for leprosy bacteria, M. leprae and less commonly M. lepromatosis, which can cause nerve damage, blindness, loss of smell, hair loss, dry skin, and if untreated, highly stigmatized and harmful lesions.\n\nBut M. leprae is also known to infect wild animals, like armadillos in the Americas, chimpanzees in West Africa, and modern red squirrels on Brownsea Island in Britain, which harbor a medieval strain distinct from the one found in Winchester.\n\n\"The medieval red squirrel strain we recovered is more closely related to medieval human strains from the same city than to strains isolated from infected modern red squirrels,\" says Sch\u00fcnemann.\n\n\"A direct comparison between ancient animal and human strains enables us to reconstruct potential transmission events over time and helps to form conclusions about the long-term zoonotic potential of the disease.\"\n\nThe researchers hope these findings might inform modern attempts to manage and eradicate the disease, especially where interspecies transmission is involved.", "source": {"uri": "sciencealert.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Some modern red squirrels in the UK also have it, but there have been no reported cases of transmission to humans.\n\nIt's the first time a medieval animal has been identified as a host for the disease.\n\n\"The finding of leprosy in modern squirrels was surprising and then it's incredible that we found it in the medieval period,\" said study co-author Dr Sarah Inskip of the University of Leicester.\n\n\"It really goes against the narrative that it was a human disease specifically,\" she said.\n\nIt's not clear whether squirrels in medieval times gave humans leprosy or the other way around.\n\nBut the shared strain suggests it was circulating between people and animals in the Middle Ages in a way that hadn't been detected before, the researchers say.\n\nBack then, squirrel fur was used as a fine lining for clothes and some people also had pet squirrels. They were particularly popular with women.\n\nThe researchers studied 25 human and 12 squirrel samples.\n\nThe human remains came from a Winchester leprosarium (hospital for people with leprosy) and the squirrel remains from a nearby pit used by furriers.\n\nPrevious studies found that modern red squirrels from Scotland and Brownsea Island off the coast of southern England carry

diseases in human history and is still present in Asia, Africa, and South America.\n\nThere are more than 200,000 new cases reported every year.\n\nIt's not known exactly how it spreads between people

While scientists have traced the evolutionary history of the mycobacterium that causes it, they didn't know how it may have spread to people from animals in the past beyond some hints that red squirrels in England may have served as a host.\n\nIn the new study, the researchers studied 25 human and 12 squirrel samples to look for M. leprae at two archaeological sites in Winchester. The city was well known for its leprosarium (a hospital for people with leprosy) and connections to the fur trade. In the Middle Ages, squirrel fur was widely used to trim and line garments. Many people also kept squirrels, trapping wild squirrels as kits in the wild and raising them as pets.\n\nThe researchers sequenced and reconstructed four genomes representing medieval strains of M. leprae, including one from a red squirrel. An analysis to understand their relationships found that all of them belonged to a single branch on the M. leprae family tree. They also showed a close relationship between the squirrel strain and a newly constructed one isolated from the remains of a medieval person.\n\nThey report that the medieval squirrel strain is more closely related to human strains from medieval Winchester than to modern squirrel strains from England, indicating that the infection was circulating between people and animals in the Middle Ages in a way that hadn't been detected before.\n\n\"The history of leprosy is far more complex than previously thought,\" Schuenemann said. \"There has been no consideration of the role that animals might have played in the transmission and spread of the disease in the past, and as such, our understanding of leprosy's history is incomplete until these hosts are considered.

eradication.\"\n\n\"In the wake of COVID-19, animal hosts are now becoming a focus of attention for understanding disease appearance and persistence,\" Inskip said. \"Our research shows that there is

Further results revealed a link between the pathogens found in the medieval rodents and those in the local human population during that period.\n\nSkin spots, deformed noses, ulcers: leprosy, is an infectious disease that can bring about some serious symptoms. The bacterium responsible, Mycobacterium leprae, which still infects around 200,000 people each year especially in the Global South, also has a long history in Europe. The international research group led by paleogeneticist Professor Verena Sch\u00fcnemann (University of Basel, formerly University of Zurich) used archaeological findings to identify red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris) as hosts for M. leprae in medieval England. The researchers also discovered that the leprosy bacteria in medieval squirrels were closely related to those isolated from medieval human skeletons from the same region. The results were published in the journal \"Current Biology\".\n\nFrom squirrels to humans or vice versa?\n\n\"This similarity shows us that leprosy bacteria were probably transmitted between animals and humans at that time,\" says Sch\u00fcnemann. However, she stresses that, based on current knowledge, it is not clear how this took place. \"We don't know whether the squirrels infected humans or whether humans were the ones to introduce the disease to the animals,\" says Sch\u00fcnemann.\n\nThere were certainly a number of points of contact between humans and squirrels during the Middle Ages. One key aspect was fur trade, which provided the highly sought-after squirrel fur for the upper echelons of society. Especially in the 11 and 12 centuries, for example, entire coats made of squirrel fur were produced for the various royal families. Furthermore, squirrels were also kept as pets, in royal courts as well as nunneries.\n\nGenetic analysis from 20 milligrams\n\nFor their study, the researchers focused on the city of Winchester in southern England. The material necessary for the genetic analysis originates from two different archaeological sites within the city. The human remains were extracted from the location of a former leprosarium, a care facility specifically for people suffering from leprosy. The researchers were able to examine the medieval squirrels thanks to hand and foot bones found at a former skinner's shop. \"We carried out the genetic analyses on the squirrels' tiny hand and foot bones, which weigh between 20 and 30 milligrams. That is not a lot of material,\" explains Christian Urban, first author of the study.\n\nFor the researchers, the results are particularly important for predicting leprosy in the future. Because to this day, it is not completely clear how the disease spreads. \"Our One Health approach prioritizes finding out more about the role animals played in the spread of diseases in the past\", says Sch\u00fcnemann. \"A direct comparison between ancient animal and human strains enables us to reconstruct potential transmission events over time and helps to form conclusions about the long-term zoonotic potential of the disease\", she adds.\n\nThe results are therefore relevant for today, as animals still receive very little attention as hosts of leprosy, even though they may be important for understanding the current persistence of the disease despite all attempts to eradicate it.", "source": {"uri": "eurekalert.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "EurekAlert!"}, "authors": [],

While scientists have traced the evolutionary history of the mycobacterium that causes it, how it may have spread to people from animals in the past was not known beyond some hints that red squirrels in England may have served as a host.\n\nIn the new study, the researchers studied 25 human and 12 squirrel samples to look for M. leprae at two archaeological sites in Winchester. The city was well known for its leprosarium (a hospital for people with leprosy) and connections to the fur trade. In the Middle Ages, squirrel fur was widely used to trim and line garments. Many people also raised them as pets.\n\nThe researchers sequenced and reconstructed four genomes representing medieval strains of M. leprae, including one from a red squirrel. An analysis to understand their relationships found that all of them belonged to a single branch on the M. leprae family tree. They also showed a close relationship between the squirrel strain and a newly constructed one isolated from the remains of a medieval person, says a release. The study found that the medieval squirrel strain is more closely related to human strains from medieval Winchester than to modern squirrel strains from England, indicating that the infection was circulating between people and animals in the Middle Ages in a way that hadn't been detected before.\n\n\"These findings on the natural reservoir of M. leprae indicated that M. laprae circulates in more wild animals than we suspected, and zoonotic infection may contribute to the epidemic of leprosy. Therefore, it is inevitable that leprosy epidemics can persist for a long time in the future, and we should remain vigilant against the spread of M. leprae between humans and wildlife,\" they write.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_leprae", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mycobacterium leprae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_squirrel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Red squirrel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leprosy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Leprosy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squirrel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Squirrel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeology", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Archaeology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Middle Ages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winchester", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Winchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Winchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_history", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human history"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_English", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle English"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_Biology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Current Biology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armadillo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Armadillo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fur_trade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fur trade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DNA sequencing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fur", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Genome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Evolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimpanzee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chimpanzee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_reservoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Natural reservoir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoonosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zoonosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Epidemic"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal_Welfare", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Animal Welfare", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Sociobiology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Biology/Sociobiology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Wildlife", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Wildlife", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/og-image.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537013", "eventUri": "eng-9537013", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

It's also plagued squirrels since at least the Middle Ages, according to a new study. After analyzing squirrel bones dating to medieval England, researchers found that the furry critters carried a strain of a leprosy-causing bacterium strikingly similar to the one many Brits harbored centuries ago. The finding suggests the disease once bounced back and forth between humans and squirrels, which could help scientists understand how leprosy persists today.\n\n\"It's one of the first times we can actually identify pathogens in ancient animal remains to a conclusive level,\" says Maria Spyrou, a genomicist at the University of T\u00fcbingen who was not involved in the study, published today in Current Biology. Such archaeological evidence could help scientists understand \"why diseases emerge in some populations, why they decline, and perhaps ways to eradicate them,\" she adds.\n\nLeprosy, which can be caused by two bacterial species -- Mycobacterium leprae and M. lepromatosis -- is on the decline but still afflicts more than 200,000 people each year, mostly in Asia, Africa, and South America. It is spread mostly through prolonged contact with an infected person. The disease was long believed to occur only in humans, but since the 1970s, researchers have discovered M. leprae in nine-banded armadillos in North and South America -- which occasionally pass it on to people -- and in a few nonhuman primate species.\n\nIn 2016, scientists also discovered that red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris) in England carry a strain of M. leprae that's closely related to the one that circulated among medieval English humans. But how the disease might have jumped between the two species through history remained uncertain. \"It's in humans, and then it's in squirrels much later on, but we don't know anything about what's happening in between,\" says Sarah Inskip, an osteoarchaeologist at the University of Leicester and an author of the new study.\n\nMedieval squirrels, the team reasoned, might have answers. Middle Ages England was squirrel crazy: People kept the arboreal rodents as pets and used their furs to line and trim clothing. Inskip and her colleagues zeroed in on the medieval city of Winchester, which had not only skinners, tailors, and furriers, but also a hospital for leprosy patients. \"It was a really smart way of [looking for] more cases,\" Spyrou says.\n\nAfter sorting through remains previous archaeologists had gathered from a pit in Winchester, the team identified 12 red squirrel bones from between the 10th and 13th centuries that appeared swollen, rough, or damaged from infection or inflammation, the markers of leprosy. By crushing these bones and plucking fragments of DNA from the resulting powder, they managed to isolate and reconstruct a genome of an M. leprae strain -- the first ever recovered from archaeological remains of a nonhuman animal.\n\n\"I was amazed we actually got it,\" Inskip says. Archaeology tends to prioritize human remains, so the tiny bones the team had to work with were not all well-preserved or well-labeled -- nor was isolating pathogen DNA within them an easy task. \"It was a bit like looking for a needle in a haystack.\"\n\nTo the team's surprise, the medieval squirrel strain bore an even closer relation to medieval human strains gathered from the site of the leprosy hospital than to those taken from modern red squirrels. This indicates leprosy circulated between squirrels and humans in England during the Middle Ages, possibly \"ping-ponging\" between the two, Inskip says -- though how frequently remains uncertain. It's also unclear where and how the squirrels first picked up the disease.\n\nThe study shows why it's important to consider the history and ecology of diseases, not just how they infect people today, says Elizabeth Uhl, a veterinary pathologist at the University of Georgia who was not part of the study. \"If you want the whole story, you have to get the pieces from all the different disciplines,\" she says.\n\nAlthough there's no evidence of red squirrels infecting people in modern times, defining the contexts in which leprosy bounced between species in the past, Uhl explains, can help us anticipate future risks -- both with squirrels and other nonhuman carriers. Targeting only human infections might miss our relationships with these animals, she says, allowing the disease to persist.", "source": {"uri": "science.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "science.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_leprae", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mycobacterium leprae"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leprosy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Leprosy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squirrel", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Squirrel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Ages", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Middle Ages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bacteria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_squirrel", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Red squirrel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fur", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeology", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Archaeology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Species"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_T\u00fcbingen", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of T\u00fcbingen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_Biology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Current Biology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genome"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genomics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lesion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathogen", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pathogen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ecology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycobacterium_lepromatosis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mycobacterium lepromatosis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine-banded_armadillo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nine-banded armadillo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arboreal_locomotion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arboreal locomotion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_English", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle English"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Primate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Leicester", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Leicester"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winchester", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Winchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Winchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Georgia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Georgia"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Infectious_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Infectious Diseases", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Livestock", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Wildlife", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Wildlife", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Fish", "label": "dmoz/Health/Animal/Fish", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Animals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Animals", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://www.science.org/do/10.1126/science.za3c4ys/abs/_20240503_on_squirrels_leprosy_lede.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9537013", "eventUri": "eng-9537013", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

To be more precise, it's a red squirrel with a tan back, white belly, and tufted ears. For hundreds of years, society's elite have kept red squirrels as pets by sewing them into luxurious floor-length cloaks, holding them in their laps, and fashioning them into golden collars adorned with pearls. Because human life was closely intertwined with that of red squirrels, One of the most cursed diseases in history There may have been repeated passages between our species and theirs, according to new research contributed by Walker Meikle.\n\nUnpleasant questions about medieval squirrels first surfaced about 10 years ago, after another group of researchers accidentally discovered three populations of red squirrels. Scotlandtwo different british isles-He had strange characteristics, including swollen lips, a warty nose, and thick, crusty skin on his ears. A search for microbial DNA in some of the squirrel's tissues revealed that the squirrels had leprosy. \"What's going on inside a red squirrel?\" Colorado State University microbiologist John Spencer recalled thinking. For a long time, scientists believed that leprosy only infected humans, but Until the 1970sDaniel Romero-Alvarez, an infectious disease ecologist and epidemiologist at Ecuador's International University SEK, told me that the bacteria that causes armadillos was also starting to be discovered. But that was in the Americas. In Europe, it was established that leprosy had essentially disappeared. around 16th century. The most plausible explanation for the presence of the pathogen in modern squirrels, Spencer said, is that the strain has been infiltrating the rodent's body unnoticed for hundreds of years.\n\nBacterial genomes extracted from several infected British squirrels These sequences were very similar to other sequences previously extracted from medieval human remains. The next step was to prove that medieval squirrels also carried the bacterium, Verena Schuenemann, a paleogeneticist at the University of Zurich in Switzerland and one of the authors of the new study, told me. told. If the microbes were genetically similar to microbes found in medieval people, this would indicate that leprosy likely moved back and forth between rodents and humans on a regular basis.\n\nRead: Did tuberculosis reach South America through seals?\n\nWorking with archaeologist Sarah Inskip of the University of Leicester, Schuenemann set out to discover British sites containing both human and squirrel remains. They focused on the medieval city of Winchester, once famous for its fur-obsessed market patrons and large leper sanitariums. After analyzing dozens of samples taken from around Winchester, the research team was able to extract just four leprosy genomes. Three of them were from humans and one was from a small squirrel foot bone. But they turned out to be sufficient. All four samples date from the High Middle Ages and are the oldest cases of leprosy ever detected in non-human animals, Inskip said. The genomes also all bud from the same branch of the leprosy family tree and share sufficient genetic similarity, strongly indicating that medieval humans and squirrels were exchanging disease-causing insects. said Schuenemann.\n\nStill, Schuenemann wasn't sure exactly how that would happen, given that leprosy transmission generally requires close contact over a long period of time. So, hoping to fill her void, she contacted Mr. Walker Meikle. widely studied medieval pets.\n\nWalker Meikle already had the exact kind of evidence Schuenemann and others were looking for. Medieval artwork depicting people cradling animals, a document describing a woman taking her animals for a walk, and finances detailing the purchase of rodent-sized flashy accessories and enclosures for the animals. Accounts, etc. Walker Meikle told me it's the kind of thing people today might buy for their pet dogs. At the time, squirrels were so popular that the 13th-century archbishop who, despite years of pleading, could not get the nuns in her district to stop doting on them. I found a description of the suffering of They essentially resemble small pet dogs, she said. The processing of fur would also have provided ample opportunity for dissemination. From the High Middle Ages to the Late Middle Ages, squirrel fur was the most popular fur used for trimming and lining clothing, and clothing made from squirrel fur is now considered as high fashion as a Prada bag. Schuenemann said. In just one year of the 14th century, the British royal family Approximately 80,000 pieces of squirrel belly skin. Because contact between squirrels and humans was so intimate, Inskip said leprosy likely passed back and forth between squirrels and humans throughout most of the medieval period.\n\nRead: Admit it, squirrels are just rats\n\nHowever, the team's study says nothing about the origins of leprosy, which infected humans at least several thousand years ago. It is also not possible to prove whether leprosy first entered humans or whether it was introduced by red squirrels. Romero-Alvarez said it further dispels the idea that leprosy is only a human problem. Armadillos may have acquired leprosy from humans relatively recently, after Europeans imported the pathogen into South America. The scaly mammal is now \"giving it back to humans,\" Spencer told me. especiallyApparently part of South America Southern United Statessome communities hunt animals for food or keep them as pets.\n\nAlthough most of the spread of leprosy is still due to human-to-human transmission, it remains rare overall. But Professor Romero \u00c1lvarez pointed out that the mere presence of the bacterium in another species means that we and other organisms can be infected by it, making the disease even more difficult to control. \"Everyone believes that leprosy is gone,\" Claudio Guedes Salgado, an immunologist at Brazil's Federal University of Par\u00e1, told me. \"But we have more lepers than the world thinks.\" The barrier between species is porous. And once a pathogen gets in, it's impossible to completely reverse that jump.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Tawny-backed, white-bellied, tufted-eared red squirrels, to be exact. For hundreds of years, society's elites stitched red-squirrel pelts into luxurious floor-length capes and made the animals pets, cradling them in their lap and commissioning gold collars festooned with pearls. Human lives were so intertwined with those of red squirrels that one of history's most cursed diseases likely passed repeatedly between our species and theirs, according to new research that Walker-Meikle contributed to.\n\nUncomfortable questions about medieval squirrels first came up about a decade ago, after another group of researchers stumbled upon three populations of red squirrels -- one in Scotland, two on different English islands -- with odd-looking features: swollen lips, warty noses, skin on their ears that had grown thick and crusty. A search for microbial DNA in some of those squirrels' tissues revealed that they had leprosy. \"What's it doing in red squirrels?\" John Spencer, a microbiologist at Colorado State University, recalled thinking at the time. Scientists had long thought that leprosy affected only humans, until the 1970s, when they began to find the bacterium that causes it in armadillos too, Daniel Romero-Alvarez, an infectious-disease ecologist and epidemiologist at Universidad Internacional SEK, in Ecuador, told me. But that was in the Americas; in Europe, dogma held that leprosy had essentially vanished by about the 16th century. The most plausible explanation for the pathogen's presence in modern squirrels, Spencer told me, was that strains of it had been percolating in the rodents unnoticed for hundreds of years.\n\nBacterial genomes extracted from several of the infected British squirrels suggested that this was the case: Those sequences bore a strong resemblance to others previously pulled out of medieval human remains. The next step was proving that medieval squirrels carried the bacterium too, Verena Sch\u00fcnemann, a paleogeneticist at the University of Zurich, in Switzerland, and one of the new study's authors, told me. If those microbes were also genetically similar to ones found in medieval people, they'd show that leprosy had probably regularly jumped between rodents and humans.\n\nRead: Tuberculosis got to South America through ... seals?\n\nSch\u00fcnemann teamed up with Sarah Inskip, an archaeologist at the University of Leicester, in the U.K., and set out to find an archaeological site in Britain with both human and squirrel remains. They zeroed in on the medieval city of Winchester, once famous for its fur-obsessed market patrons, as well as a large leprosarium. After analyzing dozens of samples from around Winchester, the team was able to extract just four leprosy genomes -- three from humans, one from the tiny foot bone of a squirrel. But those turned out to be enough. All four samples dated to about the High Middle Ages -- the oldest detection so far of leprosy in a nonhuman animal, Inskip told me. The genomes also all budded from the same branch of the leprosy family tree, sharing enough genetic similarities that they strongly indicated that medieval humans and squirrels were swapping the disease-causing bugs, Sch\u00fcnemann told me.\n\nStill, Sch\u00fcnemann wasn't sure exactly how that would have happened, given that transmitting a leprosy infection generally requires prolonged and close contact. So, hoping to fill in the blanks, she reached out to Walker-Meikle, who has extensively studied medieval pets.\n\nWalker-Meikle already had the exact type of evidence that Sch\u00fcnemann and her colleagues were looking for: medieval artwork depicting people cradling the animals, documents describing women taking them out for walks, financial accounts detailing purchases of flashy, rodent-size accessories and enclosures of the sort people today might buy for pet dogs, Walker-Meikle told me. Squirrels were so popular at the time that she found written references to the woes of a 13th-century archbishop who, despite years of pleading, couldn't get the nuns in his district to stop doting on the creatures. They were essentially akin, she said, to tiny lapdogs. Fur processing, too, would have provided ample opportunity for spread. In the High and Late Middle Ages, squirrel fur was the most popular fur used to trim and line garments, and clothes made with it were considered as high fashion as a Prada bag now, Sch\u00fcnemann told me. In a single year in the 14th century, the English royal household purchased nearly 80,000 squirrel-belly skins. Contact between squirrels and humans was so intimate that, throughout much of the Middle Ages, leprosy likely ping-ponged back and forth between the two species, Inskip told me.\n\nRead: Admit it, squirrels are just tree rats\n\nBut the team's work doesn't say anything about the origins of leprosy, which entered humans at least thousands of years ago. It also can't prove whether leprosy infiltrated humans or red squirrels first. It does further dispel the notion that leprosy is a problem only for humans, Romero-Alvarez told me. Armadillos may have picked up leprosy from humans relatively recently, after Europeans imported the pathogen to South America. The scaly mammals are now \"giving it back to humans,\" Spencer told me, especially, it seems, in parts of South America and the southern United States, where some communities hunt and eat the animals or keep them as pets.\n\nHuman-to-human transmission still accounts for the majority of leprosy spread, which remains uncommon overall. But Romero-Alvarez pointed out that the mere existence of the bacterium in another species, from which we and other creatures can catch it, makes the disease that much more difficult to control. \"Everybody believes that leprosy is gone,\" Claudio Guedes Salgado, an immunologist at Par\u00e1 Federal University, in Brazil, told me. \"But we have more leprosy than the world believes.\" The barriers between species are porous. And once a pathogen crosses over, that jump is impossible to fully undo.", "source": {"uri": "tittlepress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "tittlepress.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Researchers examined the bones of red squirrels from an ancient furrier, along with the bones of leprosy victims who lived at about the same time in the UK roughly 900 years ago, reports the Guardian. To their surprise, they discovered that one of the squirrels had the same strain of leprosy as the humans, suggesting that the disease was passing between the two species way back when, per the BBC.\n\n\"It really goes against the narrative that it was a human disease specifically,\" says Sarah Inskip of the University of Leicester, co-author of the new study in Current Biology. Squirrels were often kept as pets in medieval times, and their pelts were commonly used in clothing, notes ScienceAlert. Either practice may have provided an avenue for infection. However, researchers can't say whether squirrels might have passed leprosy to humans or vice versa. \"The history of leprosy is far more complex than previously thought,\" says another study author, Verena Schuenemann of the University of Basel in Switzerland.\n\nThe Atlantic notes that scientists believed leprosy was exclusive to humans until the 1970s, when it turned up in armadillos. Those animals are believed to have caught it from us and are now spreading it back to humans in South America and in southern US states. More recently, researchers also discovered that some modern red squirrels in the UK also carry a strain, though a different one than the medieval variety. All of which means more study is necessary. \"There has been no consideration of the role that animals might have played in the transmission and spread of the disease in the past, and as such, our understanding of leprosy's history is incomplete until these hosts are considered,\" says Schuenemann.

One may be a cause of the other, A genome study conducted by Verena Scheunemann of the University of Basel and her team, in which the working group compared bacteria from 25 people and 12 squirrels, shows. One of these ancient strains of leprosy bacteria from a squirrel was more closely related to human strains of the time than to today's strains that are still found in squirrels.\n\nLeprosy is one of the oldest infectious diseases known to humanity and is still spreading in parts of Asia, Africa and South America, while the bacteria caused by this type Mycobacterium leprae The diseases causing it have been virtually eliminated in developed countries.

According to Sotheby's, Apex is 30 percent larger than Sophie, the most complete stegosaurus on public display to date, which is housed in the Natural History Museum in London.\n\nStan, the world's most complete tyrannosaurus rex skeleton, sold in 2020 for a record $31.8m.", "source": {"uri": "aljazeera.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Jazeera Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dinosaur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fossil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sotheby's", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sotheby's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stegosaurus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stegosaurus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeleton", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Skeleton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_culture", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Popular culture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morrison_Formation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Morrison Formation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godzilla", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Godzilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Myth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleontology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paleontology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sacrum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrannosaurus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tyrannosaurus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_History_Museum,_London", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Natural History Museum, London"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christie's", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christie's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coyote", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coyote"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arthritis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Hong Kong"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Science_and_Nature", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Science and Nature", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Paleontology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Paleontology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Science", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2024-07-10T215840Z_1993065413_RC2AS8A6AW3B_RTRMADP_3_AUCTION-DINOSAUR-NEW-YORK-1720676523.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722961", "eventUri": "eng-9722961", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-17", "textStart": 448, "textEnd": 455}], "sentiment": 0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 201, "relevance": 1}

The fossil does show evidence of arthritis, suggesting that Apex lived to an advanced age.\n\nHatton said Apex was found \"with the tail curled up underneath the body, which is a common death pose for animals.\"\n\nThe dinosaur will be auctioned on July 17 as part of Sotheby's \"Geek Week\" series.\n\nSotheby's is estimating that it will sell for $4 million to $6 million.", "source": {"uri": "mynorthwest.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "My Northwest"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@mynorthwest.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sotheby's", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sotheby's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stegosaurus", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stegosaurus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dinosaur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fossil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_terms_of_location", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anatomical terms of location"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_culture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Popular culture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dinosaur, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dinosaur, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_pose", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Death pose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arthritis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Science_and_Nature", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Science and Nature", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Paleontology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Paleontology", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Science", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Science", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Puzzles/3D", "label": "dmoz/Games/Puzzles/3D", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Dentistry/Fillings", "label": "dmoz/Health/Dentistry/Fillings", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://mynorthwest.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/MYNW_Facebookj.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722961", "eventUri": "eng-9722961", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-17", "textStart": 1103, "textEnd": 1110}], "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

The auction house says it has collaborated with Cooper to \"document the entire process, from discovery and excavation to restoration, preparation and mounting,\" in order to guarantee the \"highest standards and transparency.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn 2022, Christie's auction house had to withdraw a T-rex skeleton a few days before the auction in Hong Kong, due to doubts about its authenticity.\n\nStegosaurus skeletons are already on display around the world, but according to Sotheby's, Apex is 30 percent larger than Sophie, the most complete stegosaurus on public display to date, which is housed in the Natural History Museum in London.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe debate around auctions of dinosaur fossils is one \"I've heard a lot,\" said Hatton. \"When you have a scientifically important specimen, the museums usually show up and find donors to bid on their behalf or they bid themselves.\"\n\n\"Most of the people I work with are donating specimens to museums or loaning them to museums, they understand the significance and importance of these specimens.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Sotheby's, Cooper has already donated fossils to museums around the world.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)\n\nFeatured Video Of The Day\n\nPM Modi Receives Russia's Top

A Stegosaurus Struts on a Jurassic Era Tour  --  at Sotheby's", "body": "To call the beast that prowls the third floor of Sotheby's a fossil would be saying Shakespeare had an ear for rhyme -- not wrong, just inadequate. The fully intact Stegosaurus, named \"Apex,\" was an armored behemoth who feasted on grass and warded off predators with spikes on its tails and kite-shaped plates down its back. It lived about 150 million years ago, is 11 feet tall and 20 feet long, and is expected to fetch between four and six million dollars.\n\nApex was discovered in a town called -- lest there be any confusion -- Dinosaur, in Colorado's northwest corner. It met its end in the late Jurassic period, and Sotheby's reckons that \"evidence of arthritis indicates that it lived to an advanced age.\" The auction house lauds the seemingly flawless fossil as the \"finest Stegosaurus specimen ever to appear at auction.\" Sotheby's was involved from the moment the creature was wrested from the earth.\n\nWhat is most striking about Apex -- it is not known whether it was male or female, though mottled bone suggests venereal disease -- is its poised sinuousness. It is as if a snake sprouted legs. Merely because it did not eat flesh does not make it welcoming. One can imagine many teeth cracking against its defensive shield, the soft skin and chewy muscles and tendons protected by an exterior that would make a Humvee envious.\n\nThe fossil record contains traces of Stegosauruses mauled by predators like Allosaurus, as well as evidence of damage, via tail spikes, inflicted by the herbivore on its meat eating foes. Stegosaurus was likely not a strategist -- the skull is about the size of a dog's, small even for a dim dinosaur. Apex's short forelimbs suggest that it could not have run very fast. That's where its humdinger of a tail would have started to lash its adversaries.\n\nApex would never have known one of the greatest hunters ever known, Tyrannosaurus rex. The Stegosaurus had already been extinct for nearly 100 million years by the time T-Rex stalked the Earth. Chronologically humans are nearly as close to the predator as it was to the Stegosaurus. Still, they've shared the same halls. In 1997, Sotheby's sold the first ever dinosaur fossil offered at auction -- a complete T-Rex named \"Sue\" -- for more than eight million dollars.\n\nThe garland of the most expensive fossil ever sold at auction belongs to Christie's, which in 2020 sold a T-Rex, \"Stan,\" for $31.8 million. Two years ago Sotheby's sold a Gorgosaurus, an older and swifter relative of the T-Rex, for just over six million dollars. In 2015, after a claim filed by a United States attorney, Preet Bharara, the actor Nicolas Cage returned to Mongolia a skull swiped from the Gobi desert by a rogue paleontologist.\n\nA Senior Vice President at Sotheby's, Cassandra Hatton, tells the Sun that something of Apex's posture reminds her of Godzilla, the terrorizer of Tokyo. In the room next to Apex hangs a prop from \"The Lost World: Jurassic Park.\" At least on film, the Stegosaurus can walk again. When asked why these animals continue to exert such a pull on imaginations -- and wallets -- Ms. Hatton pauses for a moment and answers \"because they're gone.\"", "source": {"uri": "nysun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Sun"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stegosaurus", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stegosaurus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fossil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sotheby's", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sotheby's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dinosaur"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Predation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auction", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Auction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrannosaurus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyrannosaurus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Jurassic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Late Jurassic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jurassic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shakespeare", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William Shakespeare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arthritis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forelimb", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forelimb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allosaurus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Allosaurus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shield", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Skull"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbivore", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Herbivore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Skin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tooth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Snake"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Meat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Muscle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tendon", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tendon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tendon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Cage", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nicolas Cage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christie's", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christie's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mongolia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Mongolia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Auctions", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Auctions", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Auctions", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Science_and_Nature", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Recreation/Science and Nature", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Paleontology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Paleontology", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Science", "label": "news/Science", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://wp.nysun.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Apex-Photo-Credit_-Matthew-Sherman-5-scaled.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=fill&fm=jpg&fl=progressive", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722961", "eventUri": "eng-9722961", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

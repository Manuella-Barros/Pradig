{"id": 231337866, "title": "Prince Harry 'directly asked by King Charles not to leak any more Royal Family secrets", "text": "King Charles has asked Prince Harry to stop giving away any more details about the royal family behind closed doors, an expert claims. Harry, alongside wife Meghan Markle, stepped down from the royal family in 2020 and the couple have spoken out about their experience in The Firm. They made controversial comments in their 2021 interview with Oprah Winfrey, the couple's 2022 Netflix docu-series and Harry's 2023 autobiography, with them seemingly deepening the ongoing royal rift. However now it seems that Charles has had enough and asked his youngest son to 'stop publicly complaining' about the royal family, according to a royal expert.. Royal author and expert Tom Quinn exclusively told the Mirror: \"Harry has been asked directly by his father not to write or say publicly anything further about the family or his brother that might cause trouble. And everyone knows that when a king asks you to do something there are going to be consequences if you do not obey.\" For all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.

Harry just can\u2019t see that complaining in private might work; complaining publicly just makes things worse and in Harry\u2019s case that means more and more ties to his past being severed.\" Harry's relationship with his father and brother has appeared strained in recent years, appearing to start from 2020 when Harry and Meghan stepped back from the royal family and moved to the US. His previous comments have included allegations of racism in the royal family to revealing a physical fight between himself and William, with all comments thought to have angered the royal family and soured the tense relationship further. This isn't the first time the impact of Harry's outspoken comments has been pointed out, as earlier this month royal commentator Jennie Bond highlighted the impact the family feud could be having on Harry's children Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet. Speaking to OK! magazine she said: \"Children grow up and are innately curious about their heritage and background... and when your heritage is one of the most famous families in the world, it will undoubtedly seem rather odd and perhaps sad that you hardly know or remember them.\" She added: \"Imagine Archie, aged 15, telling his friends, 'My grandpa is/was King! And my Uncle is/will be King too.' But he hardly knew or met them. How sad... and Meghan would have to bear the brunt of the responsibility for that.\" The Mirror has reached out to Buckingham Palace and the Sussexes for comment on this story.

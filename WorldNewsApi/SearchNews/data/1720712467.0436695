{"id": 232024184, "title": "Leeds Rhinos call for moment of reflection as Rob Burrow tributes continue", "text": "Leeds Rhinos have called for a \"moment of reflection\" to be held in honour of Rob Burrow at 6pm today. Rhinos legend Burrow tragically passed away earlier this month at the age of 41 after a battle with motor neurone disease (MND). Burrow was diagnosed with MND in 2019 and raised millions to fight the disease alongside his former teammate Kevin Sinfield. And to mark a week since Burrow's death, Rhinos asked fans to \"have a moment of reflection with loved ones at home together to remember Rob and keep in your thoughts his family and all those impacted by MND.\" The club have also announced that they will start moving some of the tributes that have been left outside Headingley in Burrow's memory in order to \"ensure that they do not get damaged by the weather and the site remains a fitting tribute to Rob\". They plan to photograph them all for a book, with a copy set to be given to Burrow's family, another to be housed at Headingley and a third to be given to the Rob Burrow Centre for MND. There are also plans for a permanent tribute to Burrow at the stadium. The club added that \"well wishers can still visit the stadium throughout the next fortnight... to lay flowers around the base of the John Holmes statue\". A celebration of Burrow's life will take place at Rhinos' next home match against Leigh Leopards, which takes place on Global MND Awareness Day on June 21. Rhinos will wear a special kit for the game, designed by artist Cath Muir who was diagnosed with MND in 2014. The kit has been approved by Burrow's family and features an image of Burrow and Sinfield and a blue cornflower, which is a symbol of hope for MND. \u00a310 from the sale of replica shirts will be donated to the Leeds Hospitals Charity appeal, which is behind the Rob Burrow Centre for MND. Construction work on the centre began the day after Burrow's death, with his family present for the groundbreaking. Burrow's mother, Irene, told BBC Breakfast: \"He was asked, we were all there and Rob used his eyes to say yes. \"There was no hesitation whatsoever, he wants it to go ahead today. The sooner they can get this done the better. Not just for the families, but the professional people there, it will make their lives a lot easier, giving bad news to people. \"He'll be watching today, we've pulled ourselves together because that's what Rob would have wanted. It's amazing to be here today for Rob. We're flying the flag, beating the drum and we will get a cure.\" Join our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

Welp \u2026 In the up-is-down world of the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case, prosecutors attempted to stanch Donald Trump\u2019s vitriolic attacks on federal law enforcement \u2013 the kind of thing criminal defendants would not typically be allowed to engage in while on pre-trial release \u2013 and wound up themselves threatened with sanctions by the judge. As Morning Memo recounted yesterday, the move by prosecutors to modify the terms of Trump\u2019s pre-trial release came late Friday before the Memorial Day weekend and prompted a heated response from Trump. U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon weighed in Monday, denying the prosecution motion, chastising them for playing loose with the local court rules, and threatening to impose sanctions on them in the future. On small bright spot, if you can call it that, is that she didn\u2019t accede to Trump\u2019s request to sanction the prosecution team immediately. Cannon\u2019s denial was without prejudice, meaning prosecutors can refile their motion: Cannon insisted that prosecutors had not sufficiently conferred with the defense team before filing and ordered that all future filings contain a statement of no more than 200 words by the opposing side of its position. In a normal case, I\u2019d applaud a judge keeping a tight leash on the prosecution team. But we\u2019re in such uncharted territory here that you can\u2019t attribute this to i-dotting or t-crossing by Cannon. Given any chance to chide the prosecution, she takes it. Given deplorable behavior by Trump that would normally never fly, she finds herself mute again and again. The judge\u2019s routine has become so predictable that even the analysis by legal observers bakes in a certain Cannon quotient: Anything that DOJ does that even arguably deviates from the rules leaves an opening that Cannon will take. So DOJ ends up graded on a weird Cannon curve while the Trump\u2019s dangerous and unprecedented conduct gets set to the side. One pattern emerging with Cannon is that when prosecutors implore her to assert herself and take more control over the case like so many judges do, she retreats to treating everything as an adversarial contest that she merely referees. But when it\u2019s a matter of importance to Trump, she regularly asserts herself, going so far as to raise issues on her own. It\u2019s another way in her handling of the case is imbalanced to Trump\u2019s advantage. The Hush Money Jury Finally Gets The Case! With closing arguments in the hush money trial complete, we\u2019re expecting the judge to spend about an hour instructing the jury on its duties before turning the case over to them to deliberate. Let me caution again that predicting jury verdicts is not just a dangerous game, it\u2019s damn near impossible. I would even go so far as to say that the rule of law has been honored here regardless of the verdict. The case was well tried, Trump had his day in court, his misdeeds weren\u2019t swept under the carpet, and that all remains true regardless of how the jury comes down. In oder to set your expectations a bit, I would say the most likely outcomes in descending order are: conviction -> hung jury -> acquittal. But a mix of outcomes \u2013 conviction on some but not all counts, hung jury on some counts, even acquittal on some counts \u2013 is defintely in play. Acquittal on all charges is I think very unlikely. After a late night and early morning turnaround, TPM\u2019s Josh Kovenky is back at it this morning. Follow his liveblog here. The Alitos Are Quite A Pair The NYT\u2019s Jodi Kantor digs deeper into the neighborhood dispute that Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito claims led his wife to fly the American flag upside down back in January 2021, sometime between the Capitol attack and Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration. What\u2019s most striking is the sheer pettiness of the Alitos, but the one factual reveal is that the key confrontation that Alito said prompted his wife to raise the distress signal actually came after the flag at the Alitos was already taken down. Not that it matters that much? Alito\u2019s explanation never made sense. On what planet does your neighbor protesting a coup attempt require you to trot out pro-coup symbols? What else could it possibly mean?

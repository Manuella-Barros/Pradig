This comes after the Biden campaign proposed an unusually early date for a debate. The second debate will take place on Sep. 10.\n\nBiden and Trump faced off previously for two debates in September and October during the 2020 presidential election, where they famously engaged in harsh attacks on each other. Trump repeatedly insulted Biden's intelligence while Biden called Trump \"the worst President America's ever had.\"\n\nWhile viewers inside the U.S. will be the main audience for the debates, politically-minded people across the globe may also wish to tune in. Here's what people in the U.K. need to know about the U.S. presidential debates.\n\nCNN's online streaming differs depending on which country you are in.\n\nU.K. viewers who want to watch the debate online can subscribe to CNN Live's U.K.-specific plan. It costs \u00a31.99 per month or \u00a319.90 per year. Once viewers are logged in, they can livestream the debate online.\n\nViewers can also watch the debate by tuning into CNN International, which can be found at channel 506 on Sky TV, per CNN International PR's social media.\n\nThe first debate will take place on Thursday, June 27, at 9 p.m. ET, which will be 2 a.m. June 28 BST. The broadcast will go on for 90 minutes and is set to feature two commercial breaks.\n\nIf you miss the live broadcast, CNN international will replay the broadcast at 7 a.m. and 7.pm on June 28 BST.\n\nThe first debate will be moderated by CNN journalists Jake Tapper and Dana Bash. Tapper is the lead Washington D.C. anchor for CNN and hosts the show The Lead with Jake Tapper. Dana Bash is a CNN news anchor and host of the show Inside Politics. Tapper and Bash also co-host the Sunday CNN talk show State of the Union, which features interviews with prominent politicians and analysts. The second debate will be hosted by ABC news. Further details on that debate have yet to be announced.\n\nThis debate will feature new rules that were not implemented in previous presidential debates. Microphones will be muted throughout the debate, unless it is the candidate's allotted time to speak. It will also not have a live audience, to minimize disruptions. Pre-written notes will also be prohibited, though candidates will be given a pen and a pad of paper. \"[CNN] will use all tools at their disposal to enforce timing and ensure a civilized discussion,\" the network said.", "source": {"uri": "time.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TIME"}, "authors": [{"uri": "anna_gordon@time.com", "name": "Anna Gordon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN_International", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_UK", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sky UK"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_Bash", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dana Bash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_debates", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States presidential debates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_presenter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "News presenter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Summer_Time", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "British Summer Time"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Public relations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Tapper", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jake Tapper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lead_with_Jake_Tapper", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Lead with Jake Tapper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_the_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State of the Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside_Politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inside Politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk_show", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Talk show"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Communication", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Communication", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Networks", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Television/Networks", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Watches", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/trump-biden-debate-tenessee.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666748", "eventUri": "eng-9666748", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 168, "textEnd": 175, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "-09-10", "textStart": 297, "textEnd": 304}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-28", "textStart": 1351, "textEnd": 1358, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

Four years ago, Trump repeatedly interrupted Biden, prompting Biden to infamously say \"Will you shut up, man!\"\n\nThe moderators for next week's debate - Democratic operatives Dana Bash and Jake Tapper - \"will use all the tools at their disposal to enforce timing and ensure a civilized discussion,\" according to CNN.\n\nWhich is exactly what Biden wants. Trump wants chaos and unpredictability.\n\nBut if Bash and Tapper appear to be silencing Trump unfairly, that could fire up the Republican troops and boost the former Republican president heading into the fall election season.\n\nThere will be no debate audience for Trump to feed off - a provision that Biden's campaign insisted on.\n\nBiden's campaign also asked for podiums for both candidates, which will protect the 81-year-old Democratic president from shuffling off or losing his place on stage.\n\nThe 90-minute debate on June 27 will include two commercial breaks, giving Biden a little time to take a respite if things get rough.\n\nThe candidates will also be provided with a pen and a pad of paper to take notes, which should help Biden if he loses focus.\n\nAnd the timing of the debate - in the mid-summer doldrums months before election - will give Biden time to recover in case of a bad performance.\n\nAnother concession by Trump is that the debate will not include third party candidates like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who polls show is hurting Biden's campaign. Kennedy has filed an official complaint hoping to be put in the debate.\n\nBy agreeing to CNN's debate, Trump and Biden are shunning the Commission on Presidential Debates, which has traditionally put on televised encounters for decades.\n\nTrump ceded control of the debate by saying months ago that he would debate Biden at \"any time, any place\" - giving the Democrats the opening they needed to accept the invitation from CNN.\n\nThis is the first of only two debates between the candidates, and there is no VP debate scheduled.\n\nDespite all the rules being slanted in his favor, Biden is taking a risk by agreeing to debate at all. A major gaffe or senior moment could send his campaign into a tailspin.\n\nBut it's a risk the Biden campaign is willing to take, given the fact that his low approval ratings remain a major problem for his re-election.\n\nJust a passing performance for Biden could re-energize his campaign and ease voters' concerns about his age and mental acuity.\n\nThe second debate between Biden and Trump is scheduled for Sept. 10 on ABC. CBS is trying desperately to get into the picture by holding a VP debate.", "source": {"uri": "bostonherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joe_battenfeld@bostonherald.com", "name": "Joe Battenfeld", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_Bash", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dana Bash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Tapper", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jake Tapper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commission_on_Presidential_Debates", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commission on Presidential Debates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Both candidates have accepted the network's invitation and agreed to accept the rules and format of the debate, as outlined in letters sent to the campaigns by the network in May.\n\nIn order to qualify for participation, candidates had to satisfy the requirements outlined in Article II, Section 1 of the US Constitution to serve as president, as well as file a formal statement of candidacy with the Federal Election Commission.\n\nAccording to parameters set by CNN in May, all participating debaters had to appear on a sufficient number of state ballots to reach the 270 electoral vote threshold to win the presidency and receive at least 15% in four separate national polls of registered or likely voters that meet CNN's standards for reporting.\n\nPolls that meet those standards are those sponsored by CNN, ABC News, CBS News, Fox News, Marquette University Law School, Monmouth University, NBC News, The New York Times/Siena College, NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist College, Quinnipiac University, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post.\n\nBiden and Trump were the only candidates to meet those requirements.\n\nThe debate will include two commercial breaks, according to the network, and campaign staff may not interact with their candidate during that time.\n\nBoth candidates agreed to appear at a uniform podium, and their podium positions will be determined by a coin flip.\n\nMicrophones will be muted throughout the debate except for the candidate whose turn it is to speak.\n\nWhile no props or pre-written notes will be allowed on the stage, candidates will be given a pen, a pad of paper and a bottle of water.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Instead, the campaign has been setting up sessions with policy experts on individual topics they think could come up at the debate next Thursday, such as the economy, immigration and democracy, according to people familiar the plans.\n\nWhen the former president was in town last week for a visit with congressional Republicans, he met with Sens. Marco Rubio and Eric Schmitt, for a debate discussion session, along with a group of his advisers, according to sources with knowledge of the meetings.\n\nIt's an example of how Trump has held informal debate-focused sessions with a series of experts, fitting them in between campaign stops and fundraisers.\n\nMany of these sessions have been with people who were part of his previous administration, including his former acting Director of National Intelligence Ric Grenell, former White House counselor Kellyanne Conway and former top adviser Stephen Miller and Tom Homan, who served as acting director of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement when Trump was president, according to sources familiar with the meetings.\n\nThe debate, being moderated by CNN anchors Jake Tapper and Dana Bash, will run for approximately 90 minutes with two commercial breaks. It is the first of two debates scheduled between the candidates -- the second of which will be hosted by ABC News on Sept. 10.\n\nIn an election year, both candidates are looking to the debate as a way to attract undecided voters in what is expected to be a very tight race.\n\nTrump has also recently spoken with some of the people on his shortlist to become his vice president as he prepares to make a decision about who will be his running mate, sources tell ABC News. His vice presidential pick would go up against Vice President Kamala Harris during a debate this summer.\n\nTrump met with Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance at Mar-a-Lago earlier this month. Vance, speculated to be a top contender to be Trump's vice president pick, discussed the economy with Trump as part of the former president's debate prep, according to a source.\n\nVance has been an active surrogate for Trump over the past few months, appearing at campaign events with him and hosting fundraisers to help raise money for Trump's White House bid.\n\nVance has maintained his commitment to helping Trump's campaign. In May, he told Donald Trump Jr. on his podcast \"Triggered with Don Jr.\" that he wanted to help the former president however he could.\n\nTrump has previously departed from traditional debate preparations, which advisers have said speak to his strengths in giving off-the-cuff remarks.\n\nMore recently, the campaign has also held more events where Trump is able to take questions from audience members. Although the questions have mainly been from his staunch supporters, the town hall forums have allowed the former president to be put on the spot ahead of the debate.\n\n\"President Trump talks with voters in town halls, speaks to thousands at rallies, and frequently takes questions from the press,\" which have prepared him for the upcoming debate, senior adviser Brian Hughes said in a statement to ABC News.\n\nHughes added that \"Biden needs rehearsals with handlers to find some way to explain this mess he's made of our nation.\"\n\n\"President Trump is always prepared to present to Americans his record of success and Biden's weakness and failures,\" Hughes said.\n\nAs Biden heads off to Camp David for his debate preparations, Trump will spend the weekend campaigning in Philadelphia and attending a series of fundraisers leading up to next week.\n\nThe Trump campaign pushed for earlier debates this election cycle, remaining confident Trump could garner more supporters if voters could see the two men debate and compare their presidential records.\n\nFollowing Trump and Biden's agreement to participate in debates in June and September, the Trump campaign has put public pressure on the Biden campaign to agree to more debates.\n\n\"We propose a debate in June, a debate in July, a debate in August, and a debate in September, in addition to the Vice Presidential debate. Additional dates will allow voters to have maximum exposure to the records and future visions of each candidate,\" Trump advisers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles said in a memo sent out in May.\n\nWhen Trump called into the Hugh Hewitt Radio show in May, the former president doubled down on his ability to debate Biden and called for more debates to be scheduled.\n\n\"I really think he has to debate. He might as well get it over with -- probably should do it early so that he can, you know, because he's not going to get any better,\" Trump said. \"... Every day is a down factor for him.\"\n\n\"I've accepted the two debates; I've recommended they should have more.\"\n\nDebates have been an opportunity for Trump to reach a wider audience. His first debate with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in September 2016 garnered 84 million viewers, making it the most-watched presidential debate in modern American history.", "source": {"uri": "abcnews.go.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rachel_scott@abcnews.go.com", "name": "Rachel Scott", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "hannah_demissie@abcnews.go.com", "name": "Hannah Demissie", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "lalee_ibssa@abcnews.go.com", "name": "Lalee Ibssa", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marco Rubio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town_hall_meeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Town hall meeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Miller_(political_advisor)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Miller (political advisor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Grenell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Richard Grenell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Homan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Homan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_Bash", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dana Bash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

(Atlanta News First) - The current and former presidents are set to take the stage together in Atlanta next week for the first presidential debate of the 2024 election.\n\nIt promises to be a historic night. It'll be the first general election debate held in Atlanta, the first debate between a sitting president and former president, and the earliest presidential election of the modern broadcast era.\n\nHere's what else to know about the upcoming debate between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump:\n\nCNN anchors Jake Tapper and Dana Bash will moderate, according to the network.\n\nThe debate will air live on CNN, CNN International, CNN en Espa\u00f1ol, CNN Max and CNN.com. The debate will also air on CBS, so you can watch it on Atlanta News First.\n\nCNN said no audience would be present during its debate.\n\nBoth candidates' microphones will be muted until it's their turn to speak. They also won't be allowed to interact with campaign staff during commercial breaks.\n\nNo props or pre-written notes will be allowed on the stage. Both candidates, though, will be given a pen and a pad of paper.\n\nTo qualify for CNN's debate, the network said candidates would need to reach at least 15% in four separate national polls of registered or likely voters, and appear on enough state ballots to reach the 270 electoral vote threshold to win the presidency - the same standards held by the Commission on Presidential Debates.\n\nCNN said Thursday that both Trump and Biden met those standards, but independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. did not.\n\nTrump will also deliver the last closing statement of the debate, which was determined by a coin toss, CNN said Thursday.\n\nBiden and Trump also have agreed to a second debate. It will be hosted by ABC on Sept. 10.\n\nIt's the first general election debate held in Atlanta.\n\nIt's also the first debate between a sitting president and former president, according to CNN.\n\nIt's the earliest presidential election of the modern broadcast era. Both Biden and Trump are the presumptive nominees for their parties. Neither have formally accepted their respective parties' nominations because the Democratic and Republican conventions haven't been held.\n\nIt will be the first televised general election matchup to be hosted by an individual network.\n\nIt marks the first time in the modern era that a televised presidential debate won't be sponsored by the nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates. Biden has announced that he won't participate in fall debates sponsored by the commission, which has organized the debates for three decades. Biden had instead proposed that media outlets directly organize the debates between himself and Trump.\n\nThe debate also marks the first time a convicted felon has ever participated in a presidential debate, much less sought the nation's highest elected office. It's also the first time a sitting U.S. president has ever debated a convicted felon seeking to unseat him from the White House.\n\nAtlanta News First and Atlanta News First+ provide you with the latest news, headlines and insights as Georgia continues its role at the forefront of the nation's political scene.

Instead, the campaign has been setting up sessions with policy experts on individual topics they think could come up at the debate next Thursday, such as the economy, immigration and democracy, according to people familiar the plans.\n\nWhen the former president was in town last week for a visit with congressional Republicans, he met with Sens. Marco Rubio and Eric Schmitt, for a debate discussion session, along with a group of his advisers, according to sources with knowledge of the meetings.\n\nIt's an example of how Trump has held informal debate-focused sessions with a series of experts, fitting them in between campaign stops and fundraisers.\n\nMany of these sessions have been with people who were part of his previous administration, including his former acting Director of National Intelligence Ric Grenell, former White House counselor Kellyanne Conway and former top adviser Stephen Miller and Tom Homan, who served as acting director of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement when Trump was president, according to sources familiar with the meetings.\n\nThe debate, being moderated by CNN anchors Jake Tapper and Dana Bash, will run for approximately 90 minutes with two commercial breaks.

His vice presidential pick would go up against Vice President Kamala Harris during a debate this summer.\n\nTrump met with Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance at Mar-a-Lago earlier this month. Vance, speculated to be a top contender to be Trump's vice president pick, discussed the economy with Trump as part of the former president's debate prep, according to a source.\n\nVance has been an active surrogate for Trump over the past few months, appearing at campaign events with him and hosting fundraisers to help raise money for Trump's White House bid.\n\nVance has maintained his commitment to helping Trump's campaign. In May, he told Donald Trump Jr. on his podcast \"Triggered with Don Jr.\" that he wanted to help the former president however he could.\n\nTrump has previously departed from traditional debate preparations, which advisers have said speak to his strengths in giving off-the-cuff remarks.\n\nMore recently, the campaign has also held more events where Trump is able to take questions from audience members. Although the questions have mainly been from his staunch supporters, the town hall forums have allowed the former president to be put on the spot ahead of the debate.\n\n\"President Trump talks with voters in town halls, speaks to thousands at rallies, and frequently takes questions from the press,\" which have prepared him for the upcoming debate, senior adviser Brian Hughes said in a statement to ABC News.\n\nHughes added that \"Biden needs rehearsals with handlers to find some way to explain this mess he's made of our nation.\"\n\n\"President Trump is always prepared to present to Americans his record of success and Biden's weakness and failures,\" Hughes said.\n\nAs Biden heads off to Camp David for his debate preparations, Trump will spend the weekend campaigning in Philadelphia and attending a series of fundraisers leading up to next week.\n\nThe Trump campaign pushed for earlier debates this election cycle, remaining confident Trump could garner more supporters if voters could see the two men debate and compare their presidential records.\n\nFollowing Trump and Biden's agreement to participate in debates in June and September, the Trump campaign has put public pressure on the Biden campaign to agree to more debates.\n\n\"We propose a debate in June, a debate in July, a debate in August, and a debate in September, in addition to the Vice Presidential debate. Additional dates will allow voters to have maximum exposure to the records and future visions of each candidate,\" Trump advisers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles said in a memo sent out in May.\n\nDebates have been an opportunity for Trump to reach a wider audience. His first debate with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in September 2016 garnered 84 million viewers, making it the most-watched presidential debate in modern American history.", "source": {"uri": "mycentraloregon.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MyCentralOregon.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Rubio", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marco Rubio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town_hall_meeting", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Town hall meeting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Miller_(political_advisor)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Miller (political advisor)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar-a-Lago", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mar-a-Lago"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Grenell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Richard Grenell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Homan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Homan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_Bash", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dana Bash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

It will be moderated by anchors Jake Tapper and Dana Bash, and the roughly 90 minute debate will include two commercial breaks.\n\nAccording to the rules, which were agreed upon by both candidates' campaigns, candidates' microphones will be muted during the debate until it is their turn to speak, seemingly an effort to limit interruptions and crosstalk.\n\nAdditionally, there will be no audience at the debate, and no props or pre-written notes will be permitted. However, each candidate will be given a pen and a pad of paper with which to take notes, as well as a bottle of water.\n\nThe window to qualify for the debate closed on Thursday, leaving independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on the outside looking in.\n\nCNN said that in order to qualify for the debate stage, candidates must meet the thresholds to be a candidate under the U.S. Constitution, as well as be on the ballot in enough states to reach 270 Electoral College votes -- enough to win the White House -- and receive at least 15% in four national polls that meet the network's standards.\n\nThe debates took shape last month after Biden challenged Trump to face off, forgoing the traditional debates sponsored by the nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates. The second will take place in September, hosted by ABC News.\n\nTrump quickly accepted and later challenged Biden to additional debates, including one hosted by Fox News in October, but Biden's campaign said no dice.\n\n\"We made clear what we wanted,\" Biden campaign spokesman Kevin Munoz told Spectrum News last month. \"We wanted two debates, we wanted to make sure it was fair and not focused on theater, but the actual policy issues here, and he agreed to them. But what Donald Trump is continuing to do, he's playing games with the American people because he does not want to talk about the issues ... enough with the games.\"\n\nThe debate will come ahead of the presidential nominating conventions -- when Trump and Biden will officially become their respective parties' nominees once again -- as well as ahead of Trump's sentencing in his New York hush money trial. A jury found Trump guilty of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in connection with a hush money payment to an adult film star ahead of the 2016 election to cover up an alleged extramarital affair. Trump has denied the affair and has vowed to appeal his conviction.\n\nBiden's campaign launched a $50 million ad blitz on Monday attacking Trump as a convicted felon, which will run ahead of the first debate through the end of June.

He then went to Italy for 48 hours for the G7 conference. He spent the weekend on the West Coast fundraising.\n\nBut the biggest hurdle the 81-year-old will have to overcome are the concerns about his age.\n\nThe Trump campaign has pummelled him about recent incidents showing him freezing or having to be guided off stage.\n\nThe White House claims the videos are edited to make the president look bad. And Biden's campaign has struck back at the 78-year-old Trump, pointing out times he fell asleep in court during his New York trial on business fraud.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, also has been down playing the upcoming showdown.\n\nAt a rally in Wisconsin this week, he argued he won't just be debating Biden but also CNN's two debate moderators - Jake Tapper and Dana Bash - who he says doesn't like him.\n\n'I'll be debating three people instead of one half of a person,' he said.\n\nBiden will get the first word and Trump will get the last when the two men meet. The campaigns participated in a coin toss with host CNN on Thursday to determine speaking order and podium position.\n\nThe debate will last 90 minutes with two commercial breaks.\n\nDuring that time, the president will focus on attacking Trump for 'ripping away reproductive rights, promoting political violence and undermining our democratic institutions, and doing the bidding of his billionaire donors to fund tax giveaways to the ultra-wealthy and corporations by hurting seniors and the middle class,' a Biden campaign official said.\n\nBut neither man has held back in attacking his rival.\n\nTrump claims Biden is physically and mentally unfit for office, while Biden has called his Republican rival 'unhinged' and a danger to democracy.\n\nBiden's supporters also point to Trump's role in the January 6th insurrection at the Capitol, his attempts overturn the 2020 election and his conviction on May 30 for 34 felony counts for his involvement in a hush-money scheme to keep an alleged sexual encounter with a porn star from the public.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, could attack Biden's son Hunter, who was convicted last week on three felony charges related to a 2018 gun purchase.\n\nNeither Donald Trump nor Joe Biden have been on the debate stage since 2020 - above they are seen at their last debate on October 22, 2020\n\nPresident Joe Biden likes to do prep work at Camp David - above he and his team prepare for the State of the Union address at Camp David in March\n\nNeither man has been on the debate stage in years.\n\nBiden didn't have a serious Democratic primary challenger and Trump refused to participate in the GOP primary debates - which didn't harm him given he won the nomination.\n\nBiden's former chief of staff Ron Klain is leading the effort to help the president get ready for the debate. Klain has prepped presidential candidates going back to Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump is not expected to do any mock debate sessions that would require someone to play the part of Joe Biden.\n\nAs for the Biden campaign, they said the role of Donald Trump has yet to be cast for their mock sessions.\n\nBiden's personal lawyer, Bob Bauer, played Trump in Biden's debate prep sessions four years ago.\n\nBut Trump will get time to practice his attack lines. He's holding a campaign rally in Philadelphia on Saturday, four days before the debate.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [],

University of Michigan director of debate Aaron Kall said this debate is unusual for two reasons: it's happening in June rather than August, and there won't be a studio audience.\n\n\"We've never witnessed a presidential debate so early in June,\" said Kall, editor and co-author of \"Debating the Donald.\" \"Both candidates felt it was important to start the debate process before early voting began. They had no issues with jettisoning the Commission on Presidential Debates and directly involving television networks.\"\n\nDo debates benefit the candidates since many voters know who they will pick in November?\n\nThe impact and influence of political debates have declined in the last several cycles. The country has become more polarized and it's more likely that viewers will tune in to cheer on their preferred candidates, as opposed to debates informing their voting preferences. There are now an infinite amount of entertainment and social media options for viewers that make it difficult to fully consume a 90-minute debate.\n\nCNN hosting of the first presidential debate may limit the size of the television audience. That being said, tens of millions of Americans are likely to watch the debate. Even a tiny moving of the political needle can make a major difference in a historically close election that could be decided by thousands of votes in a handful of battleground states. The content and narrative of what happens in the debate will likely shape future news cycles and fundraising efforts. No other event in the coming months has the potential to fundamentally shape the election like presidential debates, and that's why both campaigns strongly felt the need to participate.\n\nHas an early presidential debate ever happened? In addition, has there been one without an audience?\n\nIt's a throwback to the inaugural Kennedy-Nixon debates of 1960 that also took place in television studios and lacked an audience. This is the purest form of political debate that should result in a more substantive and issue-focused exchange. It also increases the degree of difficulty for the candidates, who must rely on their political instincts and will largely be in the dark about how they are doing until the conclusion of the event.\n\nWhat does each candidate need to do to avoid previous debate mistakes?\n\nNeither Trump or Biden has formally debated since October of 2020. Usually, the challenger has an advantage in the opening debate since they've likely participated in many recent primary debates. The president is out of practice and busy running the country. Trump famously skipped the primary debates this year and President Biden has recently been on several overseas trips. A much earlier debate means the practice schedules of both campaigns will be accelerated and it will likely take time for both to get properly acclimated and up to speed.\n\nTrump should avoid interrupting President Biden and the moderators throughout the debate. He was ridiculed for doing this during the 2020 debate in Cleveland. While both candidates performed poorly, more viewers felt Biden was a little better.\n\nPresident Biden must refrain from making a disqualifying gaffe that will shift the focus back to his advanced age and stamina for serving another term in office. He often benefits from low expectations and should harken back to his State of the Union performance in March, which was pretty well-received. Trump eschews traditional debate preparation and will likely spend time fielding questions from campaign aides and political allies. President Biden will likely spend time in Camp David with a trusted group of advisers who must try and extricate him from the presidential bubble.\n\nWhat issue is most important for each candidate?\n\nThere are a plethora of important issues that will come up during the debate, including the Middle East, abortion, the economy/inflation, January 6, Hunter Biden, Trump's legal issues, immigration, etc. Both campaigns will do their best to predict the questions in advance and devise some strong talking points. Political \"zingers\" have become more popular in presidential debates recently because of their ability to create viral moments, but the lack of an in-person audience may decrease the utility of these in Atlanta.\n\nWhat should/shouldn't the moderators do so that this doesn't become a sideshow?\n\nCNN moderators Jake Tapper and Dana Bash have complete autonomy over the debate questions. The network has instituted some novel rules for the presidential debate which should improve the quality of the product, including the ability to mute candidate microphones. This actually may help Trump, as viewers were turned off by his continual interruptions of Biden and moderator Chris Wallace in 2020.\n\nTwo planned commercial breaks will allow the candidates to compose themselves and regroup, although they will be prohibited from conferring with campaign aides.

However, campaign staff will be prohibited from interacting with their respective candidates during these intermissions, thereby denying them the opportunity to conduct strategic consultations or tinker with the debate. appearance of the candidates.\n\nNo opening statement\n\nUnlike previous debates, there will be no opening statements. Instead, each candidate will deliver a two-minute closing statement at the end of the debate. The debate will begin with a question, with candidates each having two minutes to respond. This will be followed by one-minute rebuttals and responses to rebuttals, plus additional time at the discretion of the moderators. Visual cues, such as flashing red lights, will alert candidates of remaining speaking time.\n\nMicrophones muted, no notes\n\nBiden and Trump will stand at identical lecterns, with their positions on stage determined by a drawing administered by CNN. Microphones will be muted throughout the debates, except when it is the candidate's turn to speak, a measure aimed at reducing interruptions that have marred previous debates. CNN said moderators Jake Tapper and Dana Bash would use every tool at their disposal to enforce timing and ensure a civilized discussion.\n\nEach candidate will receive a pen, a notepad and a bottle of water on stage; however, no props or written notes will be permitted.\n\nNo live audience\n\nContrary to tradition, there will be no studio audience to minimize disruption during the debate.

With the showdown one week away, Biden, who prefers briefing binders and practice sessions, will be focused on holding Trump accountable on his record and coming up with punchy one-liners to throw off the former president.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has been trying out new catch phrases and bits of rhetoric, ready to pound his rival with his words. Next Thursday's debate in Atlanta is believed to be the first time the two men will be in the same room together in four years - since their final presidential debate on October 15, 2020.\n\nThe Biden campaign is already down playing expectations, noting the president has been busy with his day job instead of preparing for the debate stage. 'The President will have less time for debate prep than 4 years ago given his day job, so prep will largely be confined to immediately prior,' a campaign official told DailyMail.com.\n\nBiden is coming off a hectic two-week travel schedule, having spent five days in France for the 80th anniversary of D-Day and a state visit. He then went to Italy for 48 hours for the G7 conference. He spent the weekend on the West Coast fundraising. But the biggest hurdle the 81-year-old will have to overcome are the concerns about his age. The Trump campaign has pummeled him about recent incidents showing him freezing or having to be guided off stage.\n\nThe White House claims the videos are edited to make the president look bad. And Biden's campaign has struck back at the 78-year-old Trump, pointing out times he fell asleep in court during his New York trial on business fraud. Trump, meanwhile, also has been down playing the upcoming showdown. At a rally in Wisconsin this week, he argued he won't just be debating Biden but also CNN's two debate moderators - Jake Tapper and Dana Bash - who he says doesn't like him.\n\n'I'll be debating three people instead of one half of a person,' he said. Biden will get the first word and Trump will get the last when the two men meet. The campaigns participated in a coin toss with host CNN on Thursday to determine speaking order and podium position. The debate will last 90 minutes with two commercial breaks.\n\nDuring that time, the president will focus on attacking Trump for 'ripping away reproductive rights, promoting political violence and undermining our democratic institutions, and doing the bidding of his billionaire donors to fund tax giveaways to the ultra-wealthy and corporations by hurting seniors and the middle class,' a Biden campaign official said. But neither man has held back in attacking his rival. Trump claims Biden is physically and mentally unfit for office, while Biden has called his Republican rival 'unhinged' and a danger to democracy.\n\nBiden's supporters also point to Trump's role in the January 6th insurrection at the Capitol, his attempts overturn the 2020 election and his conviction on May 30 for 34 felony counts for his involvement in a hush-money scheme to keep an alleged sexual encounter with a porn star from the public. Trump, meanwhile, could attack Biden's son Hunter, who was convicted last week on three felony charges related to a 2018 gun purchase. Neither man has been on the debate stage in years.\n\nBiden didn't have a serious Democratic primary challenger and Trump refused to participate in the GOP primary debates - which didn't harm him given he won the nomination. Biden's former chief of staff Ron Klain is leading the effort to help the president get ready for the debate. Klain has prepped presidential candidates going back to Hillary Clinton.\n\nTrump is not expected to do any mock debate sessions that would require someone to play the part of Joe Biden. As for the Biden campaign, they said the role of Donald Trump has yet to be cast for their mock sessions.\n\nBiden's personal lawyer, Bob Bauer, played Trump in Biden's debate prep sessions four years ago. But Trump will get time to practice his attack lines. He's holding a campaign rally in Philadelphia on Saturday, four days before the debate.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

The other is workshopping responses and retorts with vice presidential hopefuls, sharpening policy lines while working to rein in his bombastic rhetoric.\n\nIn some ways, aides to President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump describe similar goals heading into next Thursday's presidential debate: painting their opponent as presiding over disorder and wholly unfit for office.\n\nFor two men who have been circling each other rhetorically for the past four years, the debate hosted by CNN in Atlanta amounts to a moment of high consequence. Both candidates are aware of the stakes, officials in both campaigns say, as they huddle with their teams to prepare attacks, form rebuttals and frame the choice of November's election.\n\nBoth teams have spent the past weeks working to fine-tune their message on a wide array of issues, from the economy to foreign affairs to their rival's fitness for office. And each has found themselves distracted in some way: Trump by the criminal trial that consumed his spring and Biden by a stretch of intensive overseas travel and a painful legal saga for his family.\n\nYet the similarities mostly end there. How each man is preparing for the debate is ultimately a microcosm of their differences as candidates, and each will enter the CNN studio with divergent objectives.\n\nIn prep sessions that have already started, Biden has been focused on ways to hold Trump accountable on the debate stage - mirroring the broader political strategy that his White House and campaign have been deploying for months.\n\n\"The president has gotten increasingly punchier in recent remarks about Trump and plans to carry that theme through to the debate,\" one Biden campaign official said.\n\nAfter months of suggesting that the American electorate was tuned out of the 2024 race, the Biden camp sees the debate as a starting block of sorts, and a chance to present its study of candidate contrasts in front of a new and engaged audience.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, is aiming to assure voters he can be a steadier and more effective leader than his successor, despite the legal issues swirling around him and a deeply divisive approach to politics.\n\nSome of his debate prep has focused less on policy, but on rhetoric. Trump has previously struggled with policy debates, instead preferring to meander and generalize - especially without a teleprompter. He's also been quick to show aggression in past debates, including speaking over his opponents and attacking the moderators, moves that stuck with viewers in the months that followed.\n\n\"I'll probably be negotiating with three people, but that's OK. I've done that before,\" Trump told his supporters Tuesday at a rally in Racine, Wisconsin, referring to Biden and CNN's moderators. \"I'll be debating three people instead of one, instead of one half of a person.\"\n\nTo get ready, Biden is gathering trusted aides this week and next at Camp David, the mountainside presidential retreat, for several days of intensive discussion and preparation. The secluded complex of rustic lodges in Maryland has, in the past, helped focus Biden and his team ahead of important moments such as State of the Union speeches.\n\nThe preparations are expected to progress over a series of days, evolving from informal discussions about topics, questions and potential responses and culminating in more formal 90-minute mock debates. The president will likely be fueled by his favorite drink of orange Gatorade. (CNN debate rules stipulate that each candidate will have a pen, writing pad and a bottle of water at the podium.)\n\nThe White House is preserving the possibility that the president and his team could travel to Atlanta directly from Camp David, depending on how much practice remains.\n\nAides have been compiling binders of questions - with possible answers to each of them - on a wide range of topics for the president to peruse. Four years ago, Biden is said to have offered detailed feedback on every anticipated topic, sometimes rejecting certain suggestions altogether. At other points, he pushed aides to home in deeper on one subject matter or frame a response in a different way.\n\nBiden's former chief of staff, Ron Klain, is taking the lead to help the president get ready to debate Trump, a Biden campaign official told CNN. Beyond knowing and working for Biden for decades, Klain is the party's most seasoned debate coach, having worked with Democratic candidates in nearly every presidential race over the past three decades.\n\nBruce Reed, another longtime aide who currently serves as Biden's deputy chief of staff, has been charged with sifting through reams of material and hours of prior Trump appearances to inform the practice sessions. Earlier this year, Reed led the process to compile the policy substance and rhetorical flair that became Biden's hourlong State of the Union address.\n\nOther close senior advisers to the president, including chief of staff Jeff Zients and senior White House advisers Anita Dunn and Mike Donilon are also involved in preparations.\n\nThe Biden team has long argued that once voters begin paying attention to the race, they will see the choice as the study in contrasts the president has promoted endlessly, but which has failed to move the needle in polling. With tens of millions of Americans expected to watch the debate - aides point to recent polling that shows most likely voters plan to tune in - that theory will be tested.\n\nThe Biden camp plans to lean heavily on prior Trump comments that - while widely covered by the political media - may not have registered on the radars of the average voter, according to sources involved in the discussions.\n\nKlain, according to a confidante, has quipped that preparing to debate Trump should be straightforward because \"he only ever says eight things,\" referring to the former president's tendency to hash out familiar grievances on social media.\n\nWhile the list of those Trumpisms - and rebukes - is still being tailored, there's one that is sure to come up, according to one source involved: Trump's December 2023 suggestion that he would not rule like a dictator \"other than Day One.\"\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has deployed the help of some of his top contenders for vice president, as well as senators, policy experts and outside allies, to help brief him ahead of next week's debate. In recent weeks, Trump has participated in roughly a dozen of these private meetings, dubbed as informal \"policy discussions\" by his campaign, sources familiar with the sessions told CNN.\n\nThe subjects of the meetings have ranged from sharpening his messaging on the economy, the border and crime, to his views on abortion, the wars in the Middle East and Ukraine and how to best frame his May 30 conviction on 34 counts of business fraud, the sources said.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump huddled with Ohio Sen. JD Vance and members of the former president's staff at Mar-a-Lago for one such briefing, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the meeting. The informal session focused on messaging around the economy, including how to best hammer Biden on inflation - an issue Trump's campaign argues is the top concern for voters this fall.\n\nTrump engaged in a similar policy discussion with Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Eric Schmitt of Missouri at the Republican National Committee headquarters in Washington, DC, last week, following his meeting with House and Senate Republicans on Capitol Hill, CNN previously reported.\n\nAmong the topics discussed were democracy and how to respond to the inevitable questions regarding the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, including Trump's response to the riot incited by his supporters that day. Trump's co-campaign managers, Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, also attended the meeting and offered advice on how to most effectively address the issue.\n\nOther meetings have taken place with senior advisers Kellyanne Conway and Stephen Miller, as well as his former acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell.\n\nNone of Trump's sessions so far have included mock debates or role-playing, sources said, something the Trump campaign currently has no plans for the former president to engage in - a departure from 2020 when Trump faced off behind closed doors with former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie standing in for Biden.\n\nOn the Biden side, casting for a Trump stand-in this year remains open, with an expectation that Biden's personal lawyer, Bob Bauer - who stood in for Trump four years ago - could easily reprise his role.\n\n\"We set aside special sessions during which I was expected to be at my Trump-worst - as personally insulting and unhinged as Trump can be,\" Bauer recalled in his book released this week, describing his practice of \"lying and blustering and bullying my way through the mock sessions.\"\n\nIn fact, trying to prepare for a wide range of unpredictable scenarios that Biden might be confronted with when standing a handful of yards away from Trump was one of the most important goals of the mock debates in the fall of 2020, according to those who were in the room. Those scenarios included everything from long-winded answers to the possibility of Trump hurling personal insults.\n\nIn the last cycle, Biden aides were particularly sensitive to Trump attacking members of Biden's family on the debate stage.\n\n\"Part of the aim of the prep process was to really acclimate Biden to the idea that Trump was potentially going to say really horrible things about his own family, his kids, so that Biden would be prepared and would not feel caught off guard by Trump's style,\" former White House communications director Kate Bedingfield said.\n\nBiden's son, Hunter, was recently convicted on three felony gun charges - a development that the president and his aides are certain to be bracing for as a potential attack line.\n\nTrump's advisers, who are wary of using the words \"debate prep\" when it comes to the former president, have consistently downplayed the notion that he requires the type of preparation that other candidates - and specifically, Biden - need for such a high-stakes debate. Instead, they have pointed to Trump's rallies and media interviews as examples of how Trump is gearing up to take Biden on, including taking questions from friendly audience members at recent events.\n\n\"President Trump takes on numerous tough interviews every single week and delivers lengthy rally speeches while standing, demonstrating elite stamina,\" senior Trump adviser Jason Miller, who is running point on Trump's efforts in advance of the debate, said in a statement.\n\nAhead of the Atlanta debate, Trump plans to hold a campaign rally in Philadelphia, a city Biden has already visited several times this year as he works to replicate his 2020 victory in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe former president's allies and advisers point out that Trump has not only appeared on several presidential debate stages over the past decade, but he has also debated Biden before - a key reason, they say, for the less conventional approach to the preparations.\n\nBut while the Trump campaign's version of debate prep is unlike the traditional planning most past candidates - and even Trump himself - have engaged in, people close to the former president told CNN his team acknowledges there is still work to do before he takes the stage in Atlanta.\n\n\"There's no question the debate will show Trump is the stronger candidate and the better choice, especially when you see the stark contrast with Biden, physically, mentally and so on. But that doesn't mean Trump shouldn't, or isn't preparing,\" said a person close to Trump, who requested anonymity to speak candidly.\n\n\"He isn't going into this without doing his homework,\" the person added.", "source": {"uri": "egyptindependent.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Egypt Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type":

Former White House chief of staff Ron Klain will take the lead after helping Biden in 2020. The president's personal lawyer, Bob Bauer, has not confirmed whether he will reprise his role as the president's stand-in for Trump.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump, whose freewheeling style is viewed as both a strength and liability in a rigid debate format, has begun to hold informal strategy sessions, including multiple with Republican senators during his trip to Washington, D.C., last week.\n\n\"The president will have less time for debate prep than four years ago given his day job, so prep will largely be confined to immediately prior,\" a Biden campaign official told the Washington Examiner. \"The president has gotten increasingly punchier in recent remarks about Trump and plans to carry that theme through to the debate while still projecting himself as the wise and steady leader in contrast to Trump's chaos and division.\"\n\nNext week's debate could be a pivotal moment in the 2024 rematch between the two men, with Biden in particular hoping to dispel concerns about his age and mental acuity. For its part, the Biden campaign teased he will lean into familiar Democratic themes, including presenting Trump as a threat to democracy and abortion access.\n\n\"The president is prepping to hold Trump accountable for his extreme record and the dangerous things he's been saying on the trail,\" the Biden official said.\n\nTrump allies, too, have been making the debate more about policy than the performance of each candidate.\n\nOne of those Republicans, Sen. Eric Schmitt (R-MO), confirmed he and Trump had an impromptu \"wide-ranging\" debate session last week at the Republican National Committee's headquarters during the former president's tour of the capital.\n\nBut he said the point of the debate will be to draw a contrast on everything from the economy to immigration.\n\n\"It's also a pretty unique opportunity for the American people to see, sort of, a side by side of two people who've served as president and what they were able to accomplish, you know, under President Trump and what a disaster Joe Biden's record has been for 3 1/2 years,\" Schmitt told the Washington Examiner. \"That's a pretty unique contrast that no one's seen in our lifetimes.\"\n\nTrump has also spoken with policy experts and vice presidential hopefuls, including Sens. J.D. Vance (R-OH) and Marco Rubio (R-FL).\n\nThe strategy sessions will give Trump a chance to improve on his performance in 2020. During the first debate, his interruptions of Biden were viewed as a mistake, though the mics will be muted when a candidate is not speaking, per the debate rules.\n\nHowever, Trump campaign senior adviser Jason Miller dismissed the need for Trump to prepare and even suggested not doing so is part of what will distinguish him from Biden.\n\nThe former president \"takes on numerous tough interviews every single week and delivers lengthy rally speeches while standing, demonstrating elite stamina,\" Miller told the Washington Examiner.\n\n\"He does not need to be programmed by staff or shot up with chemicals like Joe Biden does,\" he added, repeating claims that Biden took performance-enhancing drugs for his most recent State of the Union speech.\n\nSchmitt said Trump didn't need the advice and predicted he will do well regardless. \"He's a very effective debater and a great counterpuncher,\" he said.\n\nThe war of words has bled into a disputed story that the Biden campaign tried to negotiate for the pair to debate sitting down.\n\n\"Donald Trump is a liar and a fraud. His campaign is full of liars and frauds,\" the Biden campaign told reporters this week. \"Their desperate leaks and lies to the right-wing media only underscore how scared Donald Trump is to debate.\"\n\nBut the messaging war will also continue promptly after the debate ends.\n\nTrump's camp has commissioned its first general election ads for next Thursday, the day of the debate, on CNN, the network hosting the event. At the same time, Biden's team has announced a $50 million June ad investment emphasizing Trump's conviction in his hush money trial.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters this week to \"stay tuned\" regarding Biden's schedule when asked whether he would have any public events before the debate, though she did preview the possibility of an appearance on Monday for the second anniversary of the Supreme Court repealing Roe v. Wade.\n\n\"We're still always working through the president's schedule,\" Jean-Pierre told reporters Monday. \"As you know, sitting in these seats and covering the president, you know how that is. Sometimes things pop up on the schedule very, very quickly. And so we always share that with you all.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nBiden and Trump's opening debate will be moderated by CNN's Jake Tapper and Dana Bash in Atlanta next Thursday at 9 p.m. and will air without a studio audience or written notes on their podiums.\n\nThe 90-minute broadcast will be interrupted for two commercial breaks, during which the candidates will not be able to confer with their campaigns, as part of an agreement made without the Commission on Presidential Debates for the first time in almost 40 years.

The other is workshopping responses and retorts with vice presidential hopefuls, sharpening policy lines while working to rein in his bombastic rhetoric.\n\nIn some ways, aides to President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump describe similar goals heading into next Thursday's presidential debate: painting their opponent as presiding over disorder and wholly unfit for office.\n\nFor two men who have been circling each other rhetorically for the past four years, the debate hosted by CNN in Atlanta amounts to a moment of high consequence. Both candidates are aware of the stakes, officials in both campaigns say, as they huddle with their teams to prepare attacks, form rebuttals and frame the choice of November's election.\n\nBoth teams have spent the past weeks working to fine-tune their message on a wide array of issues, from the economy to foreign affairs to their rival's fitness for office. And each has found themselves distracted in some way: Trump by the criminal trial that consumed his spring and Biden by a stretch of intensive overseas travel and a painful legal saga for his family.\n\nYet the similarities mostly end there. How each man is preparing for the debate is ultimately a microcosm of their differences as candidates, and each will enter the CNN studio with divergent objectives.\n\nIn prep sessions that have already started, Biden has been focused on ways to hold Trump accountable on the debate stage - mirroring the broader political strategy that his White House and campaign have been deploying for months.\n\n\"The president has gotten increasingly punchier in recent remarks about Trump and plans to carry that theme through to the debate,\" one Biden campaign official said.\n\nAfter months of suggesting that the American electorate was tuned out of the 2024 race, the Biden camp sees the debate as a starting block of sorts, and a chance to present its study of candidate contrasts in front of a new and engaged audience.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, is aiming to assure voters he can be a steadier and more effective leader than his successor, despite the legal issues swirling around him and a deeply divisive approach to politics.\n\nSome of his debate prep has focused less on policy, but on rhetoric. Trump has previously struggled with policy debates, instead preferring to meander and generalize - especially without a teleprompter. He's also been quick to show aggression in past debates, including speaking over his opponents and attacking the moderators, moves that stuck with viewers in the months that followed.\n\n\"I'll probably be negotiating with three people, but that's OK. I've done that before,\" Trump told his supporters Tuesday at a rally in Racine, Wisconsin, referring to Biden and CNN's moderators. \"I'll be debating three people instead of one, instead of one half of a person.\"\n\nDebate camp\n\nTo get ready, Biden is gathering trusted aides this week and next at Camp David, the mountainside presidential retreat, for several days of intensive discussion and preparation. The secluded complex of rustic lodges in Maryland has, in the past, helped focus Biden and his team ahead of important moments such as State of the Union speeches.\n\nThe preparations are expected to progress over a series of days, evolving from informal discussions about topics, questions and potential responses and culminating in more formal 90-minute mock debates. The president will likely be fueled by his favorite drink of orange Gatorade. (CNN debate rules stipulate that each candidate will have a pen, writing pad and a bottle of water at the podium.)\n\nThe White House is preserving the possibility that the president and his team could travel to Atlanta directly from Camp David, depending on how much practice remains.\n\nAides have been compiling binders of questions - with possible answers to each of them - on a wide range of topics for the president to peruse. Four years ago, Biden is said to have offered detailed feedback on every anticipated topic, sometimes rejecting certain suggestions altogether. At other points, he pushed aides to home in deeper on one subject matter or frame a response in a different way.\n\nBiden's former chief of staff, Ron Klain, is taking the lead to help the president get ready to debate Trump, a Biden campaign official told CNN. Beyond knowing and working for Biden for decades, Klain is the party's most seasoned debate coach, having worked with Democratic candidates in nearly every presidential race over the past three decades.\n\nBruce Reed, another longtime aide who currently serves as Biden's deputy chief of staff, has been charged with sifting through reams of material and hours of prior Trump appearances to inform the practice sessions. Earlier this year, Reed led the process to compile the policy substance and rhetorical flair that became Biden's hourlong State of the Union address.\n\nOther close senior advisers to the president, including chief of staff Jeff Zients and senior White House advisers Anita Dunn and Mike Donilon are also involved in preparations.\n\nThe Biden team has long argued that once voters begin paying attention to the race, they will see the choice as the study in contrasts the president has promoted endlessly, but which has failed to move the needle in polling. With tens of millions of Americans expected to watch the debate - aides point to recent polling that shows most likely voters plan to tune in - that theory will be tested.\n\nThe Biden camp plans to lean heavily on prior Trump comments that - while widely covered by the political media - may not have registered on the radars of the average voter, according to sources involved in the discussions.\n\nKlain, according to a confidante, has quipped that preparing to debate Trump should be straightforward because \"he only ever says eight things,\" referring to the former president's tendency to hash out familiar grievances on social media.\n\nWhile the list of those Trumpisms - and rebukes - is still being tailored, there's one that is sure to come up, according to one source involved: Trump's December 2023 suggestion that he would not rule like a dictator \"other than Day One.\"\n\n'Policy sessions'\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has deployed the help of some of his top contenders for vice president, as well as senators, policy experts and outside allies, to help brief him ahead of next week's debate. In recent weeks, Trump has participated in roughly a dozen of these private meetings, dubbed as informal \"policy discussions\" by his campaign, sources familiar with the sessions told CNN.\n\nThe subjects of the meetings have ranged from sharpening his messaging on the economy, the border and crime, to his views on abortion, the wars in the Middle East and Ukraine and how to best frame his May 30 conviction on 34 counts of business fraud, the sources said.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump huddled with Ohio Sen. JD Vance and members of the former president's staff at Mar-a-Lago for one such briefing, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the meeting. The informal session focused on messaging around the economy, including how to best hammer Biden on inflation - an issue Trump's campaign argues is the top concern for voters this fall.\n\nTrump engaged in a similar policy discussion with Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Eric Schmitt of Missouri at the Republican National Committee headquarters in Washington, DC, last week, following his meeting with House and Senate Republicans on Capitol Hill, CNN previously reported.\n\nAmong the topics discussed were democracy and how to respond to the inevitable questions regarding the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, including Trump's response to the riot incited by his supporters that day. Trump's co-campaign managers, Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, also attended the meeting and offered advice on how to most effectively address the issue.\n\nOther meetings have taken place with senior advisers Kellyanne Conway and Stephen Miller, as well as his former acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell.\n\nMock debates\n\nNone of Trump's sessions so far have included mock debates or role-playing, sources said, something the Trump campaign currently has no plans for the former president to engage in - a departure from 2020 when Trump faced off behind closed doors with former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie standing in for Biden.\n\nOn the Biden side, casting for a Trump stand-in this year remains open, with an expectation that Biden's personal lawyer, Bob Bauer - who stood in for Trump four years ago - could easily reprise his role.\n\n\"We set aside special sessions during which I was expected to be at my Trump-worst - as personally insulting and unhinged as Trump can be,\" Bauer recalled in his book released this week, describing his practice of \"lying and blustering and bullying my way through the mock sessions.\"\n\nIn fact, trying to prepare for a wide range of unpredictable scenarios that Biden might be confronted with when standing a handful of yards away from Trump was one of the most important goals of the mock debates in the fall of 2020, according to those who were in the room. Those scenarios included everything from long-winded answers to the possibility of Trump hurling personal insults.\n\nIn the last cycle, Biden aides were particularly sensitive to Trump attacking members of Biden's family on the debate stage.\n\n\"Part of the aim of the prep process was to really acclimate Biden to the idea that Trump was potentially going to say really horrible things about his own family, his kids, so that Biden would be prepared and would not feel caught off guard by Trump's style,\" former White House communications director Kate Bedingfield said.\n\nBiden's son, Hunter, was recently convicted on three felony gun charges - a development that the president and his aides are certain to be bracing for as a potential attack line.\n\nExpectations game\n\nTrump's advisers, who are wary of using the words \"debate prep\" when it comes to the former president, have consistently downplayed the notion that he requires the type of preparation that other candidates - and specifically, Biden - need for such a high-stakes debate. Instead, they have pointed to Trump's rallies and media interviews as examples of how Trump is gearing up to take Biden on, including taking questions from friendly audience members at recent events.\n\n\"President Trump takes on numerous tough interviews every single week and delivers lengthy rally speeches while standing, demonstrating elite stamina,\" senior Trump adviser Jason Miller, who is running point on Trump's efforts in advance of the debate, said in a statement.\n\nAhead of the Atlanta debate, Trump plans to hold a campaign rally in Philadelphia, a city Biden has already visited several times this year as he works to replicate his 2020 victory in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe former president's allies and advisers point out that Trump has not only appeared on several presidential debate stages over the past decade, but he has also debated Biden before - a key reason, they say, for the less conventional approach to the preparations.\n\nBut while the Trump campaign's version of debate prep is unlike the traditional planning most past candidates - and even Trump himself - have engaged in, people close to the former president told CNN his team acknowledges there is still work to do before he takes the stage in Atlanta.\n\n\"There's no question the debate will show Trump is the stronger candidate and the better choice, especially when you see the stark contrast with Biden, physically, mentally and so on. But that doesn't mean Trump shouldn't, or isn't preparing,\" said a person close to Trump, who requested anonymity to speak candidly.\n\n\"He isn't going into this without doing his homework,\" the person added.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kevin_liptak@aol.com", "name":

Commercial breaks have not occurred under The Commission on Presidential Debates, which has overseen the debates for over three decades, but won't this year.\n\nFor the first time since 1976, the presidential debate will not take place in front of a live audience.\n\nDetails of new rules\n\nBoth candidates agreed to have the microphones muted when it is not their turn to speak, minimizing potential for interruptions. Debates held ahead of the 2020 election included numerous interruptions by both Trump and Biden.\n\nOn par with previous years, the moderators \"will use all tools at their disposal to enforce timing and ensure a civilized discussion,\" said CNN.\n\nStraying from previous years, there will be no opening statements from either candidate. The candidates will be given two minutes to respond to a question, with one-minute rebuttals and responses to rebuttals. The moderators also will have an extra minute they can use at their discretion. At the end of the debate, there will be a two-minute closing statement from each candidate.\n\nAccording to the network, there will be a uniform podium with positions determined via a coin flip.\n\nThe candidates won't be able to bring pre-written notes or props onto the debate stage with them, they instead will be provided with a pen, paper and water. Campaign staff are also not permitted to speak or interact with their respective candidates until the end of the debate.\n\nThe June 27 debate marks the earliest presidential debate in U.S. history, with neither candidate officially accepting their party nomination yet. Both Biden and Trump will be able to accept their nominations after their party's conventions.\n\nThe Republican Convention is in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, next month, while the Democratic Convention takes place in August in Chicago.\n\nThe debate will be the first of two scheduled to take place this year, with an ABC News-hosted presidential debate set for September 10.", "source": {"uri": "voanews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "VOA Voice of America"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_debates", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States presidential debates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commission_on_Presidential_Debates", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Commission on Presidential Debates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_Bash", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dana Bash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Tapper", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jake Tapper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Communication", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Communication", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Historical_Anomalies_and_Revisionism", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Historical Anomalies and Revisionism", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://gdb.voanews.com/69004B18-26A1-49C8-85F1-EA05B4921E6D.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666748", "eventUri": "eng-9666748", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 124, "textEnd": 131, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "-09-10", "textStart": 2345, "textEnd": 2357}], "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who ran as an independent, was unable to meet the requirements.\n\nWhile this is a preamble to a likely rematch between President Biden and former President Trump, who are the presumptive nominees of their respective parties, there are several differences with this early presidential debate.\n\nFor one, the June 27 matchup will have no studio audience, unlike previous debates hosted by universities.\n\nCandidates also agreed to microphone muting throughout the 90-minute debate.

As debate preparations intensify, a Biden campaign official threw doubt on the idea that the historical trend would apply to Biden, who has often had showdowns about Trump and forcefully denounced him.\n\nThe official said the campaign could not imagine a world where Biden expected deference from Trump on a debate stage.\n\nIn a statement, Trump senior adviser Jason Miller said Trump would be ready for the debate, criticizing Biden's preparations as being \"programmed\" for the showdown by advisers and saying Trump does \"numerous tough interviews every single week and delivers lengthy rally speeches while standing.\"\n\n'Uncomfortable,' 'bewildered,' 'embarrassed'\n\nPresident Jimmy Carter was widely perceived to have fumbled his first -- and only -- debate against Ronald Reagan in 1980.\n\n\"Are you better off than you were four years ago?\" Reagan challenged voters in what became a theme damaging to Carter's campaign.\n\nIncumbents' historically rocky first debate performances stem from their having experienced deference in the Oval Office, experts said.\n\n\"Once the president is in the office, and especially after four years in the office, they are in a sort of protected bubble where they don't hear much conflicting information,\" said Schroeder, who has written a book about the history of presidential debates.\n\nAn incumbent on the debate stage can require \"a sort of transition almost back to being a normal citizen,\" he said.\n\nSamuel Popkin, who played Reagan during Carter's debate preparations, said, \"Every president thinks, 'I know how to run a presidential campaign because I won one a few years ago.'\"\n\nPopkin studied Reagan's remarks and wrote a memo about how to deflate his stories. But when it came to rehearsing a debate with Popkin playing Reagan, Carter \"got so uncomfortable\" and \"embarrassed,\" Popkin said.\n\nPopkin described the tense rehearsal in his book, \"The Candidate,\" writing that Carter was \"bewildered\" and that he suggested they stop after only 11 minutes of practice.\n\n\"The president looked lonely and vulnerable when he heard Reagan's critique in front of his wife, his closest friends, and his inner circle,\" Popkin wrote.\n\nFour years later, Reagan was the incumbent facing criticism, with The New York Times reporting that his advisers found he was on the defensive.\n\nSchroeder said, \"Even Bill Clinton, who was a really good debater, his first debate against Bob Dole in 1996 as an incumbent president was not his finest moment by any stretch of the imagination.\"\n\nFormer campaign officials emphasized the need for incumbents to strike contrasts with their challengers, rather than solely defend their records.\n\n\"Usually incumbents in some ways have the harder job, because they're defending the sitting record,\" said Sara Fagen, who worked on President George W. Bush's 2004 re-election campaign.\n\nVoters thought Democratic nominee John Kerry won the first debate against Bush by about 2-to-1, according to a Pew Research Center poll.\n\nIn a poll question asking voters to use one word to describe the candidates' performances, the top negative word for Bush was \"defensive.\"\n\n\"For most incumbents, you want to make the election about a choice, not a referendum,\" Fagen said.\n\nPresident Barack Obama faced a similar reckoning during his 2012 debate preparation.\n\n\"If it's a referendum on the incumbent, the incumbent usually loses,\" Obama 2012 campaign manager Jim Messina said he told Obama. \"If it is a choice between the two candidates, you'll win.\"\n\nMessina said he instructed Obama \"don't chase rabbits,\" meaning do not go down a hole in self-defense. He said Obama was on the defensive during several questions of his first 2012 debate against Republican nominee Mitt Romney.\n\nAbout two-thirds of voters thought Romney outperformed Obama in the first debate, according to CNN and Pew polls.\n\nDespite Obama's preparation, he \"was rusty,\" Schroeder said. \"He just seemed a little uncomfortable with the whole exercise.\"\n\nAfter the first debate, Messina said, Obama was \"much more focused.\"\n\n\"The president blew off one of the last debate sessions before the first debate,\" Messina said. \"He definitely did not do that after the first debate.\"\n\nMessina recalled seeing a video of himself in the spin room after the second debate with a \"glow about me.\"\n\n\"I look like a 10-year-old boy who just got free beer for the first time because I was so happy, because he had just driven the choice narrative over and over and over,\" Messina said.\n\nThe Biden campaign also appears to be digging into the choice narrative, previewing Biden's debate preparation by noting that he \"has gotten increasingly punchier in recent remarks about Trump and plans to carry that theme through to the debate, while still projecting himself as the wise and steady leader in contrast to Trump's chaos and division.\"\n\nJust a week before the first debate, the Biden campaign announced a $50 million advertising campaign, part of which is going to TV spots that strike a contrast between Biden's and Trump's characters.\n\nThe stakes\n\nThe debate next month holds a unique place in history not only for its unprecedented early date. It will be the first time two candidates who have held the Oval Office will face off. And it's unclear how much debates alone alter voting preferences come November.\n\n\"Ultimately, it's been very difficult for anybody to demonstrate that performances in presidential debates have changed voters' preferences,\" said Lynn Vavreck, a professor of American politics and public policy at UCLA.\n\nFagen said voters ahead of November are \"so already entrenched.\" She said this debate \"probably matters more than more recent elections, just because of the dynamics of the race,\" pointing to each candidate's challenges and the fact that both have held the presidency.\n\nBiden and Trump are neck and neck, according to polling. There is also a large and ideologically diverse swath of voters who dislike both candidates -- but may yet choose one of them in the fall.\n\nThe closeness of the race means a debate does not need to shift a large part of the electorate to have a notable impact.\n\n\"When you get into situations where you're talking about that few votes being pivotal, anything could be pivotal,\" Vavreck said.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "megan_lebowitz@aol.com", "name": "Megan Lebowitz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Carter", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Carter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_(government_title)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President (government title)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Arts", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Master of Arts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Miller_(communications_strategist)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jason Miller (communications strategist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Messina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Messina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush_2004_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George W.

Both candidates have accepted the network's invitation and agreed to accept the rules and format of the debate, as outlined in letters sent to the campaigns by the network in May.\n\nQualification requirements\n\nIn order to qualify for participation, candidates had to satisfy the requirements outlined in Article II, Section 1 of the US Constitution to serve as president, as well as file a formal statement of candidacy with the Federal Election Commission.\n\nAccording to parameters set by CNN in May, all participating debaters had to appear on a sufficient number of state ballots to reach the 270 electoral vote threshold to win the presidency and receive at least 15% in four separate national polls of registered or likely voters that meet CNN's standards for reporting.\n\nPolls that meet those standards are those sponsored by CNN, ABC News, CBS News, Fox News, Marquette University Law School, Monmouth University, NBC News, The New York Times/Siena College, NPR/PBS

their podium positions will be determined by a coin flip.\n\nMicrophones will be muted throughout the debate except for the candidate whose turn it is to speak.\n\nWhile no props or pre-written notes

We're just one week away from the first debate, which will air on CNN.\n\nIt will be in a TV studio, with no audience. Microphones will be muted when the other candidate is talking. There will be no props or prewritten notes. There will be two commercial breaks, and some intentionally onerous guidelines if any other network wants to simulcast the CNN stream.\n\nWhy is this happening? Let's posit for the moment that Biden and Trump are merely vessels for their respective parties, and are not personally involved in any aspects of the debate decision-making.\n\nFor the Democrats, you take this big swing because you believe the race needs to be shaken up, and fast. Rip the band-aid off, see what you've got, and try to change the trajectory of the race.\n\nFor the Republicans, you agree to this for one reason -- because it's the only way, it appears, to get Joe Biden on a debate stage. So you take what you can get, because you believe, whatever the format, that it is imperative to expose Biden to the widest audience possible.\n\nIt's fair to say that no single presidential debate has carried as much weight as this one. The stakes could not be higher for the candidates and both partisan constituencies. So let's break down the four possible outcomes -- and the political fallout of each.\n\n1. Biden meltdown ... brings a Biden replacement?\n\nThe White House and others on the left can argue all they want about the \"cheapfake\" videos of Biden they claim are out of context. But if Biden has a viral moment during the debate -- like the one over the weekend where former President Obama had to grab his arm and lead him off stage during a fundraiser after he visibly froze for eight seconds -- or if he appears flustered, lost and alarmingly old, it will be the single takeaway from the entire 90-minute event. And it's a scenario Democrats had to know was a possibility when they made the curious decision to agree to debate at all. (Remember -- they could have just passed on the debates entirely.)\n\nIf this happens, Trump will benefit in the short term, but it would be the clear impetus for the Democratic establishment to push Biden to the side in favor of a new nominee. And doing so this early would give them more leeway to execute.\n\nMaybe it's Vice President Kamala Harris, or maybe it's a contested convention in August, or maybe it's some other unprecedented plan. But next week's debate could absolutely be used as the catalyst to force a massive reshuffling of the 2024 primary. If that happens, it could conceivably help Democrats by putting a more attractive option up against Trump.\n\n2. Lose-lose ... is a big win for Trump\n\nIf the debate feels like two senior citizens arguing over bingo at the old age home, that the reality of 159 years of combined life crushes the soul of America, it's going to be a bad night for both candidates. Or maybe it's just that Biden is the worst version of himself -- stumbling and mumbling and smiling awkwardly -- while Trump is the most combative and unfocused version of himself.\n\nIn this scenario, Biden's mental fitness would probably not be glaring enough for the Democratic machine to replace him. The race doesn't change much, with turnout likely even more depressed because the growing group of \"double haters\" remain turned off by both candidates. So that makes it a win for Trump, both short- and long-term.\n\n3. Win-win ... is a small win for Trump\n\nIt's certainly plausible we get a debate like the second one in October 2020, where both candidates walked away claiming victory. We could see Biden score some points on Trump and get the legacy press and left boosting him up after, while Trump scores some points on Biden, and the right is able to plausibly argue on behalf of their candidate.\n\nA split-decision scenario would again be a win for Trump, because the race trajectory remains the same. That said, appearing competent and lucid is the admittedly low bar for Biden in 2024, and if he passes it, it could help him with \"normies\" who don't follow politics regularly and haven't paid much attention to the race so far.\n\n4. Biden overperforms, Trump struggles\n\nThe final possibility is that Biden overperforms expectations, while Trump gets flustered and sidetracked and fails to land the intellectual blows he needs to rough up the perception of Biden.\n\nThis is obviously helpful for the Democrats in the short term, but the prospects of long-term help are iffy. Their candidate remains the historically unpopular 81-year-old who sort of said he wouldn't be running for a second term the last time the casual fans checked in on the exhausting sport of politics.\n\nThe Acela media likes to play up every political plot twist as if it is monumental. But this pre-convention general election debate truly is one -- with the ramifications potentially leading to a candidate getting replaced.", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri": "steve_krakauer@thehill.com", "name": "Steve Krakauer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_debates", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States presidential debates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_debates", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential debates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commission_on_Presidential_Debates", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Commission on Presidential Debates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swing (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Simulcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Marcos,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Marcos, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Marcos, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partisan_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Partisan (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brokered_convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brokered convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_video", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Viral video"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_district", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electoral district"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_machine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political machine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Voter turnout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_age", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Old age"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Communication", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Communication", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/GettyImages-1229229798.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666748", "eventUri": "eng-9666748", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-09-16", "textStart": 74, "textEnd": 82}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-10-", "textStart": 3926, "textEnd": 3938}], "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

The other is workshopping responses and retorts with vice presidential hopefuls, sharpening policy lines while working to rein in his bombastic rhetoric.\n\nIn some ways, aides to President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump describe similar goals heading into next Thursday's presidential debate: painting their opponent as presiding over disorder and wholly unfit for office.\n\nFor two men who have been circling each other rhetorically for the past four years, the debate hosted by CNN in Atlanta amounts to a moment of high consequence. Both candidates are aware of the stakes, officials in both campaigns say, as they huddle with their teams to prepare attacks, form rebuttals and frame the choice of November's election.\n\nBoth teams have spent the past weeks working to fine-tune their message on a wide array of issues, from the economy to foreign affairs to their rival's fitness for office. And each has found themselves distracted in some way: Trump by the criminal trial that consumed his spring and Biden by a stretch of intensive overseas travel and a painful legal saga for his family.\n\nYet the similarities mostly end there. How each man is preparing for the debate is ultimately a microcosm of their differences as candidates, and each will enter the CNN studio with divergent objectives.\n\nIn prep sessions that have already started, Biden has been focused on ways to hold Trump accountable on the debate stage - mirroring the broader political strategy that his White House and campaign have been deploying for months.\n\n\"The president has gotten increasingly punchier in recent remarks about Trump and plans to carry that theme through to the debate,\" one Biden campaign official said.\n\nAfter months of suggesting that the American electorate was tuned out of the 2024 race, the Biden camp sees the debate as a starting block of sorts, and a chance to present its study of candidate contrasts in front of a new and engaged audience.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, is aiming to assure voters he can be a steadier and more effective leader than his successor, despite the legal issues swirling around him and a deeply divisive approach to politics.\n\nSome of his debate prep has focused less on policy, but on rhetoric. Trump has previously struggled with policy debates, instead preferring to meander and generalize - especially without a teleprompter. He's also been quick to show aggression in past debates, including speaking over his opponents and attacking the moderators, moves that stuck with viewers in the months that followed.\n\n\"I'll probably be negotiating with three people, but that's OK. I've done that before,\" Trump told his supporters Tuesday at a rally in Racine, Wisconsin, referring to Biden and CNN's moderators. \"I'll be debating three people instead of one, instead of one half of a person.\"\n\nDebate camp\n\nTo get ready, Biden is gathering trusted aides this week and next at Camp David, the mountainside presidential retreat, for several days of intensive discussion and preparation. The secluded complex of rustic lodges in Maryland has, in the past, helped focus Biden and his team ahead of important moments such as State of the Union speeches.\n\nThe preparations are expected to progress over a series of days, evolving from informal discussions about topics, questions and potential responses and culminating in more formal 90-minute mock debates. The president will likely be fueled by his favorite drink of orange Gatorade. (CNN debate rules stipulate that each candidate will have a pen, writing pad and a bottle of water at the podium.)\n\nThe White House is preserving the possibility that the president and his team could travel to Atlanta directly from Camp David, depending on how much practice remains.\n\nAides have been compiling binders of questions - with possible answers to each of them - on a wide range of topics for the president to peruse. Four years ago, Biden is said to have offered detailed feedback on every anticipated topic, sometimes rejecting certain suggestions altogether. At other points, he pushed aides to home in deeper on one subject matter or frame a response in a different way.\n\nBiden's former chief of staff, Ron Klain, is taking the lead to help the president get ready to debate Trump, a Biden campaign official told CNN. Beyond knowing and working for Biden for decades, Klain is the party's most seasoned debate coach, having worked with Democratic candidates in nearly every presidential race over the past three decades.\n\nBruce Reed, another longtime aide who currently serves as Biden's deputy chief of staff, has been charged with sifting through reams of material and hours of prior Trump appearances to inform the practice sessions. Earlier this year, Reed led the process to compile the policy substance and rhetorical flair that became Biden's hourlong State of the Union address.\n\nOther close senior advisers to the president, including chief of staff Jeff Zients and senior White House advisers Anita Dunn, Mike Donilon and Cedric Richmond are also involved in preparations.\n\nThe Biden team has long argued that once voters begin paying attention to the race, they will see the choice as the study in contrasts the president has promoted endlessly, but which has failed to move the needle in polling. With tens of millions of Americans expected to watch the debate - aides point to recent polling that shows most likely voters plan to tune in - that theory will be tested.\n\nThe Biden camp plans to lean heavily on prior Trump comments that - while widely covered by the political media - may not have registered on the radars of the average voter, according to sources involved in the discussions.\n\nKlain, according to a confidante, has quipped that preparing to debate Trump should be straightforward because \"he only ever says eight things,\" referring to the former president's tendency to hash out familiar grievances on social media.\n\nWhile the list of those Trumpisms - and rebukes - is still being tailored, there's one that is sure to come up, according to one source involved: Trump's December 2023 suggestion that he would not rule like a dictator \"other than Day One.\"\n\n'Policy sessions'\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has deployed the help of some of his top contenders for vice president, as well as senators, policy experts and outside allies, to help brief him ahead of next week's debate. In recent weeks, Trump has participated in roughly a dozen of these private meetings, dubbed as informal \"policy discussions\" by his campaign, sources familiar with the sessions told CNN.\n\nThe subjects of the meetings have ranged from sharpening his messaging on the economy, the border and crime, to his views on abortion, the wars in the Middle East and Ukraine and how to best frame his May 30 conviction on 34 counts of business fraud, the sources said.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump huddled with Ohio Sen. JD Vance and members of the former president's staff at Mar-a-Lago for one such briefing, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the meeting. The informal session focused on messaging around the economy, including how to best hammer Biden on inflation - an issue Trump's campaign argues is the top concern for voters this fall.\n\nTrump engaged in a similar policy discussion with Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Eric Schmitt of Missouri at the Republican National Committee headquarters in Washington, DC, last week, following his meeting with House and Senate Republicans on Capitol Hill, CNN previously reported.\n\nAmong the topics discussed were democracy and how to respond to the inevitable questions regarding the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, including Trump's response to the riot incited by his supporters that day. Trump's co-campaign managers, Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, also attended the meeting and offered advice on how to most effectively address the issue.\n\nOther meetings have taken place with senior advisers Kellyanne Conway and Stephen Miller, as well as his former acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell.\n\nMock debates\n\nNone of Trump's sessions so far have included mock debates or role-playing, sources said, something the Trump campaign currently has no plans for the former president to engage in - a departure from 2020 when Trump faced off behind closed doors with former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie standing in for Biden.\n\nOn the Biden side, casting for a Trump stand-in this year remains open, with an expectation that Biden's personal lawyer, Bob Bauer - who stood in for Trump four years ago - could easily reprise his role.\n\n\"We set aside special sessions during which I was expected to be at my Trump-worst - as personally insulting and unhinged as Trump can be,\" Bauer recalled in his book released this week, describing his practice of \"lying and blustering and bullying my way through the mock sessions.\"\n\nIn fact, trying to prepare for a wide range of unpredictable scenarios that Biden might be confronted with when standing a handful of yards away from Trump was one of the most important goals of the mock debates in the fall of 2020, according to those who were in the room. Those scenarios included everything from long-winded answers to the possibility of Trump hurling personal insults.\n\nIn the last cycle, Biden aides were particularly sensitive to Trump attacking members of Biden's family on the debate stage.\n\n\"Part of the aim of the prep process was to really acclimate Biden to the idea that Trump was potentially going to say really horrible things about his own family, his kids, so that Biden would be prepared and would not feel caught off guard by Trump's style,\" former White House communications director Kate Bedingfield said.\n\nBiden's son, Hunter, was recently convicted on three felony gun charges - a development that the president and his aides are certain to be bracing for as a potential attack line.\n\nExpectations game\n\nTrump's advisers, who are wary of using the words \"debate prep\" when it comes to the former president, have consistently downplayed the notion that he requires the type of preparation that other candidates - and specifically, Biden - need for such a high-stakes debate. Instead, they have pointed to Trump's rallies and media interviews as examples of how Trump is gearing up to take Biden on, including taking questions from friendly audience members at recent events.\n\n\"President Trump takes on numerous tough interviews every single week and delivers lengthy rally speeches while standing, demonstrating elite stamina,\" senior Trump adviser Jason Miller, who is running point on Trump's efforts in advance of the debate, said in a statement.\n\nAhead of the Atlanta debate, Trump plans to hold a campaign rally in Philadelphia, a city Biden has already visited several times this year as he works to replicate his 2020 victory in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe former president's allies and advisers point out that Trump has not only appeared on several presidential debate stages over the past decade, but he has also debated Biden before - a key reason, they say, for the less conventional approach to the preparations.\n\nBut while the Trump campaign's version of debate prep is unlike the traditional planning most past candidates - and even Trump himself - have engaged in, people close to the former president told CNN his team acknowledges there is still work to do before he takes the stage in Atlanta.\n\n\"There's no question the debate will show Trump is the stronger candidate and the better choice, especially when you see the stark contrast with Biden, physically, mentally and so on. But that doesn't mean Trump shouldn't, or isn't preparing,\" said a person close to Trump, who requested anonymity to speak candidly.\n\n\"He isn't going into this without doing his homework,\" the person added.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

No press briefings. No media appearances. Nothing. Meanwhile, President Trump will be traversing the country for rallies and meeting voters. The choice is clear,\" Nick Sortor wrote.\n\nIn what will be the first real showdown between the two this election cycle, the face-off could potentially shift the narrative for both candidates and each is looking to attract undecided voters in what is expected to be a very tight race.\n\nUnlike in 2020, Biden's 2024 duties as president will take away some of the time he has for debate prep, meaning much of it will be confined to the days immediately beforehand, officials said.\n\nBiden has just completed a whirlwind couple of weeks that included two foreign trips and hosting two major fundraisers -- all while dealing with the emotional fallout from his son, Hunter Biden's, recent conviction on felony gun charges.\n\nAccording to a campaign official, Ron Klain, Biden's former chief of staff, is leading the debate preparations. Other senior campaign aides and longtime advisers, including Cedric Richmond, a former White House aide and current campaign co-chair, will also be on hand.\n\nTo get ready, Biden is gathering trusted aides this week and next at Camp David, the mountainside presidential retreat, for several days of intensive discussion and preparation. The secluded complex of rustic lodges in Maryland has, in the past, helped focus Biden and his team ahead of important moments such as State of the Union speeches.\n\nThe preparations are expected to progress over a series of days, evolving from informal discussions about topics, questions and potential responses and culminating in more formal 90-minute mock debates. The president will likely be fueled by his favorite drink of orange Gatorade. (CNN debate rules stipulate that each candidate will have a pen, writing pad and a bottle of water at the podium.)\n\nThe White House is preserving the possibility that the president and his team could travel to Atlanta directly from Camp David, depending on how much practice remains.\n\nAides have been compiling binders of questions - with possible answers to each of them - on a wide range of topics for the president to peruse. Four years ago, Biden is said to have offered detailed feedback on every anticipated topic, sometimes rejecting certain suggestions altogether. At other points, he pushed aides to home in deeper on one subject matter or frame a response in a different way.\n\nCNN released additional details about the debate earlier this week.\n\nCNN Releases Additional Details For Trump-Biden Debate\n\nThe debate, moderated by Jake Tapper and Dana Bash, will be 90 minutes and include two commercial breaks.\n\nCampaign staff may not interact with the candidates during the commercial breaks.\n\n\"Both candidates agreed to appear at a uniform podium, and their podium positions will be determined by a coin flip,\" CNN wrote.\n\n\"Microphones will be muted throughout the debate except for the candidate whose turn it is to speak.

This year, Biden's debate prep could look similar with his facing the same opponent.\n\nBiden will be aiming to hold Trump accountable for not only his administration's track record, but also comments Trump has made on the campaign trail on topics ranging from reproductive rights to the economy, to perceived threats of political violence, to what Biden campaign officials say are his efforts to undermine the judicial system.\n\nHe is also expected to continue the \"punchier\" -- more pointed -- remarks he has used to attack the former president as of late, campaign officials said.\n\nBiden has taken to half-jokingly slamming Trump for suggesting that disinfectants could be used to treat coronavirus.\n\n\"Remember when he was trying to deal with COVID, he said just inject a little bleach in your veins,\" Biden said after at North America's Building Trades Unions National Legislative Conference in April. \"He missed it. It all went to his hair.\"\n\nAt a recent fundraiser in Los Angeles with former President Obama, after moderator Jimmy Kimmel asked the president if his recent trip to Italy -- which included a visit with the pope -- was to \"restore the soul of America\" because it seemed like the country needed an \"exorcism,\" Biden jokingly replied \"Yeah.\"\n\nTrump and his campaign have been pushing the narrative that Biden is in the midst of a \"cognitive decline.\" They've seized on a misleading video from his trip to France to mark the the 80th anniversary of D-Day where they falsely claimed the president \"froze.\"\n\nIf elected, Biden would be 86 when he completed his second term, the oldest president ever to serve.\n\nHis poll numbers show him neck-and-neck in key battleground states with Trump, according to 538's polling average -- and he must perform well to quell voter doubts.\n\nSeparately, in the lead-up to the debate, the Biden campaign has focused on slamming Trump over his 34 felony convictions in his New York hush-money trial. They've labeled this November as an election between a \"convicted criminal\" and a \"president who's fighting for your family\" in a new ad that's a part of a $50 million June paid media campaign.",

Here's how they'll prep.", "body": "WASHINGTON - With one week to go, President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are in full-on debate mode.\n\nThe presumptive Democratic and Republican nominees are starting the final stages of preparation for their first in-person showdown since 2020. Biden will take campaign briefings at Camp David this weekend, while Trump will also meet with policy advisors, all activities leading up to Thursday's encounter.\n\nThe former president will also engage Saturday in his favorite form of debate prep: A campaign rally, this one in the politically pivotal state of Pennsylvania.\n\nThe Trump and Biden campaigns expect millions to tune in for this first of two scheduled presidential debates. CNN will host the opening round on Thursday in Atlanta. ABC is organizing a second debate for Sept. 10, with details to come.\n\nIn a race that is currently a dead heat, both candidates are gearing up to play both offense and defense, on topics ranging from Biden's age to Trump's criminal conviction in his New York hush money case.\n\nAs Biden gets ready for the showdown in Atlanta, he's taking a more tradition approach: Debate camp.\n\nThe president is scheduled to depart Thursday for the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland as he and his advisors try to figure out how to counter his political rival next week.\n\nOne likely issue to surface at the debate (and during debate preparations): The ages of the candidates.\n\nVoters have concerns about both Biden and Trump's ages as the November election approaches. After all, in 2025 either of them would be the oldest president to take office.\n\nTrump, 78, has clearly signaled he plans to make Biden's age an issue in both the debate on Thursday and the months of campaigning to follow. While Trump has said Biden, 81, isn't too old to serve as president, during a rally in Wisconsin on Tuesday. Trump said the Democrats \"have a candidate who has no clue.\"\n\nBiden, on the other hand, is expected to also challenge Trump's cognitive abilities, from his slurring of words to threatening political opponents with prosecution.\n\nBiden spokesperson James Singer said in a statement that Trump \"has only gotten worse,\" and accused the former president of being a \"convicted criminal who's only out for himself.\"\n\nThis time around, Trump isn't planning to hold mock debates, a common tool politicians use to prepare for the onstage competitions. Instead, it appears he's relying on rallies and talks with a variety of allies.\n\nIn recent weeks, he's spoken with a network of his defenders about how he should handle the debate with Biden. The debate advisers have included some of Trump's top vice-presidential running mate possibilities, such as Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and J.D. Vance of Ohio and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum.\n\nIn addition to attacking Biden on the debate stage, Trump will also likely address his criminal conviction in New York, where a jury last month found him guilty of falsifying business records to hide a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\n\nHe's also expected to talk about abortion. Trump has publicly said he believes states should set their own restrictions as Republicans struggle to unify behind one stance - and Democrats accuse the former president of supporting a national ban.\n\nPolitical observers will be watching to see if Trump addresses these in front of crowds in Philadelphia over the weekend as he prepares to make his GOP pitch to voters across the country next week.\n\nIn previous speeches, Trump has said that proposals for a federal abortion ban could hurt Republican candidates - including himself - in the fall election.\n\nAnd as for his four sets of criminal charges, Trump said Thursday on Truth Social: \"All Biden can do is talk about his WEAPONIZED Witch Hunt Trials against me.\" The former president has long claimed without evidence that his indictments across multiple cases are targeting his reelection bid.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_David", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Camp David"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Burgum", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Doug Burgum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stormy_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stormy Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

As debate preparations intensify, a Biden campaign official cast doubt on the idea that the historical trend would apply to Biden, who has often gotten into confrontations over Trump and forcefully denounced him .\n\nThe official said the campaign couldn't imagine a world in which Biden would expect deference from Trump in a debate.\n\nIn a statement, Trump senior adviser Jason Miller said Trump would be ready for the debate, criticizing Biden's preparations as being timed for confrontation by advisers and saying Trump was doing many tough interviews every week and speaking out long standing rally speeches.\n\n\"Uncomfortable\", \"disconcerted\", \"embarrassed\"\n\nPresident Jimmy Carter was widely seen as having botched his first and only debate against Ronald Reagan in 1980.\n\n\"Are you better off than you were four years ago?\" Reagan challenged voters on what became a damaging theme for Carter's campaign.\n\nHistorically difficult early debate performances by outgoing presidents are due to the fact that they have been the subject of deference in the Oval Office, experts say.\n\nOnce the president is in office, and especially after four years in office, he is in a sort of protected bubble where he doesn't hear a lot of conflicting information, said Schroeder, who wrote a book on the history of presidential debates.\n\nAn incumbent on the debate stage may need some sort of transition to become a normal citizen again, he said.\n\nSamuel Popkin, who played Reagan during Carter's debate preparations, said: \"Every president thinks: I know how to run a presidential campaign because I won one a few years ago.\n\nPopkin studied Reagan's remarks and wrote a memo on how to deflate his stories. But when it came to rehearsing a debate with Popkin playing Reagan, Carter was so uncomfortable and embarrassed, Popkin said.\n\nPopkin described the tense rehearsal in his book, The Candidate, writing that Carter was baffled and suggested stopping after just 11 minutes of practice.\n\nThe president looked alone and vulnerable when he heard Reagan's criticism in front of his wife, his closest friends and his entourage, Popkin wrote.\n\nFour years later, Reagan was the incumbent president facing criticism, with the New York Times reporting that his advisers found him to be on the defensive.\n\nSchroeder said: Even Bill Clinton, who was a very good debater, his first debate against Bob Dole in 1996 as the incumbent president was not, by any means, his finest moment.\n\nFormer campaign officials have stressed the need for incumbents to draw contrasts with their challengers, rather than simply defending their results.\n\n\"Usually, incumbents have, in some ways, the toughest job, because they're defending the record of the session,\" said Sara Fagen, who worked on President George W. Bush's 2004 re-election campaign. .\n\nVoters thought Democratic candidate John Kerry won the first debate against Bush by about 2 to 1, according to a Pew Research Center poll.\n\nJohn Kerry and George Bush during a presidential debate in Coral Gables, Florida, in 2004. Ron Edmonds/AP\n\nIn a poll question asking voters to use one word to describe the candidates' performance, the most negative word for Bush was \"defensive.\"\n\n\"For most incumbents, the election should be a choice, not a referendum,\" Fagen said.\n\nPresident Barack Obama faced a similar reckoning in preparation for the 2012 debate.\n\n\"If it's a referendum on the incumbent president, the incumbent usually loses,\" Jim Messina, Obama's 2012 campaign manager, told Obama. \"If there is a choice between the two candidates, you will win.\n\nMessina said he asked Obama \"not to chase rabbits,\" that is, not to fall into a hole to defend himself. He said Obama was defensive during several questions in his first 2012 debate against Republican nominee Mitt Romney.\n\nAbout two-thirds of voters thought Romney outperformed Obama in the first debate, according to CNN and Pew polls.\n\nDespite Obama's preparation, he \"was rusty,\" Schroeder said. \"He just seemed a little uncomfortable with the whole exercise.\"\n\nAfter the first debate, Messina said, Obama was \"much more focused.\"\n\n\"The president ruined one of the last debate sessions before the first debate,\" Messina said. \"He certainly didn't do that after the first debate.\"\n\nMitt Romney and Barack Obama during the second presidential debate in Hempstead, New York, in 2012.

Clary / AFP via Getty Images file\n\nMessina remembers seeing a video of himself in the film room after the second debate with a \"glow about me.\"\n\n\"I look like a 10-year-old boy who just got free beer for the first time because I was so happy, because he had just driven the narrative of choice over and over again,\" Messina said.\n\nThe Biden campaign also appears to be interested in the choice narrative, providing insight into Biden's debate preparation by noting that he \"has become increasingly forceful in his recent remarks about Trump and plans to continue this theme in the debate, while projecting himself as the wise and constant\". leader, unlike the chaos and division of Trump.\n\nJust a week before the first debate, the Biden campaign announced a $50 million ad campaign, part of which will go toward TV spots contrasting the Biden and Trump personas.\n\nChallenges\n\nNext month's debate occupies a unique place in history, not only because of its unprecedented early timing. This will be the first time that two candidates who have occupied the Oval Office will face each other. And it's unclear how much the debates alone will change voting preferences in November.\n\n\"Ultimately, it was very difficult for anyone to demonstrate that performance in the presidential debates changed voters' preferences,\" said Lynn Vavreck, a professor of American politics and public policy at UCLA.\n\nFagen said voters by November are already entrenched. She said this debate \"probably matters more than more recent elections, just because of the dynamics of the race,\" highlighting each candidate's challenges and the fact that both have held the presidency.\n\nBiden and Trump are neck and neck, poll shows. There is also a wide range of ideologically diverse voters who dislike both candidates but might choose one in the fall.\n\nThe close nature of the race means that a debate does not need to move a large portion of the electorate to have a notable impact.\n\n\"When you find yourself in situations where you're talking about a few critical votes, everything can be crucial,\" Vavreck said.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_debates", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States presidential debates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Carter", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Carter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "George W.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. posted a video on Instagram this week introducing the two ravens he's coaxed into hanging out on his balcony by giving them food every morning. He's hoping to teach them to eat out of his hand.\n\nWhat To Expect From Next Week's First Presidential Debate\n\nViewers tuning into a debate between President Gerald Ford and then-Governor Jimmy Carter in 1976 were treated to one of the rarest spectacles in politics: 27 minutes of silence. The debate's audio cut out due to a failed 25-cent electrical component that took nearly a half-hour to find and fix.\n\nThose tuning into the first debate of the 2024 cycle between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump on June 27 may be hoping for the same thing.\n\nNext week's CNN-hosted debate in Atlanta, Georgia, is unprecedented several times over: The contest between two historically old and unpopular candidates-one of whom is a convicted felon-is taking place earlier than any general election debate in recent memory and under fairly unconventional rules. National surveys and swing-state polls have for months shown Trump with a slight advantage over the incumbent, though his lead is often within the margin of error. Will a debate shake up the race?\n\nUsually, presidential debates present candidates-particularly the challenger-to introduce themselves to the broader American public, giving voters who may not have been watching the primary process closely a chance to familiarize themselves with their options. This time, however, Biden and Trump need no introduction: both have served a term as president and have been fixtures in the national media for a half-century.\n\nNo, voters know who their options are, and most of them aren't fans. A Gallup poll last month-in the field before Trump's May 31 felony convictions in New York-showed Biden and Trump pulling equal favorability ratings, with 46 percent of respondents viewing the candidates favorably overall. Among the majority of respondents who've soured on the two candidates, Trump seemed to provoke a more extreme response, with 40 percent holding a \"highly unfavorable\" opinion of him compared to 35 percent for Biden on that score. But all told, Biden was slightly more unpopular with respondents, with 54 percent rating him unfavorably compared to 52 percent who thought poorly of Trump.\n\nPerhaps expectedly given that data, that race has been tight for months. National RealClearPolitics (RCP) polling averages show Trump ahead of Biden by 0.5 percentage points in a two-way race-a statistical tie-and up 2.4 percent nationally in a five-way race that also includes independent candidates Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Cornel West, and Green Party candidate Jill Stein (but not Libertarian Party nominee Chase Oliver). Biden got some good news last night-a Fox News poll that a three-point swing in his direction since last month-but he hasn't led Trump in the average of either configuration since September. RCP's polling averages also show Trump ahead in seven key battleground states: Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Georgia. Of those, the former president's weakest polling showing seems to be in Wisconsin and Michigan, where Biden and Trump are in a statistical dead heat.\n\nEven though he has a slight polling edge, Trump also seems to have a ceiling, failing to eclipse 48 percent in the RCP average at any point in a two-way race. In a five-way race, Trump's high-water mark is 43 percent.\n\nIt's not just election fatigue that has this debate seeming earlier than ever: General election debates have never been held before late September after both candidates are officially nominated at their party's national convention, this year in mid-July for the Republicans and mid-August for the Democrats. In both 2016 and 2020, June 27 was closer to the final primary debates of those cycles than to the first general election debate.\n\nIt wasn't clear there would be general election debates at all this election cycle. In early 2022, the Republican National Committee pulled out of the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD)-the nonpartisan organization that has long organized debates-citing alleged bias. The Biden campaign, for its part, dragged its feet in December when asked if the president would participate. Our own Chris Stirewalt predicted last year that hope for a 2024 general election debate was dead.\n\nBut, much like Noam Chomsky, reports of the presidential debate's death were ultimately greatly exaggerated. The two campaigns came together last month to organize a debate independently of the CPD. \"I am Ready and Willing to Debate Crooked Joe at the two proposed times,\" Trump posted on Truth Social May 15. \"Just tell me when, I'll be there. 'Let's get ready to Rumble!!!'\" Later that same day, Biden responded with a video message. \"Donald Trump lost two debates to me in 2020, and since then he hasn't shown up for a debate,\" he said, referring to Trump's non-appearances at the handful of Republican primary dates. \"Now he is acting like he wants to debate me again. Well, make my day, pal. I'll even do it twice.\"\n\nThis televised throwdown will be a rematch of four years ago, but the format will look a little different, CNN announced this week. Incredibly-or maybe predictably, considering the free-for-all of the last severaltelevised debates-microphones will be muted when it is the other candidate's turn to speak. Reportedly at the request of the Biden campaign, there will be no live audience in the room. The 90-minute program will have two commercial breaks, but the candidates' staff will be barred from interacting with Biden and Trump during that time. The first candidate to speak will be determined as all gentlemen's competitions begin-with a coin toss-and the moderators, Dana Bash and Jake Tapper, will jump right into questions, forgoing opening statements from the two candidates.\n\nThe muted microphones seem to be geared towards preventing the screaming match at the first debate in 2020-although it's unclear whether the decision came from the network or a request from one of the campaigns. Will it work? \"I don't think Donald Trump cares about a mute button,\" said Gail Gitcho, a Republican consultant who advised several presidential campaigns, most recently that of biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy. \"If there's one thing that you can predict about President Trump, it's that he's going to be on offense all the time.\"\n\nBut would an empty room put a damper on some of the former president's sometimes boisterous antics? \"Trump is always the more theatrical one,\" Gitcho told TMD, suggesting the Biden campaign figured a live audience plays to Trump's advantage. But the theory that, with no live audience, Trump will downplay his stagecraft is \"really silly,\" she added.\n\nIndependent candidate Robert F. Kennedy will not be on the stage after falling short of CNN's benchmark qualifications to make the debate. The network required candidates-in addition to being constitutionally eligible and having filed their candidacy with the Federal Elections Commission-to reach at least 15 percent on four national polls, and be on enough ballots to secure the 270 electoral votes needed to win. Kennedy fell short on two fronts, garnering 15 percent in only three national polls and making the ballot in only six states and therefore eligible for only about a third of the electoral votes required.\n\nKennedy will be watching the show just like the rest of us, as Biden and Trump try to make themselves look good, and perhaps more crucially, one another look bad. Axios' Alex Thompsonreported yesterday that the Biden campaign is prepared to make Donald Trump's character-and the events of January 6-the focal point of its electoral strategy. Trump, meanwhile, has consistently hit Biden on the border and the economy, while all the while centering \"retribution\" as a key campaign theme.\n\nBut the debate may end up being less about the content and more about the delivery, with two elderly men standing behind the podiums. Trump, his campaign, and its supporters have spent months hitting Biden on his age and feebleness, including occasionally with some misleading editing. At a rally in Wisconsin on Tuesday, Trump suggested that Biden would need to be \"pumped up\" on cocaine in order to debate him.\n\nAt the same time, Trump, only three years Biden's junior, seems to appreciate that attacks on his opponent's age may have an \"Uno reverse\" quality to them-both because of his own advanced years and because if the bar is set too low for Biden, he could exceed expectations. \"JOE BIDEN IS NOT TOO OLD TO BE PRESIDENT-NOT EVEN CLOSE,\" Trump posted on social media earlier this month. \"BUT HE IS TOO INCOMPETENT AND CORRUPT!\"\n\nMeanwhile, 81-year-old Biden-whom even some unnamed Democrats admitted in a recent Wall Street Journal report was showing his age-made sure Trump didn't feel self-conscious about his age on his birthday last week. \"Happy 78th birthday, Donald,\" the president tweeted. \"Take it from one old guy to another: Age is just a number.\"\n\nAnd while both Trump and Biden may want that to be true, voters are concerned. In March, a New York Times/Siena College poll showed that some two-thirds of voters thought Biden was \"just too old\" to continue to be an effective president. Voters seemed much less concerned about Trump's age.\n\nIn the never-ending list of things that could make this debate unlike any other, one of the candidates is a convicted felon, a fact Biden will likely point out. \"He's been convicted of 34 felonies, found liable for sexual assault, and committed financial fraud,\" the narrator says in a campaign commercial Biden tweeted Monday.\n\nBut Trump has maintained the conviction-and otherlegalwoes-are nothing more than political hit-jobs. \"When [Biden] indicted me over nothing, they opened up a whole new box and then I got indicted again and again and again. ... I was like a ping-pong ball,\" Trump told supporters in Nevada last week, erroneously suggesting that the president himself drove the criminal charges being brought. \"And what they've done is they've weaponized the Department of Justice.\"\n\nAs weird as the debate is sure to be, will anyone be watching who hasn't already decided who to vote for?

As debate preparations intensify, a Biden campaign official threw doubt on the idea that the historical trend would apply to Biden, who has often had showdowns about Trump and forcefully denounced him.\n\nThe official said the campaign could not imagine a world where Biden expected deference from Trump on a debate stage.\n\nIn a statement, Trump senior adviser Jason Miller said Trump would be ready for the debate, criticizing Biden's preparations as being \"programmed\" for the showdown by advisers and saying Trump does \"numerous tough interviews every single week and delivers lengthy rally speeches while standing.\"\n\nPresident Jimmy Carter was widely perceived to have fumbled his first -- and only -- debate against Ronald Reagan in 1980.\n\n\"Are you better off than you were four years ago?\" Reagan challenged voters in what became a theme damaging to Carter's campaign.\n\nIncumbents' historically rocky first debate performances stem from their having experienced deference in the Oval Office, experts said.\n\n\"Once the president is in the office, and especially after four years in the office, they are in a sort of protected bubble where they don't hear much conflicting information,\" said Schroeder, who has written a book about the history of presidential debates.\n\nAn incumbent on the debate stage can require \"a sort of transition almost back to being a normal citizen,\" he said.\n\nSamuel Popkin, who played Reagan during Carter's debate preparations, said, \"Every president thinks, 'I know how to run a presidential campaign because I won one a few years ago.'\"\n\nPopkin studied Reagan's remarks and wrote a memo about how to deflate his stories. But when it came to rehearsing a debate with Popkin playing Reagan, Carter \"got so uncomfortable\" and \"embarrassed,\" Popkin said.\n\nPopkin described the tense rehearsal in his book, \"The Candidate,\" writing that Carter was \"bewildered\" and that he suggested they stop after only 11 minutes of practice.\n\n\"The president looked lonely and vulnerable when he heard Reagan's critique in front of his wife, his closest friends, and his inner circle,\" Popkin wrote.\n\nFour years later, Reagan was the incumbent facing criticism, with The New York Times reporting that his advisers found he was on the defensive.\n\nSchroeder said, \"Even Bill Clinton, who was a really good debater, his first debate against Bob Dole in 1996 as an incumbent president was not his finest moment by any stretch of the imagination.\"\n\nFormer campaign officials emphasized the need for incumbents to strike contrasts with their challengers, rather than solely defend their records.\n\n\"Usually incumbents in some ways have the harder job, because they're defending the sitting record,\" said Sara Fagen, who worked on President George W. Bush's 2004 re-election campaign.\n\nVoters thought Democratic nominee John Kerry won the first debate against Bush by about 2-to-1, according to a Pew Research Center poll.\n\nIn a poll question asking voters to use one word to describe the candidates' performances, the top negative word for Bush was \"defensive.\"\n\n\"For most incumbents, you want to make the election about a choice, not a referendum,\" Fagen said.\n\nPresident Barack Obama faced a similar reckoning during his 2012 debate preparation.\n\n\"If it's a referendum on the incumbent, the incumbent usually loses,\" Obama 2012 campaign manager Jim Messina said he told Obama. \"If it is a choice between the two candidates, you'll win.\"\n\nMessina said he instructed Obama \"don't chase rabbits,\" meaning do not go down a hole in self-defense. He said Obama was on the defensive during several questions of his first 2012 debate against Republican nominee Mitt Romney.\n\nAbout two-thirds of voters thought Romney outperformed Obama in the first debate, according to CNN and Pew polls.\n\nDespite Obama's preparation, he \"was rusty,\" Schroeder said. \"He just seemed a little uncomfortable with the whole exercise.\"\n\nAfter the first debate, Messina said, Obama was \"much more focused.\"\n\n\"The president blew off one of the last debate sessions before the first debate,\" Messina said. \"He definitely did not do that after the first debate.\"\n\nMessina recalled seeing a video of himself in the spin room after the second debate with a \"glow about me.\"\n\n\"I look like a 10-year-old boy who just got free beer for the first time because I was so happy, because he had just driven the choice narrative over and over and over,\" Messina said.\n\nThe Biden campaign also appears to be digging into the choice narrative, previewing Biden's debate preparation by noting that he \"has gotten increasingly punchier in recent remarks about Trump and plans to carry that theme through to the debate, while still projecting himself as the wise and steady leader in contrast to Trump's chaos and division.\"\n\nJust a week before the first debate, the Biden campaign announced a $50 million advertising campaign, part of which is going to TV spots that strike a contrast between Biden's and Trump's characters.\n\nThe debate next month holds a unique place in history not only for its unprecedented early date. It will be the first time two candidates who have held the Oval Office will face off. And it's unclear how much debates alone alter voting preferences come November.\n\n\"Ultimately, it's been very difficult for anybody to demonstrate that performances in presidential debates have changed voters' preferences,\" said Lynn Vavreck, a professor of American politics and public policy at UCLA.\n\nFagen said voters ahead of November are \"so already entrenched.\" She said this debate \"probably matters more than more recent elections, just because of the dynamics of the race,\" pointing to each candidate's challenges and the fact that both have held the presidency.\n\nBiden and Trump are neck and neck, according to polling. There is also a large and ideologically diverse swath of voters who dislike both candidates -- but may yet choose one of them in the fall.\n\nThe closeness of the race means a debate does not need to shift a large part of the electorate to have a notable impact.\n\n\"When you get into situations where you're talking about that few votes being pivotal, anything could be pivotal,\" Vavreck said.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Carter", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Carter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_debates", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States presidential debates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_debates", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential debates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_(government_title)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President (government title)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Miller_(communications_strategist)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jason Miller (communications strategist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Messina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Messina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Dole", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bob Dole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pew_Research_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pew Research Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George W.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who ran as an independent, was unable to meet the requirements.\n\nWhile this is a preamble to a likely rematch between President Biden and former President Trump, who are the presumptive nominees of their respective parties, there are several differences with this early presidential debate.\n\nFor one, the June 27 matchup will have no studio audience, unlike previous debates hosted by universities.\n\nCandidates also agreed to microphone muting throughout the 90-minute debate. Whenever a candidate is speaking, the other candidate's microphone will remain muted.\n\nAccording to the rules, moderators will also have the power to \"use all tools at their disposal to enforce timing and ensure civilized discussion,\" as previous debates between the two presidents were mired with name-calling and frequent interruptions.\n\nThere will be no props or pre-written notes allowed, but candidates will have a pad of paper, a pen, and a bottle of water at their disposal.\n\nBoth President Biden and former President Trump agreed to the rules in May, and the second debate will be hosted by ABC on Sept. 10.\n\nA Quinnipiac poll released after the debates were announced found that 72 percent of Americans said they would likely watch the rematch between the two candidates. Twenty-seven percent, however, said they likely would not tune into the early debate.\n\nGreen Party presidential candidate Jill Stein, who previously ran for president in the 2016 election, said that she had filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission, alleging she has been unfairly excluded from CNN's debate and suggested voters should hear from all candidates.\n\n\"We think that the American people are really hungry for a real debate, not just the two zombie candidates that are being rammed down our throats again,\" Ms. Stein said in a June 19 interview with Scripps News.\n\n\"We know that the American people are really hungry for real debate and discussion, and I think they are owed that, and we need to have that.\"\n\nIn national polls averages on RealClearPolitics, Ms. Stein has only earned roughly one percent of support.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Electoral College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Kennedy_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert F.

Meanwhile, Biden has opted to hunker down in the days leading up to what is expected to be a historic clash by prepping with his advisors at Camp David.\n\nKEY DEM SENATE CANDIDATE WHO ACCUSED OPPONENT OF ELECTION DENIALISM HAS HISTORY OF QUESTIONING RESULTS\n\nTrump has been gathering with Republican allies for private meetings in recent weeks as he looks ahead to the debate, including a handful of those in contention to be his vice presidential running mate, senators and other policy experts, sources tell Fox News Digital. His campaign has characterized the meetings as \"policy discussions.\"\n\nOne of the vice presidential nominee contenders, Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio, huddled with Trump and members of his staff earlier this month at the former president's Mar-a-Lago club and residence in Palm Beach, Florida. Sources familiar with the meeting confirmed the encounter and that the session centered around debate messaging on the economy and how to target Biden over inflation.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTrump also took part in another policy discussion last week during his one-day trip to the nation's capital, where he met behind closed doors with Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, another potential running mate, as well as first-term Sen. Eric Schmitt of Missouri.\n\nTrump co-campaign managers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, veterans in the political world, also sat in on the session, which included discussions on how to deal with likely debate questions on the Jan. 6, 2021 protests at the U.S. Capitol by supporters of the former president aiming to disrupt congressional certification of Biden's 2020 election victory.\n\nBIDEN MAKES MAJOR GAINS WITH CRUCIAL VOTING GROUP AHEAD OF 1ST DEBATE WITH TRUMP: POLL\n\nTrump has also held policy discussions with senior advisers Kellyanne Conway and Stephen Miller, and with former acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell.

The event was largely characterized by a flurry of interruptions, particularly from then-President Donald Trump.\n\nMore: When is the first 2024 presidential debate between Trump and Biden? Date, time, moderators, how to watch\n\nCNN said both candidates agreed to accept the network's list of rules for the debate, as outlined in letters sent to the Biden and Trump campaigns in May. These rules included a muted microphone, which will only be unmuted when it is a respective candidate's turn to speak.\n\nIt's a stark contrast from the Trump campaign's outcry over the muted mic rule in 2020. In a letter to the bipartisan CPD at the time of the format change, former Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien strongly objected to the new rule. He called it \"completely unacceptable for anyone to wield such power,\" and said it would give \"further editorial control of the debate over to the Commission, which has already demonstrated its partiality to Biden.\"\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nThis time around, both campaigns have accepted the parameters with little fanfare. The second and final debate in 2020, when muted mics were used, was notably more tame than the first.\n\nThe moderators, CNN's Dana Bash and Jake Tapper, \"will use all tools at their disposal to enforce timing and ensure a civilized discussion,\" according to the network.\n\nContributing: Joey Garrison, USA Today", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_debates", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States presidential debates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commission_on_Presidential_Debates", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Commission on Presidential Debates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Stepien", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bill Stepien"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_Bash", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dana Bash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Tapper", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jake Tapper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Communication", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Communication", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Genres", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Double_Disc_Court", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Double Disc Court", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Kites/Rules", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Kites/Rules", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/06/20/USAT/74158783007-20161020-t-120000-z-85172762-ht-1-ecak-04-a-5-dg-rtrmadp-3-usaelectiondebate.JPG?auto=webp&crop=3499,1969,x0,y167&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666748", "eventUri": "eng-9666748", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 69, "textEnd": 76}, {"amb": false, "date": "-09-29", "textStart": 548, "textEnd": 556}], "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

His campaign has characterized the meetings as \"policy discussions.\"\n\nOne of the vice presidential nominee contenders, Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio, huddled with Trump and members of his staff earlier this month at the former president's Mar-a-Lago club and residence in Palm Beach, Florida. Sources familiar with the meeting confirmed the encounter and that the session centered around debate messaging on the economy and how to target Biden over inflation.\n\nTrump also took part in another policy discussion last week during his one-day trip to the nation's capital, where he met behind closed doors with Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, another potential running mate, as well as first-term Sen. Eric Schmitt of Missouri.\n\nTrump co-campaign managers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, veterans in the political world, also sat in on the session, which included discussions on how to deal with likely debate questions on the Jan. 6, 2021 protests at the U.S. Capitol by supporters of the former president aiming to disrupt congressional certification of Biden's 2020 election victory.\n\nBIDEN MAKES MAJOR GAINS WITH CRUCIAL VOTING GROUP AHEAD OF 1ST DEBATE WITH TRUMP: POLL\n\nTrump has also held policy discussions with senior advisers Kellyanne Conway and Stephen Miller, and with former acting Director of National Intelligence Richard Grenell.

Some pundits predict Donald Trump will pull out, but I don't see it as such a move would be a tremendous loss of face, and he would gain nothing.\n\nBiden, on the other hand... Can he make it through 90 minutes without cue cards, teleprompters, and Jill's handholding? He's exceeded expectations before -- by exceeding expectations, I mean he didn't collapse and fall flat on his face during his spiteful State of the Union address. If he even makes it to the debate finish line, our fawning national media will claim it was one of the great debate performances in history -- regardless of what he actually says.\n\nBut how are the two candidates preparing for the big night? Not surprisingly, Biden is once again aiming to live out his Witness Protection fantasy and will largely disappear for a full week to get ready for 90 minutes in front of the cameras (and his nemesis, Trump).\n\nDon't expect to see a lot of mumbling appearances in the near future from the president:\n\nTo get ready, Biden is gathering trusted aides this week and next at Camp David, the mountainside presidential retreat, for several days of intensive discussion and preparation. The secluded complex of rustic lodges in Maryland has, in the past, helped focus Biden and his team ahead of important moments such as State of the Union speeches.\n\nThe preparations are expected to progress over a series of days, evolving from informal discussions about topics, questions and potential responses and culminating in more formal 90-minute mock debates. The president will likely be fueled by his favorite drink of orange Gatorade. (CNN debate rules stipulate that each candidate will have a pen, writing pad and a bottle of water at the podium.)\n\nThe White House is preserving the possibility that the president and his team could travel to Atlanta directly from Camp David, depending on how much practice remains.\n\nThe man is completely incompetent, no matter how many advisors he meets with.\n\nRelated:\n\nHere's the Behind the Scenes Dish on How Biden Might Get Out of Debates\n\nDangerous Debates: Trump Needs to Be Quite Careful\n\nTrump, meanwhile, is known for taking a different path regarding debates, not prepping as much as some political opponents and relying more on his quick thinking on his feet. But he notes he faces more than just Joe Biden up on the stage -- there will be biased CNN anchors Jake Tapper and Dana Bash as well:\n\n\"I'll probably be negotiating with three people, but that's OK. I've done that before,\" Trump told his supporters Tuesday at a rally in Racine, Wisconsin, referring to Biden and CNN's moderators. \"I'll be debating three people instead of one, instead of one half of a person.\"\n\nThe former president hasn't been idle, however, and has been meeting with aides:\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has deployed the help of some of his top contenders for vice president, as well as senators, policy experts and outside allies, to help brief him ahead of next week's debate. In recent weeks, Trump has participated in roughly a dozen of these private meetings, dubbed as informal \"policy discussions\" by his campaign, sources familiar with the sessions told CNN.\n\nThe subjects of the meetings have ranged from sharpening his messaging on the economy, the border and crime, to his views on abortion, the wars in the Middle East and Ukraine and how to best frame his May 30 conviction on 34 counts of business fraud, the sources said.\n\nI still don't know if I believe this debate will actually take place, but if it does, it could be a historic moment that could very well decide the future of this country.", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bob_hoge@redstate.com", "name": "Bob Hoge", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_the_Union", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "State of the Union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_David", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Camp David"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pundit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pundit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatorade", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gatorade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Maryland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_Bash", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dana Bash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Tapper", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jake Tapper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racine,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racine, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Racine, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Communication", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Communication", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Future", "label": "dmoz/Society/Future", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2020/274/35119c14-52d5-4cef-90ee-2179b233fcc3.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666748", "eventUri": "eng-9666748", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 147, "textEnd": 154}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-30", "textStart": 3616, "textEnd": 3622}], "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

If you've got a functioning brain stem, you're going to be watching.\"\n\nJones said the debate will likely be a deciding factor for the \"narrow\" margin of voters still undecided between the presumptive nominees for the two major parties.\n\nThe political advisor noted that Biden does not have preferred \"momentum\" going into the debate, but he predicted a \"strong\" performance on policy-based discussions. However, if the president flubbed or botched his debate performance, he added, then it would be \"game over.\"\n\n\"If Biden goes out there and messes up, it's game over.

JD Vance, R-Ohio, a senior adviser said, and on immigration with former White House aide Stephen Miller and Tom Homan, the former acting head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. He also held discussions with Sens. Eric Schmitt, R-Mo., and Marco Rubio, R-Fla., when he was in Washington last week, the source said, and on national security issues with Ric Grenell, his former acting director of national intelligence.\n\nNorth Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, a one-time GOP presidential contender turned Trump ally, acknowledged that he's been in contact with the former president's team regarding debate prep.\n\n\"But you know, there's never been a better, there's never been a better politician, a better debater, a better communicator,\" Burgum said at an event in his state on Thursday.\n\nThe Trump campaign has long insisted that his various media interviews and hours-long rallies serve as preparation for a debate -- though many recent interviews have been with friendly conservative media outlets.\n\nSenior Trump adviser Brian Hughes said Trump plans to push Biden on his handling of immigration and the economy -- issues the Trump team has maintained are notable weaknesses for the president.\n\nWith \"the damage [Biden] has done through inflation, open borders and weak foreign policy,\" Hughes said, \"Biden needs rehearsals with handlers to find some way to explain this mess he's made of our nation.\"\n\nTrump will hold a rally on Saturday in Philadelphia and attend a fundraiser with Vance on Thursday night in Cleveland. And while several court hearings related to the federal case in South Florida regarding Trump's handling of classified documents are scheduled for the next several days, Trump's attendance at them is not currently expected.\n\nMeanwhile, Biden is scheduled to travel to Camp David on Thursday night and remain at the presidential retreat until at least Monday, much of which will be dedicated to debate prep, according to senior campaign and administration officials.\n\nTop campaign staff and White House advisers will be joining the president during his time at the Maryland mountainside compound for the prep sessions, the officials said, which will become more \"intensive\" as June 27, the night of the debate, approaches. There will likely be full-length \"mocks\" in the final stretch, these officials said. Former White House chief of staff Ron Klain is \"leading\" the prep, according to a Biden campaign official.\n\nOther members of the rotating cast include campaign aides Jennifer O'Malley Dillon, co-chair Cedric Richmond and senior adviser Mike Donilon. Biden will also be joined by White House officials, including chief of staff Jeff Zients, senior adviser Bruce Reed, senior adviser Anita Dunn and senior adviser Steve Ricchetti. These aides may not all be at Camp David for the entire duration of Biden's stay but are all expected to be heavily involved throughout the process.\n\nBiden campaign officials said that the president is \"prepping to hold Trump accountable for his extreme record and the dangerous things he's been saying on the trail.\" Those topics include Trump \"ripping\" away reproductive rights, \"promoting political violence and undermining our democratic institutions,\" and \"doing the bidding of his billionaire donors\" by funding tax breaks to the ultra-wealthy that also hurt senior citizens and middle-class Americans.\n\nA former Biden aide familiar with the campaign's thinking said the debate preparations were \"like cramming for a final,\" adding that the president prefers to talk things through, looks at briefing materials and writes on cards how he might want to say specific things.\n\nThis former aide said that the biggest challenges for Biden would be distilling information into bite-sized answers and navigating the potential trap of defending his record while also needing to look forward. Another challenge, this person said, is how the president will deal with fact-checking Trump.\n\nThe goal for Biden aides during prep sessions, this person explained, was wanting the president to show two contrasting visions for the country -- especially for people who haven't tuned into the race until debate night.\n\nThis person also said that Biden will likely be prepared to respond to attacks by Trump with muscular retorts, including possible references to the Republican being a convicted felon.\n\nThe former aide added that another challenge for Biden will be if Trump remains disciplined for the entire 90-minute event. Trump staying mostly on message, this person said, could make everything the Biden team has been saying about the former president seem like exaggeration or pure politics.\n\nBiden campaign officials said that the president will have \"less time\" for debate prep than he did in 2020, given his \"day job.\" That, they said, is why the prep has been largely confined to just the coming days. Biden spent much of the first half of June in Europe, with trips to France and Italy.\n\nBiden has gotten \"increasingly punchier\" in recent remarks about Trump, officials explained, and plans to \"carry that theme through to the debate,\" they said, \"while still projecting himself as the wise and steady leader in contrast to Trump's chaos and division.\"\n\nBiden is expected to remain at Camp David through the weekend but it's possible he could stay there longer. The White House left open the possibility that the president could do a quick day trip or two while there, if necessary. It's also possible Biden may go straight to Atlanta from Camp David if aides decide he needs to keep prepping there until the day of the debate.\n\nAs far as the debate itself, CNN, which is hosting the June 27 face-off, announced Thursday that Trump will get the final word, after a coin flip determined podium placement and the order of closing statements.\n\nThe Biden campaign, which won the coin toss, chose to select the right podium position.\n\nBiden aides have planned to set up a robust rapid response operation on the night of the debate, according to two sources familiar with the discussions. This will be a joint White House and campaign effort and there will also be a presence from top surrogates on the ground in Atlanta, these people said.\n\nOn Trump's end, allies and several vice presidential hopefuls will join the former president in Atlanta on Thursday, according to an invitation to a campaign watch party event obtained by NBC News.\n\nAmong those listed as attending are former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Vance, as well as Reps. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., Byron Donalds, R-Fla., and Wesley Hunt, R-Texas.\n\nThe invitation also teases \"potential post-debate remarks\" from Trump himself.", "source": {"uri": "nbcnews.com",

The event was largely characterized by a flurry of interruptions, particularly from then-President Donald Trump.\n\nMore: When is the first 2024 presidential debate between Trump and Biden? Date, time, moderators, how to watch\n\nCNN said both candidates agreed to accept the network's list of rules for the debate, as outlined in letters sent to the Biden and Trump campaigns in May. These rules included a muted microphone, which will only be unmuted when it is a respective candidate's turn to speak.\n\nIt's a stark contrast from the Trump campaign's outcry over the muted mic rule in 2020. In a letter to the bipartisan CPD at the time of the format change, former Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien strongly objected to the new rule. He called it \"completely unacceptable for anyone to wield such power,\" and said it would give \"further editorial control of the debate over to the Commission, which has already demonstrated its partiality to Biden.\"\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nThis time around, both campaigns have accepted the parameters with little fanfare. The second and final debate in 2020, when muted mics were used, was notably more tame than the first.\n\nThe moderators, CNN's Dana Bash and Jake Tapper, \"will use all tools at their disposal to enforce timing and ensure a civilized discussion,\" according to the network.\n\nContributing: Joey Garrison, USA Today\n\nKathryn Palmer is an elections fellow for USA TODAY.

But will there be anything else historic about it?\n\nWhen Joe Biden and Donald Trump square off on June 27, it will be the first time in history that a sitting president and a former one participate in a debate. But will there be anything else historic about it?\n\nTrump is wrestling with trying simultaneously to lower and raise expectations for Biden. On the one hand, he enjoys depicting him as a doddering old man who can barely pull his socks on in the morning; on the other, he worries that a forceful Biden will show up at the debate, slinging zingers. So he suggests that the president will be \"pumped up\" on a heady cocktail of drugs that may well include cocaine left behind by Hunter. Trump is also suggesting that the debate moderators, Jake Tapper and Dana Bash, will be out to get him. \"I'll be debating three people,\" he said, \"instead of one, instead of one half of a person.\"\n\nFor all his bluster about Biden's debilities, Trump does appear to be taking the up coming debate seriously, or at least with as much seriousness as he is able to muster for any consequential event other a WWE competition. He's apparently meeting, among other things, with his potential vice-presidential running mates to discuss strategy for the debate on topics ranging from Ukraine to tax policy. It's his advisers who appear to be filling in many of the blanks, including Robert C. O'Brien, his former national security adviser, who has issued a sweeping call for an assertive approach to foreign policy in Forign Affairs calling The Return of Peace Through Strength for a return to Reagan-era doctrines.\n\nAny preparation that Trump is conducting, though, is likely to prove superfluous. His specialty is the cheap shot -- the venomous insinuation, the sneering mockery, the splenetic outburst. Trump is a performer and he knows, more than anyone else, that the show must go on. His task will be to reprise his role on \"The Apprentice\" by dismissing Biden.\n\nBiden, in turn, will seek to recapitulate his great evening during the State of the Union when he toyed with his Republican detractors, professing mock astonishment at their responses to him. A wary Trump already senses that Biden will seek to go in for the kill. To corner him, Biden will need to point not simply to a lower inflation rate but to pummeling Trump on his record as a convicted criminal.\n\nWhat neither candidate will want to address is the soaring national debt as they offer gauzy promises for the future. A new report from the Congressional Budget Office indicates that it will exceed 50 trillion dollars by 2034. Even as America expands it financial and military commitments, it has no coherent, let alone cogent, plan for addressing its mounting federal debt.\n\nBut such minutiae isn't what will turn this debate into a summer blockbuster. Trump, like Will Smith in the movie hit \"Bad Boys,\" is intent on demonstrating that he's on the comeback trail.

Kennedy against Republican Vice President Richard Nixon, who was recovering from a hospital visit and had a 5 o'clock shadow, having refused makeup.\n\nDemocratic President Joe Biden and Republican former President Donald Trump plan to face off in a presidential debate on June 27 and another Sept. 10 ahead of a Nov. 5 election, part of a tradition marked by some of the most memorable moments of modern US political history:\n\n* 1960: The first televised debate pitted Democratic nominee John F. Kennedy against Republican Vice President Richard Nixon, who was recovering from a hospital visit and had a 5 o'clock shadow, having refused makeup. The 70 million viewers focused on what they saw, not what they heard. Kennedy won the election.\n\n* 1976: In the first TV debate in 16 years, Democrat Jimmy Carter faced unelected incumbent Republican President Gerald Ford. In remarks seen as a major blunder, Ford said: \"There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe, and there never will be under a Ford administration.\" Carter won the election.\n\n* 1980: Carter appeared in a second debate with Republican Ronald Reagan after boycotting the first for including third-party candidate John Anderson. The president accused Reagan of planning to cut Medicare healthcare funding for Americans 65 and older. Reagan, who already had complained that Carter was misrepresenting his stands on a number of issues, said: \"There you go again\" and chuckled, drawing audience laughter and coining a catchphrase. Reagan won the election.\n\nKnow more | Key dates in the US presidential race\n\n* 1984: Reagan, 73, successfully defused the issue of his age when he debated Democrat Walter Mondale, 56, quipping: \"I want you to know that also I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience.\" Reagan was re-elected.\n\n* 1988: A debate against Republican Vice President George H. W. Bush opened with Democrat Michael Dukakis being asked whether he would favor the death penalty for someone who raped and murdered his wife. The question offered a candidate dubbed \"the iceman\" by critics a chance to show his emotional side. His laborious response did just the opposite. Bush won the election.\n\nThe vice presidential debate came alive when Dan Quayle, Bush's running mate, compared himself politically to John F. Kennedy. Democrat Lloyd Bentsen replied in quiet, deadly tones: \"Senator, I served with Jack Kennedy. I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy.\"\n\n* 1992: Three candidates - Bush, Democrat Bill Clinton and independent Ross Perot - shared a stage. Clinton won the election.\n\n* 1996: In a debate with Clinton, Republican Bob Dole was asked by a student whether at 73 he was too old to understand the needs of young people. He replied that at his age, intelligence and experience meant he had the advantage of wisdom. Clinton retorted: \"I can only tell you that I don't think Senator Dole is too old to be president. It's the age of his ideas that I question.\" Clinton was re-elected.\n\n* 2000: In his first debate with Republican George W. Bush, Democratic Vice President Al Gore drew negative reviews for sighing loudly while Bush spoke. \"We all make mistakes. I've been known to mangle a syllable or two myself,\" Bush said during their second debate, purposely mispronouncing \"syllable.\" Bush won the election.\n\n* 2004: The last debate between Bush and Democrat John Kerry offered voters a stark contrast in styles, with Bush sticking to simple arguments while Kerry released an array of facts to make his case. Bush was re-elected.\n\nAlso Read | RFK Jr faces midnight deadline to qualify for CNN presidential debate\n\n* 2008: Sarah Palin, Republican John McCain's running mate, and Joe Biden, running with Democrat Barack Obama, clashed on the economy and Iraq during a lively but polite vice presidential debate. Palin frequently displayed a folksy style. At one point, she said: \"Aw, say it ain't so, Joe,\" adding a \"doggone it\" for good measure. Biden and Palin both vowed to make US economic policy friendlier for middle-class workers, but Biden said McCain had called the fundamentals of the economy strong as the financial crisis broke out. The Obama-Biden ticket won the election.\n\n* 2012: Obama stumbled in his first debate with Republican Mitt Romney, surprising and worrying his supporters. But in their second debate Romney, responding to a question about gender pay equality, said he had \"binders full of women\" as candidates for cabinet posts. The phrase became a meme on social media, with tweets, original artwork and a Facebook group spoofing Romney. Obama won again.\n\n* 2016: The first debate between businessman Donald Trump and Democratic former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton drew 84 million US television viewers, a record for a debate and a rare number in an age of digital streaming. An exchange of insults dominated their second debate, with Clinton jabbing at Trump for sexually aggressive remarks about women he made on a just-uncovered 2005 videotape. Trump sought to deflect criticism by accusing Bill Clinton, the candidate's husband, of having done worse to women. In her book published in 2017, Clinton wrote that in their second debate Trump made her skin crawl by stalking her around the stage and she wondered if she should have told him to \"back up, you creep.\" Instead she said, \"I kept my cool, aided by a lifetime of dealing with difficult men trying to throw me off.\" In the third debate Trump called Clinton \"such a nasty woman\" and declined to say he would accept the election results. Trump won the election.\n\n* 2020: Down in the opinion polls, then-President Trump came into his first debate with Biden, the former vice president, looking for a fight. But his belligerence worked against him. He repeatedly interrupted Biden and the moderator, Chris Wallace, to the point where the entire event veered out of control. He attacked Biden's family. Polls and focus groups conducted afterward showed swing voters were repulsed by his behavior. At one point when Trump was interrupting him, Biden said: \"Will you shut up, man? This is so unpresidential.\" Wallace told Trump: \"I think the country would be better served if we allowed both people to speak with fewer interruptions. I'm appealing to you, sir, to do that.\" Trump, referring to Biden, responded: \"And him, too.\"\n\nWallace: \"Well, frankly you've been doing more interrupting.\" Trump would later drop out of the second debate after it was switched to a virtual format in the wake of his COVID-19 diagnosis. He then adopted a more restrained tone for the final face-off with Biden.\n\nAt the vice presidential debate that year, a stray housefly briefly commanded the US national stage, generating buzz when it perched on Vice President Mike Pence's cropped white hair while he debated his Democratic rival, then-US Senator Kamala Harris.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@indianexpress.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Ford", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gerald Ford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Richard Nixon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

I say allegedly, because after the last couple of weeks the President has had, I will be stunned if he actually shows up on stage.\n\nOriginally floated by Biden as an offer his campaign believed Trump would never accept, the former President did accept on Hugh Hewitt's show - anytime, any place. Now that it's locked in for the 27th with Jake Tapper and Dana Bash co-moderating, both sides are officially into debate prep mode. For Trump, that means refining his approach so that he doesn't come across as antagonistic and off-putting as he was in the first debate of the 2020 cycle. For Biden, it means pharmaceutical research to come up with the elixir that will maintain its potency for an entire 90-minute debate without wearing off. Why would such a potion need to be brewed? Let's review Biden's most recent fortnight. At the G7:\n\nFrom the fundraiser in Los Angeles:\n\nFrom the amnesty speech at the White House Tuesday:\n\nAnd from the trip to Delaware after the Bill and Hillary Clinton fundraiser Wednesday night, notice how carefully Dr. Jill Dr. Biden, Ed.D is leading him from the White House to Marine 1 after a long day. Joe had to downshift from his shuffling gear to an amble resembling a post-surgery hospital lap around the floor, complete with a delta formation of handlers covering every possible open space to catch Biden if he stumbled.\n\nOnce they flew to Andrews Air Force Base, the transfer to the motorcade SUV got even rougher.\n\nLook, if the President of the United States, the leader of the free world, is having trouble negotiating the entry into a Chevrolet Suburban, it's hard to blame him for not quite having a handle on 15 million illegal immigrants flooding the country, two hot wars that began due to his foreign policy, rampant inflation, and skyrocketing crime in inner cities. Hell, even one of the President's Secret Service detail got mugged at gunpoint during the Los Angeles stop. In short, the American dream train has left the station for a large chunk of the country on this administration's watch. But forget all that. Biden's got real problems - climbing into a car. It's no wonder CNN is demanding the debate next Thursday be a sit-down affair.\n\nI'm doubtful the debate will happen, and Joe Biden has the perfect out. It's a lame excuse, and they'll get killed over it, but I can easily see the Biden campaign, if not Biden himself, saying it's beneath the dignity of the office of the president to share the stage with a convicted felon, so the debate is off. Whatever downside to them pulling the rip cord is not nearly as bad as demonstrating that he's just not up to this job anymore.\n\nWhile most of my Debate Watch bandwidth has been dedicated to this upcoming contest in Atlanta, something happened in Toronto Monday night at Roy Thomson Hall which I didn't have on my radar at all. The Munk Debates convened in a two-on-two format to discuss the proposition that anti-Zionism is antisemitism. Now let me say at the outset here that the fact that we are in the year of our Lord 2024 and we have to have a debate on this subject is equal parts dismaying and depressing. Of course, anti-Zionism is antisemitic. There are only two sets of people that have any doubt as to that question - people who are uneducated on the history of the state of Israel, and antisemites.\n\nTaking up the pro side of the proposition are two very capable people - British author and journalist Douglas Murray, and director of UK Lawyers For Israel, Natasha Hausdorff. How capable are these two? I'll share with you the highlights in just a bit, but suffice it to say that if you ever find yourself in a situation where you are on the other side of these two in a debate format, you'd better take a long, hard look at the position you're taking, because there's a good chance you're on the wrong side, and it will be indefensible. I don't agree with Murray on everything, but on this conflict, his vision is better than 20/20.\n\nSticking up for the anti-Zionists were two people very hostile to the state of Israel - MSNBC veteran and Hamas supporter Mehdi Hasan, and Haaretz journalist Gideon Levy, a left-wing Jew who developed his anti-Zionist views covering conflicts with Palestinians for the left-wing paper. Going into the debate, the audience was pre-polled on the question. In a 61-30% split, the audience was predisposed to believe that being anti-Zionist was being antisemitic. Here is the opening remarks by Murray, who gave a master class at how to do this. (Warning, there is a quotation by Murray that is cited in order to bolster his argument that contains two usages of the F-word.)\n\nTo give you a sense for how completely dominant Murray was during this debate, here is a highlight reel of his best moments.\n\nYes, it pretty much went on like this all night. There was one particular exchange where Hasan and Levy tried to make a point, and Murray responded with such a rhetorical thumping that the audience knew the debate had all but ended at that point.\n\nMurray, of course, has developed quite a profile of notoriety through viral clips in venues like this, as well as television interview appearances, oftentimes with hostile interlocutors. His partner, Natasha Hausdorff, was no slouch in this debate. She'll get overshadowed over the course of time in online discussions about this debate, but she was exceptional in her own right. At one point, Mehdi Hasan tried to excerpt just a few words from former UK Prime Minister Lord Arthur Balfour as a quote, totally out of context, branding him as a \"card-carrying antisemite.\" Hausdorff came back at him in response with the receipts, including the entire quote, not the cherrypicked one by Hasan.\n\nIf you get caught playing fast and loose with a citation in order to try to make your point, your credibility is gone with the debate audience, and you might as well beat the traffic home and walk off the stage. But being antisemitic is so fulfilling, I guess, that Hasan doesn't seem to mind getting his rear end kicked all over Canada. Hausdorff got the job of mopping up at the end. Here's her closing statement.\n\nThe audience responded very favorably to the case made by Murray and Hausdorff, with the post-debate poll showing a margin of 66-34. The spread went from 22 to 32 points, a five-point swing. It's encouraging that much movement can be made once people hear the argument presented with clarity.\n\nA lot of pundits are beginning to hedge their bets, predicting that Biden will probably beat expectations at the debate, of course presuming the debate actually happens, and the President will perform better than his recent two weeks would indicate. But can anyone honestly believe that they're going to get anything approaching clarity on Israel from Joe Biden? And for that matter, clarity on anything without a teleprompter with which to read?\n\nThe debate I want to see isn't Trump vs. Biden. What I want to see is Douglas Murray versus Joe Biden.

Kennedy against Republican Vice President Richard Nixon, who was recovering from a hospital visit and had a 5 o'clock shadow, having refused makeup. The 70 million viewers focused on what they saw, not what they heard. Kennedy won the election.\n\n- 1976: In the first TV debate in 16 years, Democrat Jimmy Carter faced unelected incumbent Republican President Gerald Ford. In remarks seen as a major blunder, Ford said: \"There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe, and there never will be under a Ford administration.\" Carter won the election.\n\n- 1980: Carter appeared in a second debate with Republican Ronald Reagan after boycotting the first for including third-party candidate John Anderson. The president accused Reagan of planning to cut Medicare healthcare funding for Americans 65 and older. Reagan, who already had complained that Carter was misrepresenting his stands on a number of issues, said: \"There you go again\" and chuckled, drawing audience laughter and coining a catchphrase. Reagan won the election.\n\n- 1984: Reagan, 73, successfully defused the issue of his age when he debated Democrat Walter Mondale, 56, quipping: \"I want you to know that also I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience.\" Reagan was re-elected.\n\n- 1988: A debate against Republican Vice President George H. W. Bush opened with Democrat Michael Dukakis being asked whether he would favor the death penalty for someone who raped and murdered his wife. The question offered a candidate dubbed \"the iceman\" by critics a chance to show his emotional side. His laborious response did just the opposite. Bush won the election.\n\nThe vice presidential debate came alive when Dan Quayle, Bush's running mate, compared himself politically to John F. Kennedy. Democrat Lloyd Bentsen replied in quiet, deadly tones: \"Senator, I served with Jack Kennedy. I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy.\"\n\n- 1992: Three candidates - Bush, Democrat Bill Clinton and independent Ross Perot - shared a stage. Clinton won the election.\n\n- 1996: In a debate with Clinton, Republican Bob Dole was asked by a student whether at 73 he was too old to understand the needs of young people. He replied that at his age, intelligence and experience meant he had the advantage of wisdom. Clinton retorted: \"I can only tell you that I don't think Senator Dole is too old to be president. It's the age of his ideas that I question.\" Clinton was re-elected.\n\n- 2000: In his first debate with Republican George W. Bush, Democratic Vice President Al Gore drew negative reviews for sighing loudly while Bush spoke. \"We all make mistakes. I've been known to mangle a syllable or two myself,\" Bush said during their second debate, purposely mispronouncing \"syllable.\" Bush won the election.\n\n- 2004: The last debate between Bush and Democrat John Kerry offered voters a stark contrast in styles, with Bush sticking to simple arguments while Kerry released an array of facts to make his case. Bush was re-elected.\n\n- 2008: Sarah Palin, Republican John McCain's running mate, and Joe Biden, running with Democrat Barack Obama, clashed on the economy and Iraq during a lively but polite vice presidential debate. Palin frequently displayed a folksy style. At one point, she said: \"Aw, say it ain't so, Joe,\" adding a \"doggone it\" for good measure. Biden and Palin both vowed to make U.S. economic policy friendlier for middle-class workers, but Biden said McCain had called the fundamentals of the economy strong as the financial crisis broke out. The Obama-Biden ticket won the election.\n\n- 2012: Obama stumbled in his first debate with Republican Mitt Romney, surprising and worrying his supporters. But in their second debate Romney, responding to a question about gender pay equality, said he had \"binders full of women\" as candidates for cabinet posts. The phrase became a meme on social media, with tweets, original artwork and a Facebook group spoofing Romney. Obama won again.\n\n- 2016: The first debate between businessman Donald Trump and Democratic former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton drew 84 million U.S. television viewers, a record for a debate and a rare number in an age of digital streaming. An exchange of insults dominated their second debate, with Clinton jabbing at Trump for sexually aggressive remarks about women he made on a just-uncovered 2005 videotape. Trump sought to deflect criticism by accusing Bill Clinton, the candidate's husband, of having done worse to women. In her book published in 2017, Clinton wrote that in their second debate Trump made her skin crawl by stalking her around the stage and she wondered if she should have told him to \"back up, you creep.\" Instead she said, \"I kept my cool, aided by a lifetime of dealing with difficult men trying to throw me off.\" In the third debate Trump called Clinton \"such a nasty woman\" and declined to say he would accept the election results. Trump won the election.\n\n- 2020: Down in the opinion polls, then-President Trump came into his first debate with Biden, the former vice president, looking for a fight. But his belligerence worked against him. He repeatedly interrupted Biden and the moderator, Chris Wallace, to the point where the entire event veered out of control. He attacked Biden's family. Polls and focus groups conducted afterward showed swing voters were repulsed by his behavior. At one point when Trump was interrupting him, Biden said: \"Will you shut up, man? This is so unpresidential.\" Wallace told Trump: \"I think the country would be better served if we allowed both people to speak with fewer interruptions. I'm appealing to you, sir, to do that.\" Trump, referring to Biden, responded: \"And him, too.\" Wallace: \"Well, frankly you've been doing more interrupting.\" Trump would later drop out of the second debate after it was switched to a virtual format in the wake of his COVID-19 diagnosis. He then adopted a more restrained tone for the final face-off with Biden.\n\nAt the vice presidential debate that year, a stray housefly briefly commanded the U.S. national stage, generating buzz when it perched on Vice President Mike Pence's cropped white hair while he debated his Democratic rival, then-U.S. Senator Kamala Harris.\n\nReporting by David Cutler, Reuters Archive; Additional reporting by James Oliphant and Andy Sullivan in Washington; Editing by Howard Goller", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@reuters.com", "name": "Reuters", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Ford", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gerald Ford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John F.

If Biden melts down or freezes up, Dems have time to replace him before they're set to nominate him in Chicago. I would have waited, but where there is a camera and a national audience, you will have a Trump.\n\nTrump should want to run against Biden, and more specifically his record, rather than against a player to be named later.\n\nHolding the debate this early might be a bad decision. A fresh candidate could beat Trump. Biden probably cannot.\n\nCNN, not known for its honesty and fairness (it famously gave Donna Brazile the debate questions for Hillary ahead of time), keeps changing the rules to favor Biden at the Atlanta debate.\n\nAll of Biden's requests, like CNN being able to mute the candidates (read: Trump), and no audience, have been granted. Both are unprecedented.\n\nAt least having no audience there will make Biden feel at home, just like at one of his campaign rallies.\n\nBiden probably had one request denied, namely that a team of Visiting Angels be in the wings to show him off stage.\n\nGiven that Biden became oddly lucid during his State of the Union address, Trump did have one poignant request: that both he and Biden be drug tested before the debate.\n\nI disagree, because if they make those two aged men tinkle in a bottle before the event, the debate would be delayed for an hour just to get measurable levels.\n\nOne could argue these two geezers should just argue in the balcony seats at The Muppet Theater instead.\n\nDana Bash and Jake Tapper will moderate with the mute button. If nothing else, their efforts will serve to remind us that kindergarten teachers are woefully underpaid.\n\nIt is funny how political bedfellows change. For the last presidential debate, Trump was famously prepared by Chris Christie. He is no longer on Trump's side. Back then, he was a good guy to have on your side, unless you were in a canoe.\n\nCNN will provide Trump an unfiltered national audience, but the reality is that most viewers have already made up their minds. This election will be decided by about 500,000 swing voters in six or seven swing states: Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, New Mexico, Nevada, Arizona and maybe Georgia. The debate, if it sways any votes, will focus on the issues that those voters care about.\n\nWhile Biden was having his Hollywood libs raise money for him in Los Angeles, Trump, with 34 felony convictions, a mug shot and more charges pending, was cutting into Biden's core support at a Black church in Detroit.\n\nBiden's rapidly falling poll numbers among African Americans have alarmed the Dems. That is no surprise.\n\nThe issues should be well defined. Trump wins on the issues that matter: the border, crime, inflation and wars of choice engulfing us. Not having an answer for any of that, Biden will run on abortion.\n\nAnd he will head-fake us with fashionable liberal worries like global warming, trans rights and whatever \"Trump is a threat to democracy\" means.\n\nThe much-bellowed \"threat to democracy,\" as best as I can understand it, is the lie the left propagates that Trump aspires to be some kind of Roman emperor. Too bad the name \"Orange Julius\" is already trademarked.\n\nReplacing Joe is tricky, since Kamala Harris is a disaster. Rumors were that Dem operatives contemplated replacing Joe with Hillary at the convention, but Kamala heard about it and said, \"Over my dead body\" -- which got Hillary thinking.\n\nContact Ron Hart,

Biden and Trump may have faced off against each other before -- remember Biden understandably losing his cool and telling Trump to \"Shut up, man\"? -- but it's anyone's guess how Trump's recent felony conviction will affect his appearance. Below, find everything you need to know about the upcoming Biden vs. Trump debate.\n\nThe first presidential debate of the 2024 election season will take place on Thursday, June 27 starting at 9 p.m. EST.\n\nThe debate will take place at CNN's Techwood campus in Atlanta, Georgia, and air live on CNN, CNN International, CNN en Espan\u0303ol, and CNN Max. Viewers can also stream it on CNN.com.\n\nCNN anchors Dana Bash and Jake Tapper will both moderate next Thursday's debate. While Tapper has overseen several debates in the past, including the final Democratic debate in 2020 between Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, Bash moderated two presidential primary debates during the 2020 election and six presidential primary debates during the 2016 election.\n\nIn a sign that wonders never cease, both Trump and Biden have agreed to forgo props and/or prewritten remarks, and have their microphones muted when it's not their turn to speak. The Biden campaign won the right-side podium position by way of a coin toss on Thursday, which gives Trump the final closing statement of the 90-minute debate. Additionally, in a marked departure from past years, the debate will not feature a studio audience.\n\nAbortion rights are almost sure to come up at the first presidential debate of 2024, especially given the effort that the Biden campaign has recently put into winning over women voters. Trump has reportedly been drilling responses with his team on issues including immigration and the state of the economy; while the Biden campaign has noted that the president is planning to hold Trump accountable for his history of outrageous comments on various topics relating to democracy and the rule of law. Each candidate's age and fitness to serve will also likely come up, as Biden and Trump have already slung verbal arrows at one another over that particular issue.\n\nThe second presidential debate of the 2024 election will be held on Tuesday, September 10.", "source": {"uri": "vogue.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "British Vogue"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conde_nast@vogue.com", "name": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_debates", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential debates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_Bash", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dana Bash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Tapper", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jake Tapper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN_en_Espa\u00f1ol", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN en Espa\u00f1ol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN_International", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN International"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bernie Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermont", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vermont"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vermont"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_debates", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential debates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Communication", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Communication", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice_and_Guides", "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice and Guides", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/66749bb27952e3733d07ff15/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-1229228819.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9666748", "eventUri": "eng-9666748", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 600, "textEnd": 607}, {"amb": false, "date": "-09-10", "textStart": 2366, "textEnd": 2378}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 456618368, "relevance": 2}

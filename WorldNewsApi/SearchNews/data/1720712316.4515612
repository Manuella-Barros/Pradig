Byron Donalds (R-FL) continued to defend his comments on the marriage rate during the Jim Crow era during a contentious conversation with MSNBC anchor Al Sharpton. Donalds appeared on MSNBC\u2019s PoliticsNation on Saturday after his event in Philadelphia earlier this week when he discussed how the black marriage rate was higher back then than it is now. His comments have come under fire by many on the Left, who have interpreted the remark to be about how Jim Crow laws benefitted black people at the time despite the fact that they kept them in segregation and prohibited them from voting. Sharpton offered Donalds another opportunity to respond to the backlash. \u201cMy response is that it\u2019s very interesting how people can just lie and mischaracterize what I said,\u201d Donalds said.\u201d I never said or insinuated anything about Jim Crow being better. Just was talking about the marriage rates of black families in America during that time period. It\u2019s an empirical fact.\u201d \u201cI mean to in any way infer that the families, black families were better in Jim Crow, I mean, I\u2019ve said things that I later said I shouldn\u2019t have said,\u201d Sharpton said. \u201cCan\u2019t you own that even sanitizing Jim Crow, even if that wasn\u2019t your intention, was to say that\u2019s my intention, I\u2019m sorry for using those words?\u201d \u201cWell, first of all, I never sanitized Jim Crow. I was just talking about the era in which black marriage rates were higher than they were during the great society and every other point in American history,\u201d Donalds responded. \u201cI mean, look, look, you and I have mutual friends. People say you\u2019re a straight shooter. We may disagree on politics. I\u2019m giving you the benefit of the doubt,\u201d Sharpton said. \u201cBut look, you were born in Brooklyn, you went down into the South, went to Florida state, you have an interracial marriage, you\u2019re the congressman of a district that\u2019s not a black district. I mean, how can you even live with yourself acting like Jim Crow was a good era or better era for blacks? What happened to you?\u201d Donalds continued to assert that he did not say that the Jim Crow era was better for black people or express any nostalgia for the era.

out.\n\nIndian customs allege Adani Group siphoned 15 billion rupees or AU$290 million into overseas tax havens, but the claims were denied by the company, The Guardian has reported.\n\nAdani is vying for a $900 million concessional loan from the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility to build a rail line for its Galilee Basin Carmichael mine to the Abbot Point coal terminal.\n\nAn Indian Directorate of Revenue Intelligence file from 2014 alleged a money trail from India to a company in Mauritius that was controlled by Vinod Shantilal Adani, the brother of Adani Group chief executive Gautam Adani.\n\nThe allegations included that the Adani Group ordered hundreds of millions of dollars worth of equipment for an electricity project in India using a front company and sold it back to businesses it controlled at a \"gross over-valuation\".\n\nIf true, it would have had the effect of moving the money to overseas bank accounts where it could not be taxed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome of the money allegedly moved out of India was taxpayer-funded in the form of loans from a publicly-owned bank.\n\nGetUp environmental campaign director Sam Regester said the revelations meant public money should not be given to Adani for its Carmichael mine.\n\n\"This is just way too much risk and it's a lose-lose proposition for Australian public money,\" he said.\u200b\n\nAn Adani Australia spokesman told Fairfax Media the allegations involved Adani's parent company and had nothing to do with the company in Australia.\n\nThe allegations were four years old, the spokesman said, and Adani Australia had nothing to add.\n\nAttempts were made to contact Adani in India.\n\nAdani Group told The Guardian that on behalf of itself, its subsidiaries and Vinod Adani that it strongly denied allegations of over-valuation.\n\nThe company said it was standard procedure for the group to follow international competitive bidding routes for major capital expenditure to ensure transparency and competitiveness.\n\nAll transactions were conducted within regulatory guidelines and provisions, Adani Group told The Guardian.\n\n\"The fact that our projects have incurred the lowest cost across central, state and private utility players has gone to establish the robustness of the processes followed by our group,\" it said.\n\nAdani Group said it was fully cooperating with the DRI investigation.\n\nA spokeswoman for Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said NAIF was a matter for the Turnbull government.\n\nComment was sought from Acting Resources and Northern Australia Minister Barnaby Joyce.\u200b\n\nNAIF was also approached for comment, but a spokeswoman said the body did not comment publicly on the specifics of proposals or the status of due diligence

Coal from the mine will also produce annual emissions equivalent to those of Malaysia or Austria according to one study.\n\nOne of the few remaining hurdles for the Adani Group is to raise finance to build the mine as well as a railway line to transport coal from the site to a port at Abbot Point on the Queensland coast.\n\nTo finance the railway Adani hopes to persuade the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility (Naif), an Australian government-backed investment fund, to loan the Adani Group or a related entity about US$700m (A$900m) in public money.\n\nWhile it awaits the decision on the loan, in Delhi the company is also expecting the judgment of a legal authority appointed under Indian financial crime laws in connection to allegations it siphoned borrowed money overseas.\n\nThe Adani Group fully denies the accusations, which it has challenged in submissions to the authority.\n\nThe investigation\n\nNews of the investigation was first reported in India three years ago, but the full customs intelligence document reveals forensic details of the workings of the alleged fraud which have not been publicly revealed.\n\nThe 97-page file accuses the Adani Group of ordering hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of equipment for an electricity project in western India's Maharashtra state using a front company in Dubai.\n\nTo read the pdf click here.\n\nThe Dubai company allegedly sold the exact same equipment back to Adani Group-controlled businesses in India at massively inflated prices, in some instances said to be eight times the sale price.\n\nAccording to the allegations in the file, the effect of these transactions was that the Adani Group spent an average 400% more for the materials. That money was allegedly paid to a company Indian authorities allege was owned through a series of shell companies leading to a Mauritius trust controlled by Vinod Adani.\n\nIf true, one effect of the alleged scheme would have been to move vast sums of money from the Adani Group's domestic accounts into offshore bank accounts where it could no longer be taxed or accounted for.\n\nBecause tariffs for using electricity transmission networks are determined partly by what they cost to build, if the DRI's accusations are correct, the overvaluation of capital goods would have been likely to have led to higher power prices for Indian consumers.\n\nA significant proportion of the money the Adani Group allegedly siphoned out of India was provided by taxpayers in the form of loans from the publicly-owned State Bank of India and ICICI, a private bank. There is no suggestion either bank was aware of or involved in any illegal activity.\n\n'We are cooperating with investigating agencies'\n\nThe Adani Group said in a statement to the Guardian on behalf of itself, its subsidiaries, and Vinod Adani that it \"strongly denies the allegations of overvaluation\".\n\n\"It is a standard procedure for the group to follow international competitive bidding route for major capital expenditures to ensure transparency and competitiveness in the process. All our transactions are always conducted within the framework of extant regulatory guidelines and provisions,\" it said.\n\n\"The fact that our projects have incurred the lowest cost across central, state and private utility players has gone to establish the robustness of the processes followed by our group.\n\n\"It may be noted that Mr Vinod Adani who is the elder brother of Mr Gautam Adani has been a non-resident Indian for about 30 years and has his own established business interests outside India,\" the statement said.\n\n\"Adani Group is aware of the investigations being conducted by the DRI, and has fully cooperated, and shall continue to cooperate with the investigating agencies.\"\n\nThe Australian loan\n\nThe Adani Group, or a linked entity, has reportedly been granted \"conditional approval\" for the US$700m (AU$900m) concessional loan from Naif, the Australian government investment fund.\n\nBut due to secrecy around the operation of the investment fund, it is not clear whether the loan application discloses the existence of the DRI notice or the ongoing legal proceedings, or whether the applicant is required to do so under the Naif's anti-money laundering provisions.\n\nAdani Group did not clarify whether it had informed Naif about the allegations when asked by the Guardian.\n\nNaif's investment mandate includes a clause preventing it from \"act[ing] in a way that is likely to cause damage to the commonwealth government's reputation, or that of a relevant state or territory government\".\n\nVinod Adani is currently listed as the sole director of four Singapore-based companies which, through their Australian subsidiaries, are proposing to build the railway line using the government loan. The companies also control a project to expand the Abbot Point port.\n\nAll four entities are ultimately owned by Atulya Resources Limited, an Adani-controlled company in the Cayman Islands.\n\nStatus of the Indian investigation\n\nThe Guardian understands the allegations of over-invoicing have been passed from the DRI to the Enforcement Directorate (ED), an Indian agency tasked with investigating financial crimes.\n\nThe Adani Group says the case is currently before a legal authority, the Adjudicating Authority, indicating that Indian officials are pressing either to seize assets they regard as being connected to money laundering or to levy a fine up to three times the sum allegedly siphoned overseas.\n\nThe company declined requests to clarify what if any penalty the authorities are seeking, but a spokesman said a decision was expected shortly. \"We follow the process of corporate governance and comply with the applicable laws,\" he said.\n\n\"All our transactions are always conducted within the framework of law. We have already submitted our detailed reply. Adjudication process on the subject is going on and we expect the order in near future.\"\n\nThe Guardian is publishing excerpts from the DRI file in the interests of ensuring Naif, as well as the public, have access to as much relevant information as possible in assessing whether Adani or linked companies would be suitable recipients of public money.\n\nIn a separate case last year, six Adani subsidiaries were listed among 40 other companies being investigated for allegedly running a similar price-inflation scheme. The companies are accused of inflating the price of coal imports from Indonesia to hide profits in overseas tax havens.\n\nThe DRI and the ED did not respond to a request to clarify the status of the investigations.\n\nThe alleged money trail\n\nIndia is electricity-starved. More than 240 million Indians - enough people to form the fifth-largest country on Earth - lack access to regular power.\n\nIn the early 1990s, to encourage power companies to build electrical infrastructure, the Indian government eliminated import tariffs on technical equipment such as reactors and transformers. Profit margins on these projects increased overnight.\n\nAdani saw the business opportunity. In 2010, the Maharashtra Eastern Grid Power Transmission Company Limited (MEGPTCL), a wholly owned subsidiary of Adani Enterprises, was granted a license to develop two electricity transmission networks in the north-east of the state.\n\nThe company used another Adani subsidiary, PMC Projects, to source the equipment it would need to build the networks. In turn, PMC, subcontracted the work to a company in Dubai.\n\nAccording to the investigators' report, bank records suggest that that company, Electrogen Infra FZE (EIF), charged significant - and to Indian authorities, suspicious - markups on the equipment it sold to PMC.\n\nIn one of the 57 invoices cited in the report, EIF is alleged to have ordered equipment from Hyundai Heavy Industries in South Korea. Bank records allegedly show the company paid Hyundai about US$65m.\n\nAccording to the DRI, it sold the same equipment to PMC for about US$260m - a mark-up of nearly 400%.\n\n\"[This] appears to be an abnormal and gross inflation, contrary to ordinary economic logic and prudence,\" investigators concluded.\n\nIn total, the report alleges EIF made about 26 orders from Hyundai Heavy Industries and sold them onto PMC for an average mark-up of more than 400%, making a profit margin of US$189m.\n\nThere is no suggestion Hyundai Heavy Industries or any other supplier was aware of or involved in any illegality.\n\nEIF allegedly purchased another 25 shipments of equipment from three companies in China. According to the report, these were sold to the Adani Group for an average markup of about 860%.\n\nInvestigators calculated the total assessable value of the allegedly marked-up invoices to be nearly 15bn rupees.\n\n\"Given the scale and extent of invoice inflation, it is apparent that it [was done] with fraudulent intent of siphoning money from India,\" the DRI said.\n\nWho controls the companies?\n\nKey to the alleged fraud, according to investigators, is that EIF, the company subcontracted to purchase the equipment from manufacturers in South Korea and China, was directly controlled by the Adani Group and its associates.\n\nInvestigators claim EIF was partly staffed by ex-Adani Group employees who had recently left the company.\n\nAccording to a letter from the company to an Indian bank that is cited in the notice, EIF was owned by another company called Electrogen Infra Holding Pvt Ltd (EIH). The trail of ownership eventually leads to a trust based in Mauritius - headed by Vinod Adani.\n\nInvestigators concluded: \"From the above information given to the bank by EIF, it appears that Vinod Adani had a direct control over the activities of EIF through the Asankhya Resources Family Trust.\"\n\nVinod Adani is also listed as having been the director of EIH between January 2010 and May 2011, though the notice states he told investigators he had no involvement in the day-to-day running of the company.\n\nInvestigators also claim to have discovered that an employee of the Adani Group subsidiary PMC had been granted permission by EIF staff to sign multimillion-dollar supply contracts on its behalf.\n\n\"All these go to show that there is no distinction between PMC and EIF, they are only working for common interest as part of a large modus-operandi for siphoning off money from India by invoice inflation,\" investigators concluded.\n\nThe DRI and the ED were both contacted for comment. Attempts were made to contact EIF but the company could not be reached on its listed email or phone number.\n\nHyundai Heavy Industries did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIt is unclear when the allegations of invoice inflation will be resolved in Delhi other than the Adani spokesman saying that they expected an order \"in near future.\" In Queensland, Naif's decision on whether to grant Adani the nearly A$1bn loan is expected by the end of this year.\n\nSupport our independent journalism by giving a one-off or monthly contribution", "date": "2017-08-15", "categories": [{"uri":

fighting the Queensland Environment Department, rather than pay a $12,000 fine for polluting the Great Barrier Reef - a breach the mining giant reported itself.\n\nThe Mackay Conservation group is calling for Adani to instead start engineering works on its Abbot Point port facility in North Queensland to make sure it doesn't happen again.\n\n\"The Queensland government has granted Adani free, unlimited water, it has amended water laws to stop objections by farmers and granted Adani a secret royalties deal,\" says Mackay Conservation Group coordinator, Peter McCallum - who visited Abbot Point with department officials in April to inspect the pollution.\n\nMcCallum claims Adani is being given privileged treatment by the Queensland government, a prime example being this $12,000 \"slap on the wrist\".\n\nAdani admitted to the Queensland Department of Environment and Heritage Protection that it released more than eight times its licenced concentration of pollution in March.\n\n\"Rather than considering challenging the measly $12,000 fine for polluting the Great Barrier Reef coast Adani should begin work immediately to secure its coal terminal from storms and cyclones to avoid repeat pollution of the Reef coast and the Caley Valley Wetlands,\" McCallum says.\n\n\"The Department handed Adani a license to pollute before Cyclone Debbie hit which placed no limit on the volume of polluted water Adani could let flow into the wetlands.\"\n\nA day later this license was retrospectively amended to protect Adani from liability for releasing coal polluted water at several other locations including the sea, McCallum claims.\n\n\"It took over a week for the Department of the Environment to begin even the most basic survey and five months later we still have no report on the pollution of the Caley Valley wetlands,\" says McCallum, who visited the site with Department officials a month after the Cyclone, and there was still coal present in the Caley Valley wetlands.\n\n\"We saw sediments which appear to be laden with coal within the wetlands adjacent to Adani's storm water system outlet,\" Mccallum says.\n\nMccallum says that with Adani's environmental record overseas, and this incident, it can't be trusted to construct a new coal terminal, build a massive coal mine or ship its coal out through the Great Barrier Reef.\n\nMackay Conservation Group exposed aerial photography of Adani's pollution of the Caley Valley wetlands in April which led to the company admitting to releasing 806mg/L of coal and other pollutants from its port at Abbot Point.\n\nWATCH MORE: Science & Health News", "date": "2017-08-14", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Environment", "wgt": 100, "id": 73, "label": "dmoz/Science/Environment"}, {"uri":

Killers have been awarded two Guinness World Records titles for their hit song Mr Brightside.\n\nThe indie-rock anthem, which has dipped in and out of the lower half of the UK's top 100 singles chart over the past 20 years, has spent the most amount of time in the chart compared with any other song, with 416 non-consecutive weeks as of July 4.\n\nThe track has also been awarded the record for the longest stay in the UK singles chart by a group - also with 416 weeks.\n\nIn May, the Official Charts Company announced that the track had become the UK's biggest single never to have reached number one, usurping Wonderwall by British band Oasis.\n\nSpeaking to Guinness World Records ahead of one of their gigs at the O2, frontman Brandon Flowers said: \"It's infectious still to us, I know some people can't wrap their head around it, but you'll see the response (when you see it live).\n\n\"It's tough not to be touched by it or be excited by it and there's going to be people tonight who've never seen it live, there'll be some people who've seen it 45 times.\n\n\"And we just don't get tired of it.\"\n\nGuinness World Records adjudicator Will Munford said: \"Mr Brightside has filled

total of 166 weeks in the top 100 of the UK singles chart as of July 4.\n\nMr Brightside featured on the track list of the band's debut studio album Hot Fuss and peaked at number 10 in the charts after it was re-released in 2004.\n\nThe band, comprised of Flowers, Ronnie Vannucci Jr, Dave Keuning, and Mark Stoermer, have been playing a slew of shows at London's O2 arena with special guests

To put this longevity into perspective, the song has spent a total of almost eight years in the Top 100, across 60 separate chart runs.\n\n\"Mr Brightside\" was first released in 2003 and re-released in 2004. The track, which was the first single from the band's debut album Hot Fuss, reached its peak position of No.10 on 5 June 2004. Incredibly, it spent just one week - its opening week in 2004 - in the Top 20 and seven weeks in the Top 40.\n\nIn May 2024, the Official Charts Company revealed that it had become the UK's biggest single never to have reached No.1, having amassed 5.57 million combined units (1.066 million sales and 530.34 million streams).\n\nThe song's enduring popularity on streaming services has kept \"Mr Brightside\" in the lower reaches of the weekly countdown over the past 20 years.\n\nGuinness World Records awarded The Killers with two certificates to celebrate their record-breaking track at London's The O2 arena on Monday evening, where the band are playing a massive six shows as part of their Rebel Diamonds tour.\n\nSpeaking backstage at The O2 ahead of their gig, The Killers frontman, Brandon Flowers, said of \"Mr Brightside\": \"It's infectious still to us, I know some people can't wrap their head around it, but you'll see the response [when you see it live].\n\n\"It's tough not to be touched by it or be excited by it and there's going to be people tonight who've never seen it live, there'll be some people who've seen it 45 times.\n\n\"And we just don't get tired of it.\"\n\nGuinness World Records Adjudicator Will Munford, said: \"Mr Brightside has filled countless dancefloors and been responsible for many end-of-night singalongs since the mid-2000s. It was an honour to present The Killers with two Guinness World Records titles for the song, it is a testament to its ability to be loved across generations and stand the test of time as one of the all-time classics.\"\n\nFor some historical context, Frank Sinatra's \"My Way\" spent a total of 122 weeks in the Top 50 (as it was then) between 1969 and 1972, and a further two weeks in the Top 75 as a re-issue in 1994, meaning it once held the title for the most cumulative weeks on the UK singles chart (one song).\n\nBy 4 July 2024, \"Someone You Loved\" (2019) by Lewis Capaldi had cemented its place at No.2 behind \"Mr Brightside\" with 236 weeks on the UK chart (and counting), and \"Perfect\" (2017) by Ed Sheeran was in third place on 191 weeks.\n\nPrior to The Killers, the longest stay on the UK singles chart by a group was previously held by Snow Patrol, with their hit \"Chasing Cars\", which had logged 75 chart weeks as of February 2008 and had gone on to amass a total of 166 weeks in the Top 100 of the UK singles chart by 4 July 2024.", "source": {"uri": "music-news.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Music News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Brightside", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mr. Brightside"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Killers", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Killers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Singles_Chart", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UK Singles Chart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinness_World_Records", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Guinness World Records"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_O2_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "The O2 Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indie_rock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indie rock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Flowers", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Flowers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamonds_(Rihanna_song)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Diamonds (Rihanna song)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_Charts_Company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Official Charts Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_40", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Top 40"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_vocalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lead vocalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Someone_You_Loved", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Someone You Loved"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Capaldi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lewis Capaldi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chasing_Cars", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chasing Cars"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Way", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "My Way"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Patrol", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snow Patrol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Sheeran", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ed Sheeran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Sinatra", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frank Sinatra"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Dating", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Dating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Lyrics", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Lyrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Anti-Music", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Toilet_Training", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Toilet Training", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Charts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Charts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.music-news.com/images/news/killers.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9722825", "eventUri": "eng-9722825", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2004-06-05", "textStart": 987, "textEnd": 998}, {"amb": false, "date": "2008-02-", "textStart": 3267, "textEnd": 3280}], "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 224, "relevance": 1}

It peaked at No. 10 in 2004, but has almost never left the charts.\n\nVideos by American Songwriter\n\nThe records broken were Most Cumulative Weeks on the U.K. Singles Chart (one song), and Longest Stay on the U.K. Singles Chart by a Group. Both milestones come in a 416 weeks each on the Top 100 U.K. Singles chart. That's about 8 years in the Top 100.\n\nTwo months ago, The Killers achieved another milestone with \"Mr. Brightside.\" The song was named the biggest song in the U.K. to never hit No. 1. It even unseated Oasis' \"Wonderwall\" for the title. Truly, the English love \"Mr. Brightside\" so much it might as well be their unofficial national anthem.\n\nAt the time, the song was on its 408th week on the Top 100 chart. With more than 5.57 million chart sales, a combination of 1.066 million sales and 530,340,000 streams, \"Mr. Brightside\" deserves to be recognized.

Once it was confirmed England will be playing Spain in the final, streamers filled the arena and The Killers burst song, with Mr Brightside the anthem of choice for celebrating.\n\n\"Well @thekillers just did the coolest thing ever on stage as England won the semi final... #ENGNED #ItsComingHome,\" a Twitter (X) user penned as they shared the video online this evening. \"This is bloody awesome,\" one wrote in response, with another adding: \"They're such a class act!\"\n\nOthers pointed out the song played within seconds of England's huge achievement, with one Twitter user praising The Killers for kickstarting the celebrations by \"playing the most British song\" and another viewer jokingly replying: \"Please rise for the national anthem.\"\n\nOn Monday, The Killers were presented with two esteemed Guinness World Records in recognition of their enduring hit Mr Brightside, ahead of their first performance at London's The O2 arena. The group's indie-rock anthem has been crowned with the record for the Most cumulative weeks on the UK singles chart (one song), having lodged an impressive 416 weeks in the Top 100 of the Official Singles Chart by 4 July 2024.\n\nThey've also claimed the title for Longest stay on the UK singles chart by a group once again, at 416 weeks. To put this feat into perspective, the song has remained in the Top 100 for almost eight years across 60 separate chart runs.

The band is currently performing a series of six shows at the venue as part of their Rebel Diamonds tour.\n\nBrandon Flowers, the frontman of The Killers, spoke backstage at The O2 before their concert.

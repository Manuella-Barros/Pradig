{"id": 223696956, "title": "Sofyan Amrabat issues update on Man Utd transfer with secret clause set to be triggered", "text": "Sofyan Amrabat is still none the wiser as to whether Manchester United will turn his loan move into a permanent one. The Morocco international, 27, joined the Red Devils on loan in the summer following months of speculation and the deal which United struck with Fiorentina includes an option to sign the playmaker permanently for \u00a321million. While Amrabat has made 21 Premier League appearances for United this season, just 10 of those were starts and, like other many others, it currently remains to be seen whether or not he will be at Old Trafford next year. Despite the uncertainty over his future, Amrabat produced a fine display in the FA Cup final as United beat Manchester City 2-1 at Wembley - and he then seemingly refused to shut the door on a permanent transfer post-match. During an interview with Ziggo Sport, Amrabat was asked about his future and replied: \"Do I already know what I\u2019m going to do next year? No. We are going to talk. \"Staying is certainly an option. Look, I think it has been a very difficult season. For Manchester United it needs to be much better, and also for me personally.\" Manchester United are expected to be active in the summer transfer market with Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos at the helm, however, recent reports have indicated that the club are unlikely to pursue a permanent deal for Amrabat. Join the debate! Do you think Man Utd should sign Amrabat? Let us know here. If that does prove to be the case then Amrabat will have his contract at Fiorentina extended for another year due to a secret clause which was agreed upon prior to his Old Trafford switch. Italian outlet Il Tirreno outlined back in September that Fiorentina insisted upon such a clause in order to protect the midfielder's market value. Amrabat went on to admit that the period at the start of his loan, where he filled in at left-back, was difficult before reiterating transfer talks would take place soon. He said: \"That wasn\u2019t easy. I have always remained calm and trained very hard. Ultimately, that patience has been rewarded. \"We are going to talk. Manchester United are the biggest club in the world, so who wouldn\u2019t want to play football here? But all parties have to be happy with each other, so we will sit down now and see what happens.\" Join our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

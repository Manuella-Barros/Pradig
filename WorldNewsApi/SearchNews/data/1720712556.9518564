Lachlan Bruce tailed four different females, including two 16-year-old girls, who were complete strangers to him. The 25-year-old, who blamed his antics on drug taking and insisted they weren\u2019t sexually motivated, largely targeted women around Aberdeen bus station. Bruce followed victims around the streets and onto buses, where he would repeatedly move seats to be closer to them, all while fixing them with an intimidating stare. Three of his victims were so scared they approached strangers for help, while another contacted a friend to pick her up and burst into tears. Fiscal depute Rebecca Coakley told Aberdeen Sheriff Court the first incident happened on November 11 2023. The court heard Bruce\u2019s first victim was onboard a bus when she \u201cfelt like someone was staring at her\u201d. Ms Coakley said: \u201cShe looked up and saw the accused staring at her with what she described as a \u2018creepy smile\u2019. \u201cThroughout the remainder of the journey, she was aware of the accused staring at her and any time she looked towards him he\u2019d look away before turning back and staring at her.\u201d The behaviour made the woman feel \u201cextremely uncomfortable\u201d and, when the bus stopped on Union Street at 10.50am, she decided to get off along with a number of other passengers. But as she walked to the front of the bus, Bruce got off as well and waited for her. The woman turned right and began to walk along Union Street, but realised Bruce was following behind her. \u2018Extremely uncomfortable\u2019 As she sped up, he did the same. Ms Coakley said: \u201cThe complainer approached two members of the public and asked them to walk with her as she was being followed.\u201d Bruce\u2019s second victim, a 16-year-old girl, noticed him while waiting for a bus at Union Square around 5.30pm on December 9. The fiscal depute told the court: \u201cWhen the bus arrived, a queue formed and the accused stood directly behind her. \u201cShe felt he was much closer than he needed to be and could feel his presence directly behind her.\u201d The girl got onto the bus and sat upstairs, where Bruce followed and took a seat across the aisle from her. Ms Coakley said: \u201cHe sat with his back against the window and was looking directly at her. \u201cDue to feeling uncomfortable, she moved several rows forward so she was no longer in his line of sight, \u201cAfter a few minutes, the accused moved and seated himself a couple of rows in front of her and continued to look through the gap in the seats at her. \u201cA few minutes later he moved again and sat in the row directly in front of her. \u201cThe complainer immediately stood up and moved back a few rows to create further space.\u201d But Bruce, yet again, moved seats to follow the teenager, this time sitting diagonally opposite her. \u2018She felt extremely scared and contacted a friend to collect her\u2019 Ms Coakley said: \u201cThe complainer stood up and walked to the back of the bus with other passengers and explained why she was sitting with them. She no longer looked at the accused.\u201d Bruce\u2019s third victim, also aged just 16, was again targeted at Aberdeen bus station, around 5.40pm on December 16. The teen noticed Bruce when he stood \u201cvery close\u201d to her and felt \u201cextremely uncomfortable\u201d about the situation. Weeks later, on December 31, the girl was at the bus station and again saw Bruce staring at her. He then walked over to the bench she was sitting on and sat down next to her. When the girl walked into the shopping centre to get away from him, he followed. Initially, she did not see Bruce as she walked around Costa, but when she headed back towards the bus station Bruce appeared again, following her back to the stance. When she got on the bus Bruce followed directly behind her, sitting a few rows behind her upstairs. Again, the 16-year-old noticed Bruce \u201cstaring directly at her\u201d and felt \u201cextremely uncomfortable\u201d. Ms Coakley said: \u201cAround 20 minutes later, the accused moved from his seat and sat directly behind the complainer, placing his face in the gap between the seats around 15cm from her. \u201cShe felt extremely scared and contacted a friend to collect her from the next stop.\u201d As the girl went to leave the bus, Bruce placed his leg in the aisle, forcing her to carefully manoeuvre around him. When she made it to safety in her friend\u2019s car she \u201cburst into tears\u201d. But the teen still had not seen the last of Bruce. She encountered him for a third time in the bus station again at 6.30pm on January 6. This time, the girl was with a friend and, on spotting Bruce, again staring at her, pointed him out. The pair waited for Bruce to board the bus first and, when he sat upstairs, they remained downstairs. Victim number four But 20 minutes later, Bruce walked downstairs and sat down a few rows behind them. Whenever they glanced round, they could see Bruce was staring at the girl. Five or 10 minutes later he moved and sat across the aisle from them, staring at the complainer for the rest of the journey until he got off at Tarves. Bruce\u2019s fourth victim first noticed him following her closely as she left Union Square around 7pm on December 30, in between the incidents with the third complainer. The fiscal depute said: \u201cShe felt scared although decided not to look at the accused and continued walking on Bridge Street. \u201cShe stopped at a crossing close to Soul and became aware of the accused standing closely on her right-hand side. As she looked up she saw the accused staring at her. \u201cThe complainer became wary of the accused\u2019s strange behaviour and felt worried for her safety.\u201d The woman went into a Tesco Express store in a bid to lose Bruce but again encountered him inside with the same unnerving stare. When she left the shop, Bruce was already outside waiting and staring at her. By this point, the woman was \u201cfrightened\u201d and Bruce continued to follow her as she approached a bus stop on Holburn Street before suddenly appearing in front of her. \u2018Very alarming to all of the women who were affected\u2019 Ms Coakley said: \u201cThe complainer stopped two members of the public and requested they walk her home.\u201d Bruce, of Tarves, pled guilty to four charges of behaving in a threatening or abusive manner. Defence agent John McLeod said his client appeared with no analogous previous convictions and only road traffic matters on his record. He explained Bruce had limited recollection of the offences due to drug use at the time, but was now taking steps to address that issue. The solicitor also highlighted that it was accepted there was no sexual motivation behind the offences. Sheriff Andrew Miller told Bruce: \u201cIt\u2019s very easy to understand why your behaviour would have been so very alarming to all of the women who were affected.\u201d He described the offences as \u201cbizarre\u201d and \u201cvery concerning\u201d. As a direct alternative to custody, he ordered Bruce to complete 160 hours of unpaid work and be supervised for 18 months.

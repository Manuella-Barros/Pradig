It is highlighted that unused or expired medicine should never be flushed or poured down the drain, as water reclamation facilities are not equipped to remove all pharmaceuticals, leading to trace amounts showing up in rivers and lakes.\n\nTo locate a Drug Take Back location in Wisconsin, individuals are directed to visit the website provided by the Department of Health Services. The success of Drug Take Back Day is dependent on the support and collaboration of various organizations and agencies, including the DEA, Fuchs Trucking, Covanta Energy, Wisconsin State Patrol, and several local law enforcement agencies.\n\nParticipants are reminded of the guidelines for the event, including the acceptable items for disposal such as prescription and over-the-counter medications, pet medications, and vape pens. Illegal drugs, needles, bio-hazardous materials, and household hazardous waste are among the items not permitted for disposal during the event.\n\nSolid, non-liquid medications should be placed in clear sealable plastic bags, while liquids, creams, and sprays must be in their original packaging to be accepted. It is important to note that illicit substances such as marijuana or methamphetamine should not be included in the collection containers during Drug Take Back Day.\n\nThe collaborative efforts of the Wisconsin DOJ, DEA, and various other agencies aim to provide a valuable opportunity for Wisconsinites to safely and responsibly dispose of unwanted medications, contributing to the overall efforts in combating the opioid epidemic.", "source": {"uri": "legalnewsline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Legal Newsline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "legal_newsline@legalnewsline.com", "name": "Legal Newsline", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Kaul", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Josh Kaul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid_epidemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Opioid epidemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health_(Philippines)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Department of Health (Philippines)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_reclamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Land reclamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covanta", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Covanta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin_State_Patrol", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin State Patrol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescription_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prescription drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methamphetamine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Methamphetamine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_Enforcement_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drug Enforcement Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_cigarette", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electronic cigarette"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plastic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cannabis (drug)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_substance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Controlled substance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-counter_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Over-the-counter drug"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Substance_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Substance Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Drugs_and_Alcohol", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Drugs and Alcohol", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/jnswire/jns-media/22/37/16184857/webp_h71gb5iyrcm5d4pbagzujmw44tlg.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9510945", "eventUri": "eng-9510945", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

Prescription and over-the-counter medications may be disposed of at Drug Take Back Day locations. Accepted items include:\n\nAmong the items that are not accepted include aerosol cans, anything containing blood or a bodily fluid, illegal drugs and sharps/syringes. Click here for a full list.\n\nKaul said disposing of unused, unwanted or expired drugs is a quick, easy and free way to ensure these medications don't end up in the wrong hands.\n\nI want to emphasize that it's important that folks do this because one of the ways that prescription painkiller abuse can happen, and that addiction can start, is by people diverting medications that are designed for lawful use for an unlawful use. Whether it's somebody going into the medicine cabinet of a family member or somebody they're visiting, or the theft of unused and unwanted medications, a lot of people become addicted to prescription painkillers through the diversion of those drugs.\n\n53,122 lbs. of medications were collected in Wisconsin's Drug Take Back Day event last fall, ranking number one in the country.\n\nIf you aren't able to participate in this Saturday's Drug Take Back Day, there are nearly 500 permanent drug drop boxes across Wisconsin that are open year round.

The Take Back program has received an overwhelming response from communities across the country.\n\nIn 2023, DEA collected more than 1.2 million pounds of unneeded medications at more than 4,600 sites nationwide during our two one-day events.\n\nDEA has now registered a record 17,000 pharmacies as authorized collectors to help Americans dispose of unused prescription drugs any day of the year. These safe disposal receptacles, in addition to DEA's annual Take Back Day events, provide the public with an easy, no-cost opportunity to anonymously dispose of medications that are no longer needed.\n\nTake Back Day has helped Americans easily rid their homes of unwanted or expired medications. These medications can be a gateway to addiction and have helped fuel the opioid epidemic.\n\nAccording to a report published by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), a majority of people who use a prescription medication for a nonmedical purpose obtained that medication from a family member or friend.\n\nRemoving unnecessary medications from the home can help prevent situations involving not taking medication as intended or dosed; taking someone else's prescription; and taking the medicine for euphoric effects rather than medicinal purposes.\n\n\"DEA has worked closely with the registrant community to dramatically increase the number of permanent disposal sites accessible to Americans. As a result, members of the public can now go to any one of 17,000 pharmacies across the nation to dispose of unused prescription medications any day of the year,\" said DEA Administrator Anne Milgram. \"I encourage everyone to take advantage of these collection sites and make every day Take Back Day.\"\n\nMake Every Day Take Back Day by visiting a local pharmacy, hospital, or business with a DEA-registered year-round collection. In addition, many local police departments provide year-round drug disposal boxes.\n\nEditor's note: The Fallbrook sheriff's substation does have a prescription drug drop off kiosk in its lobby, available during business hours, Monday through Friday. Medications can also be dropped off at most pharmacies. In Fallbrook, these drug stores have drop off kiosks: Albertsons, 1133 S. Mission Road; CVS, 1101 S. Mission Road; and Rite Aid, 1331 S. Mission Road.\n\nFor those with base access, the USN Naval Hospital Camp Pendleton, 200 Mercy Circle, also takes unused medications. And if you go shopping in Temecula, these drugstores are another option for dropping off those medications: Vons, 29530 Rancho California Road; CVS, 29610 Rancho California Road; CVS, 30640 Rancho California Road or Albertsons, 30530 Rancho California Road.", "source": {"uri": "villagenews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Village News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescription_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prescription drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_Enforcement_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drug Enforcement Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Take_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Take (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pharmacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid_epidemic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Opioid epidemic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_Abuse_and_Mental_Health_Services_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphoria", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Euphoria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Addiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Milgram", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anne Milgram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CVS_Pharmacy", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CVS Pharmacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Corps_Base_Camp_Pendleton", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rite_Aid", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rite Aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Reed_National_Military_Medical_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Walter Reed National Military Medical Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vons", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albertsons", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Albertsons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_manager", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "City manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temecula,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Temecula, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Temecula, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health", "label": "dmoz/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Pharmacy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Senior_Health", "label": "dmoz/Health/Senior Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Abortion", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Abortion", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Senior_Health/Drugs", "label": "dmoz/Health/Senior Health/Drugs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 51}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://www.villagenews.com/home/cms_data/dfault/images/companylogo_facebook.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9510945", "eventUri": "eng-9510945", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

(WATE) -- It's that time of the year to take a look in your medicine cabinet and get rid of those medications that expired or aren't being used anymore.\n\nOn Saturday, April 27, several East Tennessee law enforcement agencies and nonprofits will collect unwanted or unused prescription medication as part of the Drug Enforcement Administration's National Prescription Drug Take-Back Day.\n\nThe DEA's Take Back Day events provide an opportunity for Americans to get rid of unused, unneeded and expired medication to help prevent drug addiction and overdose deaths. All of the events will run from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. The events happen twice a year in April and October.\n\nAccording to the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, the most common method of obtaining pills is through family and friends. ASAP of Anderson shared that prescription drugs can be easily stolen when they are left in unlocked cabinets and drawers. In 2021, the National Institute on Drug Abuse reported that 14.3 million Americans over the age of 12 misused prescription drugs.\n\n\"This is such an important event and we're thankful to have the Hamblen County Substance Abuse Coalition partnering with us each year to make it happen in Hamblen County,\" said Sheriff Chad Mullins.\n\nItems that will be accepted include unneeded and expired prescription medications, antibiotics, steroids, cold medicine, vitamins/herbal supplements, pet medications, eye drops, and ointments. However, needles, IV bags, blood sugar equipment, and illegal drugs will not be accepted.\n\nThere are drop-off events in nearly every East Tennessee county, including Knox, Hamblen, Anderson and Sevier Counties.

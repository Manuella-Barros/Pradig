The zoo made the announcement Wednesday, about half a year after it sent its three pandas back to China. The Smithsonian\u2019s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute said the pair of pandas are Bao Li (pronounced BOW\u2019-lee) and Qing Bao (ching-BOW\u2019). Giant pandas are icons in Washington, D.C., and beloved around the nation and the world. For more than five decades, the institute has created and maintained one of the world\u2019s foremost giant panda conservation programs, helping move the panda from \u201cendangered\u201d to \u201cvulnerable\u201d on the global list of species at risk of extinction. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to announce the next chapter of our breeding and conservation partnership begins by welcoming two new bears, including a descendent of our beloved panda family, to Washington, D.C.,\u201d said Brandie Smith, the institute\u2019s John and Adrienne Mars director. \u201cThis historic moment is proof positive our collaboration with Chinese colleagues has made an irrefutable impact. Through this partnership, we have grown the panda population, advanced our shared understanding of how to care for this beloved bear and learned what\u2019s needed to protect wild pandas and preserve native habitat.\u201d In the video announcement released today on the insitute\u2019s social media channels, first lady Dr. Jill Biden joined Smithsonian Secretary Lonnie G. Bunch III and Smith to reveal pandas are coming back to the nation\u2019s capital. This news comes just six months after giant pandas Tian Tian, Mei Xiang and their cub, Xiao Qi Ji, went to China last November, prompting a nationwide outpouring of farewell from millions of panda fans of all ages.", "summary": "The Smithsonian\u2019s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute has helped move the panda from 'endangered' to 'vulnerable' on the global list of species at risk of extinction.", "url": "https://www.centralmaine.com/2024/05/29/two-new-giant-pandas-are-returning-to-washingtons-national-zoo-from-china/", "image": "https://w2pcms.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/05/Giant_Pandas_89303_65c29f.jpg?w=1000", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:49:53", "author": "Dino Hazell,DINO HAZELL - Associated Press", "authors": ["Dino Hazell", "DINO HAZELL - Associated Press"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.475}

In April, Attorney General Bonta joined 22 attorneys general in sending a letter to UnitedHealth Group, Inc. -- the nation's largest healthcare company and the parent company of Change Healthcare -- urging the corporation to take more meaningful action to better protect providers, pharmacies, and patients harmed by the recent breach.\n\n\"The cyberattack against Change Healthcare put the personal information of far too many consumers at risk,\" said Attorney General Bonta. \"Alongside attorneys general across the country, I urge California consumers to take advantage of the resources available to protect them from identity theft and more, including by enrolling in the two years of free credit monitoring and identity theft protections. My office is committed to protecting the rights of patients and consumers, including those affected by data breaches.\"\n\nChange Healthcare, a unit of UnitedHealth, is the nation's biggest electronic data clearinghouse. Change Healthcare's technological infrastructure is used by tens of thousands of providers, pharmacies, and insurers to verify insurance, confirm pre-authorization of procedures or services, exchange insurance claim data, and perform other administrative tasks essential to the delivery of health care.\n\nThe February cyberattack against Change Healthcare interrupted operations for thousands of doctors' offices, hospitals, and pharmacies. It also resulted in many Americans' sensitive health and personal data being leaked onto the dark web -- a hidden portion of the Internet where cyber criminals buy, sell, and track personal information. The actual number and identity of affected patients are currently unknown.\n\nUnitedHealth has publicly stated that the data breach could impact up to a third of all Americans. Typically, when there is a data breach impacting California residents, consumers receive an individualized letter or email if their data was impacted. However, Change Healthcare has not yet provided individual notice to consumers. Given the significant impact of the breach, and since Change Healthcare has not yet provided notice to individuals who were affected, the safest course of action is for everyone to take advantage of the free resources that are available. Change Healthcare is offering free credit monitoring and identity theft protections for two years from a company called IDX . These free resources are available to all California residents who believe they may have been impacted by the cyberattack. They also set up a dedicated website and call center to assist consumers. The website and call center will not be able to provide individuals details about whether their data was impacted, but can guide them through setting up free credit monitoring and identity theft protections.\n\nConsumers should be aware of potential warning signs that someone is using their medical information. The signs include:\n\nIf consumers are concerned that their data may have been impacted but prefer not to use the free resources provided by Change Healthcare, they can also consider:\n\nA credit freeze prevents creditors -- such as banks or lenders -- from accessing individual's credit reports. This will stop identity thieves from taking out new loans or credit cards in consumer's names because creditors will not approve their loans or credit requests if they cannot first access their credit reports. By law, a credit bureau must allow you to place, temporarily lift, or remove a credit freeze for free.\n\nWhen consumers freeze their credit with each bureau, the bureaus will send them a personal identification number. The consumers can then use that PIN to unfreeze their credit if they want to apply for a loan or credit card. Consumers can also use the PIN to freeze their credit again after they have applied for loans or a new credit card.\n\nIndividuals will have to freeze their credit with each bureau: Experian, Equifax and TransUnion.\n\nAttorney General Bonta joined a bipartisan group of attorneys general from across the country in sharing these consumer protection resources.", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz", "name": "Mil-Osi Publisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_Healthcare", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Change Healthcare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UnitedHealth_Group", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UnitedHealth Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_breach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Data breach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Identity theft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pharmacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberattack", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cyberattack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_attorney_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "State attorney general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_General_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attorney General of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oakland, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oakland, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Personal data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_web", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dark web"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybercrime", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cybercrime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_protection", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consumer protection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TransUnion", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TransUnion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_bureau", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit bureau"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experian", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Experian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_history", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Credit history"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_identification_number", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Personal identification number"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equifax", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Equifax"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Insurance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Insurance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 88}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719617", "eventUri": "eng-9719617", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 234, "relevance": 1}

When a data breach reaches Connecticut residents, it will usually send an individual message to inform them. This time, Change Healthcare hasn't provided personal notices.\n\nThe press release did not include when consumers could expect a notice by.\n\nThe office of the Attorney General provided warning signs and information about cyberattacks and freezing credit resources below:\n\nConsumers should be aware of potential warning signs that someone is using their medical information.

This will stop identity thieves from taking out new loans or credit cards in consumer's names because creditors will not approve their loans or credit requests if they cannot first access their credit reports. By law, a credit bureau must allow you to place, temporarily lift, or remove a credit freeze for free.\n\nWhen consumers freeze their credit with each bureau, the bureaus will send them a personal identification number.

PAUL, Minn. - Minnesota's Attorney General has some advice for consumers after February's data breach at Change Healthcare.\n\nThe nation's biggest electronic data clearinghouse. Change Healthcare's technological infrastructure is used by tens of thousands of providers, pharmacies, and insurers to verify insurance, confirm pre-authorization of procedures or services, exchange insurance claim data, and perform other administrative tasks essential to the delivery of health care. The February cyberattack interrupted operations for thousands of doctors' offices, hospitals, and pharmacies. It also resulted in Americans' sensitive health and personal data being leaked onto the dark web - a hidden portion of the Internet where cyber criminals buy, sell, and track personal information.\n\nMN AG Keith Ellison says the actual number and identity of affected patients are currently unknown. Change Healthcare has publicly stated that the data breach could impact up to 1/3 of all Americans.\n\nIn April, Ellison and a bipartisan coalition of 22 attorneys general had sent a letter to UnitedHealth Group, Inc. -- the nation's largest health insurer and the parent company of Change Healthcare -- urging the corporation to take more meaningful action to better protect providers, pharmacies, and patients harmed by the recent breach.\n\n\"The recent data breach at Change Healthcare is unprecedented and could affect millions of Minnesotans,\" says Attorney General Ellison. \"I encourage everyone to avail themselves of the free credit monitoring and identity theft protections being offered by Change Healthcare, and to be on the lookout for signs that bad actors have access to their personal and medical information.\"\n\nFor information visit changecybersupport.com. To enroll in credit monitoring through IDX use the link at changecybersupport.com or call 1-888-846-4705. For additional support from Change Healthcare call 1-866-262-5342.\n\nEllison says there are potential warning signs your medical information by someone else, including:\n\n- A bill for medical services you did not receive;\n\n- Errors in their Explanation of Benefits statement like services you never received or prescription medications you do not take;\n\n- A call from a debt collector about a medical debt you do not owe;\n\n- Medical debt collection notices on your credit report you do not recognize;\n\n- A notice from your health insurance company indicating they have reached their benefit limit; or\n\n- You are denied insurance coverage because your medical records show a pre-existing condition you do not have.\n\nIf consumers are concerned that their data may have been impacted but prefer not to use the free resources provided by Change Healthcare, they can also consider freezing their credit.\n\nEllison says a credit freeze prevents creditors -- such as banks or lenders -- from accessing individual's credit reports. It will stop identity thieves from taking out new loans or credit cards in consumer's names because creditors will not approve their loans or credit requests if they cannot first access their credit reports. By law, a credit bureau must allow you to place, temporarily lift, or remove a credit freeze for free.\n\nWhen consumers freeze their credit with each bureau, the bureaus will send them a personal identification number. The consumers can then use that PIN to unfreeze their credit if they want to apply for a loan or credit card. Consumers can also use the PIN to freeze their credit again after they have applied for loans or a new credit card.\n\nIndividuals will have to freeze their credit with each bureau: Experian, Equifax and TransUnion.\n\nEquifax | https://www.equifax.com/personal/credit-report-services/credit-freeze/\n\n+1 (888) 766-0008\n\nExperian | https://www.experian.com/freeze/center.html\n\n+1 (888) 397-3742\n\nTransUnion | https://www.transunion.com/credit-freeze\n\n+1 (800) 680-7289", "source": {"uri": "kimt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KIMT-TV 3 Mason City"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mike_bunge@kimt.com", "name": "Mike Bunge", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_Healthcare", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Change Healthcare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Ellison", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Keith Ellison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_breach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Data breach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pharmacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Health care"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnesota", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Minnesota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Personal data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_web", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dark web"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_hacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Security hacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberattack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cyberattack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybercrime", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cybercrime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Health insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_debt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medical debt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UnitedHealth_Group", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UnitedHealth Group"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_history", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Credit history"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_attorney_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State attorney general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_theft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Identity theft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postal_Index_Number", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Postal Index Number"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TransUnion", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "TransUnion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experian", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Experian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equifax", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Equifax"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Credit_and_Collection", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Credit and Collection", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Banking_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Banking Services", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 42}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/kimt.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/e/cb/ecbfd818-3fed-11ed-a170-43b1138b7917/633588483f018.image.jpg?crop=1024%2C538%2C0%2C100&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719617", "eventUri": "eng-9719617", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

Nearly five months later, Change Healthcare has yet to provide necessary notice to impacted consumers. Connecticut consumers cannot wait any longer to take protective steps. I strongly urge any Connecticut residents who may have been impacted to immediately take advantage of free credit monitoring and identity theft protections. I will continue to press for notice - individuals have a right to know if they have been impacted, how they were impacted, and what they can do,\" said Attorney General Tong.\n\nChange Healthcare, a unit of UnitedHealth, is the nation's largest electronic data clearinghouse. Its technological infrastructure supports tens of thousands of providers, pharmacies, and insurers in verifying insurance, confirming pre-authorization of procedures or services, exchanging insurance claim data, and performing other essential administrative tasks in healthcare delivery.\n\nThe February cyberattack interrupted operations for numerous doctors' offices, hospitals, and pharmacies. It also led to the exposure of Americans' sensitive health and personal data on the dark web -- a hidden portion of the Internet where cybercriminals trade personal information. The exact number and identities of affected patients remain unknown.\n\nChange Healthcare has publicly stated that up to one-third of all Americans could be affected by this breach. Typically, consumers receive an individualized letter or email if their data is compromised; however, Change Healthcare has not yet provided such notifications. Given this delay in notification following the breach's occurrence in February 2024, Attorney General Tong is highlighting both the breach itself and available resources from Change Healthcare.\n\nChange Healthcare offers all Connecticut residents who believe they may have been impacted two years of free credit monitoring and identity theft protection. Although their dedicated website and call center cannot confirm individual impacts on personal data directly at this time, they can assist with setting up these protections.\n\nIn April 2024, Attorney General Tong joined other attorneys general in sending a letter to UnitedHealth Group Inc., urging more substantial actions to protect those harmed by this recent breach.\n\nCyberattacks targeting the healthcare sector have risen significantly in frequency and severity over recent years. Data breaches involving Protected Health Information (PHI) must be reported by HIPAA-covered entities to the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services - Office for Civil Rights (hhs.gov). Since early 2024 alone, nearly 38 million individuals' PHI has been compromised according to reports on their portal.\n\nConsumers should be aware of potential warning signs indicating misuse of their medical information:\n\nIf concerned about potential impact but opting out from using Change Healthcare's free resources provided post-breach incidentally noted earlier within our article text body section contextually surrounding its mention thereof thus far mentioned previously heretofore...\n\nFreezing Credit\n\nA credit freeze prevents creditors -- such as banks or lenders -- from accessing

Thousands of healthcare providers, pharmacies, and insurers rely on Change Healthcare's services, making the exposure of sensitive health and personal data to cybercriminals a significant threat to public trust and security.

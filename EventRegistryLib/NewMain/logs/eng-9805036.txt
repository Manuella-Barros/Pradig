Monitor patients closely after epinephrine is used, in case further treatment, including emergency medical help, is needed.\n\n\"Neffy's approval is based on four studies in 175 healthy adults, without anaphylaxis, that measured the epinephrine concentrations in the blood following administration of neffy or approved epinephrine injection products,\" the FDA said. \"Results from these studies showed comparable epinephrine blood concentrations between neffy and approved epinephrine injection products.\"\n\nThe studies also showed that neffy was effective in triggering the kinds of increases in blood pressure and heart rate that are crucial to treating anaphylaxis.\n\nNeffy can come with side effects. These may include: throat irritation, tingling nose, headache, nasal discomfort, feeling jittery, tingling sensation, fatigue, tremor, runny nose, itchiness inside the nose (nasal pruritus), sneezing, abdominal pain, gum pain, numbness in the mouth, nasal congestion, dizziness, nausea and vomiting.\n\n\"Neffy comes with a warning that certain nasal conditions, such as nasal polyps or a history of nasal surgery, may affect absorption of neffy, and patients with these conditions should consult with a health care professional to consider use of an injectable epinephrine product,\" the FDA added. \"Neffy also comes with warnings and precautions about use of epinephrine by people with certain coexisting conditions and allergic reactions associated with sulfite.\"\n\nThe new approval comes after an expert advisory panel supported neffy's use back in May of 2023. In September, the FDA held back on approval, asking for further study.\n\nMore information\n\nLearn the signs of anaphylaxis at the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nSOURCE: U.S. Food and Drug Administration, announcement, Aug. 9, 2024\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nPeople nervous about administering epinephrine by needle during an episode of anaphylaxis now have a newly approved nasal spray alternative.", "source": {"uri": "maryvilleforum.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Maryville Forum"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenaline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adrenaline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_spray", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nasal spray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaphylaxis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anaphylaxis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Allergy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergen", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Allergen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostril", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nostril"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paresthesia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paresthesia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pulmonology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intensive care medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human nose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fatigue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Side effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_professional", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health professional"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_congestion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nasal congestion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_polyp", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nasal polyp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinorrhea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rhinorrhea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tremor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tremor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_intestine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Small intestine"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs_and_Medications", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs and Medications", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Allergies", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Allergies", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Smokeless", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Smokeless", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/maryvilleforum.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/67/d67fdbdd-1e06-5cd4-b2f6-034c2456dc7a/66b663dfd13f0.image.jpg?crop=1024%2C538%2C0%2C0&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9805036", "eventUri": "eng-9805036", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 216, "relevance": 1}

Research estimates anaphylaxis may cause up to 200 deaths each year.\n\nNeffy, a single-dose nasal spray that can be administered into one nostril, was approved for use in adult and pediatric patients who weigh at least 66 pounds.\n\nThe Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America (AAFA) said the nasal spray may remove some barriers that prevent people from using epinephrine, especially for children who may be afraid of needles.\n\n\"The needle-free device removes the fear of needle-based injections and may be easier to use,\" said Kathy Przywara, community vice president at AAFA. \"This may increase confidence among people managing life-threatening allergies.\"\n\nNeffy's approval is based on four studies in 175 healthy adults without anaphylaxis that measured the epinephrine concentrations in the blood following the administration of neffy or approved epinephrine injection products.\n\nLast year, the U.S. health regulator declined to approve the spray and requested additional testing, a decision that went against the recommendation of its independent experts.\n\nHow does neffy work?\n\nThere's no preparation or activation necessary before using neffy, Richard Lowenthal, co-founder and CEO of ARS Pharma, told USA TODAY last year. The device works similarly to Narcan, the nasal spray that reverses opioid overdoses.\n\n\"You grab the device, put it in somebody's nose and press the plunger at the bottom of the device and it will snap and spray the medicine,\" he said.\n\nThe person doesn't need to be breathing or snort the medication, he said; it's automatically absorbed by the nasal mucosa.\n\nThis isn't possible with normal epinephrine, which isn't absorbed in the nose if taken from a vial. However, the new nasal spray has a solvent that gets between cells in the nose and helps the body absorb epinephrine.\n\nThe most reported side effects included mild nasal discomfort, headache, runny nose, nausea, moderate dizziness, moderate vomiting and mild throat irritation.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenaline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adrenaline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_spray", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nasal spray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaphylaxis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anaphylaxis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Allergy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoinjector", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Autoinjector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epinephrine_autoinjector", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epinephrine autoinjector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostril", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nostril"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Asthma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pediatrics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_emergency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medical emergency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_mucosa", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nasal mucosa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Side effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinorrhea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rhinorrhea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naloxone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Naloxone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dizziness", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dizziness"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_overdose", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drug overdose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nausea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomiting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vomiting"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs_and_Medications", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs and Medications", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Respiratory_Disorders", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Respiratory Disorders", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Allergies", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Allergies", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Smokeless", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Tobacco/Smokeless", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/08/09/USAT/74739299007-neffydevice-2-mg.png?auto=webp&crop=2849,1603,x0,y623&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9805036", "eventUri": "eng-9805036", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

Friday's approval comes after the FDA stalled neffy's approval in September, asking the drugmaker for additional data.\n\nAt the time, the company was being asked to conduct a repeat-dose study of neffy to show it worked as well as available epinephrine products. (Viatris, the maker of the EpiPen, also filed a petition asking for more data, Endpoints reported.) Much of the data ARS submitted last year was from people who were healthy or only had mild allergies (not anaphylaxis), there was limited safety data, no formal clinical efficacy trial, and results varied across trials.\n\nThe 2-milligram dose of neffy was approved for anaphylaxis in adults and children who weigh more than 66 pounds. One spray goes in a single nostril, and the second can be used as backup if the first fails to curb anaphylaxis. Experts recommend seeking out medical care during an episode of anaphylaxis, even if a person has taken epinephrine.\n\nThe review process for epinephrine is based on surrogate measures of efficacy, such as how well neffy raises a person's blood pressure (a necessary step for calming an allergic reaction). Epinephrine has been widely used since before the FDA existed, so its approval process is different from that of newer drugs.\n\nNeffy's approval was based on four studies that included 175 healthy adults without anaphylaxis. Concentrations of epinephrine in their blood after using neffy were comparable to those after using an auto-injector pen, according to a new release from the FDA.\n\nAn epinephrine nasal spray has been difficult to develop because the drug is not well-absorbed through the nose, said ARS CEO Richard Lowenthal, a 25-year veteran in drug development who started his career as a new drug reviewer at the FDA.\n\nARS presents neffy as a smaller and more easily administered rival to auto-injectors which, for decades, have been the only quick treatment option for people with severe allergies. Epinephrine, which is the same thing as adrenaline, has been used for a century to treat anaphylaxis. However, existing treatments have run into supply, cost, and design issues neffy hopes to fix.\n\nLowenthal told STAT in September that a pair of neffy would not cost more than $199, even for people who are uninsured or have high-deductible health insurance plans. For most people with commercial insurance, ARS plans to use coupons to drive copays down to $25 per two-pack.\n\nHe also said he doesn't expect to encounter the same supply issues that have plagued other epinephrine products. Since 2017, there have been shortages of the EpiPen, and other auto-injectors have been pulled from the market over quality control problems. Lowenthal said it's the complicated design of the pens that has been a problem. Epinephrine itself is available, and neffy will be using a simple spray device, the same one used for overdose reversal medication Narcan and several other products on the market. Neffy's nasal spray containers are about the size of a tea bag, and deliver a single dose into the nose with a one-handed pump.\n\nARS' research suggests children as young as 12 years old can use neffy by themselves (the drugmaker chose the name to be kid-friendly). \"It doesn't matter if you dose it upside down, right side up, at an angle -- doesn't matter. It fires exactly the same way in every direction,\" Lowenthal said. And ARS has designed a clip-on carrying case reminiscent of an AirPods case to keep the doses in.\n\nNeffy could also be stored at up to 122 degrees Fahrenheit for up to three months, meaning users don't need to worry about the drug going bad if they leave it in a hot car for an afternoon, Lowenthal said. That pushes the temperature stability further than auto-injectors, he said.\n\nReported side effects of neffy include: throat irritation, headache, nasal discomfort, fatigue, tremor, runny or itchy nose, sneezing, abdominal pain, gum pain, numbness in the mouth, nasal congestion, dizziness, nausea and vomiting. People with nasal polyps or a history of nasal surgery may not absorb neffy well, and those with allergic reactions to sulfite should talk to a doctor before using the spray.\n\nLack of access to epinephrine -- because of cost or supply, or insurance coverage -- can put people with severe allergic reactions in risky situations, experts say. While deaths from anaphylaxis are rare, delaying treatment means the allergic reaction will worsen and require hospitalization.\n\nAccess issues widen health disparities. Already, data suggest there are significant differences in food allergy prevalence by socioeconomic status. And Black, Hispanic, and Asian children have higher rates of severe allergic reactions, allergies to multiple foods, and related emergency visits, Gupta found in her research. (The top nine allergens are peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish, finned fish, milk, eggs, soy, wheat, and sesame.)\n\nARS will next look to expand the patient pool to children of lower weights. The drugmaker also told STAT it was conducting trials to see if neffy can work for people with chronic hives or persistent asthma.", "source": {"uri": "statnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "STAT"}, "authors": [{"uri": "isabella_cueto@statnews.com", "name": "Isabella Cueto", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenaline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adrenaline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_spray", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nasal spray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaphylaxis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anaphylaxis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epinephrine_autoinjector", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Epinephrine autoinjector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Allergy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Efficacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viatris", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viatris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostril", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nostril"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_development", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drug development"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blood pressure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fatigue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_as_food", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Egg as food"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Side effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfite", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sulfite"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_congestion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nasal congestion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_polyp", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nasal polyp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paresthesia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paresthesia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asia"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Substance_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Substance Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Drugs_and_Alcohol", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Drugs and Alcohol", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Substance_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Substance Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Hand-2-1024x576.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9805036", "eventUri": "eng-9805036", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

Instead, the agency asked the manufacturer to complete a study comparing repeat doses of neffy to repeat doses of epinephrine injection.\n\n\"Anaphylaxis is life-threatening and some people, particularly children, may delay or avoid treatment due to fear of injections,\" Kelly Stone, associate director of FDA's Division of Pulmonology, Allergy and Critical Care, said in a statement. \"The availability of epinephrine nasal spray may reduce barriers to rapid treatment of anaphylaxis. As a result, neffy provides an important treatment option and addresses an unmet need.\"\n\nEpinephrine has been used since 1901 and is the first line of defense to treat allergic reactions. But all current epinephrine treatments, like the well-known EpiPen and other autoinjectors, use needles -- which poses a problem if people are needle-phobic.\n\nThe approval represents the first significant change in epinephrine delivery in over 35 years, the company said.\n\n\"This approval marks a watershed moment in addressing an unmet medical need for people with Type I allergies -- a treatment alternative that avoids the need to inject epinephrine with a needle, which can be fraught with anxiety and fear for many,\" Richard Lowenthal, ARS co-founder, president and CEO said in a statement.\n\nNeffy is a single dose nasal spray administered into one nostril. A second dose (using a new nasal spray in the same nostril) may be given if there is no improvement in symptoms or if symptoms worsen.\n\nThe company said neffy is expected to be available within eight weeks of FDA approval.\n\nAside from being needle-free, part of the appeal of the device is that it could provide competition to the expensive EpiPen.\n\nIn 2007, a pack of two injectors cost $100, but when Mylan bought the product, it hiked the cash price to more than $600 by 2016 -- despite each pen costing a fraction of that to make.\n\nAs a result of the outcry, Mylan began selling an \"authorized generic\" for $300. An authorized generic is essentially the same product as the brand-name drug, just marketed without the brand name.\n\nFor people with severe allergic reactions who have commercial insurance that covers neffy, ARS said it will use a co-pay savings program to limit the cost to $25 for each filled prescription of two single-use neffy devices.\n\nFor eligible patients without insurance coverage, or in situations where a health plan does not yet cover the product, or if a patient faces high out-of-pocket costs due to a high-deductible plan, ARS said it will offer a cash price of $199 for two doses of neffy through digital pharmacy BlinkRx.\n\nThe cash price is also available for patients who use GoodRx at retail pharmacies, the company said.", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nathaniel_weixel@thehill.com", "name": "Nathaniel Weixel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenaline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adrenaline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_spray", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nasal spray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaphylaxis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anaphylaxis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epinephrine_autoinjector", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Epinephrine autoinjector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Allergy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediatrics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pediatrics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoinjector", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Autoinjector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pulmonology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Intensive care medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostril", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nostril"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anxiety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorized_generics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Authorized generics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mylan", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mylan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescription_drug", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prescription drug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pharmacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Pharmacy", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs_and_Medications", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs and Medications", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Allergies", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Allergies", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/AP17159778159294-e1723225180476.jpg?strip=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9805036", "eventUri": "eng-9805036", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

(Nasdaq: SPRY), a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to empowering at-risk patients and caregivers to better protect patients from severe allergic reactions that could lead to anaphylaxis, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved neffy (epinephrine nasal spray) 2 mg for the treatment of Type I Allergic Reactions, including anaphylaxis, in adults and children who weigh \u226530 kg (66 lbs.). The approval represents the first significant innovation in the delivery of epinephrine in more than 35 years and is the first and only needle-free treatment option for patients and families living with severe allergic reactions.\n\n\"Until today, patients with severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, only had one treatment option - an often painful and anxiety-inducing needle injection of epinephrine. In some cases, patients would delay or not administer the life-saving treatment at the onset of symptoms, increasing the risk for a severe reaction or negative outcomes requiring additional emergency medical treatment,\" said Thomas B. Casale, M.D., Professor of Medicine and Pediatrics and Chief of Clinical and Translational Research in the USF Health Morsani College of Medicine's Division of Allergy and Immunology at the University of South Florida in Tampa, Florida. \"FDA approval of neffy means that patients with severe allergies finally gain a long-awaited, needle-free, easy-to-carry epinephrine delivery method that has the potential to reduce time to administration, which can lead to better clinical outcomes and improvements in quality of life for patients and their caregivers.\"\n\nType I allergic reactions, including those caused by food, medications, and insect bites, can lead to life-threatening anaphylaxis and result in an estimated 500,000 emergency room (ER) visits each year, with nearly 60% of such patients reported to not have received epinephrine prior to visiting the ER.\n\n\"This approval marks a watershed moment in addressing an unmet medical need for people with Type I allergies - a treatment alternative that avoids the need to inject epinephrine with a needle, which can be fraught with anxiety and fear for many,\" said Richard Lowenthal, Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer, ARS Pharmaceuticals. \"Epinephrine treatment is only effective if available, readily usable, and administered appropriately. Our team has worked tirelessly to create an easy-to-carry, easy-to-use, needle-free device that offers peace of mind to patients and caregivers by enabling them to administer epinephrine quickly and confidently when needed. We thank the FDA staff for their partnership and support in the development of neffy, and are deeply grateful to the severe allergy community, including advocates, patients, parents, and healthcare professionals, for their contributions to the development of neffy as an important, life-saving treatment.\"\n\nThe approval of neffy is based on data from five primary registration studies with a 2 mg intranasal dose of epinephrine. These primary clinical trials were supported by numerous pilot and supportive studies. neffy met all defined clinical endpoints and its pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) data were within the range of approved epinephrine injection products. These data included single- and twice-dosed studies in healthy adults, with self-administration and caregiver administration in Type I allergy patients, in pediatric patients \u226530 kg (66 lbs.) as well as in those with allergic rhinitis (congestion and runny nose). Adverse events in neffy clinical trials were generally mild in nature without any meaningful nasal irritation or pain, and no serious adverse events were reported in any clinical study.\n\n\"Anyone who has experienced or witnessed an anaphylaxis reaction knows it can be very stressful deciding when to inject epinephrine to themselves or a child and often delay,\" said Dr. Jonathan Spergel, Chief of the Allergy Program at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. \"We know that earlier administration is better, and for many, the needle is a barrier that causes dangerous hesitation. That is why the field has long pursued an effective treatment approach that does not require an injection.\"\n\nPrioritizing Patient Access\n\nAs part of its commitment to access and affordability for all patients who need neffy, ARS Pharma plans to offer robust programs to support patient access. For people with severe allergic reactions who have commercial insurance that covers neffy, ARS Pharma is committed to limiting what most commercially insured patients pay to just $25 for each filled prescription of two single-use neffy devices via a co-pay savings program. For eligible patients without insurance coverage, situations in which a health plan does not yet cover neffy, or if a patient faces high out-of-pocket costs due to a high-deductible plan, ARS Pharma will offer a cash price of $199 for two doses of neffy via BlinkRx, a digital pharmacy service that is available to patients at no added cost. This cash price is also available for patients who use retail pharmacies via GoodRx, a free-to-use website and mobile app, or whose insurance plans explicitly carve out coverage of neffy. In addition, for eligible U.S. residents who are uninsured or underinsured, meet certain eligibility criteria, and have exhausted all other options, the ARS Pharma Patient Assistance Program (PAP) will provide neffy at no cost.\n\nAccording to Dr. Lou Garrison, Professor Emeritus in The Comparative Health Outcomes, Policy, and Economics (CHOICE) Institute in the School of Pharmacy at the University of Washington, \"neffy's value to society should be measured by more than its benefit to the individual at the moment they use it to stop an anaphylactic reaction; its value is also in the reassurance it offers to everyone from just carrying it, knowing it can protect them in an emergency. Like a fire extinguisher in the home, neffy offers peace of mind to the person carrying it and also to their family and friends, who are reassured that the health of a loved one is better protected. But the peace of mind for potential patients and the similar spillover to their caregivers are values that are too often overlooked in health economics analyses. A product like neffy offers substantial societal value that should be embraced by insurance plans aligning care and coverage for patients affected by severe allergic reactions.\"\n\n\"We join other patient organizations in our enthusiasm for the significant clinical and societal value of neffy, as well as ARS Pharma's commitment to making it accessible for everyone no matter their insurance coverage,\" said Peter Rubin, Executive Director of No Patient Left Behind, a non-profit dedicated to healthcare reforms that ensure patients can access the medicines of today and tomorrow. \"Patients should not have to go without treatment due to out-of-pocket costs and ARS Pharma's co-pay assistance program will help with that. This FDA approval is groundbreaking for patients living with severe allergies because neffy offers a clear benefit as an effective, convenient nasal spray. Ultimately, it is beneficial for all insurers and employer plan sponsors to cover neffy with affordable co-pays so that patients in need can access this needle-free epinephrine alternative when appropriately prescribed. Until then, we appreciate ARS Pharma for offering comprehensive programs to broaden patient access.\"\n\nPatient Support Available Through neffyconnect\n\nTo help ensure affordability and access, the neffyconnect program provides patients, caregivers, and healthcare professionals (HCPs) with information about patient support programs, such as medication fulfillment services and financial support to guide their treatment journey, including navigating insurance requirements and potential barriers to access. neffyconnect will also provide families with helpful educational resources and tools. ARS Pharma expects the majority of payors to formalize their coverage decision policies during the next six months; in the interim, neffyconnect can help HCPs and patients access financial support and medication fulfillment services. For more information, visit www.neffy.com or call 1-877-myneffy (1-877-696-3339).\n\n\"We commend the FDA's decision to approve ARS Pharma's neffy, which offers the food allergy community a nasal-spray epinephrine delivery device,\" said Sung Poblete, Ph.D., RN, CEO of FARE. \"This needle-free breakthrough should make it easier for food allergy patients and those around them to administer epinephrine in the event of an anaphylactic reaction. Importantly, we believe that innovation of this nature should also make it easier to have epinephrine more broadly available for use in the event of an emergency -- in police cruisers, at restaurants, in airplanes, at hotels, at amusement parks, and in other areas where accidental exposures are possible. This is a win for the food allergy community.\"\n\n\"Studies show adults and teens with food allergies often don't carry their auto-injectors. This new technology may overcome the inherent reluctance of people to carry bulkier epinephrine with them everywhere,\" said Lianne Mandelbaum, an advocate for people with food allergies and Founder of the non-profit No Nut Traveler. \"Currently the FAA only requires planes to include vials of epinephrine, which have to be administered with syringes. This can take time, and time is of the essence when treating an allergic reaction for the best possible outcome. This becomes critical in the air where backup medical care is not accessible. A small, convenient needle-free device may not only be vital to those who carry it but extend a safety net to fellow passengers who are not otherwise prepared for a mile-high allergic reaction.\"\n\nProduct Availability\n\nneffy is expected to be available in the United States within eight weeks of FDA approval for patients who weigh 30 kg or greater (66 lbs.). In the interim, patients can visit www.neffy.com to register for product updates, including when telemedicine services will be available. ARS Pharma plans to file a supplemental NDA application with the FDA for neffy (epinephrine nasal spray) for children who weigh 15 to <30 kg by the end of the third quarter of 2024. In the European Union (EU), neffy received a positive opinion and recommendation for approval from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use on June 27, 2024, with commercial launch in the EU expected in Q4 2024 following the expected grant of market authorization by the European Commission (EC).\n\nThe shelf life of neffy is 30 months and allows for temperature exposure up to 122\u00b0F (50\u00b0C), making it a potentially effective treatment if left in a car or outside for a length of time. If accidentally frozen, neffy can be thawed and administered.\n\nFor more information, visit www.neffy.com.\n\nInvestor Conference Call Information\n\nARS Pharma management will host a conference call and webcast at 8:00 a.m. ET on Monday, August 12, 2024, to discuss the FDA approval and launch of neffy. To access the webcast and slides, please visit the Events & Presentations page in the Investors & Media section of the Company's website. A replay of the webcast will be available for 30 days following the event.\n\nDial-in information for conference participants may be obtained by registering for the event here.\n\nAbout Type I Allergic Reactions, including Anaphylaxis\n\nType I severe allergic reactions are serious and potentially life-threatening events that can occur within minutes of exposure to an allergen and require immediate treatment with epinephrine, the only FDA-approved medication for these reactions. While epinephrine auto-injectors have been shown to be highly effective, there are well published limitations that result in many patients and caregivers delaying or not administering treatment in an emergency situation. These limitations include fear of the needle, lack of portability, needle-related safety concerns, lack of reliability, and complexity of the devices. There are approximately 40 million people in the United States who experience Type I severe allergic reactions due to food, venom or insect stings. Of those, only 3.3 million currently have an active epinephrine auto-injector prescription, and of those, only half consistently carry their prescribed auto-injector. Even if patients or caregivers carry an auto-injector, more than half either delay or do not administer the device when needed in an emergency.\n\nDr. Jonathan Spergel, Chief of the Allergy Program at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, is a paid consultant and serves as a member of the ARS Pharma Scientific Advisory Board. He was not involved in the neffy clinical trials.\n\nAbout neffy\n\nneffy is an intranasal epinephrine product for patients with Type I allergic reactions including food, medications, and insect bites that could lead to life-threatening anaphylaxis.\n\nINDICATION AND IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR NEFFY (epinephrine nasal spray)\n\nINDICATION\n\nneffy 2 mg is indicated for emergency treatment of type I allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, in adult and pediatric patients who weigh 30 kg or greater.\n\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nIt is recommended that patients are prescribed and have immediate access to two neffy nasal sprays at all times. In the absence of clinical improvement or if symptoms worsen after initial treatment, administer a second dose of neffy in the same nostril with a new nasal spray starting 5 minutes after the first dose.\n\nneffy is for use in the nose only.\n\nAdvise patients when to seek emergency medical assistance for close monitoring of the anaphylactic episode and in the event further treatment is required.\n\nAbsorption of neffy may be affected by underlying structural or anatomical nasal conditions.\n\nAdminister with caution to patients who have heart disease; epinephrine may aggravate angina pectoris or produce ventricular arrhythmias. Arrhythmias, including fatal ventricular fibrillation, have been reported, particularly in patients with underlying cardiac disease or taking cardiac glycosides, diuretics, or anti-arrhythmics.\n\nThe presence of a sulfite in neffy should not deter use.\n\nneffy may alter nasal mucosa for up to 2 weeks after administration and increase systemic absorption of nasal products, including neffy.\n\nPatients with certain medical conditions or who take certain medications for allergies, depression, thyroid disorders, diabetes, and hypertension, may be at greater risk for adverse reactions.\n\nEpinephrine can temporarily exacerbate the underlying condition or increase symptoms in patients with the following: hyperthyroidism, Parkinson's disease, diabetes, renal impairment. Epinephrine should be administered with caution in patients with these conditions, including elderly patients and pregnant women.\n\nAdverse reactions to neffy may include throat irritation, intranasal paresthesia, headache, nasal discomfort, feeling jittery, paresthesia, fatigue, tremor, rhinorrhea, nasal pruritus, sneezing, abdominal pain, gingival pain, hypoesthesia oral, nasal congestion, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting.\n\nAbout ARS Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nARS Pharma is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to empowering at-risk patients and caregivers to better protect patients from severe allergic reactions that could lead to anaphylaxis. The Company is commercializing neffy, an epinephrine nasal spray product for patients with Type I allergic reactions, including food, medications, and insect bites that could lead to life-threatening anaphylaxis.

(Nasdaq: SPRY), a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to empowering at-risk patients and caregivers to better protect patients from severe allergic reactions that could lead to anaphylaxis, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved neffy\u00ae (epinephrine nasal spray) 2 mg for the treatment of Type I Allergic Reactions, including anaphylaxis, in adults and children who weigh \u226530 kg (66 lbs.). The approval represents the first significant innovation in the delivery of epinephrine in more than 35 years and is the first and only needle-free treatment option for patients and families living with severe allergic reactions.\n\n\"Until today, patients with severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, only had one treatment option - an often painful and anxiety-inducing needle injection of epinephrine. In some cases, patients would delay or not administer the life-saving treatment at the onset of symptoms, increasing the risk for a severe reaction or negative outcomes requiring additional emergency medical treatment,\" said Thomas B. Casale, M.D., Professor of Medicine and Pediatrics and Chief of Clinical and Translational Research in the USF Health Morsani College of Medicine's Division of Allergy and Immunology at the University of South Florida in Tampa, Florida. \"FDA approval of neffy means that patients with severe allergies finally gain a long-awaited, needle-free, easy-to-carry epinephrine delivery method that has the potential to reduce time to administration, which can lead to better clinical outcomes and improvements in quality of life for patients and their caregivers.\"\n\nType I allergic reactions, including those caused by food, medications, and insect bites, can lead to life-threatening anaphylaxis and result in an estimated 500,000 emergency room (ER) visits each year, with nearly 60% of such patients reported to not have received epinephrine prior to visiting the ER.\n\n\"This approval marks a watershed moment in addressing an unmet medical need for people with Type I allergies - a treatment alternative that avoids the need to inject epinephrine with a needle, which can be fraught with anxiety and fear for many,\" said Richard Lowenthal, Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer, ARS Pharmaceuticals. \"Epinephrine treatment is only effective if available, readily usable, and administered appropriately. Our team has worked tirelessly to create an easy-to-carry, easy-to-use, needle-free device that offers peace of mind to patients and caregivers by enabling them to administer epinephrine quickly and confidently when needed. We thank the FDA staff for their partnership and support in the development of neffy, and are deeply grateful to the severe allergy community, including advocates, patients, parents, and healthcare professionals, for their contributions to the development of neffy as an important, life-saving treatment.\"\n\nThe approval of neffy is based on data from five primary registration studies with a 2 mg intranasal dose of epinephrine. These primary clinical trials were supported by numerous pilot and supportive studies. neffy met all defined clinical endpoints and its pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) data were within the range of approved epinephrine injection products. These data included single- and twice-dosed studies in healthy adults, with self-administration and caregiver administration in Type I allergy patients, in pediatric patients \u226530 kg (66 lbs.) as well as in those with allergic rhinitis (congestion and runny nose). Adverse events in neffy clinical trials were generally mild in nature without any meaningful nasal irritation or pain, and no serious adverse events were reported in any clinical study.\n\n\"Anyone who has experienced or witnessed an anaphylaxis reaction knows it can be very stressful deciding when to inject epinephrine to themselves or a child and often delay,\" said Dr. Jonathan Spergel, Chief of the Allergy Program at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. \"We know that earlier administration is better, and for many, the needle is a barrier that causes dangerous hesitation. That is why the field has long pursued an effective treatment approach that does not require an injection.\"\n\nPrioritizing Patient Access\n\nAs part of its commitment to access and affordability for all patients who need neffy, ARS Pharma plans to offer robust programs to support patient access. For people with severe allergic reactions who have commercial insurance that covers neffy, ARS Pharma is committed to limiting what most commercially insured patients pay to just $25 for each filled prescription of two single-use neffy devices via a co-pay savings program. For eligible patients without insurance coverage, situations in which a health plan does not yet cover neffy, or if a patient faces high out-of-pocket costs due to a high-deductible plan, ARS Pharma will offer a cash price of $199 for two doses of neffy via BlinkRx, a digital pharmacy service that is available to patients at no added cost. This cash price is also available for patients who use retail pharmacies via GoodRx, a free-to-use website and mobile app, or whose insurance plans explicitly carve out coverage of neffy. In addition, for eligible U.S. residents who are uninsured or underinsured, meet certain eligibility criteria, and have exhausted all other options, the ARS Pharma Patient Assistance Program (PAP) will provide neffy at no cost.\n\nAccording to Dr. Lou Garrison, Professor Emeritus in The Comparative Health Outcomes, Policy, and Economics (CHOICE) Institute in the School of Pharmacy at the University of Washington, \" neffy 's value to society should be measured by more than its benefit to the individual at the moment they use it to stop an anaphylactic reaction; its value is also in the reassurance it offers to everyone from just carrying it, knowing it can protect them in an emergency. Like a fire extinguisher in the home, neffy offers peace of mind to the person carrying it and also to their family and friends, who are reassured that the health of a loved one is better protected. But the peace of mind for potential patients and the similar spillover to their caregivers are values that are too often overlooked in health economics analyses. A product like neffy offers substantial societal value that should be embraced by insurance plans aligning care and coverage for patients affected by severe allergic reactions.\"\n\n\"We join other patient organizations in our enthusiasm for the significant clinical and societal value of neffy, as well as ARS Pharma's commitment to making it accessible for everyone no matter their insurance coverage,\" said Peter Rubin, Executive Director of No Patient Left Behind, a non-profit dedicated to healthcare reforms that ensure patients can access the medicines of today and tomorrow. \"Patients should not have to go without treatment due to out-of-pocket costs and ARS Pharma's co-pay assistance program will help with that. This FDA approval is groundbreaking for patients living with severe allergies because neffy offers a clear benefit as an effective, convenient nasal spray. Ultimately, it is beneficial for all insurers and employer plan sponsors to cover neffy with affordable co-pays so that patients in need can access this needle-free epinephrine alternative when appropriately prescribed. Until then, we appreciate ARS Pharma for offering comprehensive programs to broaden patient access.\"\n\nPatient Support Available Through neffy connect\n\nTo help ensure affordability and access, the neffy connect program provides patients, caregivers, and healthcare professionals (HCPs) with information about patient support programs, such as medication fulfillment services and financial support to guide their treatment journey, including navigating insurance requirements and potential barriers to access. neffy connect will also provide families with helpful educational resources and tools. ARS Pharma expects the majority of payors to formalize their coverage decision policies during the next six months; in the interim, neffy connect can help HCPs and patients access financial support and medication fulfillment services.

Importantly, we believe that innovation of this nature should also make it easier to have epinephrine more broadly available for use in the event of an emergency -- in police cruisers, at restaurants, in airplanes, at hotels, at amusement parks, and in other areas where accidental exposures are possible. This is a win for the food allergy community.\"\n\n\"Studies show adults and teens with food allergies often don't carry their auto-injectors. This new technology may overcome the inherent reluctance of people to carry bulkier epinephrine with them everywhere,\" said Lianne Mandelbaum, an advocate for people with food allergies and Founder of the non-profit No Nut Traveler. \"Currently the FAA only requires planes to include vials of epinephrine, which have to be administered with syringes. This can take time, and time is of the essence when treating an allergic reaction for the best possible outcome. This becomes critical in the air where backup medical care is not accessible. A small, convenient needle-free device may not only be vital to those who carry it but extend a safety net to fellow passengers who are not otherwise prepared for a mile-high allergic reaction.\"\n\nProduct Availability\n\nneffy is expected to be available in the United States within eight weeks of FDA approval for patients who weigh 30 kg or greater (66 lbs.). In the interim, patients can visit www.neffy.com to register for product updates, including when telemedicine services will be available. ARS Pharma plans to file a supplemental NDA application with the FDA for neffy (epinephrine nasal spray) for children who weigh 15 to <30 kg by the end of the third quarter of 2024. In the European Union (EU), neffy received a positive opinion and recommendation for approval from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use on June 27, 2024, with commercial launch in the EU expected in Q4 2024 following the expected grant of market authorization by the European Commission (EC).\n\nThe shelf life of neffy is 30 months and allows for temperature exposure up to 122\u00b0F (50\u00b0C), making it a potentially effective treatment if left in a car or outside for a length of time. If accidentally frozen, neffy can be thawed and administered.\n\nFor more information, visit www.neffy.com.\n\nInvestor Conference Call Information\n\nARS Pharma management will host a conference call and webcast at 8:00 a.m. ET on Monday, August 12, 2024, to discuss the FDA approval and launch of neffy. To access the webcast and slides, please visit the Events & Presentations page in the Investors & Media section of the Company's website. A replay of the webcast will be available for 30 days following the event.\n\nDial-in information for conference participants may be obtained by registering for the event here.\n\nAbout Type I Allergic Reactions, including Anaphylaxis\n\nType I severe allergic reactions are serious and potentially life-threatening events that can occur within minutes of exposure to an allergen and require immediate treatment with epinephrine, the only FDA-approved medication for these reactions. While epinephrine auto-injectors have been shown to be highly effective, there are well published limitations that result in many patients and caregivers delaying or not administering treatment in an emergency situation. These limitations include fear of the needle, lack of portability, needle-related safety concerns, lack of reliability, and complexity of the devices. There are approximately 40 million people in the United States who experience Type I severe allergic reactions due to food, venom or insect stings. Of those, only 3.3 million currently have an active epinephrine auto-injector prescription, and of those, only half consistently carry their prescribed auto-injector. Even if patients or caregivers carry an auto-injector, more than half either delay or do not administer the device when needed in an emergency.\n\nDr. Jonathan Spergel, Chief of the Allergy Program at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, is a paid consultant and serves as a member of the ARS Pharma Scientific Advisory Board. He was not involved in the neffy clinical trials.\n\nAbout neffy\u00ae\n\nneffy\u00ae is an intranasal epinephrine product for patients with Type I allergic reactions including food, medications, and insect bites that could lead to life-threatening anaphylaxis.\n\nINDICATION AND IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR NEFFY (epinephrine nasal spray)\n\nINDICATION\n\nneffy 2 mg is indicated for emergency treatment of type I allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, in adult and pediatric patients who weigh 30 kg or greater.\n\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION\n\nIt is recommended that patients are prescribed and have immediate access to two neffy nasal sprays at all times. In the absence of clinical improvement or if symptoms worsen after initial treatment, administer a second dose of neffy in the same nostril with a new nasal spray starting 5 minutes after the first dose.\n\nneffy is for use in the nose only.\n\nAdvise patients when to seek emergency medical assistance for close monitoring of the anaphylactic episode and in the event further treatment is required.\n\nAbsorption of neffy may be affected by underlying structural or anatomical nasal conditions.\n\nAdminister with caution to patients who have heart disease; epinephrine may aggravate angina pectoris or produce ventricular arrhythmias. Arrhythmias, including fatal ventricular fibrillation, have been reported, particularly in patients with underlying cardiac disease or taking cardiac glycosides, diuretics, or anti-arrhythmics.\n\nThe presence of a sulfite in neffy should not deter use.\n\nneffy may alter nasal mucosa for up to 2 weeks after administration and increase systemic absorption of nasal products, including neffy.\n\nPatients with certain medical conditions or who take certain medications for allergies, depression, thyroid disorders, diabetes, and hypertension, may be at greater risk for adverse reactions.\n\nEpinephrine can temporarily exacerbate the underlying condition or increase symptoms in patients with the following: hyperthyroidism, Parkinson's disease, diabetes, renal impairment. Epinephrine should be administered with caution in patients with these conditions, including elderly patients and pregnant women.\n\nAdverse reactions to neffy may include throat irritation, intranasal paresthesia, headache, nasal discomfort, feeling jittery, paresthesia, fatigue, tremor, rhinorrhea, nasal pruritus, sneezing, abdominal pain, gingival pain, hypoesthesia oral, nasal congestion, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting.\n\nThese are not all of the possible side effects of neffy.

It's administered as a single dose sprayed into one nostril. A second dose may be given if needed, similar to injectable epinephrine, the agency said.\n\nNeffy uses the same spray device as Narcan, the naloxone nasal spray for opioid overdose, according to a spokesperson for its maker, ARS Pharmaceuticals.\n\n\"Anaphylaxis is life-threatening and some people, particularly children, may delay or avoid treatment due to fear of injections,\" said Dr. Kelly Stone, associate director of the Division of Pulmonology, Allergy and Critical Care in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. \"The availability of epinephrine nasal spray may reduce barriers to rapid treatment of anaphylaxis.\"\n\nThe approval was based on studies in 175 healthy adults measuring concentrations of epinephrine in the blood, which showed comparable levels for Neffy and injected epinephrine, as well as similar increases in blood pressure and heart rate. A study in children weighing more than 66 pounds found comparable epinephrine levels to those in adults.\n\nThe drug had been expected to be approved last year, but was delayed as the FDA sought more information about repeat dosing. The FDA said Friday that patients may need to seek emergency medical assistance for close monitoring after experiencing anaphylaxis, and in case further treatment is needed. It's also recommended patients who get injectable epinephrine seek immediate emergency care.\n\nThe FDA noted people who have nasal conditions like nasal polyps or who have had nasal surgery may not absorb Neffy sufficiently and should talk with a health-care provider about whether an injectable epinephrine would be better for them.\n\nThe agency said the most common side effects of Neffy include throat irritation, tingling nose, headache, nasal discomfort and feeling jittery, among others.\n\nAnaphylaxis is most often caused by reactions to medication, foods or insect stings, according to the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology. Symptoms, which typically start within five to 30 minutes of contact with an allergen, include hives, swelling of the throat and other areas, wheezing and passing out.\n\n\"Anyone who has experienced or witnessed an anaphylaxis reaction knows it can be very stressful deciding when to inject epinephrine to themselves or a child and often delay,\" Dr. Jonathan Spergel, chief of the allergy program at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said in a news release from ARS Pharmaceuticals. \"We know that earlier administration is better, and for many, the needle is a barrier that causes dangerous hesitation. That is why the field has long pursued an effective treatment approach that does not require an injection.\"\n\nARS Pharmaceuticals didn't disclose the list price of Neffy - how much it costs before insurance or other discounts - in its news release Friday. It said that for patients with commercial insurance that covers the drug, the price out of pocket would be no more than $25 for two single-use devices, via a co-pay program. For certain patients without insurance coverage or who face high out-of-pocket costs, the company said the price would be $199 for two doses of Neffy. For other patients who can't afford the medicine, the company said it would provide Neffy for free.\n\nThe medicine is expected to be available in the United States within eight weeks, ARS said. The company also noted it plans to file for FDA approval of Neffy for children who weigh between 15 and 30 kg (33 to 66 pounds) by the end of the third quarter of this year, or before October.\n\nCNN's Jen Christensen contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Common symptoms include hives, swelling, itching, vomiting and difficulty breathing.\n\nThe device, marketed as Neffy, could upend treatment for the 33 million to 45 million Americans with severe allergies to food and other triggers. Anaphylaxis sends more than 30,000 people to emergency rooms and results in more than 2,000 hospitalizations and more than 230 deaths in the U.S. each year.\n\nOf the 6 million prescriptions written for auto-injectors each year, more than 40% are never filled, Dr. Thomas Casale, an allergist at the University of South Florida, told an FDA advisory panel last year. Even when they are available to caregivers, many auto-injectors are used incorrectly, he said.\n\n\"There's a real unmet medical need for a large portion of the population,\" he said.\n\nNeffy is intended for people who weigh at least 66 pounds. It is given in a single dose sprayed into one nostril. A second dose can be given if the person's symptoms don't improve.\n\nThe new treatment could be life-changing for people with severe food allergies, said Dr. Kelly Cleary, a pediatrician and director with the Food Allergy Research & Education, a nonprofit advocacy group.\n\n\"I have seen the look of worry or fear,\" said Cleary, whose 11-year-old son has multiple food allergies. \"I worry about what happens if someone hesitates.\"\n\nRequiring an injection in an emergency is as scary to some children as the allergic reaction itself. Some parents have had to restrain thrashing children to inject them, sometimes causing cuts that require stitches. About 3,500 caregivers a year are injured when they accidentally inject themselves in the hands, ARS said.\n\nPriscilla Hernandez, of Pasadena, California said her 12-year-old son, Zacky, who is allergic to sesame, peanuts, tree nuts, avocado and other foods, was traumatized when he had a reaction at school about six years ago and a nurse treated him with an auto-injector.\n\n\"Having to do a shot creates this whole different level of anxiety,\" she said.\n\nShe said, \"we are over the moon\" about the FDA's approval of the spray, which Zacky will start carrying when it becomes available.\n\nFirst marketed in 1901, epinephrine predates the FDA itself. Products like the EpiPen auto-injector, approved in 1987, were authorized based on chemistry and manufacturing data and were not required to prove safety and efficacy.\n\nClinical trials of people experiencing potentially deadly reactions are difficult for ethical and pragmatic reasons. Instead, ARS officials compared the effect of the nasal spray on biological markers to existing epinephrine treatments.\n\nResults showed Neffy worked about as well as injected epinephrine to boost heart rate and blood pressure, which counter severe reactions. The drug is combined with a patented agent that allows it to be easily absorbed through nasal membranes.\n\nOther needle-free epinephrine devices are being developed to treat allergic reactions. In the pipeline are nasal sprays from Bryn Pharma, of North Carolina, and Nausus Pharma, of Israel; a needle-free auto-injector from Crossject of France; and an epinephrine film that is administered under the tongue from Aquestive Therapeutics, of New Jersey.\n\nNeffy is designed to be easy to carry and easy to use, especially for children, said Richard Lowenthal, president and chief executive of San Diego-based ARS.\n\n\"We don't want fear. There's no needle, there's no pain with this product,\" he said. \"It's basically like spraying saline into your nose.\"\n\nNeffy will come in packs of two and is expected to cost about the same as a two-pack of auto-injectors, around $300 to $700. Lowenthal said he hoped insurance companies would cover the cost to patients for a low co-pay amount.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

The injectable epinephrine products can help save a life during an allergic reaction, but there's never been a needle-free option, until now.\n\nFor the first time, a non-injection form of epinephrine has been approved by the FDA. Known as neffy, the single-dose nasal spray is designed to be administered into one nostril, and was approved for use in adults and kids who weigh at least 66 pounds with severe allergies.\n\n\"Anaphylaxis is life-threatening and some people, particularly children, may delay or avoid treatment due to fear of injections,\" said Kelly Stone, MD, PhD, Associate Director of the Division of Pulmonology, Allergy and Critical Care in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, in a statement. \"The availability of epinephrine nasal spray may reduce barriers to rapid treatment of anaphylaxis. As a result, neffy provides an important treatment option and addresses an unmet need.\"\n\nEpinephrine has been used in the treatment of anaphylactic allergies since the early 1900s, and the injectable form of the drug has been the standard for the past 35 years, reports ARS Pharmaceuticals, the manufacturer of neffy. For those who may have a needle phobia, neffy is a game-changer.\n\n\"This approval marks a watershed moment in addressing an unmet medical need for people with Type I allergies - a treatment alternative that avoids the need to inject epinephrine with a needle, which can be fraught with anxiety and fear for many,\" said Richard Lowenthal, Co-Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer, ARS Pharmaceuticals. \"Epinephrine treatment is only effective if available, readily usable, and administered appropriately.\"\n\nThe approval of neffy is based on four studies involving 175 healthy adults without anaphylaxis. These studies compared the blood concentrations of epinephrine after using neffy to those after using approved epinephrine injection products. The results showed comparable epinephrine levels in the blood, as well as similar increases in blood pressure and heart rate -- critical effects in treating anaphylaxis.\n\nFor children weighing more than 66 pounds, a separate study demonstrated that epinephrine concentrations were similar to those in adults who received neffy.\n\nAs with injectable epinephrine products, a second dose of neffy may be administered if symptoms don't improve or worsen. However, patients should still seek emergency medical assistance for close monitoring and potential further treatment -- the same as with injectable epinephrine.\n\nIt's important to note that neffy comes with certain warnings. People with nasal conditions like polyps or a history of nasal surgery should consult a healthcare professional, as these conditions may affect the absorption of the medication. Additionally, the product includes warnings about use in people with certain coexisting conditions and potential allergic reactions to sulfites.\n\nCommon side effects of Neffy include throat irritation, nasal discomfort, headache and feeling jittery, among others.\n\nNeffy is expected to be available within eight weeks of FDA approval, the manufacturer said, and is expected to cost around $25 for those with insurance for two single-use neffy devices via a co-pay savings program.\n\nExperts believe neffy will expand access to epinephrine, making it more available for use in areas where accidental exposures happen, like at restaurants, on airplanes and at hotels. \"This is a win for the food allergy community,\" said Sung Poblete, Ph.D., RN, CEO of FARE, a nonprofit organization dedicated to supporting those with food allergies.\n\nThe FDA's approval of neffy marks a significant step forward in allergy treatment, especially for those with a fear of injections.\n\n\"Anyone who has experienced or witnessed an anaphylaxis reaction knows it can be very stressful deciding when to inject epinephrine to themselves or a child and often delay,\" said Dr. Jonathan Spergel, Chief of the Allergy Program at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, in a statement. \"We know that earlier administration is better, and for many, the needle is a barrier that causes dangerous hesitation. That is why the field has long pursued an effective treatment approach that does not require an injection.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenaline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adrenaline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Injection (medicine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaphylaxis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anaphylaxis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Allergy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_spray", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nasal spray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pulmonology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epinephrine_autoinjector", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Epinephrine autoinjector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doctor of Medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_medicine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Intensive care medicine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doctor of Philosophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostril", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nostril"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human nose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blood pressure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anxiety"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heart rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Side effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Substance_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Health/Addictions/Substance Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Teen_Health/Drugs_and_Alcohol", "label": "dmoz/Health/Teen Health/Drugs and Alcohol", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/gI.ie.ymQRVeRVtRfmmn4A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/motherly_353/01def3a4794c80824d8a38623d24c383", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9805036", "eventUri": "eng-9805036", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

Common symptoms include hives, swelling, itching, vomiting and difficulty breathing.\n\nThe device, marketed as Neffy, could upend treatment for the 33 million to 45 million Americans with severe allergies to food and other triggers. Anaphylaxis sends more than 30,000 people to emergency rooms and results in more than 2,000 hospitalizations and more than 230 deaths in the U.S. each year.\n\nOf the 6 million prescriptions written for auto-injectors each year, more than 40% are never filled, Dr. Thomas Casale, an allergist at the University of South Florida, told an FDA advisory panel last year. Even when they are available to caregivers, many auto-injectors are used incorrectly, he said.\n\n\"There's a real unmet medical need for a large portion of the population,\" he said.\n\nNeffy is intended for people who weigh at least 66 pounds. It is given in a single dose sprayed into one nostril. A second dose can be given if the person's symptoms don't improve.\n\nThe new treatment could be life-changing for people with severe food allergies, said Dr. Kelly Cleary, a pediatrician and director with the Food Allergy Research & Education, a nonprofit advocacy group.\n\n\"I have seen the look of worry or fear,\" said Cleary, whose 11-year-old son has multiple food allergies. \"I worry about what happens if someone hesitates.\"\n\nRequiring an injection in an emergency is as scary to some children as the allergic reaction itself. Some parents have had to restrain thrashing children to inject them, sometimes causing cuts that require stitches. About 3,500 caregivers a year are injured when they accidentally inject themselves in the hands, ARS said.\n\nPriscilla Hernandez, of Pasadena, California said her 12-year-old son, Zacky, who is allergic to sesame, peanuts, tree nuts, avocado and other foods, was traumatized when he had a reaction at school about six years ago and a nurse treated him with an auto-injector.\n\n\"Having to do a shot creates this whole different level of anxiety,\" she said.\n\nShe said, \"we are over the moon\" about the FDA's approval of the spray, which Zacky will start carrying when it becomes available.\n\nFirst marketed in 1901, epinephrine predates the FDA itself. Products like the EpiPen auto-injector, approved in 1987, were authorized based on chemistry and manufacturing data and were not required to prove safety and efficacy.\n\nClinical trials of people experiencing potentially deadly reactions are difficult for ethical and pragmatic reasons. Instead, ARS officials compared the effect of the nasal spray on biological markers to existing epinephrine treatments.\n\nResults showed Neffy worked about as well as injected epinephrine to boost heart rate and blood pressure, which counter severe reactions. The drug is combined with a patented agent that allows it to be easily absorbed through nasal membranes.\n\nOther needle-free epinephrine devices are being developed to treat allergic reactions. In the pipeline are nasal sprays from Bryn Pharma, of North Carolina, and Nausus Pharma, of Israel; a needle-free auto-injector from Crossject of France; and an epinephrine film that is administered under the tongue from Aquestive Therapeutics, of New Jersey.\n\nNeffy is designed to be easy to carry and easy to use, especially for children, said Richard Lowenthal, president and chief executive of San Diego-based ARS.\n\n\"We don't want fear.

It's administered as a single dose sprayed into one nostril. A second dose may be given if needed, similar to injectable epinephrine, the agency said.\n\nNeffy uses the same spray device as Narcan, the naloxone nasal spray for opioid overdose, according to a spokesperson for its maker, ARS Pharmaceuticals.\n\n\"Anaphylaxis is life-threatening and some people, particularly children, may delay or avoid treatment due to fear of injections,\" said Dr. Kelly Stone, associate director of the Division of Pulmonology, Allergy and Critical Care in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. \"The availability of epinephrine nasal spray may reduce barriers to rapid treatment of anaphylaxis.\"\n\nThe approval was based on studies in 175 healthy adults measuring concentrations of epinephrine in the blood, which showed comparable levels for Neffy and injected epinephrine, as well as similar increases in blood pressure and heart rate. A study in children weighing more than 66 pounds found comparable epinephrine levels to those in adults.\n\nThe drug had been expected to be approved last year, but was delayed as the FDA sought more information about repeat dosing. The FDA said Friday that patients may need to seek emergency medical assistance for close monitoring after experiencing anaphylaxis, and in case further treatment is needed. It's also recommended patients who get injectable epinephrine seek immediate emergency care.\n\nThe FDA noted people who have nasal conditions like nasal polyps or who have had nasal surgery may not absorb Neffy sufficiently and should talk with a health-care provider about whether an injectable epinephrine would be better for them.\n\nThe agency said the most common side effects of Neffy include throat irritation, tingling nose, headache, nasal discomfort and feeling jittery, among others.\n\nAnaphylaxis is most often causedby reactions to medication, foods or insect stings, according to the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology. Symptoms, which typically start within five to 30 minutes of contact with an allergen, include hives, swelling of the throat and other areas, wheezing and passing out.\n\n\"Anyone who has experienced or witnessed an anaphylaxis reaction knows it can be very stressful deciding when to inject epinephrine to themselves or a child and often delay,\" Dr. Jonathan Spergel, chief of the allergy program at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said in a news release from ARS Pharmaceuticals. \"We know that earlier administration is better, and for many, the needle is a barrier that causes dangerous hesitation. That is why the field has long pursued an effective treatment approach that does not require an injection.\"\n\nARS Pharmaceuticals didn't disclose the list price of Neffy - how much it costs before insurance or other discounts - in its news release Friday. It said that for patients with commercial insurance that covers the drug, the price out of pocket would be no more than $25 for two single-use devices, via a co-pay program. For certain patients without insurance coverage or who face high out-of-pocket costs, the company said the price would be $199 for two doses of Neffy. For other patients who can't afford the medicine, the company said it would provide Neffy for free.\n\nThe medicine is expected to be available in the United States within eight weeks, ARS said. The company also noted it plans to file for FDA approval of Neffy for children who weigh between 15 and 30 kg (33 to 66 pounds) by the end of the third quarter of this year, or before October.\n\nThe storm surge brought by Tropical Storm Debby washed away almost 100 sea turtle nests on Anna Maria Island.

Common symptoms include hives, swelling, itching, vomiting and difficulty breathing.\n\nThe device, marketed as Neffy, could upend treatment for the 33 million to 45 million Americans with severe allergies to food and other triggers. Anaphylaxis sends more than 30,000 people to emergency rooms and results in more than 2,000 hospitalizations and more than 230 deaths in the U.S. each year.\n\nOf the 6 million prescriptions written for auto-injectors each year, more than 40% are never filled, Dr. Thomas Casale, an allergist at the University of South Florida, told an FDA advisory panel last year. Even when they are available to caregivers, many auto-injectors are used incorrectly, he said.\n\n\"There's a real unmet medical need for a large portion of the population,\" he said.\n\nNeffy is intended for people who weigh at least 66 pounds. It is given in a single dose sprayed into one nostril. A second dose can be given if the person's symptoms don't improve.\n\nThe new treatment could be life-changing for people with severe food allergies, said Dr. Kelly Cleary, a pediatrician and director with the Food Allergy Research & Education, a nonprofit advocacy group.\n\n\"I have seen the look of worry or fear,\" said Cleary, whose 11-year-old son has multiple food allergies. \"I worry about what happens if someone hesitates.\"\n\nRequiring an injection in an emergency is as scary to some children as the allergic reaction itself. Some parents have had to restrain thrashing children to inject them, sometimes causing cuts that require stitches. About 3,500 caregivers a year are injured when they accidentally inject themselves in the hands, ARS said.\n\nPriscilla Hernandez, of Pasadena, California said her 12-year-old son, Zacky, who is allergic to sesame, peanuts, tree nuts, avocado and other foods, was traumatized when he had a reaction at school about six years ago and a nurse treated him with an auto-injector.\n\n\"Having to do a shot creates this whole different level of anxiety,\" she said.\n\nShe said, \"we are over the moon\" about the FDA's approval of the spray, which Zacky will start carrying when it becomes available.\n\nFirst marketed in 1901, epinephrine predates the FDA itself.

Instead, ARS officials compared the effect of the nasal spray on biological markers to existing epinephrine treatments.\n\nResults showed Neffy worked about as well as injected epinephrine to boost heart rate and blood pressure, which counter severe reactions. The drug is combined with a patented agent that allows it to be easily absorbed through nasal membranes.\n\nOther needle-free epinephrine devices are being developed to treat allergic reactions. In the pipeline are nasal sprays from Bryn Pharma, of North Carolina, and Nausus Pharma, of Israel; a needle-free auto-injector from Crossject of France; and an epinephrine film that is administered under the tongue from Aquestive Therapeutics, of New Jersey.\n\nNeffy is designed to be easy to carry and easy to use, especially for children, said Richard Lowenthal, president and chief executive of San Diego-based ARS.\n\n\"We don't want fear.

It's given as a single dose sprayed into one nostril. A second dose may be given if needed, similar to injectable epinephrine, the agency said.\n\nNeffy uses the same spray device as Narcan, the naloxone nasal spray for opioid overdose, according to a spokesperson for its maker, ARS Pharmaceuticals.\n\n\"Anaphylaxis is life-threatening and some people, particularly children, may delay or avoid treatment due to fear of injections,\" said Dr. Kelly Stone, associate director of the Division of Pulmonology, Allergy and Critical Care in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a news release. \"The availability of epinephrine nasal spray may reduce barriers to rapid treatment of anaphylaxis.\"\n\nThe approval was based on studies in 175 healthy adults measuring concentrations of epinephrine in the blood, which showed comparable levels for Neffy and injected epinephrine, as well as similar increases in blood pressure and heart rate. A study in children weighing more than 66 pounds found comparable epinephrine levels to those in adults.\n\nThe drug had been expected to be approved last year, but that was delayed as the FDA sought more information about repeat dosing. The agency said Friday that patients may need to seek emergency medical assistance for close monitoring after experiencing anaphylaxis, and in case further treatment is needed. It's also recommended that patients who get injectable epinephrine seek immediate emergency care.\n\nThe FDA noted that people who have nasal conditions like polyps or who have had nasal surgery may not absorb Neffy sufficiently and should talk with a health-care provider about whether an injectable epinephrine would be better for them.\n\nThe most common side effects of Neffy include throat irritation, tingling nose, headache, nasal discomfort and feeling jittery, the FDA says.\n\nAnaphylaxis is most often caused by reactions to medication, foods or insect stings, according to the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology. Symptoms, which typically start within five to 30 minutes of contact with an allergen, include hives, swelling of the throat and other areas, wheezing and passing out.\n\n\"Anyone who has experienced or witnessed an anaphylaxis reaction knows it can be very stressful deciding when to inject epinephrine to themselves or a child and often delay,\" Dr. Jonathan Spergel, chief of the allergy program at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said in a news release from ARS Pharmaceuticals. \"We know that earlier administration is better, and for many, the needle is a barrier that causes dangerous hesitation. That is why the field has long pursued an effective treatment approach that does not require an injection.\"\n\nARS Pharmaceuticals didn't disclose the list price of Neffy - how much it costs before insurance or other discounts - in its news release Friday.\n\nThe company's CEO, Richard Lowenthal, told CNN that the list price would be shared Monday on a call with financial analysts and investors. However, he noted that the price to insurers would be similar to that of an epinephrine autoinjector called Auvi-Q, which analyst Tim Lugo of financial firm William Blair noted was about $640. Lowenthal noted, though, that Neffy's shelf life is longer: 30 months, compared with 18 months for autoinjectors.\n\nARS Pharmaceuticals said that for people with commercial insurance that covers the drug, the price out of pocket would be no more than $25 for two single-use devices, via a co-pay program. For certain people who don't have insurance coverage or who face high out-of-pocket costs, the company said, the price would be $199 for two doses of Neffy. For other those who can't afford the medicine, the company said it would provide it for free.\n\nThe medicine is expected to be available in the United States within eight weeks, ARS said. Lowenthal said it had manufactured several lots in anticipation of approval and is in the process of scaling up to be able to meet anticipated demand.\n\nHe said the company's market research suggests that there are 3.2 million people \"that really hate those autoinjectors, children that are terrified of needles,\" who are going to \"switch very quickly\" to the nasal spray and that an additional 3.3 million people have had prescriptions written for injectable epinephrine but who haven't filled them and may switch, as well.\n\nARS also believes that another 13.5 million people have been diagnosed with anaphylaxis who have never received a prescription, Lowenthal said, \"and now there's a safer, easier-to-use alternative - needle-free, pain-free - they'll be able to also protect themselves.\"\n\nUltimately, Lowenthal expects an uptake of Neffy similar to nasal-spray naloxone, or Narcan, which he said accounts for 80% of use of the opioid-overdose reversal drug. He said his team has talked with companies that make emergency kits for airplanes, and the medicine could also be stocked in public places like restaurants.\n\nThe FDA, Lowenthal noted, asked ARS to run studies of the drug using \"passerbys,\" \"somebody we pull off the street who has no idea about this product, no idea about the disease.\"\n\nThose participants were put in a simulated experiment as if they were in a restaurant with another patron experiencing a severe allergic reaction, and they had to read the instructions and administer the drug, Lowenthal said.\n\n\"One hundred percent of them did it right without any instructions, training, nothing,\" he said.\n\nThe company also plans to file for FDA approval of Neffy for children who weigh between 15 and 30 kilograms (33 and 66 pounds) by the end of the third quarter of this year, or before October. Lowenthal said that would be a lower dose, similar to how EpiPen comes in a lower dose for smaller children.\n\n\"The allergy community has been waiting for this and happy to see the FDA approved it,\" said Dr. Purvi Parikh, an immunologist and allergist in New York who isn't affiliated with ARS Pharmaceuticals.\n\n\"It's super important because there are a lot of needle-phobic patients who won't use their EpiPens in critical situations,\" including children and their caregivers, she said.\n\n\"Similar to Narcan,\" she added, \"this will save lives.\"\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 CNN.

The injection is commonly referred to by its brand name EpiPen, which is owned by Pennsylvania-based Mylan Inc. Generic versions also are available.\n\nThe new nasal spray is being dubbed Neffy by the FDA and was developed by ARS Pharmaceuticals.\n\nThe California-based company said one of the reasons behind the treatment was to make epinephrine more accessible to patients, particularly those with trouble using injection drugs.\n\n\"Our nasal spray may help reduce hesitation and allow patients to confidently administer when needed,\" the company says on its website.\n\nA Type I allergic reaction or Type I hypersensitivity is \"an immediate reaction and involves immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated release of antibodies against the soluble antigen. This results in mast cell degranulation and release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators,\" according to a National Institutes of Health definition.\n\nThe cause of the reaction is exposure to various types of antigen or foreign substance.\n\nCommon antigens can include food and nut allergies, as well as bee, wasp or other insect stings and bites.\n\nLike the injection, Neffy is a single-use treatment and the spray is administered into one nostril. Patients may require further medical treatment at a hospital or other care facility depending on the severity of their allergic reaction.\n\n\"Today's approval provides the first epinephrine product for the treatment of anaphylaxis that is not administered by injection.

It was greenlighted through one of the FDA's drug expedition processes.\n\nAnaphylaxis occurs when the body goes into shock from a massive allergic reaction. Blood pressure rapidly drops, heart rate increases, airways constrict, and swelling can occur in the upper airways -- all of which can potentially lead to death.\n\nEpinephrine, which reverses most anaphylactic symptoms by increasing blood pressure, opening the airways, and reducing swelling, is the first-line treatment for this condition.\n\nHowever, all epinephrine products currently approved to treat anaphylaxis are administered by injection, like EpiPens, which can be painful.\n\n\"The availability of epinephrine nasal spray may reduce barriers to rapid treatment of anaphylaxis. As a result, neffy provides an important treatment option and addresses an unmet need.\"\n\nNeffy is a single-dose nasal spray administered into one nostril. If symptoms worsen or do not improve, a second dose through the same nostril may be given.\n\nPatients may need to seek emergency medical assistance for close monitoring if further treatment is required. Nasal polyps or a history of nasal surgery may slow the absorption of neffy.\n\nThe studies showed that, following neffy administration, people had a significantly higher concentration of epinephrine in the blood and that the rise was comparable to other epinephrine injection drugs.\n\nNeffy also demonstrated similar physiological effects, with a comparable rise in blood pressure and heart rate as other epinephrine injection products. Both blood pressure and heart rate are critical in the treatment of anaphylaxis.\n\nNeffy may alter the inside lining of the nose for up to two weeks after administration and increase absorption of nasal products, including neffy.\n\nThe company said the product should be administered with caution for those with heart disease, as epinephrine may aggravate chest pain and cause abnormal heartbeats in the ventricles of the heart. Irregular heartbeats, including fatal variants, have been reported, particularly in patients with underlying cardiac disease or those taking cardiac glycosides, diuretics, which encourage urine production, and drugs that help control arrhythmias.\n\nPatients with certain medical conditions or who take specific medications for allergies, depression, thyroid disorders, diabetes, and hypertension may be at greater risk for adverse reactions, ARS Pharmaceuticals said.\n\nCommon side effects of neffy include throat irritation, tingling nose, headache, nasal discomfort, feeling jittery, tingling sensations, fatigue, tremor, runny nose, itchiness inside the nose, abdominal pain, gum pain, numbness in the mouth, nasal congestion, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting.\n\nExcess epinephrine drugs can cause rapid heart rate, hypertension, anxiety, palpitations, sweating, weakness, vomiting, and tremors.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.theepochtimes.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Men's_Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Men's Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Dentistry/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Health/Dentistry/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Senses/Touch_and_Sensation", "label": "dmoz/Health/Senses/Touch and Sensation", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/04/08/id5624245-fda-eet-10.13-LSedit-1080x720.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9805036", "eventUri": "eng-9805036", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

Please try again later.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved a nasal spray for serious allergic reactions to food, medications and insect stings, marking the first needle-free treatment for such conditions.\n\nThe epinephrine nasal spray is administered as a single dose in one nostril and will serve as a critical alternative to treating emergency allergic reactions without an injection, the agency said.\n\nThe two-milligram spray, called Neffy, is designed to block allergic reactions, including a serious condition called anaphylaxis, which can happen within seconds or minutes of being exposed to an allergen.\n\nThe decision introduces an alternative to auto-injector devices such as the EpiPen for blocking severe allergic reactions. It also vindicates the approach of Neffy manufacturer ARS Pharmaceuticals, which pitched its product as a superior way of treating anaphylaxis that overcomes people's hesitation to inject themselves or someone else. Anaphylaxis can cause constriction of the airways, plummeting blood pressure and a racing pulse.\n\n\"Anaphylaxis is life-threatening and some people, particularly children, may delay or avoid treatment due to fear of injections,\" Kelly Stone, FDA's associate director of the Division of Pulmonology, Allergy and Critical Care, said in a statement.\n\nRichard Lowenthal, CEO of ARS, said in a statement Friday that \"this approval marks a watershed moment in addressing an unmet medical need\" for people with severe allergies. Neffy, Lowenthal said, \"avoids the need to inject epinephrine with a needle, which can be fraught with anxiety and fear for many.\"\n\nARS shares surged on the news Friday and were up about 10 percent in midday trading. The company didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe approval comes nearly a year after the FDA surprised ARS by requesting an additional study before making a decision. A panel of outside experts, convened by the FDA, had previously endorsed Neffy, voting 16-6 in favor of approving the drug for adults and 17-5 for children weighing at least 66 pounds.\n\nStill, the committee acknowledged some uncertainty because of a lack of clinical data. While epinephrine has been used for more than a century, it had never before been subjected to the FDA's exhaustive process to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. ARS, based in San Diego, brought together executives who previously had developed Narcan, the nasal spray used to revive people from opioid overdoses.\n\nAn ARS executive once quipped that Neffy would \"make the current needle injectors as dated a technology as the flip phone.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rachel_roubein@washingtonpost.com", "name": "Rachel Roubein", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "daniel_gilbert@washingtonpost.com", "name": "Daniel Gilbert", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_spray", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nasal spray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaphylaxis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anaphylaxis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Allergy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenaline", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adrenaline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostril", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nostril"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Respiratory tract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasoconstriction", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vasoconstriction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulmonology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pulmonology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pulse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epinephrine_autoinjector", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Epinephrine autoinjector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Allergen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blood pressure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naloxone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Naloxone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_overdose", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drug overdose"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opioid", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Opioid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anxiety"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Biotechnology_and_Pharmaceuticals", "label": "dmoz/Business/Biotechnology and Pharmaceuticals", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Biotechnology_and_Pharmaceuticals/Pharmaceuticals", "label": "dmoz/Business/Biotechnology and Pharmaceuticals/Pharmaceuticals", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs_and_Medications", "label": "dmoz/Health/Pharmacy/Drugs and Medications", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Allergies", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Allergies", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 48}], "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PSSFBLTDBZRV5NBZAEUAUPJN4A.jpg&w=1440", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9805036", "eventUri": "eng-9805036", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

U.S. health regulators on Monday, July 29, 2024, approved a first-of-its-kind blood test for colon cancer, offering a new way of screening for a leading cause of cancer deaths. Test manufacturer Guardant said the Food and Drug Administration approved its Shield test for screening in adults 45 and older who have an average risk of colon cancer.\n\nU.S. health officials on Friday approved a nasal spray to treat severe allergic reactions, the first needle-free alternative to shots like EpiPen.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration said it approved the spray from drugmaker ARS Pharmaceuticals Inc. as an emergency treatment for adults and older children experiencing life-threatening allergic reactions known as anaphylaxis.\n\nAnaphylaxis occurs when the body's immune system develops a sudden, unexpected reaction to a foreign substance, such as food, insect stings or medications. Common symptoms include hives, swelling, itching, vomiting and difficulty breathing.\n\nThe device, marketed as Neffy, could upend treatment for the 33 million to 45 million Americans with severe allergies to food and other triggers. Anaphylaxis sends more than 30,000 people to emergency rooms and results in more than 2,000 hospitalizations and more than 230 deaths in the U.S. each year.\n\nOf the 6 million prescriptions written for auto-injectors each year, more than 40% are never filled, Dr. Thomas Casale, an allergist at the University of South Florida, told an FDA advisory panel last year. Even when they are available to caregivers, many auto-injectors are used incorrectly, he said.\n\n\"There's a real unmet medical need for a large portion of the population,\" he said.\n\nNeffy is intended for people who weigh at least 66 pounds. It is given in a single dose sprayed into one nostril. A second dose can be given if the person's symptoms don't improve.\n\nThe new treatment could be life-changing for people with severe food allergies, said Dr. Kelly Cleary, a pediatrician and director with the Food Allergy Research & Education, a nonprofit advocacy group.\n\n\"I have seen the look of worry or fear,\" said Cleary, whose 11-year-old son has multiple food allergies. \"I worry about what happens if someone hesitates.\"\n\nRequiring an injection in an emergency is as scary to some children as the allergic reaction itself. Some parents have had to restrain thrashing children to inject them, sometimes causing cuts that require stitches. About 3,500 caregivers a year are injured when they accidentally inject themselves in the hands, ARS said.\n\nPriscilla Hernandez, of Pasadena, California said her 12-year-old son, Zacky, who is allergic to sesame, peanuts, tree nuts, avocado and other foods, was traumatized when he had a reaction at school about six years ago and a nurse treated him with an auto-injector.\n\n\"Having to do a shot creates this whole different level of anxiety,\" she said.\n\nShe said, \"we are over the moon\" about the FDA's approval of the spray, which Zacky will start carrying when it becomes available.\n\nFirst marketed in 1901, epinephrine predates the FDA itself. Products like the EpiPen auto-injector, approved in 1987, were authorized based on chemistry and manufacturing data and were not required to prove safety and efficacy.\n\nClinical trials of people experiencing potentially deadly reactions are difficult for ethical and pragmatic reasons. Instead, ARS officials compared the effect of the nasal spray on biological markers to existing epinephrine treatments.\n\nResults showed Neffy worked about as well as injected epinephrine to boost heart rate and blood pressure, which counter severe reactions. The drug is combined with a patented agent that allows it to be easily absorbed through nasal membranes.\n\nOther needle-free epinephrine devices are being developed to treat allergic reactions. In the pipeline are nasal sprays from Bryn Pharma, of North Carolina, and Nausus Pharma, of Israel; a needle-free auto-injector from Crossject of France; and an epinephrine film that is administered under the tongue from Aquestive Therapeutics, of New Jersey.\n\nNeffy is designed to be easy to carry and easy to use, especially for children, said Richard Lowenthal, president and chief executive of San Diego-based ARS.\n\n\"We don't want fear. There's no needle, there's no pain with this product,\" he said. \"It's basically like spraying saline into your nose.\"\n\nNeffy will come in packs of two and is expected to cost about the same as a two-pack of auto-injectors, around $300 to $700. Lowenthal said he hoped insurance companies would cover the cost to patients for a low co-pay amount.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

It's for adults, and for children who weigh at least 66 pounds, who have what are known as type 1 allergic reactions, which include the potentially life-threatening condition called anaphylaxis. Signs are trouble breathing or swallowing, skin symptoms like hives and swelling, stomach problems like cramps or nausea, and heart issues like a drop in blood pressure and rapid heartbeat.\n\nAllergic reactions are triggered by an abnormal immune system response, usually to something like foodor medication, or from an insect sting. Until now, the only treatment for anaphylaxis was an epinephrine shot in the thigh, usually through an automatic injector pen like the EpiPen. Up to 2% of people in the U.S. are estimated to have a lifetime chance of having anaphylaxis.\n\nNeffy is taken as a single dose sprayed into one nostril, and a combination of four studies among 175 healthy adults showed the product could achieve a blood epinephrine level similar to what you'd get from a shot, as well as a similar increase in blood pressure and heart rate. In a study of children weighing more than 66 pounds, blood concentration levels after taking neffy were similar to levels seen in adults who used the product.\n\nWhen a person's blood pressure drops too low, they can go into anaphylactic shock, and swollen bronchial tissue can lead to loss of consciousness. Life-saving treatment is needed right away in cases of anaphylactic shock.\n\nPeople with some nasal conditions or a history of nasal surgery should talk to a health care professional about whether they should use neffy, the FDA advised, and the product also may not be safe for some people with certain other conditions or sulfite allergies.\n\nNo announcement has been made by neffy maker ARS Pharma as to when the product will likely be available in the U.S., but the company announced recently that it's expected to be available in Europe by the end of this year. There was also no word on how much neffy will cost.\n\nA previous announcement from ARS Pharma about its efforts to get neffy FDA-approved emphasized the importance of offering a needle-free treatment option.\n\n\"While epinephrine autoinjectors have been shown to be highly effective, there are well published limitations that result in many patients and caregivers delaying or not administering treatment in an emergency situation,\" the company said.", "source": {"uri": "medscape.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Medscape"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenaline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adrenaline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_spray", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nasal spray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaphylaxis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anaphylaxis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Allergy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortness_of_breath", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shortness of breath"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swallowing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swallowing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edema", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edema"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotension", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hypotension"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachycardia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tachycardia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cramp", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cramp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nausea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stomach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stomach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Skin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Immune system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_pressure", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Blood pressure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epinephrine_autoinjector", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Epinephrine autoinjector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thigh", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Thigh"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Wounds_and_Injuries", "label": "dmoz/Health/Conditions and Diseases/Wounds and Injuries", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Health", "label": "news/Health", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://img.medscapestatic.com/vim/live/professional_assets/medscape/images/thumbnail_library/ht_240809_neffy_device_2mg_800x450.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9805036", "eventUri": "eng-9805036", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

(NASDAQ:SPRY) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved neffy\u00ae, the first new delivery method for epinephrine in over three decades, designed to treat severe allergic reactions in adults and children weighing at least 30 kg (66 lbs.). This needle-free nasal spray offers a new option for those at risk of anaphylaxis, a potentially life-threatening condition triggered by allergies to foods, medications, or insect bites.\n\nThe approval of neffy comes as a significant advancement in allergy treatment, providing a less intimidating alternative to the traditional epinephrine auto-injector. According to Professor Thomas B. Casale from the University of South Florida, the ease of use and needle-free administration may lead to quicker treatment during allergic reactions, improving clinical outcomes and quality of life for patients and their caregivers.\n\nClinical trials have demonstrated neffy's efficacy, with pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data aligning with those of approved injectable epinephrine products. The trials, which included various patient groups such as children and individuals with allergic rhinitis, reported no serious adverse events and only mild side effects.\n\nARS Pharma is committed to making neffy accessible, with patient support programs designed to limit out-of-pocket expenses for commercially insured patients to $25 for two doses. Uninsured patients and those without coverage for neffy can purchase two doses for $199 through digital pharmacy services like BlinkRx and GoodRx.\n\nThe company also offers a Patient Assistance Program (PAP) for eligible individuals who are uninsured or underinsured, providing neffy at no cost. ARS Pharma anticipates that most payors will establish coverage policies within the next six months, during which time the neffyconnect program will aid healthcare professionals and patients in accessing financial support and medication fulfillment services.\n\nNeffy is expected to be available in the U.S. within eight weeks following FDA approval, with ARS Pharma planning to submit a supplemental NDA for children between 15 to\n\nIn other recent news, ARS Pharmaceuticals has received a positive opinion from the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use for the marketing of EURneffy\u00ae, a needle-free adrenaline nasal spray for emergency treatment of severe allergic reactions. The final marketing authorization process by the European Commission is expected in the third quarter of 2024. The product, which demonstrated efficacy in a data package involving over 700 participants and more than 1,200 administrations, is anticipated to be available in Europe in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nIn other company news, ARS Pharmaceuticals' shareholders elected three Class I directors and ratified Ernst & Young LLP as the independent auditor for the current fiscal year. The company has also responded to regulatory concerns from both the European Medicines Agency and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration regarding its epinephrine nasal spray, neffy\u00ae. These are the latest developments in the company's operations.\n\nAs ARS Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:SPRY) heralds the FDA's nod for its innovative needle-free epinephrine nasal spray, neffy\u00ae, the company's financial health and market performance provide additional context for investors. SPRY holds a notable position with more cash than debt on its balance sheet, indicating a solid liquidity position that could support the upcoming commercialization efforts for neffy. Moreover, analysts have a positive outlook on the company's sales growth in the current year, aligning with the expected product launches and expanded market access.\n\nInvestingPro data shows a substantial revenue growth of 128.31% over the last twelve months as of Q2 2024, which may reflect investor optimism about the company's growth trajectory. Despite not being profitable over the last twelve months, with a reported gross profit margin of -3913.2%, the company's liquid assets exceed its short-term obligations, suggesting it has the financial resilience to navigate through its growth phase. Additionally, the stock has been trading near its 52-week high, with a price 92.52% of this peak, which could indicate market confidence in the company's prospects.\n\nInvestingPro Tips highlight that while SPRY is not expected to be profitable this year, its trajectory is marked by a large price uptick over the last six months, demonstrating significant investor interest. These insights, along with numerous additional tips available on InvestingPro, provide a more comprehensive view of ARS Pharma's potential in the wake of neffy's approval.", "source": {"uri": "uk.investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrenaline", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adrenaline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medication", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Medication"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agricultural_Research_Service", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Agricultural Research Service"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaphylaxis", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Anaphylaxis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Food and Drug Administration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergy", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Allergy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_spray", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nasal spray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allergic_rhinitis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Allergic rhinitis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacodynamics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pharmacodynamics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Efficacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Injection (medicine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacokinetics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pharmacokinetics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_South_Florida", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of South Florida"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_life", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quality of life"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Clinical trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marketing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_event", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adverse event"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_drug_application", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New drug application"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Side effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_professional", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Health professional"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_for_Medicinal_Products_for_Human_Use", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pharmacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Biotechnology_and_Pharmaceuticals/Pharmaceuticals", "label": "dmoz/Business/Biotechnology and Pharmaceuticals/Pharmaceuticals", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Pharmacy", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Pharmacy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Specific_Substances/Tobacco", "label": "dmoz/Health/Specific Substances/Tobacco", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Conditions_and_Diseases", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Health/Conditions and Diseases", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/redesign/images/seo/investing_300X300.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9805036", "eventUri": "eng-9805036", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

(Nasdaq: SPRY), a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to empowering at-risk patients and caregivers to better protect themselves from severe allergic reactions that could lead to anaphylaxis, today reported business highlights and financial results for the second quarter of 2024.\n\n\"Thanks to the diligent work by the entire ARS team, we believe we are in the final steps with FDA, with draft physician labeling in hand and commercial readiness efforts well underway to support the successful launch of neffy upon FDA approval,\" stated Richard Lowenthal, Co-founder, President, and CEO of ARS Pharma. \"We are also greatly encouraged by the EMA's CHMP positive opinion adopted for EURneffy and are in advanced discussions to select a pharmaceutical partner with a strong commercial infrastructure who will launch EURneffy in Europe. Importantly, our robust balance sheet provides us with a multi-year operating runway that supports our planned neffy commercialization activities in the U.S. We are well positioned to bring this treatment to the millions of patients living with Type I allergies, including anaphylaxis, and their dedicated caregivers, who we believe are in dire need of a needle-free, safe, effective, and easy-to-carry epinephrine treatment solution.\"\n\nAbout Type I Allergic Reactions including Anaphylaxis\n\nType I severe allergic reactions are serious and potentially life-threatening events that can occur within minutes of exposure to an allergen and require immediate treatment with epinephrine, the only FDA-approved medication for these reactions. While epinephrine autoinjectors have been shown to be highly effective, there are well published limitations that result in many patients and caregivers delaying or not administering treatment in an emergency situation. These limitations include fear of the needle, lack of portability, needle-related safety concerns, lack of reliability, and complexity of the devices. There are approximately 40 million people in the United States who experience Type I severe allergic reactions. Of this group, over the last three years, approximately 20 million people have been diagnosed and experienced severe Type I allergic reactions that may lead to anaphylaxis, but (in 2023, for example) only 3.2 million filled their active epinephrine autoinjector prescription, and of those, only half consistently carry their prescribed autoinjector. Even if patients or caregivers carry an autoinjector, more than half either delay or do not administer the device when needed in an emergency.\n\nAbout Urticaria\n\nUrticaria is a skin disorder that causes itchy hives and/or angioedema with an annualized incidence of 5 million in the United States, with about 40% becoming chronic urticaria; 50% of chronic urticaria cases are non-responsive to first-line antihistamine therapy. These non-responsive patients on stable therapy regimens can experience exacerbations or flares several times a year among acute cases, and even several times a week, including up to three or four emergency room visits per year. Angioedema is also a co-occurring symptom in about 33 to 67% of these patients. There are currently no approved community use treatments for acute flares experienced by urticaria patients on chronic regimens of antihistamines. ARS Pharma is investigating neffy for episodic symptomatic relief of these acute flares or exacerbations to improve the quality of life of urticaria patients. If neffy is approved for this indication, patients would have the option to quickly resolve exacerbations or flares at home without escalating to chronic use of systemic biologics that may have more serious side effects and benefit-risk considerations or visiting the emergency room for further treatment.\n\nAbout ARS Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\n\nARS Pharma is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to empowering at-risk patients and caregivers to better protect themselves from severe allergic reactions that could lead to anaphylaxis. The Company is developing neffy (also referred to as ARS-1), an intranasal epinephrine product in clinical development for patients and their caregivers with Type I allergic reactions including food, medications and insect bites that could lead to life-threatening anaphylaxis.

Even when they are available to caregivers, many auto-injectors are used incorrectly, he said.\n\n\"There's a real unmet medical need for a large portion of the population,\" he said.\n\nNeffy is intended for people who weigh at least 66 pounds. It is given in a single dose sprayed into one nostril. A second dose can be given if the person's symptoms don't improve.\n\nThe new treatment could be life-changing for people with severe food allergies, said Dr. Kelly Cleary, a pediatrician and director with the Food Allergy Research & Education, a nonprofit advocacy group.\n\n\"I have seen the look of worry or fear,\" said Cleary, whose 11-year-old son has multiple food allergies. \"I worry about what happens if someone hesitates.\"\n\nRequiring an injection in an emergency is as scary to some children as the allergic reaction itself. Some parents have had to restrain thrashing children to inject them, sometimes causing cuts that require stitches. About 3,500 caregivers a year are injured when they accidentally inject themselves in the hands, ARS said.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nPriscilla Hernandez, of Pasadena, California said her 12-year-old son, Zacky, who is allergic to sesame, peanuts, tree nuts, avocado and other foods, was traumatized when he had a reaction at school about six years ago and a nurse treated him with an auto-injector.\n\n\"Having to do a shot creates this whole different level of anxiety,\" she said.\n\nShe said, \"we are over the moon\" about the FDA's approval of the spray, which Zacky will start carrying when it becomes available.\n\nFirst marketed in 1901, epinephrine predates the FDA itself. Products like the EpiPen auto-injector, approved in 1987, were authorized based on chemistry and manufacturing data and were not required to prove safety and efficacy.\n\nClinical trials of people experiencing potentially deadly reactions are difficult for ethical and pragmatic reasons. Instead, ARS officials compared the effect of the nasal spray on biological markers to existing epinephrine treatments.\n\nResults showed Neffy worked about as well as injected epinephrine to boost heart rate and blood pressure, which counter severe reactions. The drug is combined with a patented agent that allows it to be easily absorbed through nasal membranes.\n\nOther needle-free epinephrine devices are being developed to treat allergic reactions. In the pipeline are nasal sprays from Bryn Pharma, of North Carolina, and Nausus Pharma, of Israel; a needle-free auto-injector from Crossject of France; and an epinephrine film that is administered under the tongue from Aquestive Therapeutics, of New Jersey.\n\nNeffy is designed to be easy to carry and easy to use, especially for children, said Richard Lowenthal, president and chief executive of San Diego-based ARS.\n\n\"We don't want fear. There's no needle, there's no pain with this product,\" he said. \"It's basically like spraying saline into your nose.\"\n\nNeffy will come in packs of two and is expected to cost about the same as a two-pack of auto-injectors, around $300 to $700. Lowenthal said he hoped insurance companies would cover the cost to patients for a low co-pay amount.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

On a global basis, we believe Anaphylm has the potential to be a billion-dollar commercial opportunity. We also believe that our epinephrine prodrug platform branded as Adrenaverse is leading the way for potential multiple epinephrine prodrug pipeline opportunities that could produce another billion dollars in opportunities, if new product candidates developed by the Company are approved by the FDA. These opportunities, along with Libervant and our base business, have positioned the Company for continued growth over the next several years.\"\n\nAnaphylm (epinephrine) Sublingual Film\n\nAquestive is advancing the development of Anaphylm (epinephrine) Sublingual Film, the first and only orally delivered epinephrine product candidate, as an easy to remember, easy to carry, and easy to use alternative to EpiPen and other injectors for the treatment of severe life-threatening allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis.\n\nIn June 2024, Aquestive reported positive topline pharmacokinetic (PK) data from the temperature / pH study of Anaphylm. The single-dose, five-period, randomized crossover study was designed to compare the PK and pharmacodynamics (PD) of Anaphylm just after consuming normal water at different temperatures (hot, cold, and room temperature) as well as water of different pHs (acidic - lemon water, and basic- baking soda water). The most consumed beverages, such as soda, milk, coffee, and juice, have acidity between lemon water and normal water. The primary PK parameters were the maximum amount of epinephrine measured in plasma (Cmax) and exposure, or the area under the curve (AUC), at predefined time points after dosing, in 30 healthy adult subjects. Topline PK and PD data from the study showed no statistically significant difference in PK and PD results between the different groups based on temperature and pH variability in the mouth.\n\nIn July 2024, Aquestive reported positive topline data from the self-administration PK study of Anaphylm. The single-dose, three-period, randomized crossover study was designed to compare the PK and PD of Anaphylm self-administered, Anaphylm healthcare provider (HCP)-administered, and Adrenalin manual intramuscular (IM) injection HCP- administered. The primary PK parameters were the maximum amount of epinephrine measured in plasma (Cmax) and exposure, or the area under the curve (AUC), at predefined time points after dosing in 36 healthy adult subjects. The median time to maximum concentration (Tmax) was 15 minutes for both the Anaphylm self-administered and HCP-administered arms, while the median Tmax for the Adrenalin IM HCP administered arm was 50 minutes post administration. Also, there was no statistical difference between the Anaphylm self-administered and HCP-administered arms of the study based on a comparison of epinephrine exposures across the first 60 minutes post-administration. Topline PD data from the study showed no difference in the median increase in systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate whether Anaphylm is self-administered or HCP-administered.\n\nThe Company's remaining supportive study, the oral allergy syndrome (OAS) challenge study, is underway, and the study is expected to be completed late in the third quarter or early fourth quarter of 2024. The Company is maintaining its guidance of initiating a full product launch of Anaphylm, if approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), at the end of 2025 or in the first quarter of 2026. This is based on completing an NDA submission with the FDA in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nAQST-108 (epinephrine) Topical Gel\n\nAquestive continues to progress its Adrenaverse epinephrine prodrug platform with AQST-108, which is an epinephrine prodrug topical gel product candidate for various potential dermatology conditions. The Company completed its first human clinical study for AQST-108 in the first quarter of 2024. The initial study measured the amount of epinephrine that remained on the skin or was found in circulation over time after the application of the gel. The data were positive, and the Company expects to hold a pre-Investigational New Drug (IND) meeting with the FDA in the fourth quarter of 2024 and is planning a phase 2a study in the first half of 2025.\n\nThe Company plans to hold an investor day the coming months to communicate the science and intellectual property that is the basis of the Adrenaverse epinephrine prodrug platform. This event will include further information regarding specific potential indications and market opportunities for AQST-108.\n\nLibervant (diazepam) Buccal Film\n\nLibervant (diazepam) Buccal Film is the first and only FDA approved orally administered rescue product for the treatment of seizure clusters in patients between the ages of two and five.\n\nIn April 2024, the FDA approved Libervant for the acute treatment of intermittent, stereotypic episodes of frequent seizure activity (i.e., seizure clusters, acute repetitive seizures) that are distinct from a patient's usual seizure pattern in patients with epilepsy between the ages of two to five. The NDA for Libervant for the acute treatment of intermittent, stereotypic episodes of frequent seizure activity (i.e., seizure clusters, acute repetitive seizures) in patients twelve years of age and older was tentatively approved by the FDA in August 2022 and is currently subject to an orphan drug market exclusivity block until January 2027 based on an FDA approved nasal spray product of another company. The Company expects to file for approval of Libervant for the treatment of these epilepsy patients between six to twelve years of age prior to the expiration of the orphan drug market exclusivity block.\n\nAquestive has launched Libervant for patients between the ages of two and five and expects to expand this launch with up to ten sales representatives in the third quarter 2024. The Company is also expanding its distribution network and expects to have national retail distribution capabilities in place by the fourth quarter 2024 as well as broadening Medicaid and commercial coverage in the coming months. Medicaid accounts for up to fifty percent of all prescriptions among this pediatric patient population.\n\nCommercial Collaborations\n\nAquestive continues to manufacture products for the licensing and supply collaborations that it has established. The Company manufactured approximately 34 million doses in the second quarter 2024, compared to approximately 48 million doses in the second quarter 2023. The Company continues to see demand for the manufacturing of Indivior's Suboxone Sublingual Film product and continues to support its other global collaborations, including the recent launch of Emylif (Riluzole) Oral Film product by Zambon in Europe.\n\nSales of royalty-based products, inclusive of Sympazan (clobazam) Oral Film for the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome in patients two years of age and older, and Azstarys for the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in patients six years of age and older, continued to contribute to the Company's revenue in the second quarter 2024.\n\nSecond Quarter 2024 Financials\n\nTotal revenues increased to $20.1 million in the second quarter 2024 from $13.2 million in the second quarter 2023. This 52% increase in revenue was primarily driven by increases in license and royalty revenue due to the recognition of deferred revenues from the termination of Licensing and Supply agreements, and co-development and research fees, partially offset by decreases in manufacture and supply revenue.\n\nManufacture and supply revenue decreased to $8.1 million in the second quarter 2024 from $11.6 million in the second quarter 2023, primarily due to timing of Suboxone and Ondif product orders. Manufacture and supply revenue decreased to $18.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 from $21.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. On a June year-to-date basis and excluding the one-time retroactive price increase of $1.7 million recognized in the three months ended March 31, 2023, manufacture and supply revenue decreased to $18.6 million from $19.7 million.\n\nResearch and development expenses increased to $4.2 million in the second quarter 2024 from $3.5 million in the second quarter 2023. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to the continued advancement of the Anaphylm development program and increases in R&D personnel costs and share-based compensation.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased to $11.4 million in the second quarter 2024 from $7.4 million in the second quarter 2023. This increase was partially driven by a $1.6 million year-over-year change in the allocation of expenses of manufacturing and supply costs. Given this year-over-year change, the Company expects to continue to see a positive benefit in gross margin offset by somewhat higher selling, general and administrative expenses. Excluding this item, increases in expenses were driven by increased commercial spending and regulatory fees related to the approval of Libervant and the commercial preparations for Anaphylm.\n\nAquestive's net loss for the second quarter 2024 was $2.7 million, or $0.03 for both basic and diluted loss per share, compared to the net loss for the second quarter 2023 of $5.8 million, or $0.10 for both basic and diluted loss per share. The decrease in net loss was primarily driven by increases in revenues and decreases in manufacture and supply expenses, offset by increases in selling, general and administrative expenses, research and development expenses, and non-cash interest expense related to amortization of the debt and royalty obligation discounts.\n\nNon-GAAP adjusted EBITDA income was $1.8 million in the second quarter 2024, compared to non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA loss of $3.3 million in the second quarter 2023. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA income excluding adjusted R&D expenses was $5.6 million in the second quarter 2024, compared to a non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA income excluding adjusted R&D expenses of $0.1 million in the second quarter 2023.\n\nCash and cash equivalents were $89.9 million as of June 30, 2024.\n\nOutlook\n\nAquestive's full-year 2024 financial guidance is below.\n\nAquestive is updating its full-year 2024 financial guidance based on second quarter 2024 results and updated outlook for the remainder of 2024.\n\nTomorrow's Conference Call and Webcast Reminder\n\nThe Company will host a conference call at 8:00 a.m. ET on Wednesday, August 7, 2024.\n\nIn order to participate, please register in advance here to obtain a local or toll-free phone number and your personal pin.\n\nA live webcast of the call will be available on Aquestive's website at: Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call\n\nAbout Anaphylm\n\nAnaphylm (epinephrine) Sublingual Film is a polymer matrix-based epinephrine prodrug product candidate. Anaphylm is similar in size to a postage stamp, weighs less than an ounce, and begins to dissolve on contact. No water or swallowing is required for administration. The packaging for Anaphylm is thinner and smaller than an average credit card, can be carried in a pocket, and is designed to withstand weather excursions such as exposure to rain and/or sunlight. The Anaphylm trade name for AQST-109 has been conditionally approved by the FDA. Final approval of the Anaphylm proprietary name is conditioned on FDA approval of the product candidate.\n\nAbout Libervant\n\nLibervant (diazepam) Buccal Film is a buccally, or inside of the cheek, administered film formulation of diazepam, a benzodiazepine intended for the acute treatment of intermittent, stereotypic episodes of frequent seizure activity (i.e., seizure clusters, acute repetitive seizures) that are distinct from a patient's usual seizure pattern in patients with epilepsy between two and five years of age. Aquestive developed Libervant as an alternative to the device-based products currently available for patients with refractory epilepsy, including a rectal gel and nasal spray products. The FDA approval for U.S. market access received in April 2024 for Libervant is for these epilepsy patients between two and five years of age. The FDA granted tentative approval in August 2022 for Libervant for treatment of these epilepsy patients twelve years of age and older, with U.S. market access for Libervant for this age group of patients subject to the expiration of the existing orphan drug market exclusivity of a previously FDA approved drug scheduled to expire in January 2027.\n\nAbout AQST-108\n\nAQST-108 (epinephrine) topical gel is an epinephrine prodrug topical gel product candidate. Aquestive completed a first in human study for AQST-108 that measured the amount of epinephrine that remained on the skin or was found in circulation over time after the application of the gel. AQST-108 is based on Aquestive's Adrenaverse platform that contains a library of over twenty epinephrine prodrug product candidates intended to control absorption and conversion rates across a variety of possible dosage forms and delivery sites.\n\nImportant Safety Information\n\nDo not give Libervant to your child between the ages of two and five if your child is allergic to diazepam or any of the ingredients in Libervant or has an eye problem called acute narrow angle glaucoma.\n\nWhat is the most important information I should know about Libervant?\n\nDo not allow your child to drive a motor vehicle, operate heavy machinery, or ride a bicycle until you know how taking Libervant with opioids affects your child.\n\nLibervant can make your child sleepy or dizzy and can slow your child's thinking and motor skills.\n\nLike other antiepileptic medicines, Libervant may cause suicidal thoughts or actions in a small number of people, about 1 in 500.\n\nWhat are the possible side effects of Libervant?\n\nFor more information about Libervant, talk to your doctor, and see Product Information: Medication Guide and Instructions For Use.\n\nAbout Aquestive Therapeutics, Inc.\n\nAquestive is pharmaceutical company advancing medicines to bring meaningful improvement to patients' lives through innovative science and delivery technologies. We are developing orally administered products to deliver complex molecules, providing novel alternatives to invasive and inconvenient standard of care therapies. Aquestive has five commercialized products marketed by its licensees in the U.S. and around the world and is the exclusive manufacturer of these licensed products. The Company also collaborates with pharmaceutical companies to bring new molecules to market using proprietary, best-in-class technologies, like PharmFilm, and has proven drug development and commercialization capabilities.

For more information, visit Aquestive.com and follow us on LinkedIn.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\n\nThis press release and our webcast earnings call regarding our quarterly financial results contains financial measures that do not comply with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), such as non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA loss, non-GAAP adjusted gross margins, non-GAAP adjusted costs and expenses and other adjusted expense measures, because such measures exclude, as applicable, share-based compensation expense, interest expense, interest expense related to the sale of future revenue, interest income, depreciation, amortization, and income taxes.\n\nSpecifically, the Company adjusts net income (loss) for loss on the extinguishment of debt; certain non-cash expenses, including share-based compensation expenses; depreciation and amortization; and interest expense related to the sale of future revenue, interest income and other income (expense), net and income taxes, with a result of non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA loss.\u202fSimilarly, manufacture and supply expense, research and development expense, and selling, general and administrative expense were adjusted for certain non-cash expenses of share-based compensation expense and depreciation and amortization. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA loss and these non-GAAP expense categories are used as a supplement to the corresponding GAAP measures to provide additional insight regarding the Company's ongoing operating performance.\n\nThese measures supplement the Company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Aquestive management uses these measures to analyze its financial results, and its future manufacture and supply expenses, gross margins, research and development expense and selling, general and administrative expense and to help make managerial decisions. In management's opinion, these non-GAAP measures provide added transparency into the operating performance of Aquestive and added insight into the effectiveness of our operating strategies and actions. The Company may provide one or more revenue measures adjusted for certain discrete items, such as fees collected on certain licensed products, in order to provide investors added insight into our revenue stream and breakdown, along with providing our GAAP revenue. Such measures are intended to supplement, not act as substitutes for, comparable GAAP measures and should not be read as a measure of liquidity for Aquestive. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA loss and the other non-GAAP measures are also likely calculated in a way that is not comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\nNon-GAAP Outlook\n\nIn providing the outlook for non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP gross margin, we exclude certain items which are otherwise included in determining the comparable GAAP financial measures. In order to inform our outlook measures of non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP gross margin, a description of the 2024 and 2023 adjustments which have been applicable in determining non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP gross margin for these periods are reflected in the tables below. In providing outlook for non-GAAP gross margin, the Company adjusts for non-cash share-based compensation expense and depreciation and amortization. The Company is providing such outlook only on a non-GAAP basis because the Company is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the totality or ultimate outcome or occurrence of these adjustments for the forward-looking period such as share-based compensation expense, income tax, amortization, and certain other adjusted items, which can be dependent on future events that may not be reliably predicted. Based on past reported results, where one or more of these items have been applicable, such excluded items could be material, individually or in the aggregate, to reported results.\n\nForward-Looking Statement\n\nCertain statements in this press release include \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

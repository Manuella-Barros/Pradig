Village Manager Randy Recklaus publicly presented settlement terms in March \u2014 but that was before the Bears received resounding rejections from Gov. J.B. Pritzker and state legislators in the team\u2019s bid for public subsides to help bankroll a new Chicago lakefront stadium. Hayes wouldn\u2019t disclose all of the ins and outs of the settlement document that was sent to Halas Hall, but confirmed that some form of previous proposals \u2014 including the Recklaus presentation from the March 18 village board meeting \u2014 are still on the table. When asked if the Bears responded positively to the settlement, Hayes replied, \u201cThey have responded, and discussions continue.\u201d Last week, the three-term mayor announced he wouldn\u2019t seek reelection, but he expects the Bears to decide whether or not to build a stadium in town before his term expires in 10 months. \u201cI feel really good that we\u2019ve presented a proposal to the Bears that they can feel comfortable with, and we\u2019ve communicated that to them, and they have responded, and discussions are continuing,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cI feel very hopeful about where things are at. And I\u2019ve always said that, ultimately, I think the Bears will find that Arlington Heights is the best site for them.\u201d A Bears spokesman said the club continues to maintain its focus on the lakefront site. Bears President and CEO Kevin Warren told the Daily Herald earlier this month he isn\u2019t ready to put the shuttered racetrack property up for sale, despite an organizational shift in focus to try to build a new stadium in Chicago. It\u2019s unclear exactly how much of a say the three school districts \u2014 Northwest Suburban High School District 214, Palatine-Schaumburg High School District 211 and Palatine Township Elementary District 15 \u2014 had in drafting the latest document, or if they\u2019re fully or partially on board. \u201cWe continue to work closely and collaboratively with the village of Arlington Heights regarding the redevelopment of Arlington Park and any discussions with the Bears,\u201d the districts said in a joint statement. \u201cThe school districts have been a full partner with the village of Arlington Heights in preparation for the next steps of this process.\u201d Hayes said the schools \u201care definitely at the table.\u201d A possible village-brokered agreement between the Bears and schools comes as the team\u2019s petition to lower the property value of the Arlington Park site makes its way through the legal process at the Illinois Property Tax Appeal Board. The Bears on March 29 formally appealed the Feb. 28 decision of the Cook County Board of Review, which set the value of the property at $124.7 million and stuck the team with a $8.9 million tax bill. The Bears want the value reduced to $60 million, which would lower the tax bill to $1.7 million. In their formal written complaint, the club\u2019s property tax attorneys submitted hundreds of pages of documents to the state agency, including two appraisals, comps and the racetrack demolition permits, according to records obtained from a Freedom of Information Act request. After the organization closed on its $197.2 million purchase in February 2023, teardown of the grandstand and other structures was done with an eye to achieving a lower valuation for vacant land. The fact that demolition started in May and was completed by November is one of the key arguments of the team\u2019s attorneys, who are seeking a hearing before the five-member, quasi-judicial body. But it could take until early next year before a decision is rendered. The county board of review has until Sept. 4 to submit evidence of its own or request an extension in response to the appeal. By July 6, the county must formally notify the three school districts and other local taxing bodies whose boundaries fall within the sprawling Arlington Park site. Hayes acknowledged the Bears\u2019 appeal is ongoing. \u201cThere\u2019s still issues to be resolved, but I think we\u2019re in a much better place than we were, say, three, four, six months ago,\u201d he said. Though Hayes said he hoped the racetrack redevelopment process would have been \u201ca little bit further down the road\u201d by now, he didn\u2019t blame the schools or the Bears for how the process has played out. \u201cLooking back on it, I can understand why it\u2019s taken this long,\u201d he said. \u201cI'm very comfortable and feel very grateful for the (village) team that we put together and the work that we\u2019ve done to try to make this happen. \u2026 I don't regret anything that we\u2019ve done, and I can understand everything that the Bears have done and the school districts have done from their perspective as well.\u201d", "summary": "As the team juggles two stadium sites now in limbo, the Chicago Bears have received and responded to a proposed settlement from Arlington Heights that aims to resolve outstanding tax issues on the suburban option, village officials confirm.", "url": "https://www.dailyherald.com/20240628/news/were-in-a-much-better-place-arlington-heights-mayor-says-bears-have-responded-to-proposed-deal/", "image": "https://imengine.public.prod.pdh.navigacloud.com/?uuid=c01f2839-1f51-5ac3-a0a6-7e6bb296e6e2&function=fit&type=preview", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 02:23:34", "author": "Christopher Placek", "authors": ["Christopher Placek"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.068}

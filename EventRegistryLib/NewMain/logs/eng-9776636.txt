But what does she get up to when she's not flipping around on the floor and securing all the gold medals?\n\nSimone Biles is 27, competing in her first-ever Olympics in Rio 2016 at 19. She lives in Houston, Texas where she's currently building a $2 million mansion with her husband.\n\nDespite her age, a lot of people think Simone is younger than she actually is. She said: \"They're like 'Oh my god, you're so cute, you're a kid. Like I want to say 'I'm grown. I'm an adult now. I'm 27 years old.\"\n\nSimone Biles is married to NFL player Jonathan Owens. Jonathan currently plays for the Chicago Bears and has previously competed for the Arizona Cardinals, Houston Texans and Green Bay Packers.\n\nThey met on Raya back in 2020 and got engaged on Valentine's Day 2022i in a gorgeous sun-lit gazebo in Houston. Her engagement ring is a big ol' ROCK and estimated to cost around $300,000. Announcing their engagement on Insta, Simone said: \"THE EASIEST YES. I can't wait to spend forever & ever with you, you're everything I dreamed of and more! let's get married FIANC\u00c9.\" They then got married on a beach in Mexico in May 2023 after having a boujee hen party.\n\nSimone Biles was adopted by her grandparents, Ronald and Nellie Biles when she was six, after she and her three siblings were placed in foster care due to their mother's issues with substance abuse.\n\nSimone Biles and her sister Adria Biles were adopted by Ronald and Nellie Biles in Texas, while their two older siblings were adopted by a great-aunt in Ohio.\n\nIn an episode of her series, titled \"Simone vs Herself,\" Simone opened up about her upbringing. She said: \"I don't remember a lot about foster care, but I definitely knew that we had been taken from our biological mom, and then you just think you're going to go back to her,\" she shared. \"We were very fortunate that we actually got to stay with our siblings because a lot of the time you either get regrouped from home to home to home, or you and your siblings get split up.\"\n\nSimone has credited her gymnastics success to Ronald and Nellie Biles and has expressed her gratitude for their support and presence in her life.\n\nDespite her huge performance in the gym, Simone is 4ft 8in, making her 1.42m tall.\n\nWhen asked which question she would like to stop being asked, Simone revealed: \"The question I wish people would stop asking me is how tall are you? Are you gonna grow?\"\n\nShe added: \"I'm not going anywhere. I'm 4'8. I'm stuck. I love my body.\"\n\nSimone has two adorable French bulldogs called Lilo and Rambo who she is OBSESSED with. In one Insta post, the wealthy gymnast showed just how much she spoils her Frenchies. One of her dogs looked up adorably at her while wearing a Louis Vuitton backpack.\n\nI am OBSESSED with the entire team USA. Simone Biles' TikTok and Instagram are full of fun pictures of videos with her teammates who she seems to be besties with. Let me join their friendship group please xx\n\nAs well as lots of adorable pics of her and her husband and gymnastics pics, Simone's Instagram is full of a lot of vibey holiday pics that I am insanely jealous of. One of Simone's favourite places is Belsize, the place she also had her hen party.\n\nSimone Biles touched on her connection to Belize in a 2016 interview with The New York Times. She shared that Belize feels like her second home as her mother, Nellie Biles, was born and raised in Belize, and so Simone was able to claim dual citizenship status.\n\nIf you scroll through Simone's Instagram page, you'll find lots of photos that show her living it up in her second island home. In the 2016 interview, the Olympian shared that she and her family visit the island nation \"at least once a year.\"\n\n* Simone Biles net worth: The insane amount she's worth from her gymnastics

Like I want to say 'I'm grown. I'm an adult now. I'm 27 years old.\"\n\nIn April 2023 Simone married American Football player Jonathan Owens, 29, after meeting in 2020. Jonathan currently plays for the Chicago Bears and has previously competed for the Arizona Cardinals, Houston Texans and Green Bay Packers.\n\nThe couple often post images of each other online, with Simone posting a sweet tribute to her husband last week for his birthday.\n\nShe wrote: \"Happy happy birthday to my husband, best friend, confidant and party goer \u2764\ufe0f thanks for being the calm to my storm! i love you with all my heart and I can't wait to see what this year brings! let's do it big baby\ud83d\udc8b\ud83d\ude18\u2728 wish I was there to celebrate you, but I'll see you soon!!! XO @jowens\"\n\nSimone Biles net worth is estimated to be an astonishing $20million, according to the Telegraph. It is believed that $7million of that is made up of endorsements and off-field pay, with Forbes reporting she acquired $100,000 in on-field earnings last year.\n\nOver the years the 27-year-old has worked with brands such as Nike, GAP, Beats By Dr Dre and United Airlines, which are sure to have added to her bank balance.\n\nSimone has yet to win a medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics, however she is part of the Women's Team Final where she may pick up her first medal.\n\nThe sporting legend currently has seven Olympic medals, four golds, one silver and three bronze medals.\n\nThe Olympic great has been open about her ADHD diagnosis, previously tweeting: \"Having ADHD, and taking medicine for it is nothing to be ashamed of nothing that I'm afraid to let people know.\"\n\nIn 2016 Simone faced backlash over her ADHD medication, which she managed with a therapeutic use exemption through the World Anti-Doping Agency.\n\nAs well as the Biles I on floor, vault and beam, and the Biles II on vault and floor, Simone has submitted a new element for the uneven bars at the 2024 Olympic Games.\n\nThe move involves a hip circle forward with 1.5 turns to a handstand, which is a variation of another move she completes earlier in her routine.\n\nFans can follow Simone on Instagram @simonebiles, where she currently boasts 8.4 million followers.\n\nThe Team USA member often shares pictures of her competitions as well as days out with friends and family.", "source": {"uri": "heart.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heart"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Known for her breathtaking routines and exceptional skill, Biles is not just participating; she's aiming to add to her already impressive tally of seven Olympic medals, including four golds. Her routines are so extraordinary that some of her moves have even been named after her, a testament to her influence and innovation in the sport.\n\nIn preparation for the Games, Biles has made the decision to skip the Opening Ceremony. This choice is all about conserving her energy and ensuring she's in top form for her events starting on July 28. Her mother, Nellie Biles, has shared that this strategic rest is crucial for Simone to perform at her best. Biles' decision underscores the importance of managing one's energy and focus, especially at such a high level of competition.\n\nBeyond her public persona, Biles' background reveals a compelling story of resilience and family support. Simone and her younger sister Adria were placed in foster care as children due to their biological mother's struggles with addiction. It was her grandparents, Ron and Nellie Biles, who stepped in to provide a stable and loving home. This support has been a cornerstone of Simone's success, and she often expresses her deep gratitude toward them.\n\nSimone Biles has spoken openly about the impact of her adoption and the positive influence her grandparents have had on her life. In her own words, she has emphasized how her parents have set a powerful example and provided unwavering support. This strong family foundation became especially evident during the Tokyo 2020 Olympics when Biles chose to withdraw from several events to prioritize her mental health. Her decision highlighted the immense pressure athletes face and the crucial role of having a supportive network.\n\nAs the Paris Games draw nearer, Simone Biles continues to be a symbol of excellence and resilience in gymnastics, driven not only by her incredible talent but also by the strong family support that has been with her from the beginning.", "source": {"uri": "businessupturn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Upturn"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games_ceremony", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games ceremony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mental health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Olympic_Committee", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "International Olympic Committee"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "label": "dmoz/Home/Family/Parenting", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death/In_Memoriam", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death/In Memoriam", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Crafts/Lacemaking", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.businessupturn.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Simone-Biles-1-1024x576.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776636", "eventUri": "eng-9776636", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-28", "textStart": 681, "textEnd": 688}], "sentiment": 0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

She was recently featured in a Netflix documentary called \"Simone Biles Rising.\"\n\nSimone Biles is a tremendously successful woman, as seen by her thirty World Championship medals, four gold medals, and seven Olympic medals. Therefore, it's interesting to note that, similar to most Olympic competitors, the vast majority of her projected $20 million net worth comes from endorsements rather than an actual income.\n\nWho was Jim Thorpe? Why did he lose his gold medals in the 1912 Olympics?\n\nSponsors have come from a wide range of industries, including Powerade, the dog food company Nulo, the online education platform MasterClass, the cybersecurity startup Axonius, the gymnastics apparel company GK Elite (where she has her line of leotards), and the cereal brand Wheaties.\n\nSimone Biles has even more sponsors, such as Uber Eats, Beats by Dre, Core Power, Hershey's, Mattress Firm, United Airlines, Visa, and Subway, listed on her official website, showing that her endorsements are extensive. Given these big brands, it's likely she's done well financially. Forbes estimated in 2021 that she earned at least $5 million annually from sponsorships. Since then, her income has likely increased, especially considering she made $10 million in 2022 alone.\n\nYou may be curious about how much money the Olympics made. Successful athletes can make a lot of money, but in the US, the prize money for Olympic titles isn't very much. Bronze medals are worth $15,000, silver medals are worth $22,500, and gold medals are worth $37,500.\n\nWho is 18-year old Olympian swimmer Katie Grimes?\n\nThis is pretty low, especially since the US government doesn't give money to the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee or its top sports programs. Simone Biles has made about $147,500 from her Olympic medals so far, but that amount is expected to change after the Games in Paris this summer.", "source": {"uri": "newsd.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsd.in"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_film", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Documentary film"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MasterClass", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MasterClass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mattress_Firm", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mattress Firm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Thorpe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jim Thorpe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Powerade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subway_(restaurant)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Subway (restaurant)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hershey_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Hershey Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheaties", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wheaties"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beats_Electronics", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Beats Electronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leotard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leotard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Visa Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Clothing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cereal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cereal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Grimes", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Katie Grimes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paralympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paralympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swimming (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://newsd.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Simone-Biles.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776636", "eventUri": "eng-9776636", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

What do we expect of them? What do we need from them? What happens when they surprise us? When you have the attention of the world, everything you do takes on a bigger meaning,\" Taylor narrated. \"It can be a heavy burden. It can be a chance to change everything. Throughout the last week, her voice has been as significant as her talents, her honesty as beautiful as the perfection that had long been her signature. But don't you see? It still is. She's perfectly human. And that's what makes it so easy to call her a hero.\"\n\n\"I'm crying. How special.

I feel so lucky to have gotten to watch you all these years, but this week was a lesson in emotional intelligence and resilience. We all learned from you. Thank you.\"\n\nSimone later revealed that she withdrew from the competition because she had the twisties. The term refers to a \"mental block in gymnastics\" that \"causes a disconnect between the brain and body, causing you to lose control over the movement,\" according to Health.com.\n\nThe Texas native made a virtual diary clip of the experience and shared the video during a September 2021 episode of her Facebook series, \"Simone vs Herself.\"\n\n\"So, having these mental blocks in the gym recently, it's not been fun, it's been scary. I'm getting lost in my skills.

A nice paycheck comes with each accolade as well.\n\nAccording to CNBC, the United States Olympics and Paralympics Committee gives gold medalists $37,500 per first-place win, silver medalists $22,500, and bronze medalists $15,000. The amount awarded per medal has changed over the course of Biles's three Olympics, but she has still been awarded more than $100,000 for her Olympic efforts.\n\nOther than a few stipends here and there, according to Synergy Gymnastics, gymnasts like Simone Biles don't make most of their money from their actual gymnastics wins. Instead, the majority of her net worth likely comes from endorsements, partnerships, and social media.\n\nBiles has appeared in commercials with Uber Eats, Powerade, Nike, and Tide. According to Forbes, thanks to endorsements like these, Biles is the sixteenth highest-paid female athlete in the world. Per their calculations, as of 2023, she earns around $100,000 from her career wins, and $7 million from sponsorships and endorsements.\n\nPer Biles's official website, her current sponsors include Spieth America, Wheaties, Athleta (which she switched to from Nike), Powerade, Nulo, Masterclass, Axonius, GK, and Friends of the Children.\n\nShe frequently posts sponsored content in partnership with these brands and others on her Instagram, which has accrued over eight million followers. Instagram creators of her caliber typically receive thousands of dollars per post.\n\nShe even released a Netflix series called Simone Biles: Rising in July of 2024, which may net her a paycheck as well.\n\nAccording to Celebrity Net Worth, Simone Biles' hard work and many streams of income have led to a net worth of $20 million. Per her social media, it seems she likes to spend her money on travel, time with her husband and dogs, and building her new home.\n\nBased on her high earnings and even higher scores, she isn't called the Greatest of All Time for nothing.", "source": {"uri": "wegotthiscovered.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "We Got This Covered"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jensen_bird@wegotthiscovered.com", "name": "Jensen Bird", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bronze"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_Medal_of_Freedom", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidential Medal of Freedom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powerade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Powerade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_worth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Net worth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike,_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nike, Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gap_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gap Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheaties", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wheaties"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Friends"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_hockey", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Field hockey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Theme", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Jewelry/Theme", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/BC38C733-8932-436F-84D5-E88767F08CE7.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776636", "eventUri": "eng-9776636", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-28", "textStart": 32, "textEnd": 41}], "sentiment": 0.5607843137254902, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

Since then, she has called them Mom and Dad.\n\nIn the Facebook Watch series, 'Simone vs. Herself,' Simone revealed that her biological mother, Shannon, struggled with drug and alcohol addiction. As a result, she and her three siblings were placed in foster care when she was three.\n\nSimone recalled her biological mother being in and out of jail and how they sometimes went without food.\n\n'I don't remember a lot about foster care, but I definitely knew that we had been taken from our biological mom, and then you just think you're going to go back to her,' Biles shared.\n\nSimon's biological father, Kelvin Clemons, met Shannon while they both were teenagers and also struggled with addiction. In a 2016 interview with the Daily Mail, Shannon revealed she occasionally speaks with Kelvin- who is not in touch with their daughter.\n\n'He just called me Sunday. I said, 'I'm watching Simone are you watching her? Are you watching her? Call me back later,\" she recalled then. 'He knows that's his daughter and he's very proud of her.'\n\nSimone also shared how 'fortunate' she was to stay with her siblings instead of being split into different homes.\n\nShe also expressed her gratitude towards her grandparents for their love and support.\n\n'Being separated from my biological mom, being placed in foster care before I officially got adopted by my grandparents, it just set me up for a better route at life,' Biles said. 'I feel like I wouldn't be where I am unless that turning point happened.'\n\nNellie Biles cherished the moments she shared with Biles and her siblings, claiming: 'I remember praying for that bonding.'\n\nBecause telling them that you love them and you care for them; that's all words,' Nellie continued. 'But then you wake up one day, and you realize that you would do anything for these children. And that you would die for these children. And when that feeling comes, that's when you know you are truly a mother.'\n\nThe bond proved strong as Simone leaned on her mom at her lowest points, including her breakdown at the Tokyo games.\n\nTheir relationship shined in the Netflix docuseries 'Simon Biles Rising' when Nellie's reaction to Simone withdrawing was seen by the public.\n\n'You can't do it. It's okay, honey,' Nellie said after receiving a call from her daughter.

Simone's title as the 'greatest gymnast of all time' is well-earned. Over her career, she has accumulated five gold medals, one silver, and two bronze, making a total of eight Olympic medals.\n\nDespite facing a leg injury during the 2024 games, Simone did not let that stop her from leading her team to victory, marking their team as the fourth-ever USA women's gymnastics team to earn gold. This triumph comes as part of her comeback story after withdrawing from the 2021 Tokyo Olympics due to suffering from the 'twisties.'\n\nThe All-Star champion has had to overcome her own challenges and now reigns as the greatest gymnast of all time. The three-time Olympian even has signature moves named after her: The Biles (floor, vault, beam) and The Biles II (floor and vault).\n\nAccording to ABC News, former Olympian Dominique Dawes commented on the difficulty of Simone's moves, \"Many people aren't even attempting to do them because they're such high difficulty, high risk maneuvers, and she does them with complete ease and effort... It's amazing to watch what she's doing. And she does it with a smile on her face.\"\n\nDawes further expressed, \"It really is Simone versus herself... That's really what makes her one of the greatest of all time. Back then they used to cap our scores. And so now with this new scoring system, the sky is the limit for athletes like Simone, who's very talented. And so if she does a higher, difficult maneuver on any of the different pieces of apparatus, she'll actually get credit for it.\"\n\nThrough all the physical challenges she has faced, from injuries to the 'twisties,' nothing has stopped Simone from excelling in her career. As she stated during the 2024 Olympics, \"I don't focus on stats, I focus on routines and going out there competing and seeing how comfortable and confident I feel.\"", "source": {"uri": "hollywoodlife.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hollywood Life"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jessica_acosta@hollywoodlife.com", "name": "Jessica Acosta", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Biles", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Simone Biles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnastics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gymnastics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletics_at_the_2016_Summer_Paralympics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Athletics at the 2016 Summer Paralympics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronze medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominique_Dawes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dominique Dawes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Track_and_Field/Athletes", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Track and Field/Athletes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Pins", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Pins", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2164046088_b7f99a-e1722368947471.jpg?quality=100&w=1024", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9776636", "eventUri": "eng-9776636", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

Gymnastics legend Simone Biles won over Taylor Swift's heart after she performed the pop star's powerful floor routine to her song \"...Ready For It?\" - however the queens have had a precious, budding friendship over the years.\n\nIn 2016, the history-making Grammy winner publicly wished Simone good luck as she headed to her first Olympics at the Rio Games.\n\nThe message manifested into the two meeting in person for the first time at a Super Bowl party (before they were WAGs).\n\nTaylor snapped a photo with Simone and her siblings Ron II and Adria at the event, which the gymnast eagerly shared via Instagram.\n\n\"Always a joy watching you perform, nice to finally meet you,\" Simone captioned the February 2017 post. \"Club nomadic @taylorswift.\"\n\nSimone faced challenges during her second trip to the Olympics in 2021 and withdrew from all individual events to prioritize mental health.\n\nThe \"Lover\" singer made a special video in support of Simone and her tough decision to walk away from the Tokyo Games.\n\n\"What do we want from our heroes? What do we expect of them? What do we need from them? What happens when they surprise us? When you have the attention of the world, everything you do takes on a bigger meaning,\" Taylor narrated. \"It can be a heavy burden. It can be a chance to change everything. Throughout the last week, her voice has been as significant as her talents, her honesty as beautiful as the perfection that had long been her signature. But don't you see? It still is. She's perfectly human. And that's what makes it so easy to call her a hero.\"\n\n\"I'm crying. How special. I love you @taylorswift13,\" Simone wrote via X in August 2021, leading Taylor to respond, \"I cried watching YOU. I feel so lucky to have gotten to watch you all these years, but this week was a lesson in emotional intelligence and resilience. We all learned from you. Thank you.\"\n\nSimone later revealed that she withdrew from the competition because she had the twisties. The term refers to a \"mental block in gymnastics\" that \"causes a disconnect between the brain and body, causing you to lose control over the movement,\" according to Health.com.\n\nThe Texas native made a virtual diary clip of the experience and shared the video during a September 2021 episode of her Facebook series, \"Simone vs Herself.\"\n\n\"So, having these mental blocks in the gym recently, it's not been fun, it's been scary. I'm getting lost in my skills.

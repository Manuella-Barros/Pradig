Fiji aims for a three-peat", "body": "Antoine Dupont had one ambition when he switched his focus to what he described as the French Olympic project: a gold medal for the host nation.\n\nThe world's premier rugby player will get France's Olympic medal campaign underway Wednesday, two days before the official opening ceremony of the Paris Games, when his team takes on the United States in the first Pool B game of the rugby sevens competition.\n\nStade de France will be at capacity and most of the attention will be on Dupont when the French kick off in the third game of a three-day men's tournament. It'll be the same on Day 2 when the French meet two-time Olympic champion Fiji, the most formidable force in rugby's condensed sevens format.\n\nThe U.S. men face France and Fiji on Wednesday, giving them a unique view of a pair of title favorites.\n\n\"When we get in that environment, besides maybe 14 players, give or take 50 friends and family coming in supporting us, the staff and the people watching on TV -- we know it's going to be us versus 69,000 people,\" U.S. captain Kevon Williams said of facing the French. \"We're OK with that, we've been preparing for that, we've honed in and said, 'It's just us.'\n\n\"All we'll see is the French jersey, so we'll be ready.\"\n\nFrance hosted the Rugby World Cup last year and the national team again failed to lift the title. It has been a finalist three times at the sport's biggest tournament.\n\nWith undisputed star of the 15-a-side game joining its ranks, France has peaked in the rugby sevens format in 2024. Dupont helped the French win a spot on the world series for the first time in 19 years, and then capped it with a victory in the series finale in Madrid.\n\nThe French evolution has coincided with an unusually lean season for Fiji.\n\nAlthough Fiji head coach Osea Kolinisau is confident the team's bid for an Olympic three-peat will overshadow the inconsistent world series run by the time the men's sevens medals are awarded Saturday.\n\n\"We plan to keep that legacy going,\" Kolinisau said. \"We can claim it solely.\"\n\nKolinisau led Fiji to its first ever Olympic gold medal as captain in 2016 at Rio de Janeiro, where rugby sevens was featured on the Olympic program for the first time.\n\nKolinisau was rushed into the coaching role earlier this year to resurrect Fiji's men's program, and he reinstated what he calls the \"Fijian way\" -- or instinct -- for sevens rugby: \"High tempo, high risk.\"\n\nIn the series finale, the Fijians posted wins over Ireland, South Africa and New Zealand before losing to France in the semifinals.\n\nFor Argentina, a grand final loss to France in Madrid was a setback after it topped the league stage of the world series, winning three of the seven stops.\n\nFor the Olympic tournament, Argentina is grouped with Australia, Samoa and Kenya in Pool B. No. 2-ranked Ireland, Tokyo silver medalist New Zealand, Rio bronze medalist South Africa and Japan are in a tough Pool A. Uruguay joins France, Fiji and the U.S. in Pool C.\n\nThe top two teams in each group and the two best third-place teams advance to the quarterfinals, meaning two-thirds of the 12 starters are still in medal contention when the knockout phase starts.\n\nThat's the stage where the Fijians have come into their own at the two previous Olympics.\n\nJerry Tuwai has been integral in Fiji's first two Olympic runs and the 35-year-old playmaker was recalled by Kolinisau two months ago after almost a year out of the team.\n\nA two-time Olympic champion, Sevens World Cup winner and player of the decade, Tuwai has embraced Kolinisau's approach ahead of the Paris Games.\n\n\"Our style of play has been opened up and our teamwork and communication. Our decision making -- that's another thing that opened up, too,\" Tuwai said. \"After two Olympic gold medals, these boys have shown they always show up in very big tournaments.\n\n\"We have this legacy to defend.\"\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri": "hjnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Herald Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri":

alignment of rugby sevens with an Olympic format has definitely caused a massive sense of excitement on the field.\n\n\"Whether it's South Africa, New Zealand, Fiji or the French, it's been great for

Fiji aims for a three-peat", "body": "FILE - Fiji's Jerry Tuwai, center, evades Britain's Alex Davis as Fiji's Meli Derenalagi looks on, in their men's rugby sevens match at the 2020 Summer Olympics, on July 27, 2021 in Tokyo, Japan. Osea Kolinisau led Fiji to its first ever Olympic gold medal when rugby sevens made its debut at the Summer Games in 2016 and now, as a coach, he's turning to old teammate Jerry Tuwai to help the Pacific nation's bid for a three-peat.\n\nAntoine Dupont had one ambition when he switched his focus to what he described as the French Olympic project: a gold medal for the host nation.\n\nThe world's premier rugby player will get France's Olympic medal campaign underway Wednesday, two days before the official opening ceremony of the Paris Games, when his team takes on the United States in the first Pool B game of the rugby sevens competition.\n\nStade de France will be at capacity and most of the attention will be on Dupont when the French kick off in the third game of a three-day men's tournament. It'll be the same on Day 2 when the French meet two-time Olympic champion Fiji, the most formidable force in rugby's condensed sevens format.\n\nThe U.S. men face France and Fiji on Wednesday, giving them a unique view of a pair of title favorites.\n\n\"When we get in that environment, besides maybe 14 players, give or take 50 friends and family coming in supporting us, the staff and the people watching on TV -- we know it's going to be us versus 69,000 people,\" U.S. captain Kevon Williams said of facing the French. \"We're OK with that, we've been preparing for that, we've honed in and said, 'It's just us.'\n\n\"All we'll see is the French jersey, so we'll be ready.\"\n\nFrance hosted the Rugby World Cup last year and the national team again failed to lift the title. It has been a finalist three times at the sport's biggest tournament.\n\nWith undisputed star of the 15-a-side game joining its ranks, France has peaked in the rugby sevens format in 2024. Dupont helped the French win a spot on the world series for the first time in 19 years, and then capped it with a victory in the series finale in Madrid.\n\nThe French evolution has coincided with an unusually lean season for Fiji.\n\nAlthough Fiji head coach Osea Kolinisau is confident the team's bid for an Olympic three-peat will overshadow the inconsistent world series run by the time the men's sevens medals are awarded Saturday.\n\n\"We plan to keep that legacy going,\" Kolinisau said. \"We can claim it solely.\"\n\nKolinisau led Fiji to its first ever Olympic gold medal as captain in 2016 at Rio de Janeiro, where rugby sevens was featured on the Olympic program for the first time.\n\nKolinisau was rushed into the coaching role earlier this year to resurrect Fiji's men's program, and he reinstated what he calls the \"Fijian way\" -- or instinct -- for sevens rugby: \"High tempo, high risk.\"\n\nIn the series finale, the Fijians posted wins over Ireland, South Africa and New Zealand before losing to France in the semifinals.\n\nFor Argentina, a grand final loss to France in Madrid was a setback after it topped the league stage of the world series, winning three of the seven stops.\n\nFor the Olympic tournament, Argentina is grouped with Australia, Samoa and Kenya in Pool B. No. 2-ranked Ireland, Tokyo silver medalist New Zealand, Rio bronze medalist South Africa and Japan are in a tough Pool A. Uruguay joins France, Fiji and the U.S. in Pool C.\n\nThe top two teams in each group and the two best third-place teams advance to the quarterfinals, meaning two-thirds of the 12 starters are still in medal contention when the knockout phase starts.\n\nThat's the stage where the Fijians have come into their own at the two previous Olympics.\n\nJerry Tuwai has been integral in Fiji's first two Olympic runs and the 35-year-old playmaker was recalled by Kolinisau two months ago after almost a year out of the team.\n\nA two-time Olympic champion, Sevens World Cup winner and player of the decade, Tuwai has embraced Kolinisau's approach ahead of the Paris Games.\n\n\"Our style of play has been opened up and our teamwork and communication. Our decision making -- that's another thing that opened up, too,\" Tuwai said. \"After two Olympic gold medals, these boys have shown they always show up in very big tournaments.\n\n\"We have this legacy to defend.\"\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri": "idahostatejournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Idaho State Journal"}, "authors":

The fact that there's been an alignment in all the structures within France from Toulouse to the French federation has helped him.\n\n\"I ask myself why more French XV players haven't done it - Damian Penaud and Gabin Villiere would be brilliant at the sport - but the fans are in for something special in Paris.\n\n\"Antoine is a guy that is absolutely box office in every way possible.\n\n\"It was a massive call to miss the Six Nations, but the seamlessness which he has made the transition has been absolutely brilliant.\n\n\"We don't know what a ceiling looks like for him yet because he continues to break through it.\"\n\nLes Bleus are in the same pool as Fiji - gold medallists at Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020 - with the early action at the Stade de France getting under way on Wednesday, two days before the opening ceremony of Paris 2024.\n\nThe medals will be decided on Saturday, with Fiji and France expecting stern competition from Australia, Argentina and New Zealand.\n\nIreland feature XVs international Hugo Keenan and Connacht's Andrew Smith following their reintegration back into the sevens programme and will also hope to be in the mix for medals.\n\nBut Great Britain, silver medallists eight years ago, are absent after losing to South Africa at last month's repechage final in Monaco.\n\nHabana, who just missed out on South Africa selection for Rio after switching his focus to sevens, said: \"It's going to be such an exciting tournament.\n\n\"The alignment of rugby sevens with an Olympic format has definitely caused a massive sense of excitement on the field.\n\n\"Whether it's South Africa, New Zealand, Fiji or the French, it's been great for the game and just seeing the continual growth of sevens globally has been brilliant.\n\n\"I obviously fell short in going to Rio, mostly because of injury, but knowing that I small part in helping the BlitzBoks go on to win a bronze medal there was pretty special.\"\n\nThe women's rugby sevens tournament in Paris takes place from July 28-30, with Great Britain and Ireland among the 12 nations competing.", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

It has been a finalist three times at the sport's biggest tournament.\n\nWith undisputed star of the 15-a-side game joining its ranks, France has peaked in the rugby sevens format in 2024. Dupont helped the French win a spot on the world series for the first time in 19 years, and then capped it with a victory in the series finale in Madrid.\n\nThe French evolution has coincided with an unusually lean season for Fiji.\n\nAlthough Fiji head coach Osea Kolinisau is confident the team's bid for an Olympic three-peat will overshadow the inconsistent world series run by the time the men's sevens medals are awarded Saturday.\n\n\"We plan to keep that legacy going,\" Kolinisau said. \"We can claim it solely.\"\n\nKolinisau led Fiji to its first ever Olympic gold medal as captain in 2016 at Rio de Janeiro, where rugby sevens was featured on the Olympic program for the first time.\n\nKolinisau was rushed into the coaching role earlier this year to resurrect Fiji's men's program, and he reinstated what he calls the \"Fijian way\" -- or instinct -- for sevens rugby: \"High tempo, high risk.\"\n\nIn the series finale, the Fijians posted wins over Ireland, South Africa and New Zealand before losing to France in the semifinals.\n\nFor Argentina, a grand final loss to France in Madrid was a setback after it topped the league stage of the world series, winning three of the seven stops.\n\nFor the Olympic tournament, Argentina is grouped with Australia, Samoa and Kenya in Pool B. No. 2-ranked Ireland, Tokyo silver medalist New Zealand, Rio bronze medalist South Africa and Japan are in a tough Pool A. Uruguay joins France, Fiji and the U.S. in Pool C.\n\nThe top two teams in each group and the two best third-place teams advance to the quarterfinals, meaning two-thirds of the 12 starters are still in medal contention when the knockout phase starts.\n\nThat's the stage where the Fijians have come into their own at the two previous Olympics.\n\nJerry Tuwai has been integral in Fiji's first two Olympic runs and the 35-year-old playmaker was recalled by Kolinisau two months ago after almost a year out of the team.\n\nA two-time Olympic champion, Sevens World Cup winner and player of the decade, Tuwai has embraced Kolinisau's approach ahead of the Paris Games.\n\n\"Our style of play has been opened up and our teamwork and communication. Our decision making -- that's another thing that opened up, too,\" Tuwai said. \"After two Olympic gold medals, these boys have shown they always show up in very big tournaments.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press.

Our style of play has been opened up, and our teamwork and communication. And our decision-making, that is another thing that has been opened up, too.\"\n\nAt the sevens series Grand Final in Madrid, won by France, Fiji reeled off victories over Ireland, South Africa and New Zealand in the style Kolinisau wanted.\n\n\"I was asked before, 'what would success look like to you?' And I said, 'I just want the boys to play the Fijian way and play together as a team',\" he said.\n\nArgentina was the surprise package of the regular season, topping the standings thanks to three wins in the first four tournaments.\n\nLos Pumas are drawn in Pool B alongside Australia, Samoa and Kenya.\n\nPool A features Rio 2016 silver medalist New Zealand, world No 2-ranked side Ireland,

And our decision-making, that is another thing that has been opened up, too.\u201d\n\nAt the sevens series grand final in Madrid won by France, Fiji reeled off victories over Ireland, South Africa and New Zealand in the style Kolinisau wanted.\n\n\u201cI was asked before, \u2018What would success look like to you?\u2019, and I said, \u2018I just wanted the boys to play the Fijian way and play together as a team\u2019,\u201d he said.\n\nArgentina were the surprise package of the regular season, topping the standings thanks to three wins in the first four tournaments.\n\nLos Pumas are drawn

The equally anticipated women's tournament will take place from July 28 to 30.\n\nSEE POOLS, SCHEDULE AND TEAMS >>\n\nAustralia and Samoa will have the honour of kicking off the Olympic competition when they take to the pitch for the first match at 15:30 local time CET (GMT+2) on 24 July.

All the action will take place at the Stade de France, which hosted the opening match and final of the 2023 Rugby World Cup.\n\nFiji have won both men's gold medals to date - Rio being their first ever Olympic medal - but five different nations have won the men's SVNS series since 2016, while Argentina were crowned winners of the 2024 SVNS league and France claimed the inaugural SVNS Grand Final title in Madrid last month, demonstrating the depth of competitiveness.\n\nAustralia and New Zealand have taken women's rugby sevens to new levels, each winning an Olympic gold medal, while France won silver at Tokyo 2020 and could pose a strong challenge on home soil alongside the United States and Canada, among others.\n\nAll six World Rugby regions are represented among the 24 teams that have secured their place in Paris via the HSBC SVNS Series, regional qualifying competitions and the World Rugby Sevens Repechage. Three teams are making their Olympic debuts: Uruguay and Samoa are competing in the men's competition for the first time, while Ireland are making their Olympic debut.\n\nRUGBY SEVENS MEDIA GUIDE >>\n\nWorld Rugby Chairman Sir Bill Beaumont said: \"We are expecting a landmark event as rugby sevens kicks off the Paris 2024 Olympic Games at the Stade de France on Wednesday.\"\n\nThe Paris Games are the crown jewel of the greatest rugby sevens season in history. The stage is set for what will be a spectacular celebration of our sport at its peak.\n\nOver six days of intense and exciting competition, the stars of rugby sevens will shine brightly in front of what promises to be a record crowd for rugby sevens at these open Games, bringing our sport, its values and the joy of the Olympic Games to record audiences around the world. Paris is ready. Rugby is ready. Let's kick off these Games in style!\n\nAur\u00e9lie Merle, Paris 2024 Executive Director of Sports, added: \"This will be a great day for rugby sevens, and it's also a great day for us at Paris 2024, with the start of the rugby and football competitions. This is our kick-off. The stage is set and what a stage!\"\n\nWe want this third appearance of rugby sevens at the Olympic Games to be an exceptional and large-scale showcase for an exciting sport and its unique fan culture. With Paris 2024, we hope to add another dimension to the famous party culture that rugby sevens is renowned for. This fits perfectly with our vision of making these Games a spectacular and popular celebration.\n\nFrance captain Paulin Riva said: \"We feel good and we are very happy that rugby is the first discipline. We want to get this medal. We have had an incredible season and we have a lot of confidence and experience against the big teams like Argentina, Fiji and New Zealand, so we feel good and we just want to get on the pitch on Wednesday. There will be a great atmosphere at the Stade de France and we are very happy to see that for rugby sevens.\"\n\nRegarding Antoine Dupont's impact, he added: \"We think Antoine is the best player in the world and when he is on the pitch we feel a lot of confidence and that is very good for the team.\"\n\nNew Zealand women's team co-captain Sarah Hirini said: \"I'm really happy to be back and competing at another top event. It's so special and feels like the first time with the energy and excitement around the Olympic Village and within our team.\"\n\nWe're going to try to do something that's never been done before, try to make history and enjoy the moment. I'm really proud that we're playing in front of a huge crowd, it's the most important thing we can achieve as a sevens sport. I was there for the Men's World Cup last year and being in that packed stadium is going to be electric.\n\nJerry Tuwai, a two-time Olympic champion and captain of the Fiji men's team, said: \"Our main goal is to come and defend our Olympic gold medal. I'm very happy to be back. I was very emotional when I was left out of some of the events in the series, but I'm really happy to be here and aim for another gold medal.\"\n\nIt will be a great atmosphere and the pressure from the public will be on us so that we can play against France. Dupont is a very good player who influences people and makes the other players around him vibrate. He has my respect, like everyone else.\n\nAustralian women's captain Charlotte Caslick said: \"We're really excited. After a great camp in Montpellier and a great end to the sevens season, we're finally here and we can't wait to get started. We played really well but we also felt we had a lot of work to do, so we came home and did just that, working really hard to prepare.\"\n\nIt's really special to have our family and friends at the Stade de France and to be able to share our experience with them. We've been practicing ways to communicate with each other despite the noise of the crowd on the pitch, which is a good thing. Even being at the 2023 Rugby World Cup in that crowd last year was already incredible.\n\nAll teams will be competing for gold, but we have the legend Sharni Smale and we would like to give her a fairytale ending in addition to winning gold. We all want to win, of course, but we have that extra motivation!\n\nIreland captain Harry McNulty said: \"It's been really nice to settle into the Olympic Village. Everyone is relaxed and calm, enjoying these special moments and we can't wait to get going. Everyone can beat everyone and my ambition is to lead the team to a confident and competitive performance.\"\n\nIt's great that we're getting the Games off to a flying start and I think it's what the sport needs. We've got such an incredible sport that reaches all over the world and rugby sevens is so exciting and thrilling that we can't wait to get started.\n\nU.S. women's team captain Naya Taper said: \"Having this many fans in the stadium is both exciting and a little scary, at least for me. Tokyo 2020 was great, but we didn't have fans in the stands to cheer us on or boo us, so I'm preparing for that excitement. We've been preparing and we're really looking forward to getting started.\"\n\nWe are very pleased with what we were able to accomplish last season, but we know that the past is the past and the present is the present. We come here with the lessons and confidence we gained from last season, and we are taking that into this tournament.\n\nWe won't be the only ones and no one will give us an easy game, but we come here to make our friends and family proud and stand on this podium with a gold medal, not a silver medal, not a bronze medal, but a gold medal.\n\nIt's really inspiring to play on such a big platform. It fits our philosophy that women can be an inspiration to everyone watching, young boys and girls, fans and new audiences, by being someone they want to follow and be like and trying to be a role model on and off the field.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_World_Cup",

Our style of play has been opened up and our teamwork and communication. And our decision-making, that is another thing that has been opened up, too.\"\n\nAt the sevens series Grand Final in Madrid won by France, Fiji reeled off victories over Ireland, South Africa and New Zealand in the style Kolinisau wanted.\n\n\"I was asked before, 'What would success look like to you?' and I said, 'I just wanted the boys to play the Fijian way and play together as a team',\" he said.\n\nArgentina were the surprise package of the regular season, topping the standings thanks to three wins in the first four tournaments.\n\nLos Pumas are drawn in Pool B alongside Australia, Samoa and Kenya.\n\nPool A features Rio 2016 silver medallists New Zealand, world number two-ranked side Ireland, South Africa and Japan.\n\nThere is no British men's team after South Africa sealed the final spot through a repechage tournament in Monaco.", "source": {"uri": "namibian.com.na", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Namibian"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The equally highly anticipated women's tournament follows on 28-30 July.\n\nAustralia and Samoa will have the honour of kicking off the Olympic competition as they take to the field for the first match at 15:30 local time CET (GMT+2) on 24 July. Hosts and recent SVNS Grand Final champions France inspired by global superstar Antoine Dupont will get their campaign under away the USA at 16:30 followed by double Olympic champions Fiji who face debutants Uruguay at 17:00.\n\nIreland and Great Britain will get play under way in the women's tournament at 15:30 on 28 July, while reigning champions New Zealand play Challenger champions China and SVNS Grand Final champions Australia kick off against South Africa.\n\nThe competition format sees all teams play three pool matches with eight teams qualifying for the quarter-finals in the evening session of the second day of competition, before the third day sees the semi-finals and the all-important medal matches as Olympic dreams are realised and broken.\n\nRugby sevens is expected to be one of the highlights of Paris 2024, following the resounding success of Rugby World Cup 2023 in France. All the action will take place at Stade de France, which was the venue for the opening match and final of Rugby World Cup 2023.\n\nFiji have famously won both men's gold medals to date - Rio being their first ever Olympic medal - but five different nations have won the men's SVNS Series since 2016, while Argentina were crowned SVNS 2024 league winners and France claimed the inaugural SVNS Grand Final title in Madrid last month, demonstrating the depth of competitiveness.\n\nAustralia and New Zealand have lifted the women's sevens game to new levels, winning one Olympic gold each, while France took silver at Tokyo 2020 and could provide a strong challenge on home soil, along with the likes of the USA and Canada among others.\n\nAll six World Rugby regions are represented among the 24 teams who secured their spots in Paris via the HSBC SVNS Series, regional qualification competitions and the World Rugby Sevens Repechage. There are three Olympic debutants with Uruguay and Samoa competing for the first time in the men's competition while Ireland's women make their first Olympic appearance.\n\nWorld Rugby Chairman Sir Bill Beaumont said: \"We anticipate a 'coming of age' event as rugby sevens kicks off the Paris 2024 Olympic Games at Stade de France on Wednesday.\n\n\"The Paris Games is the jewel in the crown of the biggest-ever sevens season. The stage is set for what will be a spectacular celebration of our sport at its breathtaking best.\n\n\"Over six days of highly competitive and compelling action, the stars of sevens will shine brightly in front of what promises to be a record crowd for Sevens at these 'Games wide open', taking our sport, its values and the joy of the Olympic Games to record audiences around the world. Paris is ready. Rugby is ready. Let's kick these Games off in style!\"\n\nParis 2024 Executive Sports Director Aurelie Merle added: \"It is going to be a big day for Rugby Sevens, and it's also a big day for us at Paris 2024, with the start of competitions in both rugby and football. It is our 'kick-off'. The stage is set - and what a stage!\n\n\"We want to make sure this third appearance of Rugby Sevens at the Olympic Games is an exceptional and high-profile showcase of a thrilling sport and its unique fan culture. With Paris 2024, we are hoping to add another dimension to the famous party culture that Rugby Sevens is known for. It's a perfect fit with our vision to make these Games a spectacular and popular celebration.\"\n\nFrance men's captain Paulin Riva said : \"We feel good and we are very excited that rugby is the first discipline. We want to catch this medal. We have had an amazing season and we have a lot of confidence and experience against the big teams like Argentina, Fiji and New Zealand so we feel good and we just want to get on to the field on Wednesday. It will be a big atmosphere in Stade de France and we are very happy to see this for rugby sevens.\"\n\nOn Antoine Dupont's impact he added: \"We think Antoine is the best player in the world and when he is on the pitch we feel a lot of confidence and it's very good for the team.\"\n\nNew Zealand women's co-captain Sarah Hirini said: \"I'm really happy to be back and at another pinnacle event. It is so special and it feels just like the first time with the energy and excitement around the Olympic Village and within our team.\n\n\"We're going to try and do something that's never been done before, trying to create history while enjoying the moment. I'm really proud that we will be playing in front of huge crowds, that's the most important thing that we can achieve as a sport for the sevens. I was here for the men's World Cup last year and being in that packed stadium is going to be electric.\"\n\nDouble Olympic champion and Fiji men's captain Jerry Tuwai said : \"The main goal for us is to come and defend our Olympic gold. I'm very happy to be back. It was emotional for me when I was left out for some Series events but I'm really happy to be here and going for another gold medal.\"\n\n\"It will be a great atmosphere and the pressure from the crowd will be on us to deliver when we play against France. Dupont is a very good player that influences people and makes other players around him tick and he has my respect, just the same as everyone else.\"\n\nAustralia women's captain Charlotte Caslick said: \"We are very excited. After a great camp in Montpellier and a great end of the sevens season, we are finally here and can't wait to begin. We have been playing very well but also felt we had a lot to work to do so we went home and did just that, working really hard to get ready.\n\n\"It is so special to have our family and friends in Stade de France and having the ability to share our experience with them. We have been practicing ways to be able to communicate between each other despite the crowd noise on the field, which is good. Even being part of Rugby World Cup 2023 in that crowd last year was already amazing.\n\n\"All the teams will be going for gold, but we have got the legend Sharni Smale and we would love to send her off with a fairytale finish as well as winning the gold. We obviously all want to win but have this extra motivation!\"\n\nIreland men's captain Harry McNulty said: \"It's been really nice to settle in to the Olympic Village. Everyone is feeling relaxed and calm, enjoying these special moments and we can't wait to kick off. Everyone can beat everyone and my ambition is to lead the squad to a confident performance and be competitive.\n\n\"It's amazing that we are kicking off the Games and I think it's what the sport needs. We have such an amazing sport that reaches all the way around the world and sevens is so exciting with many thrills and we can't wait to get started.\n\nUSA women's captain, Naya Taper said: \"Having so many fans in the stadium is both exciting and somehow scary, at least for me. Tokyo 2020 was great but we didn't have the fans in the stands cheering or booing for us so I'm getting ready for that stimulation. We have been preparing and are definitely looking forward to begin.\n\n\"We are very happy with what we have been able to achieve last season but we know the past is the past and the present is the present. We are coming here with the learning and the confidence we gained from last season, bringing it to this tournament.\n\n\"Bearing in mind we won't be the only one and nobody will give us an easy game but we are coming out here to make our friends and family proud and get on that podium with a gold medal, not a silver, not a bronze, but a gold medal.\n\n\"It is really inspiring to be playing on such a big platform. It relates to our philosophy that women can be a source of inspiration for anyone watching, young boys and young girls, fans and new publics, being somebody they want to follow behind and strive to be like and trying to be a role model on and off the field.\".", "source": {"uri": "pina.com.fj", "dataType": "news", "title": "pina.com.fj"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

(Photo By Stephen McCarthy/Sportsfile via Getty Images)\n\nYes, rugby is an Olympic sport. Not in the full 15-a-side version of the game but in the shortened, exciting format of rugby sevens.\n\nRugby Sevens was introduced to the Olympics Games at Rio 2016. Fiji men won the nation's first-ever gold medal - men's or women's - by beating Team GB, who took silver. South Africa secured bronze over Japan. Australia won gold in the women's event while New Zealand took silver and Canada took bronze.\n\nIn Tokyo 2020, Fiji men defended their title with New Zealand taking silver and Argentina taking bronze. New Zealand women earned gold, France took silver and Fiji took bronze.\n\nInterestingly, the 15-a-side union format of the game was an Olympic sport but was last featured 100 years ago. A men's event debuted at the 1900 Games, also in Paris, with home side France taking gold. The last 15s medal was awarded at the 1924 Game, again in Paris, with the USA taking the title.\n\nThis means that the defending Olympic champions in rugby union are technically the USA.\n\nRugby at the Paris 2024 Olympics: Need to know\n\nRugby Sevens captains at Paris 2024 Olympic Games (Getty Images)\n\nParis 2024 will see 12 men's and 12 women's teams compete in Rugby Sevens for gold.

But captain Jerry Tuwai, a two-time gold medalist, said that \"a lot of things have changed since Osea came back,\" with the team focused on defending their Olympic \"legacy.\"\n\nAt the sevens series grand final in Madrid, Fiji reeled off victories over Ireland, South Africa and New Zealand in the style Kolinisau wanted. \"I was asked before, 'What would success look like to you?' and I said, 'I just wanted the boys to play the Fijian way and play together as a team',\" he said.\n\nArgentina were the surprise package of the regular season, with three wins in the first four tournaments.

The fact that there's been an alignment in all the structures within France from Toulouse to the French federation has helped him.\n\n\"I ask myself why more French XV players haven't done it - Damian Penaud and Gabin Villiere would be brilliant at the sport - but the fans are in for something special in Paris.\n\n\"Antoine is a guy that is absolutely box office in every way possible.\n\n\"It was a massive call to miss the Six Nations, but the seamlessness which he has made the transition has been absolutely brilliant.\n\n\"We don't know what a ceiling looks like for him yet because he continues to break through it.\"\n\nLes Bleus are in the same pool as Fiji - gold medallists at Rio 2016 and Tokyo 2020 - with the early action at the Stade de France getting under way on Wednesday, two days before the opening ceremony of Paris 2024.\n\nThe medals will be decided on Saturday, with Fiji and France expecting stern competition from Australia, Argentina and New Zealand.\n\nIreland feature XVs international Hugo Keenan and Connacht's Andrew Smith following their reintegration back into the sevens programme and will also hope to be in the mix for medals.\n\nBut Great Britain, silver medallists eight years ago, are absent after losing to South Africa at last month's repechage final in Monaco.\n\nHabana, who just missed out on South Africa selection for Rio after switching his focus to sevens, said: \"It's going to be such an exciting tournament.\n\n\"The alignment of rugby sevens with an Olympic format has definitely caused a massive sense of excitement on the field.\n\n\"Whether it's South Africa, New Zealand, Fiji or the French, it's been great for the game and just seeing the continual growth of sevens globally has been brilliant.\n\n\"I obviously fell short in going to Rio, mostly because of injury, but knowing that I small part in helping the BlitzBoks go on to win a bronze medal there was pretty special.\"\n\nThe women's rugby sevens tournament

Fiji aims for a three-peat", "body": "Volunteers are seen inside the State de France ahead of the 2024 Summer Olympics, Sunday, July 21, 2024, in Saint-Denis, France.\n\nAntoine Dupont had one ambition when he switched his focus to what he described as the French Olympic project: a gold medal for the host nation.\n\nThe world's premier rugby player will get France's Olympic medal campaign underway Wednesday, two days before the official opening ceremony of the Paris Games, when his team takes on the United States in the first Pool B game of the rugby sevens competition.\n\nStade de France will be at capacity and most of the attention will be on Dupont when the French kick off in the third game of a three-day men's tournament. It'll be the same on Day 2 when the French meet two-time Olympic champion Fiji, the most formidable force in rugby's condensed sevens format.\n\nThe U.S. men face France and Fiji on Wednesday, giving them a unique view of a pair of title favorites.\n\n\"When we get in that environment, besides maybe 14 players, give or take 50 friends and family coming in supporting us, the staff and the people watching on TV -- we know it's going to be us versus 69,000 people,\" U.S. captain Kevon Williams said of facing the French. \"We're OK with that, we've been preparing for that, we've honed in and said, 'It's just us.'\n\n\"All we'll see is the French jersey, so we'll be ready.\"\n\nFrance hosted the Rugby World Cup last year and the national team again failed to lift the title. It has been a finalist three times at the sport's biggest tournament.\n\nWith undisputed star of the 15-a-side game joining its ranks, France has peaked in the rugby sevens format in 2024. Dupont helped the French win a spot on the world series for the first time in 19 years, and then capped it with a victory in the series finale in Madrid.\n\nThe French evolution has coincided with an unusually lean season for Fiji.\n\nAlthough Fiji head coach Osea Kolinisau is confident the team's bid for an Olympic three-peat will overshadow the inconsistent world series run by the time the men's sevens medals are awarded Saturday.\n\n\"We plan to keep that legacy going,\" Kolinisau said. \"We can claim it solely.\"\n\nKolinisau led Fiji to its first ever Olympic gold medal as captain in 2016 at Rio de Janeiro, where rugby sevens was featured on the Olympic program for the first time.\n\nKolinisau was rushed into the coaching role earlier this year to resurrect Fiji's men's program, and he reinstated what he calls the \"Fijian way\" -- or instinct -- for sevens rugby: \"High tempo, high risk.\"\n\nIn the series finale, the Fijians posted wins over Ireland, South Africa and New Zealand before losing to France in the semifinals.\n\nFor Argentina, a grand final loss to France in Madrid was a setback after it topped the league stage of the world series, winning three of the seven stops.\n\nFor the Olympic tournament, Argentina is grouped with Australia, Samoa and Kenya in Pool B. No. 2-ranked Ireland, Tokyo silver medalist New Zealand, Rio bronze medalist South Africa and Japan are in a tough Pool A. Uruguay joins France, Fiji and the U.S. in Pool C.\n\nThe top two teams in each group and the two best third-place teams advance to the quarterfinals, meaning two-thirds of the 12 starters are still in medal contention when the knockout phase starts.\n\nThat's the stage where the Fijians have come into their own at the two previous Olympics.\n\nJerry Tuwai has been integral in Fiji's first two Olympic runs and the 35-year-old playmaker was recalled by Kolinisau two months ago after almost a year out of the team.\n\nA two-time Olympic champion, Sevens World Cup winner and player of the decade, Tuwai has embraced Kolinisau's approach ahead of the Paris Games.\n\n\"Our style of play has been opened up and our teamwork and communication. Our decision making -- that's another thing that opened up, too,\" Tuwai said. \"After two Olympic gold medals, these boys have shown they always show up in very big tournaments.\n\n\"We have this legacy to defend.\"\n\nAP Summer Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/2024-paris-olympic-games", "source": {"uri": "idahostatejournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Idaho State Journal"}, "authors":

Our style of play has been opened up and our teamwork and communication. And our decision-making, that is another thing that has been opened up, too.\"\n\nAt the sevens series Grand Final in Madrid won by France, Fiji reeled off victories over Ireland, South Africa and New Zealand in the style Kolinisau wanted.\n\n\"I was asked before, 'What would success look like to you?' and I said, 'I just wanted the boys to play the Fijian way and play together as a team',\" he said.\n\nArgentina were the surprise package of the regular season, topping the standings thanks to three wins in the first four tournaments.\n\nLos Pumas are drawn in Pool B alongside Australia, Samoa and Kenya.\n\nPool A features Rio 2016 silver medallists New Zealand, world number two-ranked side Ireland, South Africa and Japan.\n\nThere is no British men's team after South Africa sealed the final spot through a repechage tournament in Monaco.\n\nPool A: Ireland, Japan, New Zealand, South Africa\n\nPool B: Argentina, Australia, Kenya, Samoa\n\nPool C: Fiji, France, Uruguay, United

The equally highly anticipated women's tournament follows on 28-30 July.\n\nVIEW POOLS, SCHEDULE AND SQUADS >>\n\nAustralia and Samoa will have the honour of kicking off the Olympic competition as they take to the field for the first match at 15:30 local time CET (GMT+2) on 24 July. Hosts and recent SVNS Grand Final champions France inspired by global superstar Antoine Dupont will get their campaign under away the USA at 16:30 followed by double Olympic champions Fiji who face debutants Uruguay at 17:00.\n\nIreland and Great Britain will get play under way in the women's tournament at 15:30 on 28 July, while reigning champions New Zealand play Challenger champions China and SVNS Grand Final champions Australia kick off against South Africa.\n\nThe competition format sees all teams play three pool matches with eight teams qualifying for the quarter-finals in the evening session of the second day of competition, before the third day sees the semi-finals and the all-important medal matches as Olympic dreams are realised and broken.\n\nRugby sevens is expected to be one of the highlights of Paris 2024, following the resounding success of Rugby World Cup 2023 in France. All the action will take place at Stade de France, which was the venue for the opening match and final of Rugby World Cup 2023.\n\nFiji have famously won both men's gold medals to date - Rio being their first ever Olympic medal - but five different nations have won the men's SVNS Series since 2016, while Argentina were crowned SVNS 2024 league winners and France claimed the inaugural SVNS Grand Final title in Madrid last month, demonstrating the depth of competitiveness.\n\nAustralia and New Zealand have lifted the women's sevens game to new levels, winning one Olympic gold each, while France took silver at Tokyo 2020 and could provide a strong challenge on home soil, along with the likes of the USA and Canada among others.\n\nAll six World Rugby regions are represented among the 24 teams who secured their spots in Paris via the HSBC SVNS Series, regional qualification competitions and the World Rugby Sevens Repechage. There are three Olympic debutants with Uruguay and Samoa competing for the first time in the men's competition while Ireland's women make their first Olympic appearance.\n\nRUGBY SEVENS MEDIA GUIDE >>\n\nWorld Rugby Chairman Sir Bill Beaumont said: \"We anticipate a 'coming of age' event as rugby sevens kicks off the Paris 2024 Olympic Games at Stade de France on Wednesday.\n\n\"The Paris Games is the jewel in the crown of the biggest-ever sevens season. The stage is set for what will be a spectacular celebration of our sport at its breathtaking best.\n\n\"Over six days of highly competitive and compelling action, the stars of sevens will shine brightly in front of what promises to be a record crowd for Sevens at these 'Games wide open', taking our sport, its values and the joy of the Olympic Games to record audiences around the world. Paris is ready. Rugby is ready. Let's kick these Games off in style!\"\n\nParis 2024 Executive Sports Director Aurelie Merle added: \"It is going to be a big day for Rugby Sevens, and it's also a big day for us at Paris 2024, with the start of competitions in both rugby and football. It is our 'kick-off'. The stage is set - and what a stage!\n\n\"We want to make sure this third appearance of Rugby Sevens at the Olympic Games is an exceptional and high-profile showcase of a thrilling sport and its unique fan culture. With Paris 2024, we are hoping to add another dimension to the famous party culture that Rugby Sevens is known for. It's a perfect fit with our vision to make these Games a spectacular and popular celebration.\"\n\nFrance men's captain Paulin Riva said : \"We feel good and we are very excited that rugby is the first discipline. We want to catch this medal. We have had an amazing season and we have a lot of confidence and experience against the big teams like Argentina, Fiji and New Zealand so we feel good and we just want to get on to the field on Wednesday. It will be a big atmosphere in Stade de France and we are very happy to see this for rugby sevens.\"\n\nOn Antoine Dupont's impact he added: \"We think Antoine is the best player in the world and when he is on the pitch we feel a lot of confidence and it's very good for the team.\"\n\nNew Zealand women's co-captain Sarah Hirini said: \"I'm really happy to be back and at another pinnacle event. It is so special and it feels just like the first time with the energy and excitement around the Olympic Village and within our team.\n\n\"We're going to try and do something that's never been done before, trying to create history while enjoying the moment. I'm really proud that we will be playing in front of huge crowds, that's the most important thing that we can achieve as a sport for the sevens. I was here for the men's World Cup last year and being in that packed stadium is going to be electric.\"\n\nDouble Olympic champion and Fiji men's captain Jerry Tuwai said : \"The main goal for us is to come and defend our Olympic gold. I'm very happy to be back. It was emotional for me when I was left out for some Series events but I'm really happy to be here and going for another gold medal.\"\n\n\"It will be a great atmosphere and the pressure from the crowd will be on us to deliver when we play against France. Dupont is a very good player that influences people and makes other players around him tick and he has my respect, just the same as everyone else.\"\n\nAustralia women's captain Charlotte Caslick said: \"We are very excited. After a great camp in Montpellier and a great end of the sevens season, we are finally here and can't wait to begin. We have been playing very well but also felt we had a lot to work to do so we went home and did just that, working really hard to get ready.\n\n\"It is so special to have our family and friends in Stade de France and having the ability to share our experience with them. We have been practicing ways to be able to communicate between each other despite the crowd noise on the field, which is good. Even being part of Rugby World Cup 2023 in that crowd last year was already amazing.\n\n\"All the teams will be going for gold, but we have got the legend Sharni Smale and we would love to send her off with a fairytale finish as well as winning the gold. We obviously all want to win but have this extra motivation!\"\n\nIreland men's captain Harry McNulty said: \"It's been really nice to settle in to the Olympic Village. Everyone is feeling relaxed and calm, enjoying these special moments and we can't wait to kick off. Everyone can beat everyone and my ambition is to lead the squad to a confident performance and be competitive.\n\n\"It's amazing that we are kicking off the Games and I think it's what the sport needs. We have such an amazing sport that reaches all the way around the world and sevens is so exciting with many thrills and we can't wait to get started.\n\nUSA women's captain, Naya Taper said: \"Having so many fans in the stadium is both exciting and somehow scary, at least for me. Tokyo 2020 was great but we didn't have the fans in the stands cheering or booing for us so I'm getting ready for that stimulation. We have been preparing and are definitely looking forward to begin.\n\n\"We are very happy with what we have been able to achieve last season but we know the past is the past and the present is the present. We are coming here with the learning and the confidence we gained from last season, bringing it to this tournament.\n\n\"Bearing in mind we won't be the only one and nobody will give us an easy game but we are coming out here to make our friends and family proud and get on that podium with a gold medal, not a silver, not a bronze, but a gold medal.\n\n\"It is really inspiring to be playing on such a big platform. It relates to our philosophy that women can be a source of inspiration for anyone watching, young boys and young girls, fans and new publics, being somebody they want to follow behind and strive to be like and trying to be a role model on and off the field.\"", "source": {"uri": "world.rugby", "dataType": "news", "title": "world.rugby"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The Aussie women kick off on July 29.\n\nBack to the men.\n\nThe competition for medals at the Olympics is incredibly difficult. Arguably there are only four teams Japan, Samoa, Kenya and Uruguay who are not in the picture to potentially jag a medal at the games.\n\nBut they sure could mess it up for the other teams. The remaining eight teams are all in with a chance of a medal. While Argentina, France and New Zealand are probably the favourites for Gold.\n\nWhile they have had a poor season and sacked their coach, you cannot discount double Olympic gold medal winners Fiji.\n\n2024 PARIS OLYMPICS 7S POOLS - Men\n\nPool A: New Zealand, Ireland, South Africa, Japan,\n\nPool B: Argentina, Australia, Kenya, Samoa,\n\nPool C: Fiji, France, USA, Uruguay\n\nThe term 'pool of death' is always bandied about at the Olympics and World Cups. The Boomers are in one and the Opals and Matildas have got seriously tough pools.\n\nOf the three rugby sevens pools, the Aussie sevens men are in the lesser 'pool of death'. In saying that all the teams in the men's pool are more than capable of getting a win over the Aussies.\n\nThe order of play for the Aussie men is Samoa on Wednesday night (11.30pm AEST), Kenya in the early hours of Thursday morning (3am AEST) and Argentina on Thursday evening (10.30PM AEST).\n\nSamoa is a really odd team they have the physique and skill to be powerhouses in this sport.\n\nFor some reason, they just cannot get it together. One minute they can blow away any team, the next they get towelled up.\n\nAs a consequence, every time the Aussie men play them there is more than a bit of fear and anxiety as to which Samoan team is going to turn up.\n\nNext is Kenya who have a bunch of super athletes, big and fast but probably lack the skills and with all due respect the rugby smarts. In saying that, the last time they met Kenya got the win.\n\nSo games one and two will entail more anxiety and stress than we need.\n\nOlympic Games Paris 2024. Every Event. Ad-free. Live & On Demand. 4K. 8 Exclusive International channels from Eurosport, Viacom18 and Sky NZ, only on Stan Sport.\n\nIf the Aussie sevens men do not defeat both teams, they sure do not deserve to get a medal; Samoa finished 11th out of 12 teams in the World Series and Kenya is not even in the World Series.\n\nOne thing you can be assured of coach John Manenti will not allow any iota of overconfidence by the team.\n\nThe last team in their pool is Argentina. They have been on a multi-year mission to develop their rugby sevens team to be world beaters and they are.\n\nOut of the seven World Series tournaments this season, they started with silver, gold, gold and gold.\n\nPlus in the grand finale in Madrid, they were runner-up to France after defeating New Zealand in the semi-final.\n\nMake no bones about it they are very good. Arguably they have the best player in the world Marcos Moneta - although Antoine Dupoint is making a late surge for that title. Moneta got injured earlier in the season but is back for the Olympics.\n\nWith him out Argentina did not win another World Series tournament. It is an understatement to say Australia will have to play very well to defeat them.\n\nAs for the team itself, it is a good blend of youth, experience, speed, size and canny playmakers.\n\nIn terms of experience, they have two players who are fronting up for their third Olympics, stalwarts Captain Nick Malouf and Henry Hutchinson.\n\nReturning for their second Olympics are Maurice Longbottom, Nathan Lawson and Dietrich Roache.\n\nNow cutting to the chase Longbottom is the star. He has had a few injuries this season but we need him to win a medal. It's a clich\u00e9 but he is an X factor player and when on, is world class.\n\nGenerally speaking, you would describe the men's squad as good and solid. They must graft and work for their wins.\n\nThe key is effort across the board by all the players in every minute of every game. They do not have all the flash and pizazz of Fiji, South Africa, New Zealand, Argentina or South Africa.\n\nIn saying that the addition of Corey Toole and Mark Nawaqanitawase do add a bit of that something extra. We will see if they can deliver that something extra. Fingers and toes crossed that they can.\n\nAll the work has been done by coach Manenti, his coaching crew and the players. Now we see how it plays out on the biggest stage.", "source": {"uri": "theroar.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Roar"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Dupont took a gamble of missing the Six Nations to make the French Olympic team, a move many traditionalists criticized.\n\nBut the scrum-half went on to help France to two wins on the World Rugby Sevens Series, including victory in the Madrid finals. In between, he skippered his club Toulouse to Top 14 and Champions Cup glory in the 15-a-side code.\n\n\"Antoine is an exceptional player and there's currently no equivalent in terms of putting in performances,\" Clerc said Tuesday, a day ahead of the start of the men's Olympic rugby sevens tournament at the Stade de France.\n\n\"He will attract a new, different audience. Sevens has long suffered from the 15-a-side calendar, where it has been very tricky for players to play both codes.\" Clerc, capped 67 times by France, added: \"Rugby sevens has improved some of Antoine's skills, even though they were already at a very high level.\n\n\"And rugby sevens will benefit from Antoine's image, his desire to highlight rugby sevens and to show that winning an Olympic medal in rugby is worth the same as the Top 14 title or Champions Cup crown.\"\n\nTransition between sevens and 15s\n\nWorld Rugby Chief Executive Alan Gilpin said Dupont's apparent ease at transitioning between 15-a-side rugby and the abbreviated game was unmatched, but should also be encouraged. \"It should be possible in the big global-stage moments in sevens and 15s that the players can try and play in both,\" Gilpin said.\n\n\"What Antoine Dupont is doing is utterly incredible. To make that transition not just once in a season, but to do it back and forth, from being player of the match in the Champions Cup one weekend to then leading France to victory in the sevens grand finale in Madrid, was incredible.\n\n\"And again, I think it inspires more players to want to do that.\" Clerc agreed that Dupont's transition had shown the way. \"You can see that it is possible for 15s players to play sevens,\" he said. \"It was considered a sport that was too specific, too tough to transition, but with precise management and intelligent coaching, it's possible.\"\n\nFanny Horta, who captained the French women's team to silver in Tokyo, said Dupont \"has an aura on the pitch, he's someone who gives the impression of being calm\".\n\n\"He gives confidence to the France team. His teammates have raised their own game since he joined the squad.\" Dupont's presence has certainly boosted the rugby competition, with a 69,000 sell-out crowd for each of the three days of action. -- AFP", "source": {"uri": "kuwaittimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Kuwait Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "https@kuwaittimes.com", "name": "https", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Clerc", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vincent Clerc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_sevens", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rugby sevens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_union_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rugby union positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Dupont", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Antoine Dupont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Rugby_Champions_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "European Rugby Champions Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Rugby_Sevens_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Rugby Sevens Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Nations_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Six Nations Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_14", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Top 14"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toulouse", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toulouse"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toulouse"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Rugby", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Rugby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cap (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rugby union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_of_the_match", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Player of the match"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_Union", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby Union", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Football", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://kuwaittimes.com/kuwaittimes/uploads/images/2024/07/23/134061.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9755459", "eventUri": "eng-9755459", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

The game is played on a standard rugby field, but matches are significantly shorter, with each half lasting only seven minutes. This results in high-intensity action and often high-scoring games. The reduced number of players and the abbreviated match time emphasise speed, agility, and strategic play, making rugby sevens a thrilling spectacle.\n\nThe objective of rugby sevens is the same as in traditional rugby: to score points by carrying the ball over the opponent's try line or by kicking it between the goalposts. A try, worth five points, is scored when a player grounds the ball in the in-goal area. After a try, the scoring team has the opportunity to add two more points with a conversion kick. Additionally, teams can score points through penalty goals and drop goals, each worth three points.\n\nThe structure of the Olympic rugby sevens tournament is designed to showcase the sport's rapid pace and unpredictability. Teams are divided into pools, and each team plays every other team in their pool. The top teams from each pool, along with the best-performing runners-up, advance to the knockout stages. This format ensures that every match is crucial, as teams vie for a spot in the quarterfinals, semifinals, and ultimately, the final.\n\nRugby sevens made its Olympic debut at the 2016 Rio Games, marking the return of rugby to the Olympics after a 92-year absence. Rugby union had previously been included in four Olympic Games from 1900 to 1924. The reintroduction of rugby, in its sevens format, was met with widespread enthusiasm, and the tournament in Rio was a resounding success. Fiji's men's team and Australia's women's team made history by winning the first-ever Olympic gold medals in rugby sevens.\n\nThe inclusion of rugby sevens, which will be played at the Stade de France, has had a significant impact on the sport's global popularity. The fast-paced, entertaining nature of sevens has attracted new fans and participants, helping to grow rugby's presence worldwide. Moreover, the Olympic platform has provided a stage for emerging rugby nations to compete against established powerhouses, contributing to the sport's development.\n\nIn preparation for the Olympics, teams undergo rigorous training and participate in the World Rugby Sevens Series, an annual series of international tournaments. This series allows teams to hone their skills, develop strategies, and gain valuable experience against top-tier competition. The World Rugby Sevens Series also serves as a qualifying pathway for the Olympics, with teams earning points based on their performance throughout the season.\n\nAs rugby sevens continues to evolve, its presence at the Olympics remains a highlight for both players and fans. The sport's blend of athleticism, strategy, and excitement makes it a perfect fit for the Olympic stage. With each edition of the Games, rugby sevens further cements its status as a must-watch event, showcasing the best of rugby's thrilling and dynamic nature. Whether you're a longtime rugby enthusiast or new to the sport, the Olympic rugby sevens tournament promises an unforgettable experience filled with drama, skill, and passion.", "source": {"uri": "insidethegames.biz", "dataType": "news", "title": "www.insidethegames.biz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rugby union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_sevens", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rugby sevens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiji_national_rugby_sevens_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fiji national rugby sevens team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Drop goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Rugby_Sevens_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Rugby Sevens Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Olympic medal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_Union", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby Union", "wgt": 46}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "wgt": 39}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Football", "wgt": 49}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Olympics", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://cdn.dmcl.biz/media/image/300308/c/GettyImages-2163049108.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9755459", "eventUri": "eng-9755459", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

Sevens has long suffered from the 15-a-side calendar, where it has been very tricky for players to play both codes.\"\n\nClerc, capped 67 times by France, added: \"Rugby sevens has improved some of Antoine's skills, even though they were already at a very high level.\n\n\"And rugby sevens will benefit from Antoine's image, his desire to highlight rugby sevens and to show that winning an Olympic medal in rugby is worth the same as the Top 14 title or Champions Cup crown.\"\n\nTransition between sevens and 15s\n\nWorld Rugby Chief Executive Alan Gilpin said Dupont's apparent ease at transitioning between 15-a-side rugby and the abbreviated game was unmatched, but should also be encouraged.\n\n\"It should be possible in the big global-stage moments in sevens and 15s that the players can try and play in both,\" Gilpin said.\n\n\"What Antoine Dupont is doing is utterly incredible. To make that transition not just once in a season, but to do it back and forth, from being player of the match in the Champions Cup one weekend to then leading France to victory in the sevens grand finale in Madrid, was incredible.\n\n\"And again, I think it inspires more players to want to do that.\"\n\nClerc agreed that Dupont's transition had shown the way.\n\n\"You can see that it is possible for 15s players to play sevens,\" he said.\n\n\"It was considered a sport that was too specific, too tough to transition, but with precise management and intelligent coaching, it's possible.\"\n\nFanny Horta, who captained the French women's team to silver in Tokyo, said Dupont \"has an aura on the pitch, he's someone who gives the impression of being calm\".\n\n\"He gives confidence to the France team. His teammates have raised their own game since he joined the squad.\"\n\nDupont's presence has certainly boosted the rugby competition, with a 69,000 sell-out crowd for each of the three days of action.\n\n\"Antoine is an exceptional player,\" added Clerc, who was part of the French sevens team that won a series leg in Paris in 2005.\n\n\"He might only play a couple of minutes, but he's capable of turning a match on its head. He brings a freshness and enthusiasm which is gripping.\n\n\"I hope his presence brings in a new audience, fans who will stay in the world of rugby, who will continue to watch the sport, be it sevens or 15s.\"", "source": {"uri": "rfi.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "RFI"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Clerc", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vincent Clerc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_sevens", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rugby sevens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_union_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rugby union positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Dupont", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Antoine Dupont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Rugby_Champions_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "European Rugby Champions Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_14", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Top 14"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Rugby_Sevens_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Rugby Sevens Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Nations_Championship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Six Nations Championship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rugby union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toulouse", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Toulouse"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toulouse"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Rugby", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Rugby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cap (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_of_the_match", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Player of the match"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_Union", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby Union", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Football", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://s.rfi.fr/media/display/6eb82fc0-48f0-11ef-b0cf-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/9d11835950e24e5af28191f20b57a4cf64e52cf2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9755459", "eventUri": "eng-9755459", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

That's also true in sevens, but they're not the same.\" The French sevens team, which he joined at the beginning of the year, opens the competitions for French athletes at their home Olympic Games, on Wednesday, July 24, against the United States at the Stade de France. And the star has discovered \"a humbling discipline,\" where certain countries \"with little means or appetite for rugby union in their countries manage to achieve great results and performances.\"\n\nHaving become an Olympic sport once again at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games, rugby is \"reaching the age of maturity,\" said a delighted Alan Gilpin, head of World Rugby, the international federation. After Rio and Tokyo 2021 - which was deprived of spectators due to the Covid-19 pandemic - \"the sevens rugby tournament is taking place for the first time in a country with a strong rugby culture,\" continued Gilpin.\n\nThe competition was originally scheduled to take place at Jean-Bouin, the home of Stade Fran\u00e7ais in the 16 arrondissement of Paris. But the organizers's gamble of \"filling the Stade de France six times\" paid off. \"It's a venue that rugby knows well,\" explained Gilpin. \"And this huge stage is going to put the spotlight on our discipline, for both men and women.\" For as far-fetched as it may seem, the women's tournament - from July 28 to 30 - will be \"the first outing for a women's team sport\" in the venue, pointed out Aur\u00e9lie Merle, executive director of sports competitions for Paris 2024.\n\nWith rugby union having struggled to break out of its own backyard for years, the sport has opted for \"sevens\" as a way of expanding its audience and fan base away from the \"rugby lands.\" At the Paris Olympics, the women's teams from China and Brazil and the men's teams from Kenya and Spain will be competing. \"This is a golden opportunity,\" said Gilpin. \"Being part of the Olympic program gives rugby a chance to develop in countries where there was no interest before.\" He gave the example of India, where the discipline is now part of the sports practiced at schools thanks to this status.\n\n\"Sevens is much more universal because it's much easier to 'get' 12 good players than 23 very good players to play union,\" added Antoine Duval, whose 2022 book Une histoire de sevens (\"A history of sevens\"), is dedicated to the sport. \"Since its beginnings in Scotland at the end of the 19 century, this sport has been designed to be played over one, two or three days.\" This is ideal for an Olympic format (in comparison, the 2023 World Cup for rugby union was stretched over two months),

The Paris games should be no exception, especially given France's own great rugby tradition.\n\nWhile the conventional 15-a-side game has only ever featured at four Olympics (1900, 1908, 1920 and 1924), sevens debuted at the Rio de Janeiro games in 2016, capturing fans with its festive atmosphere and fast-running athleticism.\n\nAnd although the traditionally strong rugby-playing nations tend to dominate the sevens version, it also allows the \"minnows\" to compete and sometimes surprise the heavyweights.\n\nSo, which teams are favourites to win medals in Paris? To answer this we've used a suite of statistical models known as Rugby Vision. This modelling system has outperformed bookmakers when forecasting outcomes for Rugby World Cup games.\n\nRugby Vision has three components:\n\nBy examining the number of times in the 10,000 simulations that each team \"wins\" the tournament, we can calculate the probability of each team winning the gold medal. Both the men's and women's tournaments have been analysed this way.\n\nMedal probabilities for each of the 12 qualified teams in the men's tournament, which begins on 24 July, are displayed below.\n\nArgentina, which dominated the 2023-24 SVNS, is favourite to win (28.1 percent) and has a 60.4 percent chance of earning any medal. France, which has home advantage and won the 2023-24 SVNS grand final, is second favourite (22.3 percent), followed by Ireland (12.5. percent), which was a consistent performer in the 2023-24 SVNS.\n\nTraditional sevens powerhouses Fiji (which won gold at the two previous Olympics) and New Zealand are fourth and fifth favourites respectively. This reflects mixed performances by both teams at the 2023-24 SVNS.\n\nThe women's tournament kicks off on 28 July, with New Zealand (34.8 percent) and Australia (31.1 percent) most likely to win gold. Between them, these two teams won seven of the eight 2023-24 SVNS tournaments.\n\nFrance is third favourite (25.9 percent), with the US (4.0 percent) and Canada (2.2 percent) rounding out the five most likely winners.\n\nAlthough New Zealand has a higher chance than Australia of winning gold, Australia has a higher chance of winning any medal. This is because the algorithm rates Australia a (slightly) stronger team than New Zealand - but New Zealand is expected to have an easier semi-final opponent.\n\nOf course, the algorithm's favourite does not always win. At the 2023 Rugby World Cup, for example, Rugby Vision ranked New Zealand likeliest to win, with South Africa second.

Our algorithm uses 10,000 simulations to rank the teams", "body": "Niven Winchester, Professor of Economics, Auckland University of Technology\n\nThe speed, skill and flair on display in rugby sevens makes it an ideal Olympic sport. The Paris games should be no exception, especially given France's own great rugby tradition.\n\nWhile the conventional 15-a-side game has only ever featured at four Olympics (1900, 1908, 1920 and 1924), sevens debuted at the Rio de Janeiro games in 2016, capturing fans with its festive atmosphere and fast-running athleticism.\n\nAnd although the traditionally strong rugby-playing nations tend to dominate the sevens version, it also allows the \"minnows\" to compete and sometimes surprise the heavyweights.\n\nSo, which teams are favourites to win medals in Paris? To answer this we've used a suite of statistical models known as Rugby Vision. This modelling system has outperformed bookmakers when forecasting outcomes for Rugby World Cup games.\n\nRugby Vision has three components:\n\nBy examining the number of times in the 10,000 simulations that each team \"wins\" the tournament, we can calculate the probability of each team winning the gold medal. Both the men's and women's tournaments have been analysed this way.\n\nMedal probabilities for each of the 12 qualified teams in the men's tournament, which begins on July 24, are displayed below.\n\nArgentina, which dominated the 2023-24 SVNS, is favourite to win (28.1%) and has a 60.4% chance of earning any medal. France, which has home advantage and won the 2023-24 SVNS grand final, is second favourite (22.3%), followed by Ireland (12.5.%), which was a consistent performer in the 2023-24 SVNS.\n\nTraditional sevens powerhouses Fiji (which won gold at the two previous Olympics) and New Zealand are fourth and fifth favourites respectively. This reflects mixed performances by both teams at the 2023-24 SVNS.\n\nThe women's tournament kicks off on July 28, with New Zealand (34.8%) and Australia (31.1%) most likely to win gold. Between them, these two teams won seven of the eight 2023-24 SVNS tournaments.\n\nFrance is third favourite (25.9%), with the USA (4.0%) and Canada (2.2%) rounding out the five most likely winners.\n\nAlthough New Zealand has a higher chance than Australia of winning gold, Australia has a higher chance of winning any medal. This is because the algorithm rates Australia a (slightly) stronger team than New Zealand - but New Zealand is expected to have an easier semi-final opponent.\n\nOf course, the algorithm's favourite does not always win. At the 2023 Rugby World Cup, for example, Rugby Vision ranked New Zealand likeliest to win, with South Africa second. South Africa beat New Zealand in the final.\n\nThe same uncertainty applies at the Olympic sevens. While Argentina is favourite to win the men's tournament, there is still a 72% chance another team will take home the gold. Upsets should be expected - that is why watching sport is so enthralling.\n\nThe author acknowledges the assistance of Jensen Fiskin, whose data collection contributed to the forecasts included in this article.", "source": {"uri": "home.nzcity.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "NZCity"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_sevens", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rugby sevens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rugby football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland_University_of_Technology", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Auckland University of Technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rio de Janeiro"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rio de Janeiro"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winchester", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Winchester"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Winchester"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmaker_(gambling)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bookmaker (gambling)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rugby World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiji", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fiji"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Fiji"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volleyball_at_the_1968_Summer_Olympics_\u2013_Women's_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volleyball at the 1968 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_Union", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby Union", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Football", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 58}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9755459", "eventUri": "eng-9755459", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-24", "textStart": 1276, "textEnd": 1283}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-28", "textStart": 1859, "textEnd": 1866}], "sentiment": 0.419607843137255, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

Dupont helped the French win a spot in the World Series for the first time in 19 years, and then capped it with a victory in the series finale in Madrid.", "source": {"uri": "euronews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Euronews English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_sevens", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rugby sevens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uzbekistan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Uzbekistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uzbekistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Morocco"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Morocco"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Republic", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dominican Republic"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Dominican Republic"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-\u00c9tienne", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint-\u00c9tienne"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-\u00c9tienne"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_(footballer,_born_1991)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oscar (footballer, born 1991)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athletic_Bilbao", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Athletic Bilbao"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportivo_Alav\u00e9s", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deportivo Alav\u00e9s"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caribbean"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiji", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fiji"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Fiji"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rugby World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cap (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rugby union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Dupont", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Antoine Dupont"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_Union", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby Union", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Football", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/08/59/81/66/1200x675_cmsv2_b1dcfdc0-c14b-5188-bd88-664a8def78e0-8598166.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9755459", "eventUri": "eng-9755459", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

It was emotional for me when I was left out for some Series events but I'm really happy to be here and going for another gold medal,\" he said.\n\n\"It will be a great atmosphere and the pressure from the crowd will be on us to deliver when we play against France. Dupont is a very good player that influences people and makes other players around him tick and he has my respect, just the same as everyone else.\"\n\nFiji faces Uruguay at 3am on Thursday and then battle USA at 6.30 am.\n\nTheir last game is against France at 1.30am on Friday.\n\nFijian rugby commentator Satish Narain believes the team can still achieve their goal of winning their third medal.\n\nIt will be tough and will require teamwork throughout.\n\n\"One thing is for sure judging from the intense competition and the improvement of teams in the recent HSBC SVNS Series that the battle in Paris will be brutal,\" he said.\n\nHe said the pressure will be on two teams, more than any other - Fiji, two-time gold winners, and France who play at home.\n\n\"That alone can be a tough one to handle. But Fiji have shown that they are made for the big dance and did that well in Tokyo to defend gold,\" he said.\n\n\"The only thing different from Tokyo to Paris will be that Japan didn't make it to the playoffs but I expect France to be there and tipped to be on the opposite side of the draw to Fiji and who knows a possible Fiji - France final.....that will be swashbuckling.\"\n\nNarain said Paris presents a huge test for Kolinisau who aims to become the first man in the world to have won an Olympic gold as a player and a coach.\n\nHere are some scenarios that Narain believes Fiji will go through, either way:\n\n\"It is going to be tough. Even to get a bronze medal, it is going to be cut-throat right throughout. Our side needs to take one game at a time.\n\n\"Nothing is Impossible. If you believe, you can achieve!\"\n\nWorld Rugby Chairman Sir Bill Beaumont said they are excited for the competition in Paris.\n\n\"We anticipate a 'coming of age' event as rugby sevens kicks off the Paris 2024 Olympic Games at Stade de France,\" he told World Rugby media.\n\n\"The Paris Games is the jewel in the crown of the biggest-ever sevens season. The stage is set for what will be a spectacular celebration of our sport at its breathtaking best.\"\n\nParis 2024 executive sports director Aurelie Merle said \"it is going to be a big day for Rugby Sevens, and it's also a big day for us at Paris 2024, with the start of competitions in both rugby and football. It is our 'kick-off'. The stage is set - and what a stage!\"\n\nFrance men's captain Paulin Riva said they are out to win the event.\n\n\"We want to catch this medal. We have had an amazing season and we have a lot of confidence and experience against the big teams like Argentina, Fiji and New Zealand so we feel good and we just want to get on to the field,\" he said.\n\n\"It will be a big atmosphere in Stade de France and we are very happy to see this for rugby sevens.\"\n\nOn Antoine Dupont's impact he added: \"We think Antoine is the best player in the world and when he is on the pitch we feel a lot of confidence and it's very good for the team.\"\n\nThe 12 teams are ready. The men will take centre stage for the next four days.", "source": {"uri": "rnz.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "RNZ"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

This will be the first time in 100 years that Paris have been chosen as the host city.\n\nAs previously mentioned the Opening Ceremony which symbolises the start of the Games takes place on Friday, July 26.\n\nThe ceremony will go down in history since it will mark the first time it will not be staged inside a stadium. Instead it will take place on the River Seine at 7:30pm local time (6:30pm UK time).\n\nHowever some of the Games' events will have already got up and running at that stage.\n\nThe football and rugby group games will begin on Wednesday, July 24, while archery and handball events are set to begin on Thursday, July 25.\n\nThe real start date of the 2024 Paris Olympics is Wednesday, July 24 when the football and rugby sevens group stage games get underway\n\nFrench captain Antoine Dupont (pictured furthest right) will lead France's rugby sevens team\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nThe opening event of the tournament is a curtain raiser.\n\nAction from the Olympics gets underway with the rugby sevens.\n\nFrance led by Antoine Dupont clash with the US in the opening game of the competition.\n\nThe French who didn't take part in the men's sevens in Tokyo will be eager to impress and are one of the favourites to claim gold in the event.\n\nIn the football, the French men's team coached by Arsenal and French legend Thierry Henry also take on Team USA in their group opener in Marseille.\n\nTeam GB will not feature in the both the men's football or rugby, whilst the women will only be present in the rugby sevens and not the football.\n\nBoth the men's rugby team and women's football team failed to qualify for the games, whilst the men's football team has not featured at the sporting event since London 2012 as the home nations have been unable to agree on their participation.", "source": {"uri":

Argentina, Kenya, Samoa and Uruguay are solely represented by their men's teams, and all four will be looking to go all the way.\n\nSo too, of course, will be the USA Eagles, as a relatively experienced side arrives in Paris led by a legend of sevens in the form of Perry Baker. However's it's Fiji who are the team to beat having won the gold medal in both 2016 and 2021, while other big-hitters like New Zealand and South Africa will certainly be in contention.\n\nOne side who won't be causing the Eagles any worries are Great Britain, who despite winning bronze in Rio and recording a fourth-place finish in Tokyo, failed to qualify for the 2024 Games after losing the 2023 European Games title to Ireland, as the men in green secured an historic victory.\n\nThere's still plenty to get excited for ahead of the men's rugby sevens tournament at the 2024 Olympics, and The Sporting News has all the details you'll need to ensure you don't miss a second of the action.\n\nIt's one of the events in which the US men's team could be near the top of medal contention, and as such there's a plethora of TV coverage of the rugby sevens at this year's Paris Olympics.\n\nBroadcasting of the men's sevens will be held both live and on catch-up with TV channels including NBC, USA Network, CNBC and E! - while for fans who want to stream the action from the Stade de France there's also several options, with Peacock and Fubo being your best bet to ensure the best coverage either live or on catch-up, the latter of which are currently offering a FREE trial to new subscribers.\n\nWith eight straight days of men's and women's rugby coming up from Paris, the men take centre stage first, as their group stage begins on Wednesday, July 24 from 3:30 p.m. local time (CEST).\n\nThere's a bumper 12 matches on offer across all three of the four-team groups on the first day, with six to round off the action on Thursday, July 25 and decide the knockout stages.\n\nThese will begin on the same day with the lower seeded matches and quarterfinals between sides still in medal contention, and after a day off on July 26, all 12 of the placings will be determined with the 11th, 9th, 7th and 5th-place matches before the semifinals, bronze and gold medal matches on Saturday, July 27, with the final kicking off at 7:45 p.m. local time (CEST).\n\n12 teams have qualified for this years Olympic Games in Paris, and will be split across three groups - A, B, and C. Playing each side in their group once, the top two teams head straight into the quarterfinals, and are joined by the two highest-ranked third-placed teams in the respective groups.\n\nThe three sides who finish bottom of their groups, plus the unsuccessful third-placed side, enter the playoff matches to decide 9th-12th place, while the four losing quarterfinalists do likewise to decide who finishes from 5th to 7th. The four winners from the last eight head into the semifinals.\n\nIn the last four, the two winners head into the gold medal match which brings the curtain down on men's sevens at Paris 2024, with the losing pair playing-off to decide who wins the bronze medal.

The Japanese side suffered defeat to New Zealand in the other Pool A clash this afternoon.\n\nAlthough the Olympics opening ceremony is not until Friday, soccer and rugby sevens preliminary rounds got underway for logistical reasons in Paris and around the country.\n\nThe shorter but speedier rugby format allows teams to play more than one match a day and the medals in the men's and women's tournaments will be decided before the 81,000-capacity stadium hosts the athletics events from August 1st.\n\nScores of fans lined up outside the sun-kissed arena for the rugby sevens, the majority in blue to support the host nation.\n\n\"It's been excitement, emotions, impatience ... I've been looking forward to the start,\" said 44-year-old France fan Matthieu.\n\n\"We're at the heart of the biggest event that we've been waiting a long time to see.\"\n\nAnother France fan, Pauline from Toulouse, arrived with three kids in tow and there was no question who they were most keen to watch when they screamed, \"Antoine Dupont!\".\n\nThe 27-year-old is a former world player of the year in the fifteen-man format and made the switch to Sevens after last year's Rugby World Cup, immediately elevating France to title contenders with his versatility.\n\nThe loudest cheer of the day was reserved for when Dupont, who has mostly come on as an impact replacement, was announced in the starting lineup in the Pool C opener against the United States.\n\nThe crowd were treated to a thriller of a match with American Marcus Tupuola scoring a late try to lock up the scores at 12-12. Madison Hughes missed the conversion leaving the two teams to share the spoils.\n\n\"It was a huge atmosphere,\" Dupont said. \"It's not common for us to play in this kind of stadium, we have to embrace this atmosphere, to embrace this pressure, to play better in the next game.\"\n\nFiji are seeking a hat-trick of golds to underline their dominance in their national sport and they later went top of Pool C with a thumping 40-12 victory over Uruguay, who were no match for the speed and power of the Pacific islanders.\n\nEarlier, Australia kicked off their Pool B campaign with a 21-14 win over Samoa fired by two tries from veteran flyer Henry Hutchison.\n\nArgentina were roundly booed by the crowd when they took to the pitch for their Pool B match against Kenya in what was perhaps a spillover from the 2022 soccer World Cup final between France and the South Americans.\n\nSuch was their disdain for the men in powder blue-and-white, the crowd jeered even when Argentina scored their five tries while loudly cheering on every Kenya move.\n\nArgentina were unperturbed as they toyed with the African side and eased to a 31-12 victory.\n\nThe pool games continue in the evening session.\n\nRSS Syndicated Content Published: Wed 24 Jul 2024, 6:24 PM Last updated: Wed 24 Jul 2024, 7:48 PM", "source": {"uri": "westmeathindependent.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Westmeath

Our algorithm uses 10,000 simulations to rank the teams", "body": "Source: The Conversation (Au and NZ) - By Niven Winchester, Professor of Economics, Auckland University of Technology\n\nThe speed, skill and flair on display in rugby sevens makes it an ideal Olympic sport. The Paris games should be no exception, especially given France's own great rugby tradition.\n\nWhile the conventional 15-a-side game has only ever featured at four Olympics (1900, 1908, 1920 and 1924), sevens debuted at the Rio de Janeiro games in 2016, capturing fans with its festive atmosphere and fast-running athleticism.\n\nAnd although the traditionally strong rugby-playing nations tend to dominate the sevens version, it also allows the \"minnows\" to compete and sometimes surprise the heavyweights.\n\nSo, which teams are favourites to win medals in Paris? To answer this we've used a suite of statistical models known as Rugby Vision. This modelling system has outperformed bookmakers when forecasting outcomes for Rugby World Cup games.\n\nBy examining the number of times in the 10,000 simulations that each team \"wins\" the tournament, we can calculate the probability of each team winning the gold medal. Both the men's and women's tournaments have been analysed this way.\n\nArgentina lead the men's pack\n\nMedal probabilities for each of the 12 qualified teams in the men's tournament, which begins on July 24, are displayed below.\n\nArgentina, which dominated the 2023-24 SVNS, is favourite to win (28.1%) and has a 60.4% chance of earning any medal. France, which has home advantage and won the 2023-24 SVNS grand final, is second favourite (22.3%), followed by Ireland (12.5.%), which was a consistent performer in the 2023-24 SVNS.\n\nTraditional sevens powerhouses Fiji (which won gold at the two previous Olympics) and New Zealand are fourth and fifth favourites respectively. This reflects mixed performances by both teams at the 2023-24 SVNS.\n\nNZ versus Australia for the women's gold\n\nThe women's tournament kicks off on July 28, with New Zealand (34.8%) and Australia (31.1%) most likely to win gold. Between them, these two teams won seven of the eight 2023-24 SVNS tournaments.\n\nFrance is third favourite (25.9%), with the USA (4.0%) and Canada (2.2%) rounding out the five most likely winners.\n\nAlthough New Zealand has a higher chance than Australia of winning gold, Australia has a higher chance of winning any medal. This is because the algorithm rates Australia a (slightly) stronger team than New Zealand - but New Zealand is expected to have an easier semi-final opponent.\n\nOf course, the algorithm's favourite does not always win. At the 2023 Rugby World Cup, for example, Rugby Vision ranked New Zealand likeliest to win, with South Africa second. South Africa beat New Zealand in the final.\n\nThe same uncertainty applies at the Olympic sevens. While Argentina is favourite to win the men's tournament, there is still a 72% chance another team will take home the gold.

The hosts featuring Antoine Dupont, arguably the world's greatest 15-a-side player, were left to rue several errors in possession that opened the door for their lesser-ranked opponents.\n\nFrance opened their account halfway through the first half, a brilliant offload out of contact releasing Jordan Sepho for a try in the corner. But the home crowd was stunned into silence just before the half-time whistle as US flyer Lucas Lacamp broke through the French defence for a long-range effort that earned his team a 7-5 lead at the break.\n\nFrance restored their advantage practically from the kick-off in the second half, Rayan Rebbadj powering over after a move that started with a clever Dupont offload. But a powerful American counter-ruck after France were caught isolated deep in their half allowed Marcus Tupuola to stroll in for a try that secured them a deserved draw.\n\n\"We lacked precision, especially close to the try line. We were knocked back a lot, especially at the start of the match,\" said France captain Paulin Riva. \"We didn't manage to finish, messed up every time we should have finished,\" he added. The result blows open pool C, which also features Fiji, always a force in sevens despite a disappointing season by their standards. With trademark free-flowing rugby, the Fijians had far too much pace and power for Uruguay, a Joji Nasova first-half double killing off the match as a contest before the break.\n\nThe South Americans put up a spirited effort, however, with two tries of their own but were no match for Fiji who laid down an impressive marker to the rest of the field. Earlier, Australia squeezed past a determined Samoa side 21-14, courtesy of a Henry Hutchison double to get their pool B campaign off to a winning start.\n\nThe other pool B match saw Argentina roundly booed by the home faithful before running out comfortable 31-12 winners against Kenya.\n\nWide-open tournament\n\nFrance were billed as the team to beat in the men's competition, with superstar Dupont one of the pin-ups of the Games. But Fiji have won both Olympic Golds since the sport was introduced at the Rio Games in 2016 and showed they will be no pushover.\n\nFiji and France will face each other in a mouthwatering clash on Thursday. In what is a wide-open tournament for the men, stiff competition will also likely come from traditional rugby powers New Zealand, South Africa, Argentina, and Ireland.\n\nIreland edged out South Africa 10-5 in a hard-fought clash in pool A, widely seen as the \"group of death\" that also features New Zealand, who destroyed Japan 40-7. With the global exposure that comes with the Olympics and playing to a sold-out Stade de France, World Rugby's chief executive Alan Gilpin has described the tournament as a \"coming of age\" moment for the sport.\n\n\"There has never been a greater spotlight on the sport,\" Gilpin said ahead of the competition. The women's tournament starts on Sunday, with Australia and New Zealand well-placed to battle for the gold. -- AFP", "source": {"uri": "kuwaittimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Kuwait Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "https@kuwaittimes.com", "name": "https", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiji", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fiji"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Fiji"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rugby union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_sevens", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rugby sevens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Dupont", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Antoine Dupont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jordan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Tupuola", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marcus Tupuola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Captain (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "South America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Rugby", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World Rugby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samoa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Samoa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_of_death", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Group of death"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Hutchison", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Henry Hutchison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_Union", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby Union", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Football", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Tournaments", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://kuwaittimes.com/kuwaittimes/uploads/images/2024/07/24/134558.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9755459", "eventUri": "eng-9755459", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

embrace this atmosphere, to embrace this pressure, to play better in the next game.\"\n\nFiji are seeking a hat-trick of golds to underline their dominance in their national sport and they later went top of Pool C with a thumping 40-12 victory over Uruguay, who were no match for the speed and power of the Pacific islanders.\n\nEarlier, Australia kicked off their Pool B campaign with a 21-14 win over Samoa fired by two tries from veteran flyer Henry Hutchison.\n\nArgentina were roundly booed by the crowd when they took to the pitch for their Pool B match against Kenya in what was perhaps a spillover from the 2022 soccer World Cup final between France and the South Americans.\n\nSuch was their disdain for the men in powder blue-and-white, the crowd jeered even when Argentina scored their five tries while loudly cheering on every Kenya move.\n\nArgentina were unperturbed as they toyed with the African side and eased to a 31-12 victory.", "source": {"uri": "breakingnews.ie", "dataType":

Jordan Conroy also scored, while Selvyn Davids answered for the Blitzboks.\n\nKennedy, inevitably, got his second - a 75-metre solo run-in - to kick-start the Irish scoring against Japan late in the day. He turned provider for the first of Chay Mullins' double with another lonely, long distance run. Captain Harry McNulty, Niall Comerford, Mark Roche and Zac Ward all contributed points to a 40-5 win.\n\nMeanwhile, Akuila Rokolisoa, Fehi Fineanganofo and Ngarohi McGarvey-Black scored two each as New Zealand cruised to a 40-12 win over a hard-working Japan in their opener.\n\nShotaro Tsuoka scored a stunner in response - overtaking two New Zealand defenders to chase down a beautifully weighted kick, but their chances were few and far between. Taiga Ishida repeated the kick-chase trick for a late consolation.\n\nMoses Leo finished off arguably the try of the day in Wednesday's final match, a 100-metre, multi-pass, coast-to-coast affair as New Zealand beat South Africa 17-5 in a physical encounter. He raced in a second time midway through the second half, while McGarvey-Black also scored.\n\nPOOL B\n\nAustralia and Argentina won both their matches to set themselves en route to the knockout phase.\n\nA Henry Hutchison brace and one for Nathan Lawson helped Australia to a 21-14 victory over Samoa in the tournament's opening match. But it was the Pacific Islanders who had the Stade de France crowd on their side, as Motu Opetai intercepted a pass to run in the competition's first try from 50 metres.\n\nAfter Hutchison and Lawson had put Australia clear, Faafoi Falaniko had the last word for Samoa, finishing a sweeping move to get the crowd on their feet again.\n\nAustralia later eased to a 21-7 win over a spirited Kenya - James Turner getting the scoreboard moving on the opening attack, with Lawson and Corey Toole also crossing.\n\nKenya had earlier lost 31-12 to Argentina, after taking the lead thanks to the pace of Chrisant Ojwang. Two Agustin Fraga tries either side of half-time handed the advantage to the South Americans, which they pushed home with three late touchdowns.\n\nArgentina went two for two with a comfortable 28-12 win over Samoa. Mat\u00edas Osadczuk scored twice, while Matteo Graziano, and Joaquin Pellandini also touched down.\n\nPOOL C\n\nFiji showed why they are double Olympic champions, while hosts France made hard work of the opening day.\n\nCheered on in a packed Stade de France, the hosts could not turn pressure into points against USA as the sides shared four tries in a hard-fought 12-12 draw, only the second in Olympic history after USA and Australia finished all-square in the women's competition in Rio.\n\nLes Bleus beat Uruguay 19-12 in their second and final outing of day one, but again made hard work of it - twice conceding the lead and surviving a nervy finish, as Ignacio Facciolo and Juan Gonzalez cancelled out tries from Antoine Zeghdar and Antoine Dupont, who showed tremendous strength to finish off a 75-metre move. Jefferson-Lee Joseph raced through the defence to put France into a winning lead.\n\nFiji kicked off their title defence with a statement 40-12 win over Uruguay. Joji Nasova scored twice, while Waisea Nacuqu, Iowane Teba, Ponepati Loganimasi, and Selesitino Ravutaumada got one apiece as they ran South American defenders ragged.\n\nA second command performance followed as the sun went down, as Fiji staged a festival of attacking, offloading rugby to beat USA 38-12.\n\nAfter Orrin Bizer put the Eagles ahead, Teba, Ravutaumada and Nacuqu all got their second tries of the day, while Kaminieli Rasaku, Josaia Raisuqe and Iosefo Masi got their names on the scoresheet, before Perry Baker scored a consolation try.\n\nMeanwhile, rugby sevens ignited the Olympic Games Paris 2024 with a spectacular first day of action in front of the largest single day crowd in rugby sevens history with 69,000 fans packed into Stade de France and millions more watching around the world.\n\nSVNS league winners Argentina, Australia, Ireland, New Zealand and double Olympic champions Fiji secured their places in Thursday's quarter-finals with pair of opening day wins.\n\nFrance superstar Antoine Dupont scored a vital try to help the hosts beat Uruguay after they began their campaign with a tense draw against the USA earlier in the day.\n\nParis 2024 Organising Committee President Tony Estanguet and New Zealand's Rugby World Cup winner Dan Carter were among a host of famous faces present at Stade de France to witness the start of the sporting action at these Olympic Games.\n\nThe men's sevens continues on Thursday with the final round of pool matches from 14:00 local time (GMT+2) before the quarter-finals begin at 20:00. Teams then take a rest on 26 July as the Games Opening Ceremony takes place before finals day on 27 July. The highly anticipated women's competition runs from 28-30 July.\n\nWorld Rugby Chairman Sir Bill Beaumont said: \"We wanted to get the Games off to a spectacular start, but, wow, today was special. A single-day record crowd for rugby sevens, an incredible atmosphere, and of course, scintillating rugby. Sevens brought its A game, and the world was watching.\n\n\"I'd also like to pay tribute to the late Bernard Lapasset, who was instrumental in bringing rugby sevens to the Olympics and the Olympics to Paris. He would have loved today, and it was great to welcome his family here. I'm sure he was looking down on a packed Stade de France and smiling.\"\n\nFrance's Antoine Dupont commented on the huge crowd support: \"The atmosphere was good and helped us to win. Maybe we did not do our best but hopefully it is going to help us more in the next game.\n\n\"There were too many technical and tactical errors but we have to have hope. It is good to see that our mindset was good across the team. The essentials are there.\n\n\"We need to raise our level. If not, we will not go too far. We need to be focused on the game and not distracted because we are capable of better. In the last minutes we showed our mindset is strong.\"\n\nFiji captain and double Olympic gold medallist Jerry Tuwai said: \"The first game is always hard, our bodies were not that fired up yet. But we improved on that and we also improved the technical stuff, like how to handle the kick-off.\n\n\"We were given the opportunity to play well. Team USA is a very good team. We respect them and we knew that coming to the game they would give everything.\"\n\nAustralia's Mark Nawaqanitawase on returning to rugby sevens from 15s to compete at the Olympic Games: \"It's a bit of a shock to be back here at the Olympic Games, but this is such a great country for rugby so it's pretty cool to be able to play the opening game of the tournament. I really want to do my country proud and bring back the gold medal.\"\n\nArgentina's Gaston Revol said: \"Both games were really tough as always. The first one against Kenya was complicated because in the first half, we could not get the ball.\n\n\"We had to defend a lot and they are strong, so we felt that intensity. But in the second half we started doing our things how we needed.\n\n\"Against Samoa, I think we had a great first half, good defence and very good positions. Perhaps we made some mistakes in the second and had to defend a lot but the balance is positive for us.\"\n\nOn coming to the Games ranked world number one: \"It is hard to be in this position. We know we are on the top of the table but we know how to manage it. We knew the games were going to be tough and we had to work a lot.\"\n\nOn the reaction from the crowd: \"The support of the crowd can be huge but on the pitch, we are seven against seven - that is the important thing. I like to play at these kinds of stadiums with full stands. If they are with us, it is very motivating, but when they are against us, as we could see they are here, it is also something to enjoy. It is nice to be a focus for all these people.\".", "source": {"uri": "pina.com.fj", "dataType": "news", "title": "pina.com.fj"}, "authors": [{"uri": "pita_ligaiula@pina.com.fj", "name": "Pita

The Paris games should be no exception, especially given France's own great rugby tradition.\n\nAuthor\n\nNiven Winchester\n\nProfessor of Economics, Auckland University of Technology\n\nWhile the conventional 15-a-side game has only ever featured at four Olympics (1900, 1908, 1920 and 1924), sevens debuted at the Rio de Janeiro games in 2016, capturing fans with its festive atmosphere and fast-running athleticism.\n\nAnd although the traditionally strong rugby-playing nations tend to dominate the sevens version, it also allows the \"minnows\" to compete and sometimes surprise the heavyweights.\n\nSo, which teams are favourites to win medals in Paris? To answer this we've used a suite of statistical models known as Rugby Vision. This modelling system has outperformed bookmakers when forecasting outcomes for Rugby World Cup games.\n\nHow the prediction model works\n\nRugby Vision has three components:\n\nan algorithm uses past game statistics to rate the strength of each sevens team, based on results from the 2023-24 SVNS international tournaments and other Olympic qualification rounds\n\nthe ratings (and home advantage for France) are then used to simulate the expected outcome of each game\n\nthe tournament is simulated 10,000 times to account for uncertainty around expected outcomes.\n\nBy examining the number of times in the 10,000 simulations that each team \"wins\" the tournament, we can calculate the probability of each team winning the gold medal. Both the men's and women's tournaments have been analysed this way.\n\nArgentina lead the men's pack\n\nMedal probabilities for each of the 12 qualified teams in the men's tournament, which begins on July 24, are displayed below.\n\nArgentina, which dominated the 2023-24 SVNS, is favourite to win (28.1%) and has a 60.4% chance of earning any medal. France, which has home advantage and won the 2023-24 SVNS grand final, is second favourite (22.3%), followed by Ireland (12.5.%), which was a consistent performer in the 2023-24 SVNS.\n\nTraditional sevens powerhouses Fiji (which won gold at the two previous Olympics) and New Zealand are fourth and fifth favourites respectively. This reflects mixed performances by both teams at the 2023-24 SVNS.\n\nNZ versus Australia for the women's gold\n\nThe women's tournament kicks off on July 28, with New Zealand (34.8%) and Australia (31.1%) most likely to win gold. Between them, these two teams won seven of the eight 2023-24 SVNS tournaments.\n\nFrance is third favourite (25.9%), with the USA (4.0%) and Canada (2.2%) rounding out the five most likely winners.\n\nAlthough New Zealand has a higher chance than Australia of winning gold, Australia has a higher chance of winning any medal. This is because the algorithm rates Australia a (slightly) stronger team than New Zealand - but New Zealand is expected to have an easier semi-final opponent.\n\nOf course, the algorithm's favourite does not always win. At the 2023 Rugby World Cup, for example, Rugby Vision ranked New Zealand likeliest to win, with South Africa second. South Africa beat New Zealand in the final.\n\nThe same uncertainty applies at the Olympic sevens. While Argentina is favourite to win the men's tournament, there is still a 72% chance another team will take home the gold. Upsets should be expected - that is why watching sport is so enthralling.\n\nThe author acknowledges the assistance of Jensen Fiskin, whose data collection contributed to the forecasts included in this article.\n\nNiven Winchester does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.\n\n/Courtesy of The Conversation.

They painted their cheeks with French flags, their hair with French colors. When the home team took the field for the first time at the Paris Games, a giant banner unrolled at one end of the stadium: Allez Les Bleus, the rallying cry of the French national teams.\n\nThey'd waited for years for this. The torch isn't yet lit, but the games have effectively begun. France opened play Wednesday in the rugby sevens tournament, the first athletic event for the host nation, which took place in front of an estimated 69,000 fans in the iconic Stade de France. Though the opening match ended in a 12-12 draw against a young American squad, it had the feel of a party, setting a promising tone for the rest of the Paris Games.\n\n\"Awesome,\" said American halfback Madison Hughes, competing in his third Olympics. \"That's what you want as an athlete. You want to perform in front of passionate fans who are really into what you're doing. Absolutely loved it.\"\n\nIt was a fitting opener. Rugby sevens is a fast-paced, truncated version of one of the world's most popular sports, and it's especially beloved in France. Every session of the rugby tournament is sold out.\n\n\"Rugby in France is hot,\" said Australia's Henry Hutchison, whose team won the first match of the tournament, 21-14, over Samoa. \"But it's also a world game, so there's so many people from around the world here.\"\n\nIt is among the most anticipated Olympic sports for locals and a marquee event for organizers, who chose to stage the tournament in the country's largest stadium. The 26-year-old Stade de France was built for the 1998 FIFA World Cup, serves as the home of the men's national soccer team and has hosted three rugby World Cups. Last year's World Cup, staged across France, averaged nearly 51,000 fans over the course of 48 matches.\n\nAlan Gilpin, chief executive of World Rugby, the sport's international governing body, said more than a half-million people will file through the stadium gates for the Olympic tournament, and rugby sevens was one of the highest demand events in Paris.\n\n\"We really believe this is the Olympic Games where rugby sevens comes of age,\" he said.\n\nAurelie Merle, the executive sports director of the Paris Games, said it was no accident that the athletic competition started Wednesday with both rugby sevens and the men's soccer tournament.\n\n\"This is the DNA of our Games ...\" he said. \"It's party time at this sport.\"\n\nAmerican Orrin Bizer walked out of the stadium tunnel Wednesday focused on what promised to be a consequential match against France. But he couldn't ignore the rumbling crowd and chuckled when he somehow spotted his sister amid the sea of French flags.\n\n\"Just seeing the atmosphere, it brought the biggest smile to my face,\" he said.\n\nThe crowd erupted barely three minutes into the match when France's Jordan Sepho crossed the goal line. It fell eerily silent by half, following a try by American Lucas Lacamp and Steve Tomasin's conversion, which gave the U.S. a 7-5 advantage. The ahhs and the oohs -- and occasional sacre bleus -- perfectly matched the rhythm of the fast-pace battle.\n\n\"That was a special crowd,\" Hughes said. \"Compared to Rio and then Tokyo, which had no crowd whatsoever, it's awesome for the Olympics to have that atmosphere.\"\n\nBarely 30 seconds into the second half, France's Rayan Rebadj's try put Les Bleus back on top, but then American Marcus Tupuola crossed the goal line with 5:08 remaining to tie the match at 12-12. Hughes missed the conversion that would've put the United States on top.\n\nThe Americans, who were knocked out in the quarterfinal round three years ago in Tokyo, weren't complaining about a draw against a talented team, as they hope to advance out of group play to the knockout rounds here.\n\n\"To draw with the host nation with all those fans in the stadium, just a test of who the boys are and our character to stay in the fight,\" said U.S. captain Perry Baker.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [{"uri":

We were knocked back a lot, especially at the start of the match,\" said France captain Paulin Riva.\n\n\"We didn't manage to finish, messed up every time we should have finished,\" he added.\n\nThe result blows open pool C, which also features Fiji, always a force in sevens despite a disappointing season by their standards.\n\nWith trademark free-flowing rugby, the Fijians had far too much pace and power for Uruguay, a Joji Nasova first-half double killing off the match as a contest before the break.\n\nThe South Americans put up a spirited effort, however, with two tries of their own but were no match for Fiji who laid down an impressive marker to the rest of the field.\n\nEarlier, Australia squeezed past a determined Samoa side 21-14, courtesy of a Henry Hutchison double to get their pool B campaign off to a winning start.\n\nThe other pool B match saw Argentina roundly booed by the home faithful before running out comfortable 31-12 winners against Kenya.\n\nWide-open tournament\n\nFrance were billed as the team to beat in the men's competition, with superstar Dupont one of the pin-ups of the Games.\n\nBut Fiji have won both Olympic Golds since the sport was introduced at the Rio Games in 2016 and showed they will be no pushover.\n\nFiji and France will face each other in a mouthwatering clash on Thursday.\n\nIn what is a wide-open tournament for the men, stiff competition will also likely come from traditional rugby powers New Zealand, South Africa, Argentina, and Ireland.\n\nWith the global exposure that comes with the Olympics and playing to a sold-out Stade de France, World Rugby's chief executive Alan Gilpin has described the tournament as a \"coming of age\" moment for the sport.\n\n\"There has never been a greater spotlight on the sport,\" Gilpin said ahead of the competition.\n\nThe women's tournament starts on Sunday, with Australia and New Zealand well-placed to battle for the gold.", "source": {"uri": "gulfnews.com",

I've been looking forward to the start,\" said 44-year-old France fan Matthieu.\n\n\"We're at the heart of the biggest event that we've been waiting a long time to see.\"\n\nAnother France fan, Pauline from Toulouse, arrived with three kids in tow and there was no question who they were most keen to watch when they screamed, \"Antoine Dupont!\".\n\nThe 27-year-old is a former world player of the year in the fifteen-man format and made the switch to Sevens after last year's Rugby World Cup, immediately elevating France to title contenders with his versatility.\n\nLOUDEST CHEER\n\nThe loudest cheer of the day was reserved for when Dupont, who has mostly come on as an impact replacement, was announced in the starting lineup in the Pool C opener against the United States.\n\nThe crowd were treated to a thriller of a match with American Marcus Tupuola scoring a late try to lock up the scores at 12-12. Madison Hughes missed the conversion leaving the two teams to share the spoils.\n\n\"It was a huge atmosphere,\" Dupont said. \"It's not common for us to play in this kind of stadium, we have to

top of Pool C with a thumping 40-12 victory over Uruguay, who were no match for the speed and power of the Pacific islanders.\n\nEarlier, Australia kicked off their Pool B campaign with a 21-14 win

We know that and we're capable of doing much better,\" said Dupont after the match. \"We didn't put ourselves in a good place once again.

At least we made all our mistakes today and tomorrow can only be better,\" said Barraque.\n\nEarlier, Australia booked their quarterfinal place from pool B with two hard-fought wins over a determined Samoa and Kenya.\n\nArgentina, who were roundly booed by the home faithful, also ensured a spot in the knock-out phase, running out comfortable 31-12 winners against Kenya before beating Samoa 28-12.\n\nArgentina's flyer Marcos Moneta shrugged off the hostile crowd reception, saying: \"I don't mind that, I enjoy it.\n\n\"I don't know if (the hostility to us) was because of the World Cup (Argentina beat France in the 2022 World Cup football final) or if they just don't like us. I don't mind.\"\n\nPool A, seen as the \"group of death\", pitted rugby superpowers New Zealand, South Africa, and Ireland against each other, along with emerging force Japan.\n\nIreland and the All Blacks emerged on top, both comfortably seeing off Japan and narrowly edging out South Africa.\n\nBoth showed they will be contenders at the business end of the competition, the All Blacks in particular impressing with some slick handling in their 17-5 win over the Blitzboks.\n\nWith the global exposure that comes with the Olympics and playing to a sold-out Stade de France, World Rugby's chief executive Alan Gilpin has described the tournament as a \"coming of age\" moment for the sport.\n\n\"There has never been a greater spotlight on the sport,\" Gilpin said ahead of the competition.\n\nThe women's tournament starts on Sunday, with Australia and New Zealand well-placed to battle for the gold.\n\n\u00a9 2024 AFP", "source": {"uri": "japantoday.com", "dataType": "news",

Los Pumas won three straight events on the world circuit to establish a buffer at the top of the standings and while their form tapered off towards the end of the season, a quarterfinal finish in Singapore still proved enough to see them edge out Ireland at the top of the ladder.\n\nThe Pumas' dip in form came while the outstanding Marcus Moneta was out injured with a broken fibula, but the 24-year-old returns to the squad for their Olympic campaign; though the loss of suspended World Rugby Sevens Player of the Year Rodrigo Isgro represents a hefty blow. Still, Argentina have a potent mix of speed, power and sevens acumen and will be intent on improving on their bronze medal from Tokyo.\n\nThe two-time defending Olympic champions were not at their best across the recent World Series, with a third-placed finish the best result of a disappointing campaign. Coach Ben Gollings paid the price for those failings when he was sacked five rounds into the season, the Englishman replaced by 2016 gold medallist Osea Kolinisau. Fiji then hit rock bottom in Singapore when they failed to even reach the quarterfinals.\n\nBut the Pacific islanders rebounded in the Grand Final event in Madrid, where they finished with the bronze medal after defeating New Zealand 17-10. That result will have given Fiji a huge shot of momentum and confidence, while they retain the ability, on their day, of playing a brand of sevens that few others can match. They have also been bolstered by the return of Iosefo Masi and Selestino Ravutaumada from the Fijian Drua Super Rugby team, Jerry Tuwai, meanwhile, remains the glue that keeps the whole team together.\n\nThe Olympic hosts set about improving their sevens team and while the men's outfit took a while to get going on the recent World Series circuit, they finished with a flurry and were crowned Grand Final winners in Madrid following a 19-5 win over Argentina. That triumph followed a run of consecutive bronze, gold and silver medals from the fourth to second last events of the season.\n\nCoincidentally, it was also the time when superstar Antoine Dupont made his transition, le petit generale proving just as dangerous in the game's shorter form as he is at 15s. Les Bleus will also be buoyed by the passionate home fans in Paris, who are aching for success after Dupont and his 15s counterparts exited last year's Rugby World Cup with a heartbreaking one-point defeat in the quarterfinals.\n\nThe All Blacks Sevens have probably flown a little under the radar recently, given Argentina's rise and the drama that has gone on inside the Fijian setup. But they will have relished that status and quietly put together yet another solid World Series campaign that finished with a bang. Winners of both of the Hong Kong and Singapore events, New Zealand were then only narrowly pipped by the Pumas in the Madrid semifinals.\n\nNew Zealand have a nice blend of Olympic experience and new blood, with six players returning from their silver medal effort in Tokyo and the other six heading to their first Games. Scott Curry and Regan Ware will be contesting their third straight Games, while Akuila Rokolisoa is one of All Blacks Sevens' younger brigade set to light up Stade de France this week.\n\nCoach John Manenti's team were the last of the automatic Olympic qualifiers from the 2022-23 World Series, leaving it until the final day of competition to book their place in Paris. They had a season earlier been crowned series champions for the first time, in what was a huge achievement for a men's program that has largely been overshadowed by Australia's sensational women's squad.\n\nAustralia's 2023-24 campaign was solid, highlighted by back-to-back runner-up finishers in Cape Town and Perth in the second and third events of the season. Unfortunately for former Wallabies captain Michael Hooper, a transition at this late stage of his career proved a bridge too far, his body letting him down with injury. Australia have however been boosted by the return of speedster Corey Toole and NRL-bound Wallabies winger Mark Nawaqanitawase, the latter set to improve their restart ability and offer a bigger body with ball in hand.\n\nThe surprise-packets of the most recent World Series season, Ireland finished just two points behind Argentina despite not claiming a title all year. What they did do however, was perform on a consistent basis as they reached all seven quarterfinals of the regular season, picking up a runners-up and three further bronze medal finishes in four of the last five events to boot. While the format was changed to align more closely with the Olympics this season, Ireland's improvement from eighth to second on the overall standings was hugely impressive.\n\nBut their inability to claim a title along the way suggests that a gold medal might be a bridge too far in Paris, while they also find themselves in a fiercely competitive pool that includes New Zealand and South Africa. Still, the Irish won't be short on confidence and they have also been boosted by the arrival of 15s star Hugo Keenan, whose extra pace will be a real weapon alongside Terry Kennedy, who was the leading try-scorer [31] on the World Series circuit.\n\nGiven how successful they have been in the game's shorter format in recent years, it is hard to believe that the Blitzboks could have missed the Olympic competition altogether. After failing to qualify automatically, South Africa were then stunned by Kenya in the Africa qualifier. That meant the 2016 bronze medallists were left with only the final repechage qualifier to secure their place, which they did by beating Great Britain in Monaco in June.\n\nEarlier during the World Series, the Blitzboks failed to advance beyond the quarterfinals after they lifted the trophy at the opening event in Dubai late last year. Meanwhile, coach Sandile Ngcobo was replaced by his assistant Philip Snyman in March, though the change in stewardship did little to improve South Africa's fortunes. They do however retain some brilliant sevens players, headed by Selvyn Davids and Rosko Specman, who will provide valuable Olympic experience from Tokyo.\n\nWhile they have a few world-class sevens players, the USA will need to play right up to their collective potential and enjoy a good dose of luck along the way if they are to feature in the medal matches in Paris. The Eagles managed only one semifinal appearance on the 2023-24 World Series and were reasonably disappointing.\n\nStill, in Perry Baker they retain a genuine game-breaker while Madison Hughes returns for his third Olympic campaign alongside the speedster. With Fiji and hosts France in the same pool, the U.S. can't afford to make a slow start and won't want to leave their quarterfinal fate to the mercy of results from the other pools.\n\nQualifiers out of Asia, the Brave Blossoms are headed to their third straight Olympics. Japan were shock semifinalists in Rio, having upset New Zealand in their pool, but finished bottom of their pool without a win on home soil in Tokyo.\n\nThey were also not a part of the elite 12-nation World Series field this season, instead playing on the challenger circuit. With a lack of recent exposure against quality opposition, the Brave Blossoms will struggle to mount a serious challenge in Paris.", "source": {"uri": "espn.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title":

But as the teams ran off the field before 69,000 in Stade de France, one certainly looked more content than the other.\n\n\"It's just character,\" said Perry Baker, a former Division III college football player in his third Olympics with the Chula Vista-based U.S. team. \"It just shows what we're about and what we're going to need to get to the medal round and, if we make it there, to get on that podium.\"\n\nIt's the Holy Grail for a team desperately trying to revitalize a sport that has been largely dormant in the United States for more than a century. And a tie in the group opener against mighty France and superstar Antoine Dupont -- U.S. coach Mike Friday calls him the Patrick Mahomes of global rugby -- kept them alive for a spot in Thursday's quarterfinals even after a 38-12 spanking three hours later by defending gold medalist Fiji.\n\nNo matter what happens Thursday, the memories of silencing 69,000 in the majestic Stade de France waving flags and chanting \"Allez les Bleus\" and spontaneously singng the national anthem will endure for the boys from Chula Vista.\n\nThey've got history, these two.\n\nIt started at the 1920 Olympics just north in Antwerp, Belgium, where the Yanks upset the favored French 8-0 to claim the gold medal.\n\nParis was hosting the 1924 Games and wanted revenge. The Yanks weren't interested, with rugby quickly falling out of favor at universities amid the rise of American football. But the U.S. Olympic Committee reluctantly agreed to send a team, which was wholly based in Northern California, which meant a six-day train trip across the country to New York, followed by nine days on a ship across the Atlantic Ocean to England, followed by a ferry across the English Channel to France.\n\nThe 28-man team arrived in the port town of Boulogne, many seasick from a rough passage, and French border officials refused them entry. For 12 hours.\n\nThey were denied access to a practice field (and had to use a park outside the city instead). They were robbed of clothes and cash. People spat at them, according to historical accounts, when they walked down the street in Paris.\n\nThe Olympic rugby competition was held in May, two months before the rest of the Games, and featured only one other nation. That meant Romania \"won\" a bronze medal despite losing 59-3 against France and 37-0 against the Americans.\n\nThe showdown for the gold was held before 30,000 in Colombes Stadium. The Yanks were 20-point underdogs.\n\nAnd won 17-3.\n\nFrench fans weren't happy, reportedly hurling bottles and rocks at the visitors, then storming the field and drowning out \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" during the medal ceremony with boos and whistles. The U.S. team needed a police escort to leave.\n\nRugby was dropped from the sports program in 1928 after Frenchman Pierre de Coubertin, the founder of the modern Games and a rugby enthusiast, stepped down as International Olympic Committee president. It wouldn't be revived until rugby sevens -- a faster version where teams play two seven-minute halves, lasting about 25 minutes total in real time -- was added in 2016.\n\nWednesday was the first time they had met on the Olympic stage in a century.\n\nFrance still can't beat them.\n\n\"There's nothing better than playing in their own country,\" Steve Tomasin said. \"To be able to quiet a crowd is just as fun as hearing a full roar. We definitely fed off that.\"\n\n\"Absolutely loved it,\" Madison Hughes said. \"Loved the little boos we were getting. It would have been really nice to get that win and maybe silence the crowd a little bit more. ... I think we came in with a lot of respect. We've been an inconsistent team this year, but I think they would have known if the USA team that can show up did show up, they were in for a battle.\"\n\nTeam USA scored on its opening possession to take a 5-0 lead. Halftime score: 33-5.\n\nGroup play closes Thursday against Uruguay, which lost 40-12 against Fiji and 19-12 against France. The top two in each of the three four-team groups advance to the quarterfinals, plus the two best third-place teams. If the Americans beat Uruguay, they're in.\n\nThat's why, with the final possession and the clock expired (in rugby you keep playing until a stoppage), Friday had his team purposely kick the ball out of bounds to end the France game in a 12-12 tie.\n\n\"Ultimately, we're still in control of our destiny, and that's the key coming out of Day 1,\" Friday, the U.S. coach, said. \"We took the draw because tactically it's about getting to the quarterfinals. ... They're aware of the history, but the reality is about the here and now and the opportunity in front of them.\n\n\"It's a fully packed Stade de France, all 69,000 of them, all chanting 'Allez les Bleus,' and we silenced them after three minutes. That's exactly what you expect from somebody with a USA badge on. That's the dog within our group. We'll fight for everything.\"", "source": {"uri": "sandiegouniontribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "San Diego Union-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_zeigler@sandiegouniontribune.com",

The French, who have looked like genuine title contenders since Dupont made the switch to Sevens after last year's Rugby World Cup, had been expected to make light work of Pool C but were held 12-12 by the United States in their opener. They were trailing 7-5 to Uruguay at halftime of their second match but Dupont broke through a series of tackles to touch down under the posts and set the hosts on their way to a 19-12 victory.\n\n\"The atmosphere was good and helped us to win. Maybe we did not do our best but hopefully it is going to help us more in the next game,\" said Dupont. \"We need to raise our level. If not, we will not go too far. We need to be focused on the game and not distracted because we are capable of better.\"\n\nFiji, who have had an iron grip on the gold medal in the sport's short Olympic history, suffered no such stage fright, thrashing Uruguay 40-12 and the U.S. 38-12 to top Pool C. Argentina brushed off the hostility of the crowd, who booed their national anthem in a spillover from France's loss in the 2022 soccer World Cup final, with a 31-12 romp over Kenya and a 28-12 victory over Samoa in Pool B.\n\n\"I was surprised today when we came out against Kenya and they started to boo,\" said Argentina's Gaston Revol. \"But it is okay. I understand it is because of a soccer game or something, maybe. They hate us. But I can work with it. We will be okay.\"\n\nAustralia beat Samoa 21-14 and Kenya 21-7 to join them in the quarter-finals and will play the top-ranked Argentines on Thursday to decide which side tops the pool. Ireland locked up their spot in the last eight from Pool A with a tight 10-5 win over South Africa and a 40-5 blowout of Japan.\n\nNew Zealand, silver medallists in Tokyo three years ago, also thrashed Japan 40-12 before prevailing 17-5 in a bruising encounter with South Africa on the back of two tries from winger Moses Leo. South Africa could still progress as one of the two third-placed finishers from the three pools who will complete the quarter-final line-up.\n\nAlthough the opening ceremony of the Olympics is not until Friday, soccer and rugby sevens preliminary rounds got underway on Wednesday for logistical reasons.", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"},

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nThe Olympic Games are back and while we haven't even had the opening ceremony yet, the sporting action is already under way in Paris.\n\nWednesday saw the football and rugby sevens competitions kick off in the French capital, with some of the world's brightest talents in both sports taking part. The likes of Manchester City star Julian Alvarez and new Bayern Munich signing Michael Olise will be involved in the football, while rugby superstar Antoine Dupont will be representing the hosts in the sevens.\n\nAll eyes will be on the Frenchman as he looks to guide his side to gold having swapped sports and missed out on this year's Six Nations. But those hoping to tune in and watch him go head-to-head with Team GB are set to be sorely disappointed.\n\nREAD MORE: Why is there no Team GB football team at the Paris 2024 Olympic Games?\n\nREAD MORE: Team GB star Charlotte Dujardin pulls out of Olympics after 'error of judgement' caught on video\n\nFor the first time since rugby sevens was added to the Olympics programme eight years ago, there will be no British men's team in the competition. While they took a silver in Rio and finished fourth in Tokyo, they will play no part in Paris having failed to qualify for the Games.\n\nTeam GB missed out on their first opportunity to qualify last year, when they were beaten by Ireland at the European Games. That meant it came down last month's repechage tournament and while they topped their group and beat Spain and Tonga in the knockout stages, the British team were defeated 14-5 by South Africa in the final to end their qualification bid.\n\nOf course, Great Britain will still have representation on the rugby pitch in Paris, with the women's team getting their campaign under way against Ireland at 2.30pm on Sunday. Having been drawn in Pool B, they will also take on Australia and South Africa as they bid to make it through to the knockout round.\n\nThe squad includes Wales star Jasmine Joyce as well as Cardiff-born England international Meg Jones. Welsh full-back Kayleigh Powell has also been named as a reserve.\n\nHaving finished fourth at the last two Games, the women's team will be hoping to finally earn a place on the podium and bring home a medal.", "source": {"uri": "walesonline.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "WalesOnline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "john_jones@walesonline.co.uk", "name": "John Jones", "type": "author", "isAgency":

Chatting to all the other athletes in Team Ireland, they're all buzzing for us,\" Lennox told the Irish Independent in the Olympic Village yesterday.\n\n\"If we can set the standard for everyone, then hopefully that propels everyone going forward.\"\n\n\"We're setting the standard early,\" Ward agreed. \"So we'll go out, do our best and hopefully that comes off with a medal and sets the standard for the rest of the athletes to go and do the same.\"\n\nFull houses of 69,000 are expected at the Stade de France for every session of the rugby sevens.\n\nHugo Keenan is the only player in the Irish sevens squad who has previous experience of playing at the home of French rugby.\n\n\"Yeah, I was asking him whether the wind is going to be swirling inside. He's the only one with the knowledge,\" Lennox said.\n\nLennox is one of seven players in the sevens squad who will play at a second Olympics.\n\nWard is among the newbies and he's been feeling the vibe.\n\nThe previous day he was in the food hall filling his water bottle when he realised Rafa Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz were beside him.\n\nSelfie? Sure, he got one.\n\nWhereas tennis players could have five sets and hours to play, the margin for error is far slimmer for sevens players with games of just 14 minutes in duration. After South Africa and Japan today, Ireland are up against top seeds New Zealand in their third and final pool game tomorrow.\n\nThe top two teams from each of the three pools, as well as the two best third-placed teams, progress to tomorrow night's quarter-finals.\n\nThree years ago in Tokyo, Ireland also played South Africa in the first game, but they lost 33-14 and closed with a 10th-place overall finish.\n\nThe Blitzboks qualified for Paris through the final repechage last month, while Ireland secured their Olympic place last year.\n\n\"We're not thinking about losing tomorrow. It's not an option. We're going to go out and give it our best crack,\" Ward continued.\n\n\"We know when we're on it, we'll beat any team. We've beaten every team we've played at least once this year, so there's no one that we're not looking forward to playing.\n\n\"They [South Africa] have only had three weeks to really prepare, whereas we've had a whole year. So we're kind of one up on them in that sense.

Still trying to get it all together.\n\n\"If I get too far ahead it kind of ruins things.\"\n\nNawaqanitawase's raw pace and physicality are essential rugby sevens ingredients but it'll be his work under the high ball that could move the needle for a side capable of winning gold in a wide-open Paris field.\n\nAn inability to collect restarts crippled them against Argentina in a loss to begin the Tokyo 2021 campaign that proved deadly.\n\nIn another big move, Manenti has also welcomed back former sevens speedster Corey Toole after his brilliant Super Rugby season on the wing for the ACT Brumbies.\n\nBut there will be no fairytale finish for former Wallabies captain Michael Hooper, as the tenacious flanker's efforts to transition were scuppered by injury.", "source": {"uri":

On Wednesday, July 24, at the Stade de France stadium in Saint-Denis, the French rugby sevens team is set to take on the United States and then Uruguay. This will be their first day of an Olympic tournament for which they have made no secret of their ambitions to win. Among them is Antoine Dupont, who has set rugby union aside for an Olympic interlude. Interviewed a week earlier in a spartan hotel room in Paris' 15 arrondissement, the star of French and international rugby, overawed and earnest, spoke of the crazy challenge of juggling rugby variants. When asked, Dupont declined to comment on the case concerning two French national rugby union team players who have been charged with rape in Argentina.\n\nThe Games are a global event, a mythical one for all sports enthusiasts. We all have memories of the Olympics, of exceptional sporting moments. Not necessarily of sporting events we love, just a love of sport and our country, as we get involved in supporting French people in every discipline. Like so many others of my generation, I was inspired by Usain Bolt. He was an incredible athlete - and human being - who dominated his discipline, the highlight of athletics sprinting events, for a hell of a long time. These memories still put a smile on my face, they make me love sport. I'm lucky to be part of this generation and to have been born at the right time: The Olympic Games being held in Paris only happens once every 100 years.\n\nA mixture of the two, because we know we're going to have the public and our families in the stands. We'll be cheered on, more than other athletes or teams, in the case of rugby. This fervor also puts us in the position of being favorites in this discipline, which can put extra pressure on us, sometimes in a negative way. Above all, we're going to have to let ourselves be buoyed by the fans' positive energy. And I'll have a role to play, with my experience of having already played in a major competition on home turf [the 2023 Rugby World Cup].\n\nI started talking about it in 2021, around the time of the Tokyo Olympics. The fact that the next ones were going to be in Paris obviously gave me a boost, as did seeing that the team was performing well. I knew I was going in with the hope of a medal. Before I arrived, they had finished fourth in the world over the season, and there had been a lot of work done to improve the team.", "source": {"uri": "lemonde.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Le Monde.fr"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_union", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rugby union"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Dupont", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Antoine Dupont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-Denis,_Seine-Saint-Denis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport_of_athletics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sport of athletics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_at_the_Summer_Olympics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Football at the Summer Olympics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_sevens", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rugby sevens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_rugby_union_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France national rugby union team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usain_Bolt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Usain Bolt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_(running)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sprint (running)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rugby World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tokyo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_Union", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby Union", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Football", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally_Challenged", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Disabled/Mentally Challenged", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://img.lemde.fr/2024/07/22/685/0/4000/2000/1440/720/60/0/5554cd1_1721654388394-img-1772.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9755459", "eventUri": "eng-9755459", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-24", "textStart": 130, "textEnd": 137}], "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

To me, rugby is tough, it's rugged (and) it's inclusive,\" she said. \"That's what was modeled in my community back home.\"\n\nThe Team USA women's sevens rugby team, which is in Pool C, will take on Japan at 6:30 a.m. Alaska time and Brazil at 10 a.m. Alaska time on July 28 (CNBC, Peacock), and then France at 5:30 a.m. Alaska time on July 29 (CNBC, Peacock). All matches will be available to stream on Peacock and will be broadcast on the USA, CNBC, NBC or E networks. Placing and quarterfinal rounds will take place on July 29 and the medal round on July 30, with exact times to be determined pending results of qualifying matches.\n\n\"It's an honor to represent everybody in Alaska but especially my Alaska (rugby players) who, back home, I know are training and soaking up the last bits of summer,\" Kelter said.\n\nThe Team USA women's sevens rugby squad is heading into the 2024 Games looking like one of the top contenders fresh off a dominant showing at the Pan American Games. They claimed the first gold medal in rugby by a U.S. team in an international games since the men's team was crowned Olympic champions in 15s rugby 100 years ago in 1924.\n\n\"Success can be defined in so many different ways,\" Kelter said. \"A lot of people chase that gold, but what we're after is something bigger and something that you can't really express or have merit on. A gold medal wouldn't do it justice because it's the memories, it's the camaraderie, it's the culture we've built, and that's all been based on all the women who have come before us.\"\n\nTheir toughest competition down in Santiago, Chile, where the Pan Am Games were held, was Canada, who the U.S. defeated 19-12 in finals. Kelter believes Canada will be a \"force to be reckoned with\" if they cross paths with the U.S. again in the Olympics.\n\nIn Team USA's initial pool play to start this year's Games, they will be going up against Japan, Brazil and France.\n\n\"Having France on home soil in the pool play games will give us a full stadium to get ready for the knock-out stages,\" Kelter said. \"We're focusing on ourselves and know that momentum can shift at the drop of a hat. We're mostly focused on being present and doing what needs to be done in that present moment.\"\n\nThis year's team mantra has been \"anywhere, anytime, anyone,\" and it has inspired and propelled them throughout the international competitive season and into the Olympics.\n\n\"That's what we are going to buy into and that's what we bought into this last campaign,\" Kelter said.\n\nThe team has been training with the U20 boys team to get different looks and prepare to counter teams with more speed.\n\n\"It's been a wonderful experience and we're just grateful that when we come back with a medal, they'll be honored having supported us,\" Kelter said.\n\nCoincidentally, the last Team USA rugby team to bring home gold did so in Paris, a fact Kelter sees as a sign that the Americans are long overdue for another champion to be crowned.\n\n\"It would mean the world to this program,\" she said. \"We'd had so many women, especially our 1991 team that won gold (in the World Cup). It would be absolutely unbelievable but also just such a gift to USA Rugby because this is the fastest-growing sport in America, and it would be a testament to all the women that came before us and the men that laid the foundation for us.\"\n\nThe 2024 Olympic Games will mark the third of Kelter's career, and given how she was relatively new to the game when she represented Team USA the first time in 2016 after playing hockey and soccer growing up, her role has shifted over the years with all the experience she has gained.\n\n\"My first Olympics, I had just played rugby for about two years, and in rugby terms, you're really a novice. And I was like, 'Oh my gosh, I can't believe I'm here,' \" she said.\n\nAt the 2020 Games in Tokyo, she had just come back from having neck fusion and spine fusion procedures but really wanted to work through it and be there for her country, and her teammates had her back.\n\n\"The team supported me and rallied around me,\" Kelter said. \"We went 3-0 in pool play and had a heartbreaker against (Great Britain) and lost in the quarterfinals.\"\n\nWhile she doesn't have any Olympic medals to show for her previous two trips, Kelter has a good feeling that the third time might just prove to be the charm.\n\n\"I don't have the Olympic rings tattooed on me yet (but) they're coming,\" she said. \"I want that to be (a) medal. I want that to be for real. ... I have yet to feel that as a team, and this team is the most competitive team I've been on in the last 10 years.\"\n\nKelter feels like this year's team has everything they need to go the distance, from chemistry to their five core team values of \"resilience, courage, love, selflessness and work ethic.\"\n\n\"Every action that we've been doing these last four years, six years, eight years, 10 years have been leading up to those five core values,\" she said. \"Those will guide us as we (look to) medal in Paris.\"\n\nThe top two teams from each pool will advance to the quarterfinals, and Kelter sees the top competitors for gold as top-ranked Australia, New Zealand, France and Canada.\n\n\"To be fair, sevens is such a quick-paced game,\" she said. \"It's two seven-minute halves, a 14-minute game, and you play two in a day and anything can happen at any time.\"\n\nKelter believes that deciding a victor will ultimately come down to which team has the \"most chemistry, stays the most present (and) supports one another the best.\"\n\n\"That is who is going to win the gold medal,\" she said.\n\nAs far as how many more years she plans to continue competing in the sport, Kelter joked about going \"until the wheels fall off, and if it ain't broke, don't fix it\" but admitted that she is slowing down a little and will likely have to adapt to a slower-paced version of the sport at some point.\n\n\"I can feel my body slowing down a little bit, but it is more so (about) what's the next chapter going to look like and it's still going to be playing rugby,\" she said. \"Maybe a lot of 15s and transition away from the sevens for a little bit to gear up for the 15s World Cup tournament in England in 2025.\"\n\nShe will be following her partner, who is also on Team USA, to play with the Loughborough Lightning in the English Premier Rugby league in England.\n\n\"I'm just trying to make sure my athletics are taken care of but also (keep) my family life and my work-life balance organized,\" Kelter said.\n\nSince rugby is such a widely played international sport and given that she plays professionally overseas when she is not representing Team USA, Kelter will be going up against some of her Premier League teammates when she takes the field at the Olympics.\n\nWhile she enjoys all of the places and that playing international rugby has taken her, Kelter would like to see the growth of women's rugby continue to expand domestically in the United States so that more of the top talent from America feel more inclined to compete closer to home.\n\n\"We would love to see all of our U.S. National Team players back home giving to grassroots programs and giving back to the clubs they once were on,\" she said.", "source": {"uri": "adn.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Faafoi Falaniko nabbed a consolation try right at the death.\n\nElsewhere, Dietrich Roache was a standout for Australia in the win over Kenya, setting up James Turner for the opening try of the game and then putting it on a platter for Lawson.\n\nElsewhere, France booked their place in the knock-out phase but struggled to live up to their pre-tournament favourites tag while powerhouse Fiji showed they will take some beating.\n\nLes Bleus came into the sevens competition on a high, boosted by the presence of Antoine Dupont, viewed by many as the world's greatest player in the 15-a-side code.\n\nBut a shock 12-12 draw against the United States in their first pool C encounter was followed by a nailbiting 19-12 win over Uruguay that was anything but convincing.\n\nFiji have won both Olympic golds since rugby was introduced at the 2016 Rio Games but have recently suffered a run of poor form by their high standards.\n\nHowever, the undisputed kings of sevens have enjoyed a renaissance under new coach Osea Kolinisau and were back to their brilliant free-flowing best in a 40-12 demolition of Uruguay.\n\nThey turned on the style in their second match, bamboozling the United States with mesmerising offloads and searing pace for a captivating 38-12 win.\n\nThe Fijians face France next in a mouthwatering clash on Thursday to decide the pool winner.\n\nIn what is a wide-open tournament for the men, stiff competition will also likely come from traditional rugby powers New Zealand, South Africa, Argentina, and Ireland.\n\nIreland and the All Blacks emerged on top, both comfortably seeing off Japan and narrowly edging out South Africa.\n\nBoth showed they will be contenders at the business end of the competition, the All Blacks in particular impressing with some slick handling in their 17-5 win over the Blitzboks.\n\nAUSSIE OLYMPIC CHAMPION LOSES EQUIPMENT IN BREAK-IN\n\nReigning Olympic BMX freestyle champion Logan Martin had some of his equipment stolen by thieves who broke into a team van in a \"crazy start\" to the Australian's title defence.\n\nMartin posted video on Instagram on Wednesday showing the passenger side window of the vehicle smashed and police officers speaking to a member of the Australian delegation.\n\n\"Our van got broken into last night,\" he said.\n\n\"Luckily my bikes weren't in there, although my bike bags were in there with some things in it.\n\n\"What a crazy start to the trip.\"\n\nMartin, who won gold in Tokyo ahead of Venezuela's Daniel Dhers, also lost his wallet.\n\nThe incident occurred in Brussels, where the Australian team was at a training camp before leaving for Paris on Wednesday.\n\nAUSSIE SAYS AXING BOXING FROM 2028 OLYMPICS WOULD BE A 'CRIME'\n\nAustralian medallist Harry Garside said on Wednesday it would be \"a crime\" to drop boxing from the 2028 Olympics, calling it a poor man's sport that saves lives.\n\nBoxing has been part of every Games since 1920, but faces an uncertain long-term future after its place at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics was put \"on hold\" by the International Olympic Committee.\n\nGarside, who won lightweight bronze in Tokyo and is bidding for gold in Paris, said it was more than a sport, with young people's dreams and aspirations at stake.\n\n\"All of our dreams started somewhere, and whether you're a boxer, whether you're in other sports, we all love the Olympic movement. That's why we're here,\" he said.\n\n\"To take that away from some young people around the world, it would be a crime, truly.\" The International Boxing Association was effectively expelled from the Olympic movement last year following a bitter dispute with its Russian president, Umar Kremlev.\n\nIt followed concerns over the credibility of IBA-sanctioned tournaments as well as the boxing governing body's finances and governance.\n\nNo other boxing governing body has been recognised by the IOC, which is organising the tournament in Paris but has said it will not be in a position to do so in Los Angeles.\n\nGarside, Australia's first boxing medallist in 33 years, said \"politics is politics\", but powerbrokers must think about the consequences.\n\n\"To say it may not be in the Olympic Games is obviously terrifying because I think boxing is historically a poor man's sport,\" he said.\n\n\"If you look around the world, it's the Third World countries that do the best. It's the countries that come from these really rough areas in the world. And they're the ones that come and win gold medals.\n\n\"Boxing deserves to be in the Olympics,\" he added. \"It has saved many people's lives, and I've seen it save many people's lives. So I hope it stays.\"\n\nCOVID HITS AUSTRALIAN OLYMPIC WATER POLO TEAM\n\nFive members of Australia's women's water polo team have tested positive for Covid-19 just days before the Paris Olympics, officials said Wednesday.\n\nAustralian chef-de-mission Anna Meares said they would resume training when well enough. Their campaign is due to start on Saturday against China.\n\n\"It is confined to the water polo team. There have been five athletes in total who have tested positive,\" she said.\n\nAustralia has a 13-person team in Paris.\n\n\"They are following all the protocols that we have. I can confirm that all the water polo team has been tested as well,\" Meares added.\n\nThe protocols include wearing masks and isolating outside of training. Paris is the first summer Olympics since the pandemic-delayed Tokyo Games in 2021, which was mostly held without spectators and with rigorous Covid testing procedures in place.\n\nCANADA FOOTBALL STAFF SENT HOME OVER DRONE SCANDAL\n\nAn assistant coach and an analyst with the Canadian women's football team were on Wednesday sent home from the Olympics for their part in a spying scandal.\n\nThe analyst, 43-year-old Joey Lombardi, was also given a suspended eight-month prison sentence for flying a drone over a New Zealand training session this week in Saint-Etienne.\n\nLombardi pleaded guilty when he appeared in court in Saint-Etienne on Wednesday, the court told AFP.\n\nThe assistant coach was Jasmine Mander, to whom Lombardi reported. Head coach Bev Priestman also announced she will take no part in the opening game of Canada's gold medal defence, against New Zealand.\n\nThe decisions come after a staff member was detained by French authorities for flying the drone in a bid to spy on New Zealand's tactics.\n\nThe Canadian Olympic Committee (COC) said it had since learned of a second incident involving New Zealand, who formally lodged a complaint with the IOC integrity unit and demanded answers from Canada.\n\n\"The COC is in contact with the IOC and in contact with FIFA. Canada Soccer has been transparent and cooperative throughout the process,\" the COC said.\n\n\"The COC will continue to review this matter and may take further action if necessary.\" Priestman said she did not think it would be appropriate to be on the bench for the clash against New Zealand on Thursday.\n\n\"On behalf of our entire team, I first and foremost want to apologise to the players and staff at New Zealand Football and to the players on Team Canada,\" she said.\n\n\"This does not represent the values that our team stands for.\n\n\"I am ultimately responsible for conduct in our programme. Accordingly, to emphasise our team's commitment to integrity, I have decided to voluntarily withdraw from coaching the match on Thursday.\"\n\nWORLD NUMBER ONE OUT OF OLYMPICS TENNIS\n\nWorld number one Jannik Sinner withdrew from the Paris Olympics tennis tournament on Wednesday after falling ill with tonsillitis.\n\nThe Italian said he had started feeling ill on Monday after a practice week in Monaco and was advised to drop out.\n\n\"After seeing my doctors on Tuesday and waiting an extra day to give myself some more time to see if my condition would improve, things unfortunately got worse,\" Sinner said in a statement.\n\n\"I was looking forward to competing with my teammates and the rest of the Italian team, but for now that will have to wait.\n\n\"As advised by my medical team, I will now take some time to rest and recover to full health. I'd like to wish the whole team Italia the best for this important event and hope to be back stronger in the future.\" Sinner said the Olympics had been \"was one of my main goals for this season\".\n\nThe 22-year-old, who won his first Grand Slam at the Australian Open earlier this year, became the first Italian to top the world rankings after his recent run to the semi-finals at the French Open.\n\nHe withdrew from the Madrid Open before the quarter-finals with a hip injury and missed the tournament in Rome in the run-up to Roland Garros.\n\nSinner needed a lengthy medical timeout after feeling dizzy and appearing to almost lose his balance during his quarter-final defeat to Daniil Medvedev at Wimbledon.\n\nThe tennis competition in Paris begins at Roland Garros on July 27 and ends on August 4.\n\nFRENCH MALE HURDLER TO WEAR SKIRT AT OPENING CEREMONY\n\nWhat's good enough for Brad Pitt and David Beckham is good enough for French athlete Sasha Zhoya, who has been given the green light to wear a skirt at the Olympic Games opening ceremony.\n\nIn a documentary on his preparations for the Games, broadcast this week, Zhoya asked designers of the French team's outfit if he could opt for a skirt rather than a pair of trousers.\n\n\"If women have the right to wear trousers, it should also be right that men have the choice of wearing skirts,\" said the 22-year-old who will take part in the 110m hurdles at the Games.\n\n\"It's 2024, we can wear everything. There's no man, no woman in fashion now.\"\n\nLuxury clothes maker Berluti initially designed sleeveless jackets, skirts and trousers for the women in the French squad but long-sleeved jackets and trousers for the men.\n\nHollywood star Pitt wore a skirt at a red carpet function in Germany in 2022 while former England footballer Beckham donned a sarong at the 1998 World Cup.\n\nAround 1,000 French police officers will be on duty on Wednesday to protect Israel's football match against Mali at the Paris Olympics where protests are also expected, Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said.\n\nThe game involving the Israeli team at the Parc des Princes stadium in Paris, as well as the Ukraine-Iraq match in the southeastern city of Lyon, have been identified by French security forces as high risk.\n\n\"All the competitions have a security plan, but it's true that these two matches, and particularly the match at the Parc des Princes, will have security, an anti-terror perimeter,\" Darmanin told BFM television and RMC radio.\n\n\"Tonight at the Parc des Princes there will be a thousand police officers who will ensure that we are there for the sport,\" he added.\n\nIsraeli President Isaac Herzog will attend the match.\n\nAll Israeli athletes at the Paris Games, which start officially on Friday, will have round-the-clock personal security provided by elite French police, both inside the Olympic village and every time they leave the compound in northern Paris.\n\nA French police source told AFP that security forces were \"expecting actions and disturbances around the stadium\" on Wednesday and said it was possible that \"people shout insults from the stands\" or that there is \"whistling and flags shown during the hymns, for example.\"\n\nEuropalestine, a French activist group behind recent protests, told the Guardian newspaper that it was planning a peaceful demonstration inside the stadium to protest the \"genocide\" in Gaza.\n\n\"We do not take (the threat) lightly, we are on high alert and all athletes have been informed of the situation,\" said Israeli government spokesperson David Mencer.\n\n\"Our duty to protect our athletes, in cooperation with the French authorities, is of the utmost importance,\" he added.\n\nThe head of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) Thomas Bach and French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday rejected a Palestinian demand that Israel be barred from the Paris Games over the war in Gaza.\n\nThe Palestine Olympic Committee asked for a ban on Israel in a letter to the IOC, citing the bombings of the besieged Gaza Strip as a breach of the Olympic truce.\n\nThe health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said Tuesday at least 39,090 people have been killed in more than nine months of war between Israel and Palestinian militants.\n\nDANCERS CALL OFF OLYMPICS CEREMONY STRIKE THREAT\n\nHundreds of dancers who were threatening to strike during the opening ceremony of the Paris Olympics on Friday have called off their protest after receiving a new pay offer, their union said.\n\nThe performers secured a rise in compensation for broadcasting rights during a final round of talks with Paris 2024 organisers on Wednesday, the SFA-CGT union said in a statement.\n\n\"This period has concluded with a victory, which although it is not total, is nonetheless a response to the urgent issues raised,\" it said.\n\nThe union, which says it represents around 10 percent of the 3,000 performers involved in the opening ceremony, filed a strike notice last week over what it said were \"outrageous disparities\" in pay between dancers.\n\nThe deal agreed on Wednesday means that the lowest-paid dancers would receive between 160-240 euros extra for their performance on Friday evening, a union member involved in the negotiations told AFP.\n\nSome of them had protested on Monday during rehearsals by the river Seine by stopping and holding their fists aloft for eight minutes.\n\nThe threat was an unwelcome development for organisers and risked deepening France's reputation for labour disputes just as the eyes of the world fall on Paris for the start of the Games.\n\nA whole host of French public sector workers have threatened strikes or stopped work ahead of the Olympics to demand bonuses for working over the July 26-August 11 event, which coincides with the summer holidays.\n\nOne-off payments of up to 1,900 euros have been agreed for police and municipal workers in Paris.\n\nThe opening ceremony is set to take place over a six-kilometre (four-mile) stretch of the river Seine, with around 6,000-7,000 athletes expected to sail down the river on 85 boats.\n\nIt will be the first time a summer Olympics has opened outside of the main athletics stadium.\n\nA small union at Paris airport operator ADP has also filed a strike notice for Friday.\n\nADP management reached an agreement last week with most labour groups to end a dispute

We know that and we\u2019re capable of doing much better,\u201d Dupont said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t put ourselves in a good place once again. We struggled to impose our game plan, to keep the ball.\u201d\n\nFiji have won both Olympic golds since rugby was introduced at the 2016 Rio Games but have recently suffered a run of poor form by their high standards.\n\nHowever, the undisputed kings of sevens have enjoyed a renaissance under new coach Osea Kolinisau and were back to their brilliant free-flowing best in a 40-12 demolition of Uruguay.\n\nThey turned on the style in their second match, bamboozling the United States with mesmerising offloads and searing pace for a captivating 38-12 win.\n\nThe Fijians face France next in a mouthwatering clash on Thursday to decide the pool winner.\n\nFrench back Jean-Pascal Barraque did not mince his words after the stuttering performance.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t really enjoy ourselves on the pitch and nor, I think, did the crowd, poor things. At least we made all our mistakes today and tomorrow can only be better,\u201d Barraque said.\n\nEarlier, Australia booked their quarter-final place from Pool B with two hard-fought wins over a determined Samoa and Kenya.\n\nArgentina, who were roundly booed by the home faithful, also ensured a spot in the knockout phase, running out comfortable 31-12 winners against Kenya before beating Samoa 28-12.\n\nArgentina\u2019s flyer Marcos Moneta shrugged off the hostile crowd reception, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t mind that, I enjoy it.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if [the hostility to us] was because of the World Cup or if they just don\u2019t like us. I don\u2019t mind.\u201d\n\nPool A, seen as the \u201cgroup of death\u201d, pitted rugby superpowers New Zealand, South Africa, and Ireland against each other, along with emerging force Japan.\n\nIreland and the All Blacks emerged on top, both comfortably seeing off Japan and narrowly edging out South Africa.\n\nBoth showed they will be contenders at the business end of the competition, the All Blacks in particular impressing with some slick handling in their 17-5 win over the Blitzboks.\n\nWith the global exposure that comes with the Olympics and playing to a sold-out Stade de France, World Rugby\u2019s chief executive Alan Gilpin has described the tournament as a \u201ccoming of age\u201d moment for the sport.\n\n\u201cThere has never been a greater spotlight on the sport,\u201d Gilpin said ahead of the competition.\n\nThe women\u2019s tournament starts on Sunday, with Australia and New Zealand well-placed to battle for the gold.", "source": {"uri":

Determined. Persistent. These are just a few of the words players on the Canadian women's rugby sevens team use to describe the group of athletes heading to Paris.\n\nTheir path to Paris 2024 has not been easy, with a slower build-up to full momentum since the last Olympics. Trust in the process, their coaches and each other has seen them rise from ninth in the SVNS Series last year to fifth this year.\n\nAccording to team captain Olivia Apps, the bumpy journey has strengthened the bond between the teams.\n\nI think a big part of our team culture is the adversity that we've been through together. The last two seasons have just been super challenging in our performances and finding consistency in our squad. There's been injuries and a lot of different obstacles. But for us to go through that together and at the end of the day still want to hang out with each other off the field and spend time talking about rugby and wanting to improve, that builds confidence.\n\nApps is one of three players returning from the Tokyo 2020 team. The other two are Keyara Wardley and Charity Williams, the latter of whom is the only player on the team for whom Paris 2024 will be a third Olympic Games. In that sense, Williams is the only player who has experienced a normal Games with fans in the stands and the opportunity to interact with other athletes in the village, so the team will be looking to her for experience.\n\nI think it's going to be tough in that regard to try and navigate, because in Tokyo we weren't allowed to interact with other people and there were no fans, Wardley said. We've worked so hard to get here, so we want to enjoy the process while we can. But we also have to know when to dial it in and I think the returning athletes can definitely help a little bit with that.\n\nApps took over the captaincy from Ghislaine Landry, one of the world's all-time leading scorers. She played a key role in the rise of Canadian women's rugby and her bronze medal at Rio 2016, when women's sevens rugby made its Olympic debut.\n\nGhislaine was a leader who really led by example. I think her presence on the field was such that it was undeniable that she was the captain of the team and in that way the leader, Apps said.\n\nI think I had to find my own leadership style. I'm someone who's very outgoing, I'm extroverted, I love to connect with my teammates. I think that's where I differed from Ghislaine and probably how I connect with my teammates in a different way. But I also learned from her that there are times to speak, to take the microphone, and there are times to give it to others and create space for others to lead as well. One thing I learned from her is that sometimes the best leadership is just to exist!\n\nApps is led on the team by vice-captain Chloe Daniels, who arguably adopts a leadership style more similar to Landrys'.\n\nI think on and off the pitch I'm a pretty level-headed, calm person, so I think in a super exciting and busy atmosphere I hope I can bring that calmness to the team to help us focus, and really get back to our roots and just be ready to play our game.\n\nQualifying for Paris 2024 was extra special for Team Canada because they were able to do it at home. The team qualified at the 2023 Rugby Americas North Sevens regional qualifying event in Langford, BC last August, and went undefeated, beating Mexico 53-0 in the final.\n\nThe 2024 HSBC SVNS season kicked off in December 2023, with Canada starting strongly in Dubai with a fourth-place finish, beating Ireland in the quarter-finals and playing a thrilling match against New Zealand in the semi-finals.\n\nCanada played in third-place play-offs at three more stops throughout the season, culminating in their bronze medal in front of a home crowd in Vancouver. They finished fourth in Los Angeles and ended the season ranked fifth in the world after a strong performance in the 2024 HSBC SVNS Grand Final in Madrid, where Canada finished fourth and defeated New Zealand in pool play for the first time since 2016.\n\nAt Tokyo 2020, the Canadian women's rugby sevens team failed to progress beyond the group stage. For Paris, there is a real urge to show the world that Canada is a contender again.\n\nI would say Team Canadas [playing style] is very aggressive and we are physical. I personally think we have some of the best athletes in the world when it comes to rugby. I think we have a good balance of aggression, speed and skill, Apps says. A lot of people say that Canadians, because rugby is not really a Canadian sport, that we don't have the rugby IQ or the rugby knowledge. But I actually think our team is one of the smartest teams and our aggression and our defensive presence is definitely palpable. And I think offensively we have incredible speed.\n\nEach country's style of rugby is so different and we have to adapt our defensive system and the way we attack to that team, she adds.\n\nFor the Olympic tournament, Canada has been drawn in Pool A, along with New Zealand, Fiji and the People's Republic of China.\n\nNew Zealand and Fiji have a similar style of play, Daniels says. They've been playing rugby for a long time. China is not a team we've seen that much, but they're fast. They move the ball quickly. So those are all things we're aware of and we're preparing for. But I think it also comes down to just doing what we've done this season and not changing too much, but preparing.\n\nIt's time to settle down and trust each other. Trust in the resilience, determination and tenacity of the team.\n\nFor Apps, the most important thing to remember is: we are not seven individuals, we play as a team. We always try to get better. We always try to raise the standards.

with the pair both priced at 7/2.\n\nFor those after somewhat of an outsider - back-to-back gold medallists Fiji are the next favourites at 5/1 to make it three wins from as many appearances at the Games, while Ireland, Australia and South Africa are next in the market at 10/1, 12/1 and 16/1 respectively.\n\nFor those wondering where Team GB are - they will not be taking part at this year's tournament - with the 2016 silver medallists and 2020 semi-finalists shockingly failing to qualify.\n\nSky Bet favourites to win the men's Rugby Sevens (7s) gold medal:\n\nFrance WAS 2/1 NOW 9/4\n\nArgentina 7/2\n\nNew Zealand 7/2\n\nFiji 5/1\n\nIreland 10/1\n\nAustralia 12/1\n\nSouth Africa 16/1\n\nUSA 28/1\n\nSamoa 100/1\n\nKenya 200/1\n\nUruguay 200/1\n\nJapan 500/1\n\nAll odds are correct at the time of publication", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_sevens", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rugby sevens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "HSBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Rugby_Men's_15s_Player_of_the_Year", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Rugby Men's 15s Player of the Year"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rugby football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_union_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rugby union positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Madrid"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Dupont", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Antoine Dupont"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samoa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Samoa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_GB", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Team GB"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiji", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fiji"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Fiji"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_Union", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby Union", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Massive_Multiplayer_Online", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Massive Multiplayer Online", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Football", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/07/24/08/87698789-0-image-m-17_1721807293568.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9755459", "eventUri": "eng-9755459", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4352941176470588, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

Norway won bronze in both Rio and Tokyo and reached the last two world championship finals and will be their key rivals. On this day we see them both, as France play Hungary and Norway face Sweden in their first games of the tournament.\n\nIRISH INTEREST: Ireland take on New Zealand in their third pool game in men's rugby sevens in the afternoon, with a knockout game to follow that evening.\n\nFriday July 26, Day 0\n\nOPENING CEREMONY: With the Stade de France busy hosting the rugby sevens, Paris has planned an innovative opening ceremony based along a 6km stretch of the Seine, with the athletes parading not at the end but at the start, and not on foot but on 94 boats, passing landmarks including the Louvre and Notre Dame before ending up at the Trocad\u00e9ro for the main show, about which organisers have been tight-lipped.\n\nMEN'S RUGBY: Antoine Dupont, France's captain, missed the Six Nations to throw himself into Olympic preparations, declaring a gold medal \"the holy grail of the sport, as simple as that\", and organisers have scheduled the men's final in the hope that he will help them get their Games off to the best possible start. It is far from a done deal, though: France failed to reach the final four in the sport's two previous Olympic outings, while Fiji have won both golds.\n\nMEN'S HANDBALL: In the past two Olympic finals Denmark beat France (in Rio) and France beat Denmark (in Tokyo). Of the five world championships in the past decade France have won two and Denmark the most recent three, extending their unbeaten run in the event to 28 games by beating France in last year's final. This year they play on the first day of the men's tournament, though it would be no surprise if they meet again when the medals are decided on 11 August.\n\nIRISH INTEREST: A horde of Irish athletes open their campaign across various sports, with Phillip Doyle and Daire Lynch among those in action in rowing heats; the men's hockey team take on Belgium in their opening pool game; gymnast Rhys McClenaghan goes in the qualification of the men's pommel horse; Ryan Mullen goes in the cycling time trial; with the men's rugby sevens tournament reaching its finale at the Stade de France.\n\nSunday July 28, Day 2\n\nSWIMMING: Between 2014 and 2020 Adam Peaty won every available global gold in the 100m breaststroke and broke the world record five times. But after Tokyo he stepped away from the pool, citing mental health issues. He returned last October, with his eyes on this day. Assuming they both safely navigated Saturday's heats, his key rival could be Qin Haiyang, China's breaststroke king.\n\nMEN'S BASKETBALL: The United States have won 16 of the 20 men's basketball golds, including the last four, and with LeBron James in an all-star side are inevitable favourites for another. James's notable teammates include Stephen Curry, who remarkably is playing his first Olympics. They get their tournament under way against a Serbia side that has in its ranks this year's NBA MVP in Nikola Jokic of the Denver Nuggets.\n\nWOMEN'S STREET SKATEBOARDING: Japan won four of the six women's skateboarding medals in Tokyo, including both golds, and in the street discipline have five of the world's current top seven. But Brazil's world No 3, Rayssa Leal, has high hopes. Nicknamed Fadinha (little fairy - after her first viral video), Leal won silver in Tokyo aged 13, has got better since, and will be out to sprinkle some magic at La Concorde.\n\nIRISH INTEREST: Nhat Nguyen and Rachel Darragh continue their pool games in the badminton singles. A horde of Irish rowing crews take to the water, including Olympic champions Paul O'Donovan and Fintan McCarthy in their double sculls heats. A slew of Irish boxers will be in action in the round of 32. The eventing team will be in cross country action. Mona McSharry gets her Olympics under way in the women's 100m breaststroke heats. The women's rugby sevens team have pool games against Britain and South Africa.\n\nMonday July 29, Day 3\n\nEQUESTRIANISM: Eventing jumping team and individual final: The grounds of the Chateau de Versailles will provide a spectacular backdrop to the equestrian events, with the finale of the eventing competition using the temporary arena by the Grand Canal.\n\nIRISH INTEREST: Irish rowers who fell short in their heats will be in action in repechages; the men's hockey team take on Australia in their pool game. The eventing team are in jumping action. Tn the pool, Daniel Wiffen, Ellen Walshe and Danielle Hill will all be in action in swimming heats. The women's rugby sevens team take on Australia in a pool game. Liam Jegou will face the decisive day in canoe slalom.\n\nTuesday July 30, Day 4\n\nSWIMMING: Women's 100m backstroke Kaylee McKeown, Australia's backstroke queen, is going for six golds in Paris - twice the number she won in Tokyo - and July 30 could bring her first, with the 100m final in the evening session. McKeown broke her own world record last October and goes in as overwhelming favourite.\n\nSURFING: men's and women's gold medal match: Olympic organisers chose to hold the surfing competition in Teahupo'o. The attraction is what surfer.com described as \"without a doubt one of the heaviest, scariest, most dangerous left-hand reef break waves in the entire world\".\n\nMEN'S TRIATHLON: The first of the triathlon events.\n\nIRISH INTEREST: One of the strongest Irish medal chances as Daniel Wiffen - assuming he qualifies - lines up for the 800m freestyle final. In rowing, Phillip Doyle and Daire Lynch will be in the men's double sculls semi-finals. The Irish men's hockey team play India. The women's rugby sevens tournament has its semi-finals and finals. A number of Irish boxers will be in round of 16/32 action.\n\nGYMNASTICS: men's all-around final: Daiki Hashimoto won gold in Tokyo three years ago, has won two World Championships since and goes into the all-around final as favourite. Meanwhile the US are hoping for what would be just their second title, and first since 2004.\n\nSWIMMING: France's L\u00e9on Marchand is the son of Xavier Marchand and C\u00e9line Bonnet, both former Olympic swimmers, is coached at Arizona State by Michael Phelps's former mentor Bob Bowman, is probably the greatest swimmer in the world, and is about to have the biggest night of his life. The 200m butterfly and 200m breaststroke finals were originally due to run consecutively, but after intensive lobbying the schedule was changed to separate the events by an hour and a half and give Marchand a greater chance of success.\n\nIRISH INTEREST: Paul O'Donovan and Fintan McCarthy will be in action in the lightweight double sculls semi-final; Kellie Harrington faces a big test in her lightweight boxing semi-final with a number of Irish boxers also competing; Mona McSharry will be in the 200m breaststroke semi-final.\n\nThursday August 1, Day 6\n\nGYMNASTICS: Women's all-around final: In 2021 Simone Biles's unexpected attack of the twisties was one of the stories of the Olympics, her troubles in the team event leading her to withdraw from the individual all-around competition to focus on her mental health. This June she won the event at the US Championships for the ninth time, and by a massive margin, and today she will be aiming for redemption.\n\nIRISH INTEREST: Nhat Nguyen will be in the round of 16 in badminton if he qualifies; Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry face the opening day of the golf tournament; a number of Irish crews face finals in rowing; the men's hockey team play Argentina; Irish boxers Jack Marley, Jennifer Lehane and Dean Clancy could face decisive quarter-finals; the Irish showjumping team face qualifiers; Noel Hendrick is in action in the K1 canoe slalom.\n\nFriday August 2, Day 7\n\nWINDSURFING: Men and women medal series: There has been a major change since the last Olympics, with the RS:X out and the eyecatching iQFoil in. The board is now attached to hydrofoils, which lift it out of the water when it's going at speed. The Dutch tend to excel in this discipline but keep an eye out for France's Nicolas Goyard.\n\nJUDO: Men's +100kg: France's legendary judoka Teddy Riner, a three-time Olympic and 11-times (that's 11 times) world champion, goes for yet another medal.\n\nIRISH INTEREST: There'll be a huge chance of Irish rowing gold in the lightweight double sculls final through Paul O'Donovan and Fintan McCarthy while the other finals could also produce medals. Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry continue their hunt for a medal in golf. Nhat Nguyen could face a quarter-final in badminton. Siblings Luke and Jodie McCann are among the Irish in action on day one of athletics at the Stade de France.\n\nSaturday August 3, Day 8\n\nATHLETICS: Women's 100m final: The second night of athletics at the Stade de France and things are hotting up, with five titles to be decided including the women's 100m, in which the USA's Sha'Carri Richardson will aim to stop Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce and Shericka Jackson hoovering up all the medals for Jamaica.\n\nSWIMMING: Women's 800m freestyle: At a meet in Orlando in February Canada's 17-year-old tyro Summer McIntosh beat Katie Ledecky in the 800m freestyle, the American's first defeat over the distance in any kind of final for 13 years. But McIntosh, who trains at the University of Florida alongside Ledecky, has decided to concentrate on other events in Paris leaving Ledecky strong favourite to cement her all-time-great status with a fourth successive Olympic gold.\n\nIRISH INTEREST: Rhys McClenaghan will try to realise his medal dreams in the pommel horse final. Ben Healy and Ryan Mullen are in the cycling road race. Kellie Harrington could face a huge semi-final clash in lightweight boxing. At the Stade de France, the Irish mixed 4x400m relay could be in medal contention in the final if at full strength.\n\nSunday August 4, Day 9\n\nTENNIS: Men's singles final Novak Djokovic has won everything worth winning in tennis, with one glaring exception. His bronze in Beijing in 2008 remains the highlight of his Olympic career - he has reached the last four three times, but the top three only once - while in 2016 he suffered his first first-round defeat since 2009. At 37 this is surely the last chance, but he injured a knee at the French Open and returns to Roland Garros in far from ideal circumstances. The women's doubles final follows, the last tennis match of the Olympics.\n\nCYCLING: Women's road race Organisers promise \"a wide variety of landscapes switching between wooded areas [and] more urban segments\", much of the former running along local cycling hotspot the Chevreuse Valley, with the race concluding with three cobble-strewn laps of a Parisian circuit around Montmartre. We can only hope for drama on a par with 2021, when Annemiek van Vleuten's enthusiastic celebrations after winning what she thought was gold were curtailed when she was informed that Anna Kiesenhofer, author of a stunning solo breakaway, had actually beaten her to it.\n\nIRISH INTEREST: Daniel Wiffen will likely be in the shake-up in the men's 1500m freestyle final. The medals will be decided in the men's golf tournament. In athletics, Nicola Tuthill goes in the women's hammer throw qualification while there will likely be Irish interest in the men's 1500m semi-finals. The men's hockey team could be in a quarter-final, while in boxing it could be a huge day with a number of Irish competitors facing potential quarter-finals and semi-finals.\n\nMonday August 5, Day 10\n\nCANOE SLALOM: Kayak cross men's and women's final: A hybrid of normal kayak race, the dodgems and the Hunger Games, the kayak cross event is wild, splashy carnage.\n\nBADMINTON: Men's and women's singles finals: China dominate Olympic badminton and won three times as many medals as their nearest challenger (Chinese Taipei) in 2021. China's Shi Yuqi is the men's world No 1 but Viktor Axelsen, a 6ft 4in Dane, is hoping to defend his title despite having some injury problems this year - he promised to \"come back really scary for the Olympics\". Korea's An Se-young is the women's No 1 and has instantly rediscovered top form after a month out with a knee injury.\n\nATHLETICS: Men's pole vault: There are few track and field athletes who dominate their event like Armand \"Mondo\" Duplantis in the pole vault. The US-born Swede (his father represented the USA internationally and introduced his son to vaulting as a three-year-old; his mother was a Swedish heptathlete), broke the world record twice in 2020, three times in 2022 and twice in 2023 before nudging it to 6.24m in China in April.\n\nIRISH INTEREST: Rhasidat Adeleke, Sharlene Mawdsley and Sophie Becker will all race the heats of the women's 400m. Ciara McGing goes in the diving preliminary round. Finn Lynch and Eve McMahon continue their campaigns in sailing, while the Irish showjumpers compete in individual qualifiers.\n\nTuesday August 6, Day 11\n\nATHLETICS: Men's 1500m final: Jakob Ingebrigtsen won gold in Tokyo but since then has twice been pipped by Britons at global tournaments, beaten by Jake Wightman at the 2022 world championships and Josh Kerr at the 2023 event. The 1500m has been a thrilling, hotly contested event in recent years and there are several athletes who could halt the Kerr v Ingebrigtsen hype including another Norwegian in Narve Gilje Nord\u00e5s, who is coached by Ingebrigtsen's estranged father, Gjert (who has not been accredited for the Olympics because he faces criminal charges in Norway).\n\nSKATEBOARDING: Women's park final: The 14-year-old Australian and world No 2 Arisa Trew is one to keep an eye on here: last year she became the first female to pull off a 720, and in June was the first to land a 900 (two and a half rotations) and a switch McTwist (if you know you know). Meanwhile Sky Brown, who won bronze for Britain at 13 in Tokyo, returns.\n\nIRISH INTEREST: Kellie Harrington will box for gold if she makes the lightweight final while a trio of Irish boxers could be in semi-final action. Ciara Mageean, Sarah Healy and Sophie O'Sullivan will be in action in the 1500m heats at the Stade de France, with the men's 1500m final potentially holding an Irish interest. Shane Sweetnam, Daniel Coyle and Cian O'Connor could be in action in the showjumping final, while the men's hockey semi-finals will also take place. The women's team pursuit will also be in action in track cycling.\n\nWednesday August 7, Day 12\n\nSAILING: Mixed dinghy medal race: In which Britain's odd couple Vita Heathcote and Chris Grube - she's 23 and going into her first Games, he's 39 and has been tempted out of retirement for one last go - have a chance of medals after coming second at the world championships in Mallorca this year, despite suffering from illness, injury and having worked together only for a matter of months. Heathcote's uncle, Nick Rogers, won silver medals in 2004 and 2008. Spain's Jordi Xammar and Nora Brugman, who won that event in Mallorca, and Japan's Keiju Okada and Miho Yoshioka are the key rivals.\n\nARTISTIC SWIMMING: Team acrobatic routine.\n\nBOXING: This could be the last round for Olympic boxing - the IOC has set a deadline of early next year to find a governing body to replace the IBA as its partners, leaving the sport's place at Los Angeles 2028 in doubt. So catch it while you can: two golds are up for grabs.\n\nIRISH INTEREST: Leona Maguire and Stephanie Meadow compete in the first round of the women's golf tournament. Jack Woolley goes in the round of 16 in taekwondo. In athletics, Sarah Lavin, Brian Fay, Mark English and Rhasidat Adeleke are among those in action, while in boxing Michaela Walsh and Dean Clancy could both face medal bouts.\n\nThursday August 8, Day 13\n\nTRACK CYCLING: Two of the great velodrome events conclude, with the quarter-finals, semis and final of the women's keirin - where riders follow a speed-controlled electric bike for a few laps before launching a wild sprint for the line - breaking up the four events of the men's omnium, each of greater drama than the last, concluding with the brilliant, chaotic, bewildering and wonderful points race. The schedule is reversed, with men's keirin and women's omnium (plus the women's sprint finals), on Sunday.\n\nATHLETICS: Women's 400m hurdles: The anticipated showdown between Femke Bol of the Netherlands and Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone of the USA, the two fastest women of all time over this distance, could be one of the highlights of this year's athletics competition.\n\nIRISH INTEREST: In athletics, Kate O'Connor goes in the heptathlon while Ciara Mageean and others will likely be in action in the 1500m semi-final. Jude Gallagher, Aoife O'Rourke and Jennifer Lehane could all face medal bouts in boxing.\n\nFriday August 9, Day 14\n\nWOMEN'S BREAKING: The breaking competition, incongruously held at the historic Place de la Concorde, lasts only one day. Nicka - the Lithuanian Dominika Banevic, who has been breaking since the age of eight - won the world and European championships last year aged 16 but the two Asian Games finalists, 671 (China's Liu Qingyi) and Ami (Japan's Ami Yuasa) are seen as the breakers most likely to make the final throw down.\n\nWRESTLING: Men's 86kg final: There have been rivalries, and then there was David Taylor v Hassan Yazdani. For years it seemed nothing could keep these representatives of clashing cultures of the USA and Iran apart: in Tokyo both breezed through the competition before Taylor's last-second takedown saw him edge a thrilling final 4-3, and they've gone on to meet in the final of every major championship since. But in a stunning upset Taylor, by then unbeaten in two and a half years, lost to Aaron Brooks in the US trials and promptly retired to go into coaching, and this is the start of a new era.\n\nHOCKEY: Women's final: The Netherlands have dominated women's field hockey for years. They top both the men's and women's world rankings, the latter by a huge margin. It would be a major surprise if they are not involved in the two medal games, but can anyone stop them?\n\nIRISH INTEREST: Rhasidat Adeleke will try to make her medal dream a reality in the women's 400m final, with Mark English and Sarah Lavin in semi-final action. Track cyclists Alice Sharpe and Lara Gillespie will hope for a big showing in the women's madison final, while boxers Aidan Walsh, Daina Moorehouse, Jack Marley and Grainne Walsh could all be fighting for gold in their respective categories.\n\nSaturday August 10, Day 15\n\nVOLLEYBALL MEN'S FINAL: Poland are hoping to finally end their Olympic jinx: they are comfortably top of the men's rankings and have emerged with two golds and a silver from the last three world championships, but they have not reached an Olympic final since 1976 and in Tokyo lost a fifth successive quarter-final.\n\nRHYTHMIC GYMNASTICS GROUP ALL-AROUND FINAL: This is a sport easy to dismiss as absurd for the idea of giving medals for glorified hoop-throwing and fancy ribbon-waving, but miss it at your peril. The group event in particular involves stunning displays of athleticism, coordination and synchronisation - it is basically people throwing and catching stuff, but in the most extraordinary ways. An unmissable highlight of the Olympic schedule.\n\nMEN'S MODERN PENTATHLON FINAL: The Olympic motto might be \"faster, higher, stronger\" but for modern pentathlon the slogan since Tokyo has been \"quicker, shorter, less confusing\". The event has been streamlined to the point that what took six hours before now takes just a couple, but if the changes benefit the spectator they haven't necessarily helped the British reigning champion, Joe Choong, who says he \"wouldn't say they favour me if I'm perfectly honest\".\n\nIRISH INTEREST: All Irish eyes will be on the women's 1500m final and women's 4x400m final to see if Ireland can get a medal on the track, while Brian Fay, Sarah Lavin and Mark English could also be in action in their respective finals. Michaela Walsh, Jude Gallagher and Aoife O'Rourke could also be boxing for gold.\n\nSunday August 11, Day 16\n\nWOMEN'S MARATHON: Tradition has it that the men's marathon should close the Olympic athletics programme, but not this year. At the end of a route that partly follows the women's march on Versailles, one of the most significant events of the French Revolution, this will be the final medal decided in the Stade de France. Ethiopia's Tigst Assefa, who shattered the world record last year, will be hoping to improve on her previous Olympic experience: coming fifth in an 800m heat in 2016.\n\nMEN'S WATER POLO: Though Serbia have won gold at the last two Olympics a three-peat would be a massive achievement given the pure competitiveness of this event - the last four world championships have had four different winners and seven different medallists, with Croatia coming out on top in the latest, in Doha in February. \"I have no favourites,\" their coach, Ivica Tucak, said. \"There is a circle of nine teams from which any can beat any, where every match can be won or lost. Any medal is a magnificent result.\"\n\nIRISH INTEREST: Five-time Olympian Fionnuala McCormack is the sole Irish representative in the women's marathon, though Mayo native Sin\u00e9ad Diver will also race for Australia. In track cycling, Lara Gillespie will compete in the women's omnium.", "source": {"uri": "irishexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Irish Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Pre-tournament favorite France, however, stumbled out of the blocks.\n\nPool B's Australia and Samoa opened the tournament in front of an electric atmosphere. The fans were rewarded for their energy with an equally energetic clash.\n\nDynamic back play from Samoa gave the Pacific nation an early lead before Australia hit back with four unanswered tries. A consolation try in the final play of the game left the score 21-14 to the Wallabies. Australia followed up their win against Samoa with another confident 21-7 win against Kenya.\n\nAustralia's main rivals in Pool B, Argentina, also started strongly against a spirited Kenya side. Booed onto the field by the partisan French crowd due to the nation's recent soccer rivalry with the host nation, Argentina immediately fell behind against the East African team.\n\nThe strong home support for Kenya carried them to a halftime lead. However, in the second half, Argentina regained their focus and began to show the quality that led them to second place in the overall World Rugby Sevens Series before securing a 31-12 win.\n\nArgentina's momentum continued into their second game against Samoa, winning 28-12. Despite conceding late tries, Argentina overcame a hostile crowd to finish the first day as one of the standout contenders in Paris.\n\nThe wins for Argentina and Australia see both nations qualify for the knockout stage, with tomorrow's clash set to decide the winner of Pool B.\n\nHosts and pre-tournament favorites France struggled to live up to the raucous expectations of the Stade de France. A 12-12 draw against the USA, followed by a labored 19-12 win against Uruguay, leaves France with a lot of room for improvement with a crucial clash against Fiji that could decide their fate.\n\nFrance's Pool C rivals Fiji, on the other hand, showed clinical dominance with a 40-12 thrashing of Uruguay in their opening game, followed by a 38-12 demolition of the USA. Despite Fiji's poor sevens season, this return to form for the defending champions will send warning signals to the other gold medal hopefuls - New Zealand, Argentina, and tomorrow's opponents France.\n\nPool A concluded with one of the favorites, New Zealand, capping off their day with a 17-5 win against South Africa, following a 40-12 thrashing of Japan earlier in the day.\n\nIreland also had a successful day. After edging out a tenacious South African side 10-5 in their opening game, the Irish turned on the afterburners to win 40-5 against a Japanese team that never managed to gain a foothold in either of their losses. Ireland's late improvement against Japan and New Zealand's consistency leave fans with a huge clash tomorrow.\n\nThe pool stage concludes on Thursday before the top two teams in each group and the two best third-placed teams qualify for the knockout rounds. Those final two places will give teams like Samoa and South Africa the opportunity to try and reach the knockout rounds and the chance at a medal.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com.my", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star "}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samoa", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Samoa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Kenya"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stade de France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiji", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fiji"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Fiji"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_national_rugby_union_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Australia national rugby union team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_sevens", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rugby sevens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Rugby_Sevens_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Rugby Sevens Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "East Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Uruguay"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Single-elimination tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ireland", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ireland"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_Union", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby Union", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9755459", "eventUri": "eng-9755459", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Paris"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-27", "textStart": 7, "textEnd": 14}], "sentiment": 0.419607843137255, "wgt": 117, "relevance": 1}

Maybe we did not do our best but hopefully it is going to help us more in the next game,\" said Dupont.\n\n\"We need to raise our level. If not, we will not go too far. We need to be focused on the game and not distracted because we are capable of better.\"\n\nFiji, who have had an iron grip on the gold medal in the sport's short Olympic history, suffered no such stage fright, thrashing Uruguay 40-12 and the U.S. 38-12 to top Pool C.\n\nArgentina brushed off the hostility of the crowd, who booed their national anthem in a spillover from France's loss in the 2022 soccer World Cup final, with a 31-12 romp over Kenya and a 28-12 victory over Samoa in Pool B.\n\n\"I was surprised today when we came out against Kenya and they started to boo,\" said Argentina's Gaston Revol.\n\n\"But it is okay. I understand it is because of a soccer game or something, maybe. They hate us. But I can work with it. We will be okay.\"\n\nAustralia beat Samoa 21-14 and Kenya 21-7 to join them in the quarter-finals and will play the top-ranked Argentines on Thursday to decide which side tops the pool.\n\nIreland locked up their spot in the last eight from Pool A with a tight 10-5 win over South Africa and a 40-5 blowout of Japan.\n\nNew Zealand, silver medallists in Tokyo three years ago, also thrashed Japan 40-12 before prevailing 17-5 in a bruising encounter with South Africa on the back of two tries from winger Moses Leo.\n\nSouth Africa could still progress as one of the two third-placed finishers from the three pools who will complete the quarter-final line-up.\n\nAlthough the opening ceremony of the Olympics is not until Friday, soccer and rugby sevens preliminary rounds got underway on Wednesday for logistical reasons.\n\n(Reporting by Rohith Nair, Vincent Daheron and Nick Mulvenney, editing by Pritha Sarkar)", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in", "dataType": "news", "title":

who helped them do it", "body": "The Australian men's team could meet France in Thursday's quarterfinals depending on their final pool stage matches.\n\nThe Paris 2024 Olympic Games may symbolically open along the River Seine on Friday.\n\nHowever, so packed is the sporting action set to take place over the next couple of weeks that the entertainment started a couple of days earlier, with the highly anticipated Rugby 7s on Wednesday in front of a packed Stade de France crowd of around 70,000.\n\nAs it did so, a fascinating piece of sporting symmetry played out.\n\nIt is only a faint historical reflection, admittedly, but it's still there, peeking out in plain sight in the third game of the entire tournament as the USA fought to a battling 12-12 draw with hosts and one of the tournament favourites, France.\n\nIn fact, these two obscure rivals will also meet in Pool C of the women's competition after the opening ceremony, as well as the men's.\n\nThey are match-ups that takes place a century on from one of the most acrimonious contests in rugby history.\n\nABC Sport will be live blogging every day of the Paris Olympics from July 27\n\nRugby played an important role in the early Olympic movement.\n\nBaron Pierre de Coubertin was a big fan of rugby and its amateur ethos, learned from his trips to Britain's public schools, particularly Rugby School.\n\nNot only did de Coubertin set up the organisation that ran the French rugby championship, he refereed the first ever final in 1892, where Racing Club de France, now Racing 92, beat Stade Fran\u00e7ais 4-3.\n\n\"What is admirable in football [rugby], is the perpetual mix of individualism and discipline,\" De Coubertin said.\n\n\"The necessity for each man to think, anticipate, take a decision and at the same time subordinate one's reasoning, thoughts and decisions to those of the captain.\n\n\"And even the referee's whistle stopping a player for a 'fault' one team mate has made and he hasn't seen, tests his character and patience.\n\nRugby union featured at the Games in 1900, 1908, 1920 and 1924, directly as a result of de Coubertin's insistence, something that earned him a posthumous spot in the World Rugby Hall of Fame in 2007.\n\nIt was not always well received though -- the official report of the 1924 Games noted that although rugby-football had been designated a \"compulsory sport\" by the Comit\u00e9 Olympique de Lausanne, it \"did not achieve the hoped-for success\".\n\nThat being said, a total of 41,268 supporters attended the three matches in 1924, 21,389 of them for the final.\n\nFrance won the first, three-team tournament at the Paris Games of 1900, beating Moseley Wanderers, representing Great Britain, in the final.\n\nThat French team featured Haitian player Constantin Henriquez, the first known black player to compete -- and win -- at a Games.\n\nIn 1908, the team representing Australasia defeated Great Britain -- represented by Cornwall -- in the final (and indeed only game of the two-team tournament) 32-3 at the White City Stadium.\n\nThe Olympics was just a small part of a lengthy tour of Britain and North America for a team that would go on to be known as the first Wallabies -- indeed, the Australians had already beaten Cornwall 18-5 at Camborne earlier in the tour.\n\nAmong the tourists was a 21-year-old livewire winger from St George Rugby Club, Dan Carroll, who would go on to play just two Tests for the Wallabies.\n\nHe scored a double at the White City Stadium against Cornwall -- and went on to play a major role when the sport returned to the Games in 1920.\n\nAt the Antwerp Games of 1920 there were again just two teams, this time France and the USA, the latter featuring a number of players that had never played the sport before.\n\nAmong them though, was Carroll, who had stayed in the United States following a tour in 1912, enrolling in Stanford University in California to study geology, after which he would work in the oil industry.\n\nHe also fought in World War I, was a fierce advocate for the sport of rugby in the United States amidst the growing popularity of American Football.\n\nThe US team had been permitted to compete but only if they funded themselves on account of the team being almost entirely based just in the State of California.\n\nTheir fundraising endeavours and arduous journey were well worthwhile -- they won 8-0 against the French.\n\nThat French team were, admittedly, not the greatest French team that had ever been gathered -- they only finished fourth in that year's Five Nations Championship with a solitary victory against Ireland in Dublin.\n\nThe French were, none the less, upset at having been defeated and were honour-bound to invite the USA to the tournament again four years later.\n\nAnd so, back the Americans came, taking on France and Romania at the 1924 Games.\n\nWhy so few teams? The British Lions were on tour in South Africa, ruling out England, Scotland, Ireland -- all of whom finished above France in that year's Five Nations -- Wales and the South Africans from competing, while Australia and New Zealand cited the high costs of travelling.\n\nAs for America's Australian, there appears to be some conjecture about whether Carroll was present in Paris.\n\nSome sources, including Rugby Australia, note Carroll as a non-playing member of the coaching group in 1924, but he is not named as a member of the backroom staff in the Games official report.\n\nWhether they were joined by their two-time capped Wallaby or not, the USA did not get a pleasant welcome to France when they returned in 1924.\n\nAs was the case at this year's Olympics, the rugby competition in 1924 actually got underway before the Games officially started, taking place in May. The remainder of the competitions took place in July.\n\nIt didn't start particularly well for the Americans.\n\nAfter playing some warm up games in Britain, the team embarked on a stormy crossing of the Channel, only to initially be denied entry at Boulogne-sur-Mer.\n\n\"We were in no mood for the unpleasant reception we received at the hands of the officials of the country who was supposedly entertaining the world's athletes,\" US team manager Sam Goodman wrote.\n\n\"There was no one to meet us; our baggage was seized and for a time we were not even allowed to land on French soil, simply because the French Olympic Committee had not taken care of our visas.\"\n\nThe Americans, reportedly, took matters into their own hands -- player Norman Cleaveland said the team 'near sparked a riot\" by bundling their way off the ship, leading the local press to brand them \"street fighters and saloon brawlers.\"\n\nThings got worse -- the team were insulted everywhere they went and even had their belongings ransacked and valuables taken while training.\n\nWith France smashing Romania 59-3, and the Americans doing likewise 37-0, all was set for a defacto decider in the mini-tournament's final match.\n\nIncidentally, Romania's third-place finish was the country's first ever Olympic medal.\n\nThe level of hostility the Americans experienced from the 21,389-strong crowd at the Stade de Colombes was unprecedented, and not helped by injuries to backs Jean Vaysse and Adolphe Jaur\u00e9guy caused by robust American tackling.\n\nThe French, frustrated by the physical play of the Americans, resorted to the sort of violence that plagued the game in France and led, in 1932, to their expulsion from the Five Nations championship -- a measure bought upon the French Union amidst allegations of professionalism and on-field violence that saw 18-year-old Agen winger Michel Pradie die on the field.\n\nFrench captain Ren\u00e9 Lasserre twice punched American centre Dick Hyland -- it was only the American's protestations to Welsh referee Albert Freethy that kept him from being sent off.\n\nThat all likely made the 17-3 victory in the defacto final against the France the all the sweeter for the Americans, even if it led to widespread booing and other unpleasant scenes in the stands, with police needed to assist the players off the pitch and into the safety of the dressing rooms.\n\nIt took a long time for rugby to return to the Olympic festival, 92 years in fact before Rio hosted the first Olympic sevens tournament.\n\nThe French and American women's teams met in the fifth-place final in Rio -- the only time to date that the Americans have crossed paths with the French at an Olympics since the 1924 -- with America winning 19-5.\n\nThat is America's best finishing position at a Games, while France has a silver medal to its name in the women's competition in Tokyo.\n\nFrance's men finished 7th in Rio, while the American men have recorded finishes of ninth and sixth at Rio and Tokyo respectively.\n\nThe two sides have met frequently throughout the SVNS Series this season, with France just edging the victory count in the women's (3-2) and men's (3-1), setting up what should be a tight contest at the Stade de France.\n\nFrance were, however, winners of the series ending SVNS finals series in Madrid, with the women finishing runners up to Australia, suggesting they could be teams to beat on home soil.\n\nIn Stephen Parez, the French have one of the most in-form players on the circuit this year, as well as wild card rookie of the year Antoine Dupont, a former World Rugby player of the year in 15s.\n\n\"Antoine Dupont is the best player in the world, we think,\" France skipper Paulin Riva said after France won the Madrid title.\n\nThe Americans can, in 38-year-old one-time Philadelphia Eagles draftee Perry Baker, count on one of the greatest Sevens try-scorers in history and still prolific even at his advanced years.\n\nThe two men's teams met on day one at the Games and, in something of a surprise to the 70,000 plus raucous supporters inside the famous Stade de France stadium, the two teams could not be separated, locked at 12-12.\n\nFortunately, the Stade de France crowd responded better than their predecessors did so at the Stade de Colombes, roaring on their heroes with even more gusto in the second match against Uruguay.\n\nHowever, the hosts were clearly under extraordinary pressure and it showed, with Uruguay pushing Les Bleus all the way in a 19-12 win, not helped by the late sin binning of French forward Andy Timo.\n\nThat was in stark contrast to the Australians, who comfortably beat Kenya 21-7 and edged Samoa 21-14. The Aussies play Argentina on Thursday,\n\nThe women's competition takes place over the weekend, and is set for just as much excitement.\n\nThe USA women's team have a fascinating mix of experience and youthful exuberance, with stars like Ilona Maher helping spread the appeal of the sport Stateside via her huge presence on social media, where she has half a million followers on Instagram and over a million on TikTok.\n\nBoth teams will go in fancying their chances, but there are plenty of other teams with the same aspirations, including defending champions Fiji (men) and New Zealand (women), Australia, of course -- and given the history, let's not rule out the USA either.", "source": {"uri": "abc.net.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Australian Broadcasting Corporation"},

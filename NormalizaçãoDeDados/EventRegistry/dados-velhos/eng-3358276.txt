Theo Riddick has been practicing with a red no-contact jersey all of camp. And the Lions occasionally give the 33-year-old Ngata scheduled rest days.\n\nAbdullah said last week that he expects to play on Sunday, and starting cornerback Nevin Lawson said Friday that he hopes to be on the field as well.\n\nThe Colts won't have quarterback Andrew Luck, who's on the physically unable to perform list while he recovers from off-season shoulder surgery, or starting center Ryan Kelly, who left Thursday's practice with an injury.\n\n\"End of the day, I believe in working,\" Lawson said. \"Any type of work I can get, I'll be happy with it. I'm not a guy that just wants to shy away and say, nah, it's first preseason (game). If I got to work, I'll be glad to do it.

On second-and-8 from the Detroit 28, Stafford threw a nice touch pass to TJ Jones cutting across the field for 22 yards. Then disaster.

Insiders Stephen Holder and David Birkett discuss what to expect on Sunday. Clark Wade/IndyStar\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nFive things to watch in the Detroit Lions' preseason opener against the Indianapolis Colts:\n\n* Rookie debuts: The Lions spent a first-round pick on Jarrad Davis, and wide receiver Kenny Golladay has been the talk of training camp. On Sunday, both will make their team debuts. Golladay said nerves led to some drops in Thursday's joint practice with the Colts, but both he and the hard-hitting Davis seem ready for the big stage.\n\n[Where do the Lions rank? Our 2017 Freep NFL preseason power rankings]\n\n* G Money: Greg Robinson put together two solid practices against the Colts this week, giving hope the Lions might not be up a creek at the left tackle position after all. Robinson's history as a starter is sketchy, and he's still learning the playbook. But a good showing Sunday will calm some fears about the Taylor Decker-less offensive line.\n\n* Bottle returns: The kick- and punt-return jobs are wholly up for grabs with about a month left before real games begin. Jamal Agnew returned a punt for a touchdown in the Lions' mock game, and he, TJ Jones, Jace Billingsley and Keshawn Martin all could get a crack at the job tonight. Dwayne Washington shined as a kick returner last preseason, can one of the aforementioned quartet do the same on punts this year?\n\nMore: Jamie Samuelsen: After Stafford, Ameer Abdullah is most important Lions\n\n* Hurricane rising: Blink and you'll miss Matthew Stafford on the field today, but the Lions should have plenty of snaps to go around for backups Jake Rudock and Brad Kaaya. Rudock is a virtual lock for the No. 2 job, while Kaaya, a sixth-round pick out of Miami, might need a strong preseason to win a spot on the 53-man roster.\n\n* On guard: You want a sleeper of a position battle two weeks into camp? The backup guard spot(s). With T.J. Lang in and out of the lineup as he makes his way back from hip surgery, Joe Dahl and Laken Tomlinson will be under a microscope Sunday. Tomlinson, Martin Mayhew's last first-round pick in 2015, has fallen behind Dahl in the rotation. It's time for him to make good on his talent.\n\nContact Dave Birkett: dbirkett@freepress.com.

Insiders Stephen Holder and David Birkett discuss what to expect on Sunday. Clark Wade/IndyStar\n\nCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE\n\nEvery time Dwayne Washington touched the ball last year, it seemed like he was trying to make a big play.\n\nToo often, Washington took a handoff that was designed to go between the tackles and bounced it outside in search of a long run. His lack of patience irked coaches and teammates, and came to a head when left tackle Taylor Decker called out one unnamed player for going \"rogue\" in a December loss to the New York Giants.\n\nThat player was Washington.\n\nIn the weeks following the Giants loss, Washington's role decreased dramatically. He had seven carries total over the Lions' final three games, and played just one offensive snap in the team's wildcard loss to the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nNow, as he enters his second season and Sunday's preseason opener against the Indianapolis Colts, Washington is \"to the point he's kind of done a 180\" as a player, Lions running backs coach David Walker said.\n\n\"Consistency (is the biggest thing) for him,\" Walker said. \"Trust his coaching, trust his eyes. Not try to make a play, let those big plays come to him. Sometimes if guys are trying to make a play, they miss a 4-yard run trying to make a 20-yard run and end up with a minus-2. So that's his - that's where he can help himself a little bit more. Just play with inside the offense. You don't have to do too much.\"\n\nMore Lions:\n\n5 things to watch in Lions' NFL preseason opener against the Colts\n\nJamie Samuelsen: After Stafford, Ameer Abdullah is most important Lions\n\nAt 6 feet 2 and 223 pounds, Washington is the most physically gifted running back on the Lions' roster.\n\nHe doesn't have Ameer Abdullah's moves or Theo Riddick's hands or Zach Zenner's master's level understanding of the playbook. But as the Lions try to revitalize a rushing attack that ranked 30th in the NFL last year, Washington could be an important part of their success.\n\n\"Last year you could tell that he was a guy that was kind of like in training, so to speak,\" Walker said. \"He's made nice strides. He's mastering the offense much better than what he was a year ago, and like I said, he doesn't have to go make a play. Just play ball. You don't have to go try to do something out of character. Just because you can run real fast doesn't mean every time you've got to try to sprint around the edge when we hand you the ball on the outside. So he's fine. He's done a nice 180.\"\n\nWashington's appetite for the big play was whetted by a strong preseason last year, when delivered two long scores.\n\nA seventh-round pick out of the University of Washington, Washington turned heads with a 96-yard kickoff return for a touchdown on his first touch of the preseason against the Pittsburgh Steelers, and he closed exhibition play with a 58-yard touchdown run against the Buffalo Bills.\n\nWhile those touchdowns proved that Washington had the goods to succeed in the NFL, they also made it easier for the rookie to overlook what he lacked.\n\nA wide receiver early in his college days, Washington still was learning the running back position and didn't have the instincts and know-how of his veteran teammates.\n\n\"There's things that guys got to see when the ball's handed to them,\" Walker said. \"Sometimes his eyes weren't quite where they needed to be and, 'Oh (crap), I'm not sure. Let me just do this.' That's when you have some issues.\"\n\nOn top of that, Washington said his conditioning wasn't where it should have been as a rookie, and he set out to fix that with an array of pool workouts and lateral agility drills this off-season.\n\n\"One thing I had to start off with was opening up my lungs,\" Washington said. \"I did a lot of swimming because I noticed that when I get a little fatigued and tired that's when my vision started to wear out.\n\n\"I feel 100% (better now). It's eye-opening.\"\n\nWashington remains a work in progress, and he's had his share of growing pains in camp. He dropped a pair of passes in a joint practice with the Colts on Thursday, and he's been inconsistent in pass protection, to be kind.\n\nBut Walker said Washington's tools still are tantalizing, and Lions coach Jim Caldwell said he's in a better position to contribute to the team.\n\n\"It probably goes without saying that he has a better grasp of the things around him and oftentimes there's so much information that's given to you, it's tough to keep up with everything,\" Caldwell said. \"Some things you might be a little bit shaky on from time to time. He's limiting his mistakes. Just in terms of overall, he's better physically and I like where he is right now.\"\n\nContact Dave Birkett: dbirkett@freepress.com. Follow him on Twitter @davebirkett.

Unfortunately, their time on the field will be limited to pregame (or postgame) handshakes.\n\nAndrew Luck and the Indianapolis Colts will welcome Matthew Stafford and the Detroit Lions to Indiana Sunday to kick off each team's preseason. The game will begin at 1:30 p.m. ET and air on NFL Network. A live stream is available at Watch NFL Network, NFL Game Pass, and the NFL mobile app.\n\nLuck, still recovering from offseason shoulder surgery, is the most prominent member of his team's physically unable to play (PUP) list. While his rehab has been going well, the Colts aren't eager to rush their star back into the lineup. His status for the opening game of the regular season is still up in the air.\n\nStafford, recovering from an injury of his own, has no such restrictions. The 29-year-old put together one of the finest stretches of his NFL career and emerged as an MVP candidate before a Week 14 finger injury sapped him of his accuracy and sent the Lions into a tailspin. Detroit lost its final four games of the season, leaving 2017 as a mission to right that wrong.\n\nIf Stafford plays, it won't be for long. Backups Jake Rudock and Brad Kaaya will likely take most of the snaps.\n\nOne player to watch for the Lions is rookie wide receiver Kenny Golladay. Detroit got a major boost to offset Calvin Johnson's retirement by signing Marvin Jones away from the Bengals, but the team's receiving corps remains shallow behind him and Golden Tate.\n\nThe Lions passed up wideouts with more name recognition to gamble on Golladay in the third round of this year's draft. To his credit, the young wideout has the stats to run with anyone selected in this year's event. A former FCS standout, he played two seasons at Northern Illinois and recorded nearly 2,300 receiving yards, 18 touchdowns, and an impressive 14.3 yards per catch. At 6'4 he's a solid red zone target, but he's also got the speed (a 4.5-second flat 40-yard dash) to stretch the field and give Stafford another versatile target.\n\nFor the Colts, keep an eye on running back Marlon Mack, if a shoulder injury doesn't keep him out of the game.\n\nFrank Gore is still playing in 2017. In fact, Frank Gore is still a starting running back in 2017. Gore turned back the hands of time to run for more than 1,000 yards last fall, but at 34 years old, he's bashed through the line and into the twilight of his career.\n\nEnter Mack, a fourth-round pick in 2017 who ran for 1,000 yards or more in each of his three seasons at South Florida. Mack isn't a surefire prospect, but he'll have plenty of opportunities to earn a starting role this preseason on a depleted Colts depth chart.\n\nThis is the only NFL game on Sunday afternoon, so it's either this or baseball.\n\nAnnouncers: Matt Shepard, Chris Spielman (Detroit); Don Fischer, Rick Venturi (Indianapolis)", "timeCrawl": "14:11:00", "sim": 0.5921568870544434, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8925161", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/American", "id": 32, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "id": 49, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "id": 51, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "id": 52, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Service_Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Society/Organizations/Service Clubs", "id": 823, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Multiplayer", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Multiplayer", "id": 1009, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

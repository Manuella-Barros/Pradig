He also recalled the moment things turned scary after he and Rob, 45, joined in a drag photoshoot in San Marco Square.\n\nHe had to persuade Rob, but eventually the pair joined in the fun. Rylan said: \"Rob finally got it and we dressed up in drag, the pair of us, and we walked with the whole collective to San Marco Square - Rob was giving Pauline Fowler vibes, it was the look he ended up with.\"\n\nWhile walking through the square, the 35 year old could hearing a young man shouting something in Italian at them, prompting him to ask one of the drag queens to translate. Rylan claimed the man said \"burn the f*****s\".\n\n\"I'm now 20 foot in a pair of heels, I wanted to go mad,\" Rylan admitted. \"I wanted to go after this bloke and basically knock him out.\"\n\nHowever, moments later the group encountered some older women, who were much more supportive. Rylan told how they all \"stood up and clapped\" for the drag queens as they came past, which he branded a \"realisation moment\".\n\n\"That was a real realisation moment, not just for us, but for them as well. They realised the people they thought we would offend or upset are the ones looking after us. It was really beautiful,\" the TV star added.\n\nRob and Rylan's new show will air on BBC Two on 12 May. The pair previously opened up about becoming an unlikely duo, admitting they bonded over their similarities - especially their divorces.\n\n\"Me and Rob, we've been through a lot of the same things,\" Rylan, who split from husband Dean Neal in 2021, said. \"We have the same f**king lawyer - she earned a fortune out of us! We're both recently divorced and we're both finding ourselves.\"", "source": {"uri": "ok.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "ok"}, "authors": [{"uri": "danni_king@ok.co.uk", "name": "Danni King", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "tasha_hall@ok.co.uk", "name": "Tasha Hall", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rylan_Clark-Neal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rylan Clark-Neal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_queen", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Drag queen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behind_closed_doors_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Behind closed doors (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Rinder", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert Rinder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judge_Rinder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Judge Rinder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piazza_San_Marco", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Piazza San Marco"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Venice", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republic of Venice"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Two", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC Two"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Celebrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Homophobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_Attwood", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Olivia Attwood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauline_Fowler", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pauline Fowler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LGBT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://i2-prod.ok.co.uk/incoming/article32710447.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_This-Morning-TV-show-London-UK-25-Nov-2019.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548965", "eventUri": "eng-9548965", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-12", "textStart": 1920, "textEnd": 1926}], "sentiment": -0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

We're both recently divorced and we're both finding ourselves.\"\n\nWith Rylan, 35, embracing single life and Rob, 45, still processing his 2018 divorce from lawyer Seth Cumming, the pair head on an educational - and sometimes debauched - journey across Italy in Rob And Rylan's Grand Tour. The duo follow in the steps of 19th-century poet Lord Byron, admiring the art of Venice, the sculptures of Florence and finally the operas of Rome.\n\nNot only did they learn a lot over in Italy, they also brought back with them a lifelong friendship. \"We'd marry each other tomorrow,\" Rylan says, with a smiling Rob adding, \"Platonically!\"\n\nRylan continues, \"I genuinely don't get connections with people that often in life. I could call Rob at three in the morning and say one word - I know he'd be in fits of laughter. I could also call Rob and say, 'I need help,' and he'd be there straight away and vice versa.\"\n\nMarking the 200th anniversary of Byron's death, the pair visit some of Italy's most iconic landmarks - with Rob realising just how perceptive former X Factor contestant Rylan can be.\n\n\"While viewing one of Sandro Botticelli's paintings, many of the film crew were moved to tears watching Rylan notice something so profound in it,\" Rob says. \"And there's a moment at the Venus de Milo sculpture when Rylan notices an imperfection on the foot that great art historians took years to notice!\"\n\nMeanwhile, Rylan was tasked with persuading Rob to check out the nightlife. \"Rob is the sort of person who will read a book and find every fine detail. It was my job to take the book out of his hand and go, 'Let's not read about it. Let's go and do it!'\"\n\nAnd it seems that he succeeded. \"At the end of the Florence episode, I'm getting off with a French rugby player and Rob is dancing on the bar!\" Rylan laughs. \"That night was never supposed to happen. We went to the one gay bar in Venice and Rob at first said, 'I just don't know how to talk to people.'\n\n\"Within three minutes, he looks at this guy and goes, 'You look like Michelangelo,' and that just sets the night off. The way it ended was just beautiful.\"\n\nRob managed to fit in some fun for himself on the trip by fulfilling his lifelong dream of conducting Vivaldi's Four Seasons in the church where it was first performed.\n\n\"Honestly, it was the most fun you could have with your clothes on,\" Rob says. \"I'd been up all night with the scoring and learned it by heart. It was without question a bucket list moment - it was one of the best nights of my life.\"\n\nThe series isn't without its emotional moments, with the pair opening up about their past loves on the journey.\n\n\"I don't think we realised how different we are and how similar we are at the same time,\" Rylan says. \"Hearing Rob talk about his relationship and him hearing me talking about mine, we didn't want to lie [to the cameras]. We were like, 'If we're going to do this, let's actually do this and not hold anything back.'\"\n\nThey add that there's one particularly \"uncomfortable\" scene in Rome, which led Rylan to panic and leave the film crew.\n\n\"I didn't know Rylan was on The X Factor so I went, 'Let's have a sing-song,' when we met some opera singers,\" Rob explains. \"I handed the music to Rylan and his whole complexion changed.\"\n\nRylan continues, \"I don't know what happened. There was something about a camera being in my face and it took me back to, 'This is your song for this week, five hours before a live X Factor show on a Saturday night, and we're changing everything.' Being thrown to the lions.\n\n\"I had to stop and walk out. I found myself walking around Rome. I hate using this word loosely but it was like PTSD. I hadn't felt like that for years.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Rob found himself out of his comfort zone when the duo donned drag and Venetian masks in Venice. \"He wasn't going to dress up,\" Rylan reveals. \"But you kept your heels on a lot longer than me.\"\n\nRob adds, \"You said I looked like Pauline Fowler! Exploring the idea of what it means to wear a mask in the 21st century, I was really moved by that experience, and there's no way but for Rylan that I would have done it. I think all blokes should have to do that.\"\n\nDespite a couple of dicey moments, Rylan and Rob's Italian tour proved to be a great success - and the friends are already planning their next trip.\n\n\"We've been having a discussion and the grand tour was fun for us. I feel like we've shown what the grand tourists were all about, and now it might be time for me and Rob to see what we're like as tourists somewhere else.\"\n\nRob adds, \"Whatever enables people, whoever you are and whatever background you come from, to go, 'F**k it, I'll have a go at that.' That's the thing that I think matters.\"\n\nRob And Rylan's Grand Tour air Sunday 12 May at 9pm on BBC Two.", "source": {"uri": "ok.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "ok"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lauren_morris@ok.co.uk", "name": "Lauren Morris", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rylan_Clark-Neal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rylan Clark-Neal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Divorce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Byron", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lord Byron"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Florence"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florence"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venice", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Venice"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_X_Factor_(British_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The X Factor (British TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Rinder", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert Rinder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Opera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "BBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rome"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_de_Milo", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Venus de Milo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Four_Seasons_(Vivaldi)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Four Seasons (Vivaldi)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandro_Botticelli", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sandro Botticelli"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Two", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "BBC Two"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Tour", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grand Tour"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightlife", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nightlife"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_bar", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gay bar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelangelo", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michelangelo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sculpture", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sculpture"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rugby football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauline_Fowler", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pauline Fowler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnival_of_Venice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carnival of Venice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_queen", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drag queen"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts", "label": "dmoz/Arts", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Filmmaking", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Movies/Guides", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Divorce", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Divorce", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Arts_and_Entertainment", "label": "news/Arts and Entertainment", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i2-prod.ok.co.uk/incoming/article32509191.ece/alternates/s1200/0_js329408239.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548965", "eventUri": "eng-9548965", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-12", "textStart": 5160, "textEnd": 5166}], "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

I always thought when you were younger \"imagine if you were known, you would be able to get anyone you want\". It's the complete opposite. I've had two dates in the last two years.\n\nRylan Clark has revealed his is dating again as he opened up about his love-life on Wednesday following his split from husband Dan Neal\n\nThe presenter, 35, suffered a mental health breakdown following his marital split in 2021 from now ex Dan\n\n'One of them was really, really great and was going well. And then my job was just too much for his life. And then the other one was so interested in my job, he decided to call the press. So they're the two opposite ends of the spectrum. I need somebody in the middle that can deal with it, but don't want it.'\n\nRylan said his divorce was the 'worst experience of his life' as he went on a 'downward spiral' and he tried to 'end' his own life.\n\nThe Radio 2 presenter continued: 'I just went on a downward spiral. I tried to end it. I tried to finish myself off. I didn't eat, I went down to nine stone. I'm six foot four. Rob, I looked horrendous.'\n\nDiscussing divorce, Rylan added that is has taught him that 'nothing is forever unless it is right'.\n\nDuring the BBC series, Rob and Rylan's Grand Tour the pair explore Venice, Rome and Florence.\n\nRylan and Dan split in 2021 following six years of marriage and the star was forced to take time out from work to look after his mental health.\n\nIn his memoir, Ten: The Decade That Changed My Future, Rylan reveals that he cheated on Dan 'years ago' but only told him in 2021, which caused the former police officer to walk out.\n\nDuring Rylan's latest BBC TV series, Grand Tour with Rob Rinder, the pair were set up on fun bling dates which the former X Factor said is a rare thing for him to go on\n\nHe explained how he is 'unlucky in love' and has only been on 'two dates' following his marriage split but neither of them were the one for him\n\nRylan said: 'I've had two dates in the last two years. One of them was really great and was going well, then my job was just too much for his life'\n\nHe wrote: 'I woke up one morning and decided to tell my now ex that I had cheated on him, years ago. I'm not sure why it was that time, or that day I had to do it. But I did.'\n\nOn the reaction, Rylan continued: 'He left. Told me it was over and that was that. You're not surprised? I get that. But I couldn't believe it.'\n\nAs to why he cheated, Rylan said: 'I have no excuses for what I did way back then, but I had my reasons.\n\n'I think for many years I had felt a bit like an imposter. That nothing I was doing was right or not quite good enough. There were times when people told me this, and so confirmed my own self-doubts.\n\n'And you know, when it's those closest to you giving you this feedback, of course you take it to heart. Similarly, someone loving me this way was all I had ever wanted and now I'd found it.\n\n'The reality is that over the course of my relationship I had started to feel wrong: I felt I was wrong for being successful, wrong for being me.'\n\nWhile the pair did attempt to give their relationship another go, Dan ultimately left again after just two weeks.\n\nAfter his divorce in 2021, Rylan took a four month break from the spotlight and cancelled all his work commitments, including hosting Eurovision.\n\nRylan later confirmed the separation in a statement which said: 'Following reports about Dan and I spending time apart, I feel I have to speak out - as the way it is being reported is unfair.\n\nRylan and Dan split in 2021 following six years of marriage and the star was forced to take time out from work to look after his mental health\n\n'I have made a number of mistakes which I deeply regret and have inevitably led to the breakdown of our marriage.'\n\nSpeaking out, the TV presenter explained how he tried to take his own life twice after reaching a point where he was unable to 'see, hear, eat, breathe or sleep'.\n\nDiscussing his struggle on Matt Willis' On The Mend podcast, Rylan said he 'lost himself' after the divorce.\n\nRylan said: 'I can't remember what made me disappear basically from the person I knew.\n\n'But the next thing I knew I could not see, hear, eat, breathe, sleep - I couldn't do anything.\n\n'And yeah, there was no signs of me having a break down, there was no signs of - like if you're having a heart attack, you'll get the pains in your arm, you'll get this... you know something's about to happen even if it's seconds before.\n\n'I didn't have the seconds, I just had the impact basically. The baseball bat round the face I call it.

Then all of a sudden I had quite a big speed bump, and instead of carrying on I just sank. It was the worst experience of my life.\"\n\nHe continued, revealing the extent of his despair: \"I just went on a downward spiral. I tried to end it. I tried to finish myself off. I didn't eat, I went down to nine stone. I'm six foot four. Rob, I looked horrendous. I'm so grateful for what I've got. I come from a council house. Like, I'm not saying we were on the breadline because we was not on the breadline, but we didn't have a lot.\"\n\n\"But in those moments and even to this day, if I had to give it all up, to not have to put my mum through what I put her through when I got ill? Fine, take it. It was horrendous. She's a 70 year old woman. And she had to watch her successful son literally disintegrate.\"\n\nThe two celebrities continued to discuss break-ups, with Rylan adding: \"What has it taught us? Nothing is forever unless it is right.\"\n\nHe noted, revealing his newfound perspective: \"I have no limits now, nothing phases me.\"\n\nRylan and Rob are currently participating in a contemporary version of The Grand Tour, famously associated with the young nobility of the 18th Century as part of their historical tradition.\n\nThis obligatory rite involved a journey across Europe where these young men would immerse themselves in its culture, and architecture, also embarking on a voyage of self-discovery.\n\nIn their own 2024 variation of the tour, Rylan and Rob go on fun blind dates set up for them, something which Rylan admits is an uncommon occurrence in his life.\n\nHe stated optimistically: \"Hopefully my luck with men is about to change. I always thought when you were younger 'imagine if you were known, you would be able to get anyone you want'. It's the complete opposite. I've had two dates in the last two years.\"\n\n\"One of them was really, really great and was going well. And then my job was just too much for his life. And then the other one was so interested in my job, he decided to call the press. So they're the two opposite ends of the spectrum. I need somebody in the middle that can deal with it, but don't want it.\"\n\nLater, the duo don theatrical masks, a nod to the practices of 18th-century young nobles. Rylan likens the masks to his habit of wearing fake tan and makeup on TV and in public.\n\nArguing that his TV and radio character, adored by millions, is a mere \"caricature\" of his true self, he revealed: \"For me wearing a mask, whether it's a massive mask that covers my entire face or whether it's foundation, concealer and bronzer, to me that makes me feel better about facing the world.

Because I fell into this trap like I've created this almost caricature of what people expect me to be like.\"\n\n\"I'm very much two people, so everyone knows me as Rylan - has a laugh, big teeth, wears a bit of makeup - a lot of makeup - and is just that presenter off the Telly or that idiot off the Telly. Whereas actually at home I'm Ross. Ross is who I grew up as. Rylan's my job. Ross is the one that sits at home with a tracksuit and a Peroni in my hand so I am very different.\"\n\nHe added defiantly, \"So you can take the pi** out of my teeth and you can say I look orange, but at the end of the day when I wipe it all off, Ross isn't bruised, Rylan takes the battering, that's how I deal with it.\"\n\nRylan views this BBC series as a restart in life, where they roam across Venice, Rome, and Florence.\n\nThe trip mirrors the grand journey of romantic poet Lord Byron, with this year marking the 200th anniversary of his passing.\n\nEarlier this year, Rylan made a documentary examining homophobia in football and why he still feels uncomfortable attending matches of his favourite team, West Ham.\n\nIn his autobiography published in September 2022, he revealed a low point in his life when he attempted suicide.\n\nHowever, he sought help and has since bounced back, maintaining his popularity by hosting his own Radio 2 show and being part of the BBC's Eurovision coverage this weekend.\n\nGet the latest celebrity gossip and telly news sent straight to your inbox.

Nothing is forever unless it is right.\"He added: \"I have no limits now, nothing phases me.\"\n\nAs part of the BBC series Rob and Rylan's Grand Tour they are on what could be termed the original gap year. The Grand Tour was a rite of passage for the young male nobility of the 18th Century, who would travel to Europe to discover its culture, architecture and themselves.\n\nAs part of their own version in 2024, Rylan and Rob go on fun blind dates set up for them and Rylan says it is a rare thing for him.

They are following in the footsteps of one of the most famous of Grand Tourists, romantic poet Lord Byron, on the 200th anniversary of his death.\n\nEarlier this year Rylan also made a documentary to look at homophobia in football and why he still feels uncomfortable to go to watch his beloved West Ham. In September 2022 he wrote in his autobiography how he attempted suicide at a low point in his life.

And they said, \"Burn the [homophobic slur].\"\n\n'I'm now 20 foot in a pair of heels - because I'm 19 without; I wanted to go mad. I wanted to go after this bloke and basically knock him out.'\n\nRylan continued: 'Then what happened, 20 metres later there was a group of old nonnas, probably in their 90s, and they all stood up and clapped us.\n\n'It was that realisation of thinking we always blame the older generation for everything, they're backward in their thinking, when actually it was that generation that was applauding this collective for being comfortable in who they are, and yet it was our generation of people who were shouting out the [homophobic slur].'\n\nRylan has previously revealed the vile homophobic messages he was sent after his powerful football documentary, Rylan: Homophobia, Football and Me, aired on Tuesday.\n\nHe recalled his own memories of what growing up as a football fan as a gay man was like, saying he had his 'fair share of s**t thrown at me'.\n\nAfter the show aired, Rylan shared screenshots of some of the abuse he received on Instagram.\n\nHe wrote: 'Thanks to everyone who watched last night. Here's a few comments from the promo vids that have been released from my documentary about homophobia in football.\n\n'Just thought I'd highlight the reason why I was asked to front this show. Case closed. I've blurred the usernames as to not encourage the same behaviour towards them.\n\n'Thanks for all your great comments, and thanks to everyone involved in making the show x.'\n\nRylan's post was showered in support from fans and friends alike with Union J singer Josh Cuthbert writing: 'The world still needs massively educating doesn't it. F**k sake.'\n\nSoaps star James Sutton added: 'So much love for you and so much respect for this project.'\n\nZander Murray, Scotland's first openly gay male footballer, also shared: 'Ignore them \u2764\ufe0f making a big impact.'\n\nRob and Rylan's Grand Tour starts on Sunday, May 12 at 9pm on BBC Two and BBC iPlayer.\n\nIf you've got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the

Rylan later confessed he had been unfaithful during their relationship.\n\nNow, Rylan has spoken about his love life and shared details on a couple of dates he's been on in the last two years.\n\nIn his new show, Rob and Rylan's Grand Tour with Robert Rinder, Rylan opens up about dating.\n\nThe series sees the pair travelling around Italy as they retrace the steps of the Grand Tourists of the past.\n\nHopefully my luck with men is about to change.\n\nAccording to the Mirror, in the show, Rylan opens up to Rob about the aftermath of his marriage breakdown. He says: \"I think it was a culmination of my marriage breaking down and actually me stopping for the first time in 10 years. Then all of a sudden I had quite a big speed bump, and instead of carrying on I just sank. It was the worst experience of my life.\"\n\n\"I just went on a downward spiral. I tried to end it, I tried to finish myself off,\" he added: \"I didn't eat, I went down to nine stone. I'm six foot four. Rob, I looked horrendous. I'm so grateful for what I've got. I come from a council house. Like, I'm not saying we were on the breadline because we was not on the breadline, but we didn't have a lot.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the pair go on some blind dates set up for them. Speaking about dating, Rylan says: \"Hopefully my luck with men is about to change. I always thought when you were younger 'imagine if you were known, you would be able to get anyone you want'. It's the complete opposite. I've had two dates in the last two years.\n\n\"One of them was really, really great and was going well. And then my job was just too much for his life. And then the other one was so interested in my job, he decided to call the press. So they're the two opposite ends of the spectrum. I need somebody in the middle that can deal with it, but don't want it.\"\n\nRylan has been open about his marriage split, recently admitting he \"couldn't understand why I pressed the nuclear button on my seemingly perfect life\".\n\nThe star added to The Guardian earlier this year: \"It's only now I'm better that I realise it was the ejector seat I needed. Now I just wish I'd pressed that escape button earlier.\n\n\"I got so ill to the point where I knew I couldn't get any iller. I couldn't speak; I had to learn to speak again, I had to learn to move again - it was like I'd had a stroke.

The couple's six-year marriage came to a heartbreaking end after Rylan confessed he'd been unfaithful, and the fallout that ensued proved to be 'extremely traumatic'.\n\nNow, the Mirror has exclusively revealed that Rylan is out and about dating once more - and hopes his luck with men will change sharpish following two disappointing encounters. As Rylan hosts coverage for the second semi-final of this year's Eurovision Song Contest, the Mirror takes a look at his painful divorce, and the serious toll it took on his mental and physical health - including extreme weight loss and two heart failures...\n\nBig Brother romance and painful divorce Sparks flew between the pair on the set of Big Brother\n\nRylan first locked eyes with former police officer Dan while filming Big Brother's Bit on the Side. Big Brother contestant Dan was evicted in the sixth week of the series - with Ryan hosting his exit interview. Things moved quickly from there, and Rylan knew from the very beginning that there was something special between them.\n\nWhen asked about the best kiss of his life in a 2019 interview with The Guardian, smitten Rylan replied: \"The first one I had with my husband Dan in late 2013. I just knew.\"\n\nDuring this happier period in their relationship, Rylan also opened up to iNews about how Big Brother had given him both a career and a husband, reflecting: \"I won Big Brother, I then got asked to host Big Brother's Bit On The Side. It gave me a career. It then gave me my husband and gave me the life I have now. Without Big Brother, I don't think any of this would have happened. It was the best apprenticeship I could have asked for.\"\n\nTheir romance deepened into something more, and Dan proposed during a trip to Paris - and Rylan joyfully accepted. Expressing his surprise and excitement in his 2016 book The Life of Rylan, the star remembered that he'd responded with the less traditional response of \"F**K OFF, C**T, C**T, YOU'RE A C**T \", before hitting his betrothed on the arm.\n\nHe added: \"Seriously this is exactly as it happened. He didn't know what to say and neither did I. I was just in so much shock... [He thought] 'Am I on Ant and Dec? Is this a wind-up?'.\"\n\nThe lovebirds tied the knot in 2015, in a star-studded bash attended by the likes of Amy Childs, Katie Price, and Eamonn Holmes, and for a while, everything seemed rosy. Rylan loved being a stepdad to Dan's son Cameron, and there had been talk of them extending their family. They even ended up making history together as the first gay couple to host This Morning.\n\nSadly, their newlywed bliss wasn't to last and, in June 2021, Rylan confirmed that he and Dan had gone their separate ways during an interview with The Sun. Admitting to 'mistakes' on his part, Rylan told fans: \"Following reports about Dan and I spending time apart, I feel I have to speak out - as the way it is being reported is unfair.\n\n\"I have made a number of mistakes which I deeply regret and have inevitably led to the breakdown of our marriage. I have taken time away from work as I am not in a good place at the moment and am seeking help.\"\n\nCheating woes and deep regrets After confessing his infidelity to Dan, Rylan was stunned by his response\n\nRylan has previously confessed that Dan left him due to his infidelity. Having cheated on him years beforehand, Rylan finally decided to come clean in May 2021 - but didn't expect his husband would actually end things. In his candid 2022 memoir, Ten: The Decade That Changed My Future, Rylan wrote: \"I have no excuses for what I did way back then, but I had my reasons. I think for many years I had felt a bit like an imposter. That nothing I was doing was right or not quite good enough.\n\n\"There were times when people told me this, and so confirmed my own self-doubts. And you know, when it's those closest to you giving you this feedback, of course you take it to heart.\"\n\nExpressing shock at Dan's reaction, he continued: \"He left. Told me it was over and that was that. You're not surprised? I get that. But I couldn't believe it.\"\n\nDuring an episode of Kathy Burke's Where There's A Will There's A Wake podcast back in March of this year, Rylan admitted that, although he didn't regret getting married, he did wish he'd thought to get a prenup first. Rylan mused: \"I don't regret getting married. I mean I regret not having a f***ing prenup. That's the only thing I regret. But even though everyone was like get a prenup, I was like I'm in love. Silly prick.\"\n\nBreakdown and heart failure The divorce had a catastrophic effect on Rylan's mental health\n\nThe split had a profound effect on Rylan's mental health, forcing him to take four months away from his work to recover. Opening up about his difficulties during an August 2023 episode of Matt Willis's On The Mend podcast,' Rylan shared that he'd made two suicide attempts during the dark period that followed his divorce.\n\nAsserting that he'd 'lost himself' during the ordeal, Rylan said: \"I can't remember what made me disappear basically from the person I knew. But the next thing I knew I could not see, hear, eat, breathe, sleep - I couldn't do anything.\n\n\"And yeah, there was no signs of me having a breakdown, there was no signs of - like if you're having a heart attack, you'll get the pains in your arm, you'll get this... you know something's about to happen even if it's seconds before. I didn't have the seconds, I just had the impact basically. The baseball bat round the face I call it. And yeah, I got very ill.\"\n\nThe presenter was severely underweight during this low point and even ended up suffering two heart failures. As per Metro, Rylan revealed the extent of his frightening health scares during An Evening With Rylan Clark event at London Royal Festival Hall in September 2022.\n\nRylan recalled: \"It was like my body had shut down. Twice last year I ended up back in an ambulance because my heart had failed and it was really strange because I just remember for a couple of weeks going, 'My heart hurts'.\"\n\nThe former X Factor star was told he had an alarming resting heart rate of 248 beats per minute - with a normal resting heart rate for adults ranging from 60 to 100 beats per minute. He continued: \"My heart had to be restarted. I just remember lying in re-sus[citation], because I had these pads on with all these wires and not understanding what it was.\"\n\nSpeaking with journalist Elizabeth Day in May 2023, on her How To Fail podcast, Rylan reflected that his 'extremely traumatic' divorce had 'nearly killed' him - all while shaping the person he is today. Rylan explained: \"When you know you have been rock bottom, like to the point of no return nearly, that's when you sit there and go, 'I will never let anything or anyone get me to where I was in that state. Not even myself, I will never let that happen to myself again [...]\n\n\"I'd like to sit here and think that the breakdown of my marriage has made me the person I am now, and I'm really, really, happy, with the person I am now, and I can sleep very well at night.\"\n\nDating again Rylan opened up to pal Rob Rinder about his romantic woes The star is now back on the dating scene\n\nRylan recently revealed that he's back on the dating scene again following his years of heartbreak, opening up to close pal Rob Rinder in a new BBC series, Rob and Rylan's Grand Tour. The show follows the two newly divorced men as they retrace the steps of the Grand Tourists of the past.\n\nFor younger noblemen of the 18th century, the Grand Tour - or the original gap year - was a rite of passage, and would see them travel around Europe to soak up culture, architecture and experiences - all while finding themselves. In other words, an ideal trip for two divorc\u00e9es looking ahead to the next chapter.\n\nTheir adventures soon took a romantic turn, with both Rylan and Rob heading on fun blind dates that had been set up for them. Rylan shared: \"Hopefully my luck with men is about to change. I always thought when you were younger 'imagine if you were known, you would be able to get anyone you want'. It's the complete opposite. I've had two dates in the last two years.\n\n\"One of them was really, really great and was going well. And then my job was just too much for his life. And then the other one was so interested in my job, he decided to call the press. So they're the two opposite ends of the spectrum. I need somebody in the middle that can deal with it, but don't want it.\"\n\nIf you're struggling and need to talk, the Samaritans operate a free helpline open 24/7 on 116 123.

I just knew.\"\n\nRylan Clark recently reminisced on his time in Big Brother, revealing how it had not only provided him with a career but also a husband.\n\nIn an interview with iNews, he reflected, \"I won Big Brother, I then got asked to host Big Brother's Bit On The Side.\n\nIt gave me a career. It then gave me my husband and gave me the life I have now.\n\nWithout Big Brother, I don't think any of this would have happened. It was the best apprenticeship I could have asked for.\"\n\nTheir romance blossomed, leading to Dan's spontaneous proposal during a trip to Paris.\n\nRylan's reaction to the proposal was a mix of surprise and excitement, as he recalled in his 2016 book, The Life of Rylan.\n\nHe remembered responding with \"F**K OFF, C**T, C**T, YOU'RE A C**T \", before playfully hitting his betrothed on the arm.\n\nHe added, \"Seriously this is exactly as it happened. He didn't know what to say and neither did I. I was just in so much shock... [He thought] 'Am I on Ant and Dec? Is this a wind-up?\"\n\nThe couple exchanged vows in a star-studded ceremony in 2015, with guests including Amy Childs, Katie Price, and Eamonn Holmes.\n\nTheir life together appeared idyllic, with Rylan relishing his role as stepdad to Dan's son Cameron.\n\nThey even made history as the first gay couple to host This Morning.\n\nIn June 2021, Rylan Clark confirmed the end of his marriage to Dan Neal in an interview with The Sun.\n\nHe acknowledged his own faults, saying: \"Following reports about Dan and I spending time apart, I feel I have to speak out - as the way it is being reported is unfair.\"\n\n\"I have made a number of mistakes which I deeply regret and have inevitably led to the breakdown of our marriage. I have taken time away from work as I am not in a good place at the moment and am seeking help.\"\n\nInfidelity regrets\n\nRylan has admitted that his infidelity was the reason for their split.\n\nHe revealed in his 2022 memoir, 'Ten: The Decade That Changed My Future', that he had been unfaithful years before and decided to confess in May 2021, not anticipating that Dan would leave him.\n\nRylan wrote: \"I have no excuses for what I did way back then, but I had my reasons. I think for many years I had felt a bit like an imposter. That nothing I was doing was right or not quite good enough.\"\n\n\"There were times when people told me this, and so confirmed my own self-doubts. And you know, when it's those closest to you giving you this feedback, of course you take it to heart.\"\n\nHe expressed his disbelief at Dan's decision to leave, adding: \"He left. Told me it was over and that was that. You're not surprised? I get that. But I couldn't believe it.\"\n\nDuring a candid conversation on Kathy Burke's \"Where There's A Will There's A Wake\" podcast in March, Rylan Clark opened up about his past marriage, expressing no regrets about the union itself but admitting he should have considered a prenup.\n\nHe reflected: \"I don't regret getting married. I mean I regret not having a f***ing prenup. That's the only thing I regret. But even though everyone was like get a prenup, I was like I'm in love. Silly pr**k.\"\n\nMental health issues and heart failure\n\nThe end of his marriage took a significant toll on Rylan's mental health, leading to a four-month break from his career.\n\nOn an episode of Matt Willis's \"On The Mend\" podcast in August 2023, Rylan revealed the extent of his struggles, including two suicide attempts post-divorce.\n\nRylan described how he felt completely lost during that time, saying: \"I can't remember what made me disappear basically from the person I knew. But the next thing I knew I could not see, hear, eat, breathe, sleep I couldn't do anything.\"\n\nHe also spoke about the suddenness of his breakdown, comparing it to an unexpected blow: \"And yeah, there was no signs of me having a breakdown, there was no signs of like if you're having a heart attack, you'll get the pains in your arm, you'll get this... you know something's about to happen even if it's seconds before. I didn't have the seconds, I just had the impact basically. The baseball bat round the face I call it. And yeah, I got very ill.\"\n\nDuring a troubling period, presenter Rylan Clark faced severe health issues, including being dangerously underweight and suffering two heart failures.\n\nSpeaking at the 'An Evening With Rylan Clark' event at London's Royal Festival Hall in September 2022, as reported by Metro, he shared his harrowing experiences.\n\nRylan recounted: \"It was like my body had shut down. Twice last year I ended up back in an ambulance because my heart had failed and it was really strange because I just remember for a couple of weeks going, 'My heart hurts'.\"\n\nThe TV personality, known for his stint on 'The X Factor', was alarmed to discover his resting heart rate had soared to 248 beats per minute, far exceeding the average adult's 60-100 beats per minute range.\n\nHe added: \"My heart had to be restarted. I just remember lying in re-sus[citation], because I had these pads on with all these wires and not understanding what it was.\"\n\nIn a candid conversation with journalist Elizabeth Day on her 'How To Fail' podcast in May 2023, Rylan reflected on how his 'extremely traumatic' divorce nearly cost him his life but ultimately contributed to his personal growth.\n\nHe expressed his resolve, saying: \"When you know you have been rock bottom, like to the point of no return nearly, that's when you sit there and go, 'I will never let anything or anyone get me to where I was in that state. Not even myself, I will never let that happen to myself again [...]\".\n\n\"I'd like to sit here and think that the breakdown of my marriage has made me the person I am now, and I'm really, really, happy, with the person I am now, and I can sleep very well at night.\"\n\nDating scene\n\nRylan Clark-Neal recently disclosed that he's back in the dating game after enduring years of heartbreak.\n\nHe shared this during a chat with his close friend Rob Rinder on their new BBC series, Rob and Rylan's Grand Tour.\n\nThe programme follows the pair - both newly divorced - as they follow in the footsteps of the Grand Tourists of yesteryears.\n\nThe Grand Tour, or the original gap year, was a rite of passage for young noblemen in the 18th century.\n\nIt involved travelling around Europe to immerse themselves in culture, architecture, and experiences - essentially, finding themselves.\n\nIn essence, it's the perfect journey for two divorcees looking forward to their next chapter.\n\nTheir escapades soon took a romantic twist, with both Rylan and Rob embarking on exciting blind dates arranged for them.\n\nRylan expressed: \"Hopefully my luck with men is about to change.

I'm joking. Definitely not, not at the BBC. Me and Rob have been mates for years, but we've never been friends. And we knew that we were the unlikely lads, we were complete opposites.\n\n\"But actually, we've got a lot of similarities in experiences we've been through, especially recently from filming. And it was just an interesting concept of Rob showing me his world and me showing him mine, so the fact that we were both almost thrown in at the deep end, we didn't really know what the show was gonna be.\n\n\"I think a lot of people when the show was announced, were like, 'oh great, another travelogue' but after you've watched it, you realise it's not a travelogue, it's something that we've never really seen before on TV.\n\n\"It's sort of a mixture of the educational side of it, but not in a snobby way, but also the realness of it all, it's actually quite emotional, and heartfelt and funny, which is quite rare for a lot of shows these days.\n\nNew show - Rylan says the series is 'something we've never really seen before' (Image: BBC / PA)\n\nRob Rinder: \"I am fascinated, to say the least, and obsessed by art, and by sharing it with the broadest possible groups of communities imaginable. The idea that I can't stand is that there's one community that owns great art, great music and trying to explode this dreadful idea that's increasingly restricting horizons, especially of young people, the idea everybody staying in a lane.\n\n\"So I wanted to be part of an arts programme that was absolutely going to empower people to look at art and music and take back the pen of the story that people have written on their behalf and go, as long as I'm culturally curious, I get to write my own story.\n\n\"It struck me that this was a really beautiful way of doing it along the lines of the grand tour and in conjunction with the idea of following some of the ideas of Byron, and the reason why he left in order to go and have the completion of an education: aesthetic, spiritual, and intellectual.\n\nRylan Clark and Rob Rinder (Image: PA / BBC)\n\nYou both have different approaches to travelling, what did you learn from each other?\n\nRC: \"Rob gave me such like an amazing gift, and I hate bigging him up but I do love him, he has opened my eyes up. I say very openly on the show that I've always felt that art's not my lane, it's not for me, people like me shouldn't be moseying around the Uffizi (gallery in Florence).\n\n\"But Rob gave me that gift, to understand that art is genuinely for everyone and it is exactly what you make of it. The artist has got their vision, and they make of their own creations what they want, but you, as the admirer of that art, make of it what you want to make of it.\n\n\"So something that Rob might look at, and believe is the dawning of a new day, I might look at it as the sunset of an old life, you make of it what you will. And I'll be forever grateful to Rob, because he's taken me to places that if I was in Venice, Florence or Rome, I would never have stepped foot in.\"\n\nDressed up - Rylan and Rob (Image: PA / BBC)\n\nWe see you have some quite emotional chats talking about your life experiences, why do you think it's important to show those candid conversations?\n\nRC: \"I think it's really healthy to, like friends, have that conversation. I think people are bored of celebrities and people on TV trying to be like, 'oh, I'm perfect. Everything's great. Listen to us, we know it's tough out there, But you hang in there guys'. F*** off!\n\n\"We're real people, we're normal working class blokes that have done alright in life. You look at Rob and think he's come from middle England, and he's like the Dowager Lady Edgar the Third, but he's not, he comes from a working class family, a cabbie's son.\n\n\"It's the same with me, we come from working class families and things going wrong. We've both been through divorces. We had very different experiences with the divorces, mine wasn't great, Rob's wasn't great, no divorce is great.\n\n\"But you know what? We've got to find ourselves just as much as the next fella along the road, just because he puts a wig on and he makes out to be a judge every now and again.\n\n\"And I sit there doing a bit of karaoke on a Saturday afternoon, doesn't mean everything's all roses. We went into this saying we don't want this to be your travelogue, your glossy entertainment show, we want it to be a real show and this is exactly what we would discuss if me and Rob were sitting in Venice having an Aperol Spritz.\"\n\n- Rob and Rylan's Grand Tour starts on May 12 at 9pm on BBC Two.", "source": {"uri": "echo-news.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Essex Echo"}, "authors":

Thousands of protesters marched through the streets of Malmo, Sweden, demanding the removal of Israeli singer Eden Golan from the semi-finals.\n\nWhen the British TV presenter appeared to skip a quick interview for the show's TikTok account, many speculated he was making a political statement. Rylan had been conducting several interviews with contestants while posing as a bell boy in the hotel lift, but reportedly Eden did not get this opportunity.\n\nIn the video of Eden's interview, a voice is heard asking her questions as she steps into the lift alone. It's unclear why Rylan was absent during this segment, but fans have their theories, suggesting he was making a political statement.\n\nRead more Eurovision 2024 fans say 'most uncomfortable situation ever' after semi-final act\n\nOne fan took to social media, previously known as Twitter, and exclaimed: \"Not @Rylan refusing to do Eden Golan's elevator interview.

Reporting from Malmo, Rylan shared his thoughts with ITV's Good Morning Britain on the host city's hospitality, stating: \"Malmo is doing an amazing job of hosting.\"\n\nHe also touched upon the political undercurrents present, saying: \"It's a song contest, it's all about the music and that's what we're here for.\" His co-host Scott Mills chimed in with: \"It does feel a little different, but it's about the music and the joy that we have every single year at Eurovision.\"\n\nTensions escalated earlier today when Eden was advised to remain in her hotel due to the protests outside. Notably, Greta Thunberg, the 21 year old renowned Swedish environmental activist, joined the large Stop Israel rally before tonight's [Thursday 9 May] second semi-final of the show.\n\nReports say that Israel's national security agency Shin Bet had previously urged Eden not to vacate her lodgings aside from performing due to planned mass protests in the Swedish city. The songstress faced controversy when she selected 'October Rain' as her entry song, with critics suggesting it referenced an October 7th episode entailing Hamas' abduction and murder of Israelis.\n\nCome March, Eden's song switched to 'Hurricane', receiving approval from the European Broadcasting Union. A crowd of five thousand gathered on the streets earlier today.

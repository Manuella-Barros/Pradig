Now their return is starting to unleash a wave of crime.Crimes committed by servicemen that aren\u2019t linked to the war increased by more than 20% last year, according to data from Russia\u2019s Supreme Court. While the overall numbers are still small and many returning servicemembers don\u2019t go on to commit offenses, there was a jump in cases of violent crimes as well as thefts and drug-related transgressions.The figures exclude crimes involving tens of thousands of convicts released from jail to join the war under a program set up by the late Wagner mercenary group leader Yevgeny Prigozhin. Those who survived six months at the front were able to gain a pardon from President Vladimir Putin and return to Russia as free men.", "summary": "Crimes committed by servicemen that aren\u2019t linked to the war increased by more than 20% last year, according to data from Russia\u2019s Supreme Court.", "url": "https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2024/06/23/world/crime-legal/russia-crime-wave/", "image": "https://www.japantimes.co.jp/japantimes/uploads/images/2024/06/23/404918.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-23 01:10:00", "author": "The Japan Times,Web Master", "authors": ["The Japan Times", "Web Master"], "language": "en", "catgory": "politics", "source_country": "JP", "sentiment": -0.042}

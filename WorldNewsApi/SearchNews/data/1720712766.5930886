The count is located in Nemo Rangers sports hall near Douglas village on the southside of Cork City. Harvey said that such is the volume of work needed by the count staff that there will be no result in the European Parliament constituency until tomorrow. The Cork city based solicitor and Sheriff, is no stranger to lengthy counts \u2013 he was the returning officer for the 20 count epic after Sinn F\u00e9in called a recount in 2019. He spoke to The Journal about how he views the mammoth task ahead. \u201cWe have 700,000 papers we are counting since we started this morning. These are long, bulky papers with 23 candidates \u2013 we had hoped that we might have the first count this evening but that is looking less likely now. \u201cWe have a large staff of more than 220 people and we hope to utilise that staff today and keep working until tonight at 10 or 11 o\u2019clock. \u201cAt the moment we won\u2019t have a first count result this evening, it will probably be sometime tomorrow morning,\u201d he said. Harvey explained that the 2019 European Parliament count was the similar in volume as this count with the same amount of candidates but the delay there was caused by a recount.

He responded: \u201ca miracle \u2013 it is unlikely\u201d. \u201cWe just want to be careful, you are dealing with people going through the night, you get more tired we want to make sure people are fresh. \u201cThere are an awful lot of papers left in the tea chest we have them stored in and it is unlikely to get through that tonight so we\u2019ll make a pragmatic decision around nine or ten o\u2019clock. If no likelihood of getting a first count result we will call it a day then. \u201cThat is what it is looking like and that is part of the plan. It could be up to Tuesday evening or Wednesday evening,\u201d he concluded.

The sports hall has a central core of counting staff, with large tables holding bundles of first preferences for each candidate. Large bins are full with the white papers and there is also a large box containing uncounted papers. Meanwhile Green Party MEP Grace O\u2019Sullivan called to the count centre and said she believes she will not be elected. She said that she believes that the cost of living issue has caused people to have \u201cother things on the mind\u201d than Green Party concerns.", "summary": "The count is located in Nemo Rangers sports hall near Douglas village on the southside of Cork City.", "url": "https://www.thejournal.ie/ireland-south-martin-harvey-returning-officer-cork-european-parliament-count-6403408-Jun2024/", "image": "https://img2.thejournal.ie/article/6403408/river/?height=400&version=6403716", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 16:56:35", "author": "View All Articles", "authors": ["View All Articles"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ie", "sentiment": -0.012}

Fergie has also become very muted about Andrew in general. She used to take every opportunity to praise him but no longer - aware that her media career depends on her keeping shtum about the unsavoury elephant in the room. Eugenie posted pictures of husband Jack with their sons but no mention of her own dad. Andrew was excluded from Garter Day, even though he remains a member and wore the robes to his brother\u2019s coronation last year. And Royal Ascot, once the stomping ground of Andrew and his top hat, commences with the disgraced royal watching proceedings on TV. The late Judge Oliver Popplewell couldn\u2019t have been on Jonathan Aitken\u2019s Christmas card list after sending him to prison for perjury when he lost his libel action against the Guardian.

They were rubbish.\u2019 Is it a case of a bluff Yorkshireman daring to speak a truth that others fear to say? Was Dr Harry Hill\u2019s decision to abandon medicine for mirth an unheralded blessing to hospital patients? Harry tells a podcast of his time at Kingston Hospital where he prepared patients for operations before sneaking out to a local hostelry. \u2018When I got bleeped, I would then have to go to the payphone in the pub and say, \u201cOh, it\u2019s Doctor Hill here,\u201d \u2019 he recalls. \u2018[The nurse] would say, \u201cYeah, you\u2019ve got to come quickly because so and so\u2019s not breathing\u201d. And then I\u2019d have to run.\u2019 Interview With The Vampire star Brad Pitt thought Daniel Day Lewis was joining the cast as Dracula figure Lestat until director Neil Jordan told him otherwise. \u2018A few years before, Daniel had confined himself to a wheelchair to play Christy Brown in My Left Foot,\u2019 explained Jordan. \u2018He would have had to sleep in a coffin for the entirety of this production if he followed the same practice.

And the bad news is that is has hit an historically low level. Apparently, the shifts in the landscape of work aren\u2019t working for people\u2014and this had negative implications for companies as well. Workforce engagement really matters, because it is linked with effort, innovation, productivity and retention\u2014and in a competitive landscape with a shortage of talent, it can make or break a company, its culture, its performance and its ability to succeed. But there are ways to boost engagement and create the conditions for people to bring their best, have a positive work experience and contribute to organizational results. Employee Engagement Defined But what is employee engagement, really? Fundamentally, it is commitment, dedication and the energy people put into their work. It is related to the emotional connection people feel\u2014and the effort they invest as a result. Engagement is evident through the outcomes it produces\u2014like productivity, innovation and retention\u2014but engagement is also evident through the behaviors people demonstrate\u2014individually, as teams and within the organization overall.

People who are engaged are responsive, interested and share ideas. You can see engagement when people advocate for ideas, listen to colleagues and deliver results. When people are engaged, they recognize colleagues and participate in celebrating accomplishments. At a team level, engagement is also apparent in many ways. Often, teams suggest more ideas and innovations. Engaged teams tend to get more done and have more fun doing it. When teams are engaged, they also tend to have more lively dialogues and healthy disagreements, as they incorporate multiple points of view. And engaged teams tend to organize their work so that people\u2019s skills and responsibilities are aligned. They also give each other feedback, support each other and celebrate wins together. Across the organization, engagement is apparent when people are aligned and seem to speak the same language. People in an engaged organization tend to volunteer for projects and suggest new or better ways of doing things. They handle conflict in a constructive way\u2014listening, working through issues and coming to positive resolution. Employees also show up\u2014both literally and figuratively\u2014enjoying their work and their time with colleagues. And in a high-engagement culture, people are also likely to grow through multiple roles, developing with the company over time. The Importance Of Employee Engagement Employee engagement delivers tremendous results, and the benefits of an engaged workforce are significant. With greater levels of workforce engagement, organizations see higher productivity, quality of work, profitability and employee retention. Employee engagement is also correlated with better customer service as well as reduced safety incidents. All of this is according to Gallup data. But how does it work? And how does employee engagement improve efficiency or productivity? Essentially, when people are engaged, they are more committed to doing great work. They invest effort and energy and get things done. This results in greater productivity. In addition, when people are engaged, they tend to dedicate themselves to tasks and seek better ways to do things\u2014resulting in greater efficiency. Likewise, employee engagement improves work culture. Culture is collective behavior and \u201cthe way things get done around here\u201d\u2014and engagement can affect the whole. When people are more engaged and perform better, they tend to affect others, according to research published in the Journal of Labor Economics. Essentially, engagement by one or a few, affects the broader culture in terms of performance. In addition, there is a relationship between engagement, productivity and satisfaction, based on research published in the Association for Psychological Science. When people are more engaged, they tend to be more productive and satisfied. And when they are more productive, they tend to be more satisfied and engaged\u2014and so on. Each of these influences the others\u2014and the culture as a whole. The bottom line is that engagement puts all kinds of positive elements in motion\u2014by driving the motivation for collective behavior which in turn leads to impressive outcomes for people and the organization. Engagement is evident individually and for teams. getty How Can Leaders Improve Employee Engagement? So what can leaders do to increase employee engagement in the office? And what can leaders do to increase engagement among remote workers? These are key actions leaders can take to positively affect engagement at individual, team and organizational levels\u2014no matter where people are working. 1. Increase Engagement With Purpose And Clear Expectations Whether people are working in the office or away from it, leaders can positively affect employee engagement by inspiring people with the bigger picture and setting clear expectations. When people have a greater sense of purpose, they believe their work has more meaning, according to studies at Northwestern University\u2014and feeling that work matters is an ingredient for engagement. Similarly when leaders share purpose, vision, commitment and strong morals, research at the University of Sussex found people were happier and more productive\u2014which also positively affects engagement. Let people know about the big picture the organization is seeking to accomplish and be clear about how their work makes a contribution to it\u2014and how their personal efforts make an impact as well. Set clear expectations for performance and outcomes\u2014so people know what to strive for and how to contribute most effectively. 2. Increase Engagement With Meaningful Work And Growth Engagement is significantly driven by work that is a match to people\u2019s skills, talents and capabilities\u2014today and tomorrow. You can positively affect engagement when you align what people are doing with what they prefer to do. And learn what they\u2019d like to learn in the future. Find out what people love and what motivates them\u2014and give them tasks and responsibilities in this vein. Happiness is significantly correlated with performance, so when people can do great work, it affects esteem, joy and engagement. In addition, ask people what they\u2019d like to learn and in what directions they would like to grow\u2014and provide learning opportunities that support the development they seek. When people have greater mobility within the organization, they are more likely to stay with the organization and engage over time. No job will be idyllic, requiring only what people love to do, but align people and their responsibilities as much as possible\u2014and give them opportunities to grow. These will pay off in terms of engagement. 3. Increase Engagement With Choice And Control Another way to inspire engagement is to give people choice and control\u2014as much as possible. When people have higher levels of flexibility, autonomy and control in their decision making, they experienced greater health and satisfaction\u2014regardless of how much stress they faced in their jobs, according to two different studies by Indiana University\u2019s Kelley School of Business. People want to be trusted and treated like adults, and when they are, they tend to be more engaged. If people are working hybrid or remote, provide them with clear guardrails about when they must be in the office and when they can choose to work elsewhere. Of course, choices in where and when they work may not be possible for some jobs, but as much as possible, give people flexibility within appropriate guidelines. And no matter where people are working, provide as much autonomy as possible in how they organize their work and get it done. Micromanaging works against engagement. Instead, set clear goals, outcomes and deadlines and provide plenty of latitude for people to accomplish results in the way that works best for them. Engaged teams tend to have more fun and get more done. getty 4. Increase Engagement With Presence And Accessibility Another surefire way to increase engagement is to be present and accessible as a leader. This is important when people are working in the office, but also when they are working hybrid and remote. Be accessible and responsive when people reach out, following up efficiently and answering questions thoroughly. In addition, be present with people. Pay attention to how they\u2019re doing and check in regularly\u2014asking them how they are. When you\u2019re meeting with people\u2014either virtually or in person\u2014set aside devices or distractions. Tune in, listen, empathize and support them. When people feel you respect them and value their work, they are more likely to be engaged. Reciprocity is a natural part of the human experience\u2014and we tend to give more when we get more. Likewise, when you provide authentic attention, focus and recognition, people will respond with effort, energy and performance. 5. Increase Engagement with a Strong Culture People value strong cultures in which values and norms are clear. They prefer \u201clegibility\u201d\u2014meaning people and organizations they are easy to read. Based on this understanding, people know how they can engage and contribute in order to make an impact. The most effective cultures are characterized by clear mission, vision and direction as well as involvement and participation\u2014and when people are engaged, they can inspire each other and lean in to participate. In addition, great cultures have consistency and clear processes balanced with the capacity to adapt and learn\u2014and these too are positively affected by employee engagement as people seek to improve things and grow based on their commitment and dedication. Talk about your culture, including what you value and how you want to behave together. Obtain feedback from people about their experience and how you can continuously improve. People know things won\u2019t be perfect, and they will appreciate your effort to get better all the time. Make Employee Engagement An Ongoing Effort Of course, none of these are one-time strategies to check off the list. Engagement is something that requires intentional effort and ongoing investment of time and energy. It pays off significantly, but is never complete. You must reinforce the purpose continuously and keep performance expectations and goals up to date. You need to be continually attentive to people and how they\u2019re working and what they\u2019d like to learn next. You\u2019ll want to shift practices as work continues to evolve. You must develop your own leadership skills\u2014getting better all the time so you can do your best for team members. And you must monitor and assess culture continuously. Leaders have a huge impact on mental health and experience. And while this creates pressure, it is also a terrific opportunity to make a difference for people and the organization. Bottom Line Give people a sense of purpose and meaningful work\u2014and provide as much choice and control as you can. Be present and accessible for teammates. And continually sustain your culture. All of these will drive not only engagement but performance\u2014at individual, team and organizational levels\u2014and they will positively affect happiness and fulfillment for people.

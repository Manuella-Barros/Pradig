Despite understanding the language, Messi admits he refrains from speaking it due to embarrassment.\n\nLionel Messi, an eight-time Ballon d'Or winner, moved to Inter Miami in 2023. This move came after a long and illustrious career at Barcelona and a short stint at Paris Saint-Germain. Messi's transition to the United States was highly anticipated, with fans eager to see how he would adapt to a new culture and language.\n\nMessi's move to Inter Miami brought him to a region with a large Spanish-speaking community, which has helped him feel at home. This familiar environment has allowed Messi to continue communicating comfortably in Spanish, his native language. Despite this, Messi recently showcased his English skills in a promotional video for the latest \"Bad Boys\" film starring Will Smith, surprising many fans.\n\nWhat Lionel Messi said\n\nIn an interview with Abitare, Messi revealed that his understanding of English is quite good, but he avoids speaking it out of embarrassment. He stated, \"I understand everything, or almost everything, in English. But out of embarrassment, I don't speak - but I think I can actually.\" This admission highlights Messi's humility and his discomfort with making public statements in a language he's not fully confident in.\n\nMessi's Inter Miami teammate, Julian Gressel, has shared insights into Messi's English-speaking abilities. Gressel mentioned that Messi knows enough English to joke around on the pitch. He recounted an amusing incident: \"Messi doesn't really ever speak to me much, and if he did, then it was a little bit in Spanish always. I understand most of it in Spanish. He came over to me and said something in English. That was the first time he'd spoken to me in English, during the game. He was covering his mouth, like he always does. Then after - this is the funny part about it - he goes, 'English pretty good, no?'\"\n\nLife at Inter Miami\n\nMessi's life in Florida is made easier by the significant Spanish-speaking contingent around him. Many of his teammates and staff at Inter Miami speak Spanish, which has helped Messi settle in quickly. This environment allows him to communicate effectively without the pressure of using English in everyday interactions.\n\nDespite his reluctance to speak English publicly, Messi has shown he can use the language when necessary. His appearance in the promotional video for \"Bad Boys\" demonstrates his willingness to step out of his comfort zone, even if just for a short while. This flexibility is a testament to Messi's adaptability and his effort to engage with the broader audience in his new home.\n\nCopa America and MLS Ambitions\n\nCurrently, Messi is with the Argentina national team, competing in the 2024 Copa America. He aims to defend the continental title successfully before returning to Inter Miami. Back in the MLS, Messi will continue to lead Inter Miami in their quest for MLS Cup glory.\n\nAs Messi continues his career in the United States, he has the opportunity to influence the growing soccer culture in the country. His presence alone has already elevated the profile of Major League Soccer, attracting new fans and increasing the league's global reach. Over time, Messi's impact off the field could be as significant as his contributions on it.\n\nLionel Messi's move to Inter Miami marks a new chapter in his illustrious career. While he remains hesitant to speak English publicly, his understanding of the language is solid. Surrounded by a supportive Spanish-speaking community, Messi continues to shine both on and off the field. As he competes in Copa America and prepares for more MLS action, fans around the world eagerly await the next steps in his incredible journey.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "fremont_farkas@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Fremont Farkas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Miami_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inter Miami CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Spanish language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballon_d'Or", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ballon d'Or"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goal (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Gressel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Julian Gressel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Smith", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Will Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLS_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MLS Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Argentina national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Communications", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Communications", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Linguistics", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Linguistics", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Education", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Education", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Education/Language_Arts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Education/Language Arts", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Language", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Language", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 62}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Lionel-Messi-reveals-reason-he-doesnt-speak-English-at-Inter-Miami.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9664788", "eventUri": "eng-9664788", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 221, "relevance": 1}

She took snaps with her two eldest sons, Thiago, 11, and Mateo, 8.\n\n'Hogwarts always,' she shared as a caption to her post on Instagram, which includes a snap of herself posing in front of the castle from the Harry Potter books.\n\nFans, however, were quick to notice that Antonella's eight-time Ballon d'Or-winning husband wasn't on the family outing, as he prepares to himself to captain his country in Atlanta, Georgia, against Canada.\n\n'Messi doesn't study at Hogwarts but he's the best at throwing magic,' a user joked in the comment section of Antonella's post.\n\nLeo Messi's wife Antonella dazzled in all-red outfit while out with her kids at Universal Orlando\n\nMessi trains with the Argentina national team ahead of the Copa America opener vs. Canada\n\n'What is Messi doing?' asked a fan account of the former Barcelona forward, while another wondered if Messi was playing at the resort.\n\nAt age 36, Messi could be playing in his final tournament with Argentina at the Copa America.\n\nThe World Cup winner will turn 37 during the tournament in the US, which kicks off on Thursday. He's clearly past his peak at Inter Miami after two decades of playing at the highest level in Europe.\n\nMessi has not set a date for his retirement and has kept the door open to playing in a sixth World Cup in 2026 to defend his title from Qatar. But he already recognizes his shortcomings.\n\n'I don't think about that yet. The moment I feel that I am not going to help my team, I will retire,' Messi said in March in an interview with Saudi broadcaster Riyad Season. 'I always ate well, trained. But as I grew I became aware that the physical effort we make is getting harder. As you grow old, things become more difficult.'\n\nLast year, Argentina's No. 10 struggled with muscular injuries while playing in MLS and for his country. That didn't change much in 2024.\n\nThere's talk about this summer's tournament being the last for Messi amid injuries and old age\n\nMessi has shown he enjoys going out at night with his wife, Antonella, and his friends in Miami. He spends time with his three children, starts new businesses and lives as if soccer is slowly becoming a smaller part of his life.\n\nStill, he has 12 goals and 13 assists for Inter Miami this season.\n\n'I have a good time at the club. I am lucky to have teammates and friends (Luis Su\u00e1rez, Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba, all former Barcelona players) by my side,' Messi told ESPN. 'I have a good time in the national team, where I have teammates and friends, too. And I enjoy the little details that I know that when I don't play anymore, I'm going to miss.'\n\nAngel di Maria, a 36-year-old winger who has played alongside Messi for years with the national team, is sure to bid farewell to international soccer after the Copa America. That has also brought more questions about whether the team's biggest star will remain on the squad.\n\n'As long as I feel like I'm fine and I can continue contributing, I'm going to do it. Today, the only thing I think about is getting to the Copa America well and being able to compete in it,' Messi told the Star Plus platform in December. 'Fighting for it again, as we always did, trying to be champions.'\n\nMessi and Co. will be looking to win back-to-back Copa America titles at the expense of Brazil\n\nArgentina's all-time top scorer and the national team's leader with 26 World Cup appearances is also seeking records in the continental competition.\n\nMessi, who won the South American championship in 2021, wants to become the Copa America's leading scorer. He has 13 goals in six editions, four behind Norberto M\u00e9ndez of Argentina and Zizinho of Brazil with 17.\n\nHe also wants to be the player with most appearances in the Copa America, a record he currently shares with former Chile goalkeeper Sergio Livingston, both with 34 games.\n\nMessi's teammates don't want to see him go.\n\n'We'll see how long, but while he's here we're going to enjoy it to the fullest,' Argentina defender Cristian Romero said.

He has 13 goals in six editions, four behind Norberto Mendez of Argentina and Zizinho of Brazil, who have 17.\n\nHe also wants to be the player with most appearances in the Copa America, a record he currently shares with former Chile goalkeeper Sergio Livingston, both with 34 games.\n\nMessi's teammates don't want to see him go.\n\n\"We'll see how long, but while he's here we're going to enjoy it to the fullest,\" Argentina defender Cristian Romero said. \"We grew up watching him.

Messi has almost exclusively used Spanish in public appearances throughout his career. In the last few years, however, the Inter Miami star has been picking up enough English to communicate with his teammates.\n\nIn a recent interview, Messi claimed that he could speak better English than most people realise. Speaking to Abitare on YouTube, he said, \"I understand everything, or almost everything in English. But out of embarrassment I don't speak - but I think I can actually.\"\n\nWhile many fans may find this statement from Lionel Messi shocking, his Inter Miami teammate Julian Gressel had confirmed the Argentine's good English speaking skills in the past. Speaking in an interview, the American footballer had said the Argentine knew enough of the language to add some comical moments on the pitch.\n\nSharing a story from one of Miami's preseason tours, this is what Gressel said on the Player/Manager Podcast - \"There was a funny moment that we had during this world tour...He came over to me and said something in English. During the game, he was covering his mouth like he always does and goes 'Now we change, you stay and Jordi runs. Jordi goes more in behind...' Then after he goes, 'English pretty good, no?'\n\nJust a few weeks back, football fans were also treated to a rare sight of Lionel Messi speaking English. The former Barcelona star had featured in a Bad Boys 4 film promo alongside Hollywood stars Will Smith and Martin Lawrence. In the clip, Messi was seen knocking on Smith's door before hilariously asking, \"Bad Boys?\" The question results in the Bad Boys cast shutting the door on the football icon.\n\nMessi spent the majority of his football career at Barcelona after joining the club at a young age. He spent over two decades at Barcelona. The FIFA World Cup-winning Argentine left for Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) in 2021. After a couple of seasons in the French capital, Messi opted for a move out of Europe for Major League Soccer (MLS) side Inter Miami.\n\nMessi has played 15 games for Inter Miami this season, scoring 14 goals and providing 11 assists. He is now preparing to lead Argentina at the CONMEBOL Copa America 2024 scheduled to start later this month.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Miami_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inter Miami CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spanish language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Gressel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Julian Gressel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Football pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONMEBOL", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CONMEBOL"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Smith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Will Smith"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Canadian", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Education", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Education", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Education/Language_Arts", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Education/Language Arts", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Academic_Study", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Academic Study", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Fun", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/02/lionel-messi-ap-2024-02-3d980150e2aea118418407de2c84628c-16x9.jpg?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9664788", "eventUri": "eng-9664788", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

Many players would probably trade fair bit of their club trophies -- if not all of them -- in exchange to lift a World Cup title with their national team.\n\nMessi is no exception to that. The eight-time Ballon d'Or winner has came so close on many occasions to bringing glory back to his native Argentina, but only in the last few years has his patience been awarded as he's brought home a couple of major honors to the South American nation.\n\nWhile Messi more than likely values the team titles than individual honors, he still probably feels a great deal of pride about being Argentina's all-time top goal scorer. The Inter Miami figure did just that roughly eight years ago back in the Copa America Centenario -- which was held in the United States, like this year's Copa America -- against the USMNT with a stunning free kick from distance.\n\nThat was Messi's 55th goal for Argentina, and that figure has just about doubled with the former Barcelona and PSG player now on 106 goals for his country since that match. Messi has also notably become Argentina's all-time appearances leader with 181 games played as well as registering the most assists in team history with 56.\n\nMessi finally got his hands on his first-ever international title with Argentina in the summer of 2021 in the form of Copa America.\n\nAfter falling short in two straight finals -- both on penalties -- vs Chile in 2015 and 2016, Messi and Co. finally lifted the elusive titles with a narrow 1-0 victory over Brazil with Angel Di Maria first-half striker proving to be enough for the win.\n\nEven after initially retiring following the 2016 Copa America defeat, Messi was able to re-emerge on the international scene to bring glory back to Argentina.\n\nBefore Messi was able to lift Copa America 2021, he and Argentina experienced heartbreak in two consecutive World Cups. First up was the 2014 World Cup final, where Mario Gotze's 113th-minute strike sunk Argentina and denied Messi a World Cup title.\n\nFour years later, Argentina were back with a better squad in the 2018 World Cup in Russia. However, they were unable to get past the Round of 16 after a chaotic encounter with France. La Albiceleste fell 4-3 marking Kylian Mbappe's official arrival on the international stage.\n\nAnother four years passed by and Argentina loaded up for Qatar for the 2022 World Cup. With Messi likely playing his last World Cup, there was pressure on him to deliver for his country -- he did that and much more.\n\nMessi stepped up with seven goals and three assists throughout the 2022 World Cup that included a brace in the final vs France. Mbappe nearly spoiled Messi's dreams once again as he bagged a hat-trick late on, but Argentina managed to prevail on penalties as Messi, in many eyes, cemented himself as the greatest player of all time.", "source": {"uri": "90min.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "90min.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5,

Messi had run onto a perfectly placed pass from teammate \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda that put the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner face-to-face with the opposing goalkeeper.\n\nOver the course of Messi's 20-year career, the Argentine has made many goalkeepers look foolish while making the game of football look easy. When Messi casually scooped the ball over helpless Guatemala goalkeeper Nicholas Hagan, the crowd's roar reverberated around the ground. It was a vintage goal from the man that every soul in that stadium had come to see.\n\nAt 36, Messi and his magic can still cast a spell on those who adore him. As he jogged back to the center circle, fans in both Argentina and Guatemala jerseys chanted \"Messi! Messi! Messi!\" as they bowed to their hero.\n\nMessi put on a show in Argentina's final warm-up match before the Copa America in the United States. He sent a message that he was fit and ready to defend the trophy that Argentina won in 2021.\n\nThe reaction from the fans in attendance was also clear: \"Don't go, Messi. Please don't go.\"\n\nDays before that match, Messi told ESPN Argentina that Inter Miami would be his final club. Sitting in a red-walled room with pictures of Argentina's 2022 World Cup triumph in the background and the gold World Cup trophy on a table to his left, Messi let everyone know that he understood the end of his career was looming.\n\nBut it was the answer just before that declaration that colors everything Messi has done over the last year in America -- and likely all that will come next.\n\nThe interviewer, Mart\u00edn Ar\u00e9valo, noted that the end of Messi's career is getting closer and asked Messi if he enjoys the game more because of that. Ar\u00e9valo said he didn't think the footballing world was ready for Messi to leave. He asked if Messi felt the same.\n\n\"I don't think I am (prepared to leave football) either,\" Messi replied. \"I've done this all my life, I love playing ball and I enjoy training, the day-to-day, the games. I am a bit scared of it all ending, that's always there. ... But I try not to think about it. I try to enjoy it. I do that more now because I'm aware there's not a lot of time left. ... I enjoy those small details that I know I'll miss when I stop playing.\"\n\nMessi is hardly the first icon to grapple with the unknown of what comes after their time in the sport so tethered to their identity comes to an end. It drove Tom Brady to more years and another Super Bowl in Tampa Bay. It still pushes LeBron James, approaching 40, and Diana Taurasi, 42, to continue in the NBA and WNBA, respectively.\n\nIt's a big part of why stadiums around the country have filled up when Messi comes to town. Fans know that it could be one final chance to see a legend.\n\nIt will color each game Argentina plays in this Copa America, too. People will wonder whether this will be the last time they see him in sky blue and white; if another Copa trophy means there will be one less place to enjoy the magic he can make with a hint of space and the ball on his left foot. Or whether the right (or wrong) result this summer means his story with the national team isn't over yet.\n\nMessi no longer carries the burden of winning with Argentina. His triumph in Qatar gave him the freedom to come to the U.S. and enjoy the twilight of his career. It's why nearly every highlight and every goal he scores as he terrorizes MLS this season is counterbalanced by a picture or a video of Messi simply enjoying life in Miami: sipping mate (a traditional South American herbal drink) in the bleachers at his sons' academy games, dancing at a birthday party or waving for the Jumbotron at a Miami Heat playoff game.\n\n\"When one talks about players who have left their marks on the history of football, we try to extend their careers when we begin to see the end,\" said Inter Miami coach Tata Martino. \"I believe that Leo and his family are prepared or are visualizing and preparing themselves for when that ending will come. It comes for everyone.\"\n\nAnd maybe it's exactly that balance, that sense of peace, that allows those small details he knows he'll miss continue to be a joy and not a burden, to bring him back for another go rather than push him to the finish line.\n\nWhile his team was nearly 3,500 miles away in Canada to face the Vancouver Whitecaps, Messi walked to the center of the pitch at his home stadium in Fort Lauderdale next to his son Thiago, whose team was set to play in a youth tournament.\n\nNews reports swirled about Messi's absence in Vancouver, how the Whitecaps might repay fans for the MLS game he was missing and what obligation Messi and Miami's other stars had to play all the time. The Argentine, however, had a smile across his face as he got a rest day and spent time with family. He told the kids and parents in attendance that he hoped \"it's an experience that lasts for the rest of your life.\"\n\nThe moment was a hint at how different life is for Messi in Florida. And why that was important to him coming to MLS.\n\n\"He can transform for a few moments into a normal person,\" Martino said.\n\nMessi is happy and settled in the U.S. He has enjoyed Miami's nightlife on a few occasions, when he's typically joined by his Inter Miami (and former Barcelona) teammates Sergio Busquets, Jordi Alba and Luis Suarez, their significant others, and sometimes even Inter Miami co-owner David and Victoria Beckham.\n\n\"It's a great group,\" Messi told Infobae in June. \"My sister is here too and one of my good friends is here with his family, as well. It's a big group and when we can we go out to dinner or we'll go to The BRESH if we can.\"\n\nMessi has been the guest of honor on two occasions at BRESH Miami, a Latin American-themed dance party that has staged events in cities such as Los Angeles, New York, Miami and Buenos Aires. Yet, Messi admits that he spends most of his free time with his family at their home in Fort Lauderdale.\n\nHe runs errands with his wife Antonella, which has led to random encounters with fans at local businesses and traffic lights throughout the city. But Messi also attracts his share of Hollywood stars, athletes and musicians, such as Will Smith, LeBron James, Serena Williams, Daddy Yankee, Kim Kardashian, Bizarrap, Patrick Mahomes and DJ Khaled.\n\n\"I don't always know who is going to be at the games,\" Messi said. \"I know that there's always (a celebrity) there. I know the majority of them and I say hello, but I'm not told in advance.\n\n\"There have been times when they're right there (near the pitch) and the result isn't going our way and it's not a good time. You're thinking about the game.\"\n\nMessi himself is now an American pop culture celebrity. He was featured in a Michelob Super Bowl ad in February. (He also told the Big Time Podcast in Saudi Arabia that his sons have brought American football into the house and \"it's a great game.\") Messi starred in a Bad Boys: Ride or Die promotion. Murals depicting his arrival to Inter Miami and his World Cup triumph paint the walls of Miami's Wynwood neighborhood. He recently launched M\u00e1s+ Next Generation Beverage Co., which includes a new sports performance drink and four flavors that depict his storied career.\n\n\"Leo wanted to be involved in something he could proudly share with his family,\" the company's chief story officer Tyler Gray told The Athletic. \"He has been actively involved throughout the development of this beverage, tasting potential formulas, helping choose flavor names and more.\"\n\nIt's too early to know whether Miami Punch, Orange D'Or, Berry Copa Crush and Lim\u00f3n Lime League will become household names in the U.S. Messi, however, has already entrenched himself as a major player in the most lucrative economy in the world.\n\nGiven the circus around Messi's arrival in Miami last summer, it is easy to forget his first few months playing in the United States were cut short.\n\nMessi turned Inter Miami into what felt like an unstoppable force in the inaugural version of the Leagues Cup, a month-long tournament created by MLS and staged between its teams and those from Mexico's Liga MX. Messi scored 10 goals in seven games en route to claiming Inter Miami's first trophy.\n\nBut he managed just six MLS appearances after that in 2023, and only four starts. He had one goal and two assists. Without its superstar, Miami fell short of the playoffs.\n\nThis year has been a reminder of what it looks like when a healthy Messi is on the field in Inter Miami's pink and black.\n\nThrough 12 games, Messi already has 25 goal contributions. His 12 goals and 13 assists are tied for third and first, respectively, in the league. Flicking on an Inter Miami match is a reminder that Messi can submit a game and an opponent to his will at any moment. Last month, in a 6-2 win over the New York Red Bulls, Messi set MLS records with five assists and six goal contributions.\n\n\"What we saw is surprising because it hasn't been seen before in our sport, but as a teammate and knowing Leo, nothing surprises me because that's the quality player he is,\" said Suarez, who had a hat trick against the Red Bulls that was somewhat overshadowed.\n\nInter Miami sat at the bottom of MLS when Messi arrived in 2023 and is now perched atop the league. The team and its quartet of ex-Barcelona stars is never out of a game, often clawing back from early deficits to snatch points. And while they limped out of the CONCACAF Champions Cup, they have two more trophies firmly in their sights: the MLS Supporters' Shield, given to the regular season champions, and MLS Cup.\n\nBut Messi has always been about more than just what he can do on the field.\n\nCommercially, Messi's impact has been transformative for the league. Teams around MLS are selling out stadiums when Miami comes to town. Sporting Kansas City moved its game from Children's Mercy Park (capacity 18,467) to the NFL's Arrowhead Stadium and still sold it out, with 72,610 fans making it the fourth-largest standalone crowd in MLS history.\n\nWhen Messi doesn't play, it's bigger news than when he does. Before the Vancouver debacle, his absence due to injury from a game in Hong Kong this preseason during an international tour sparked an international incident.\n\nMiami is aiming to surpass $200 million in revenue this year, which would more than triple its revenue in 2022.\n\n\"We are talking about the greatest of all time in the world's biggest sport, in a moment that the world is more interconnected than ever and that we have more technology than ever,\" Inter Miami co-president Xavi Asensi told The Athletic earlier this year. \"So put all this together and it's atomic, it's massive.\"\n\nThe hope, of course, is that Messi can be more than an on-field or commercial lift for MLS.\n\nDavid Beckham's arrival in 2007 was a moment that changed the league forever via the introduction of the designated player rule. Time is ticking down on MLS to be able to use the cultural moment created by Messi's on-field exploits and his ability to lift everything around him. So far, the league has opted for a more cautious route.\n\nThat ticking clock is a reality Argentina is trying to cope with ahead of this Copa America.\n\nArgentina head coach Lionel Scaloni has done his best to deflect questions from journalists about Messi's pending retirement. Scaloni was a teammate of Messi with Argentina in 2006. He's now one of the principal reasons Messi is so comfortable in Argentina's colors.\n\nDoubts about how much longer Messi will represent Argentina intensified last fall after his hectic first summer with Inter Miami. A lingering leg muscle injury had halted his spectacular run of form in Leagues Cup but Scaloni included Messi in Argentina's squad for World Cup qualifiers against Paraguay and Peru in October. Scaloni was asked if Argentina should begin to grow accustomed to playing without their star captain.\n\n\"Let's keep in mind that he's still here,\" Scaloni said sternly. \"What kind of thinking is 'When he is gone'? The truth is (Messi) is still active. Let's leave him alone. Are we already retiring him?\"\n\nMessi certainly didn't help to defuse the situation when in June 2023 he told Chinese outlet Titan Sports that he would retire before the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico. \"This (2022) was my last World Cup,\" said Messi. \"I'll see how things go, but in principle, I won't go to the next World Cup.\"\n\nMessi will turn 37 on June 24, and other than repeating as a Copa America champion, there's truly nothing left for him to accomplish in football. \"I can say that I'm a world champion,\" Messi said in 2023. \"I've accomplished everything.\"\n\nAs that reality begins to settle for Messi's teammates, they're doing their best to focus on the present.\n\n\"For now, let's not talk about Messi not continuing,\" Argentina midfielder Exequiel Palacias told Reuters in April. \"You can never imagine the national team without Messi. We all want him to be eternal and always play with us.\"\n\nThis week, during Argentina's Copa America media day, Messi posed for a picture with Di Maria, who has already announced this tournament will be his last with Argentina. As the photographers snapped pictures of the two Rosario-born playmakers, Argentina's midfield general Rodrigo De Paul said cryptically, \"Get your shots in now because this is it. They won't be at the next Copa America. Let's go, because this is the last one.\"\n\nLaughter followed, but De Paul's spontaneous quip came from a deeper place. The 30-year-old Atletico Madrid midfielder confessed to Spanish-language outlet Telemundo that Messi's retirement from the national team is a topic that isn't kept hidden away among Argentina's tight-knit group of players.\n\n\"I'm scared of the day that Messi is no longer with the national team,\" De Paul said. \"I talk about it with Leo often. Everything is so much easier with him (on the pitch). The advantages that we have thanks to him. Everything we do is about him. (Messi) always says to me, 'You lift up the phone and call me if the national team is ever in need. I'll always be a part of you guys.\"\n\nIn a much more casual setting than a pre-World Cup qualifier, earlier this month Scaloni finally opened up about life after Messi.\n\n\"It's going to happen someday. The longer it takes, the better,\" Scaloni told Telemundo. \"We're going to miss (Messi) at some point. It is what it is. (Diego) Maradona left the national team and someday Leo will, too. The coach won't always be the same person. Things change, but in the meantime, we have to enjoy this.\"\n\nMessi's contract with Inter Miami runs through 2025 with an option for one additional season. Meanwhile, many fans and football administrators are hoping Messi will delay his international retirement and play in a sixth World Cup in 2026.\n\nSo much of the marketing and promotion that will surround the North American World Cup will presumably be focused on Messi. His influence on the sport in America cannot be understated as a potential lift for a sport that's expected to experience an era of unprecedented growth.\n\nBut first comes the Copa America, the major tournament that may yet be Messi's farewell from the international stage.\n\nHow Argentina fares may or may not impact his decision. A second consecutive Copa America title could motivate him to push for a second straight World Cup trophy. Success this summer also could lead Messi to go out on top. If Argentina don't win the Copa America, Messi can step away gracefully and pass the baton to the national team's highly touted younger generation.\n\nOne thing is certain: Messi will keep us on the edge of our seats this summer, not just for what he does on the field, but as we wonder what it will mean in the totality of his story.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

All trophies he's won for Argentina", "body": "Yes, Messi has won the Copa America before. / CARL DE SOUZA/GettyImages\n\nLionel Messi has earned just about every domestic and international trophy throughout his illustrious career, but has he won the Copa America?\n\nMessi's trophy case is full of titles from his time at Barcelona, PSG, and Inter Miami. From 4 Champions League trophies to league titles in both Spain and France, Messi is one of the most decorated athletes in the history of sport. Of course, he also has a number of individual accolades, including eight Ballon d'Or awards.\n\nDespite Messi's domestic success, his quest for Argentina trophies always proved much more difficult. Messi and Argentina lost three straight finals in a row, once to Germany in the 2014 World Cup and then twice to Chile in back-to-back Copa America tournaments.\n\nIn 2021, Messi found himself in yet another Copa America final, but this time, the end result finally went in his favor.\n\nYes, Messi won the 2021 Copa America. Argentina defeated Brazil in the Copa America final 1-0 after an early goal from \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda. As Argentina's captain, Messi finally hoisted the Copa America trophy, earning his first major international trophy.\n\nMessi also won the Golden Boot and the Copa America Best Player award for his efforts in the 2021 tournament. The eight-time Ballon d'Or winner tallied four goals and five assists throughout the competition, playing a significant role in nine of Argentina's 12 total goals.\n\nJust one year later at the 2022 World Cup, Messi proved the 2021 Copa America win was anything but a fluke.\n\nHere's all the trophies Messi's won for Argentina so far:\n\nAfter Messi won the U-20 World Cup and an Olympic Gold Medal, he did not win another trophy for Argentina for 13 years. In the wake of the 2021 Copa America win, Messi told ESPN, \"I have peace of mind of having achieved the dream that has been denied to me so many times.\"\n\nExcept Messi's international dominance did not end in 2021. He led Argentina to victory against Italy to win the Finalissima, and then secured the biggest trophy in soccer just several months later against France in the World Cup final.", "source": {"uri": "90min.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "90min.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Miami_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inter Miami CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballon_d'Or", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ballon d'Or"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serie_A", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Serie A"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcelona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Barcelona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spain"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Spain"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c1ngel_Di_Mar\u00eda", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "\u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chile"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Chile"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONMEBOL\u2013UEFA_Cup_of_Champions", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CONMEBOL\u2013UEFA Cup of Champions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Olympic_Games", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Summer Olympic Games"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_awards", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup awards"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Italy"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Italy"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Consumer_Goods_and_Services/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Business/Consumer Goods and Services/Awards", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Handball/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Handball/Tournaments", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Awards", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Awards", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2398,h_1348,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/90min_en_international_web/01hx79cs2v4rth8qegrx.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9664788", "eventUri": "eng-9664788", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

Although he hasn't officially set a retirement date, the possibility of his departure from the international scene seems increasingly likely.\n\nIn a candid interview with Saudi broadcaster Riyad Season in March, Messi acknowledged the challenges that come with aging. \"I don't think about retirement yet. The moment I feel that I am not going to help my team, I will retire,\" he said. \"I always ate well, trained. But as I grew older, I became aware that the physical effort we make is getting harder. As you grow old, things become more difficult.\"\n\nThe eight-time Ballon d'Or winner faced several muscular injuries last year while playing in MLS and for Argentina, a trend that continued into 2024. Nevertheless, Messi's passion for the game remains evident as he continues to make significant contributions on the field, with 12 goals and 13 assists for Inter Miami this season.\n\nMessi's life in Miami reflects a balance between his professional commitments and personal enjoyment. He often spends time with his wife, Antonella, and their three children, engages in new business ventures, and enjoys the company of close friends and former Barcelona teammates Luis Su\u00e1rez, Sergio Busquets, and Jordi Alba.\n\n\"I have a good time at the club and with the national team,\" Messi told ESPN. \"I enjoy the little details that I know I will miss when I stop playing.\"\n\nThe Copa America also marks the impending farewell of \u00c1ngel di Maria, Messi's long-time teammate, who is set to retire from international soccer after the tournament. This has fueled further speculation about Messi's future with the national team.\n\n\"As long as I feel like I'm fine and I can continue contributing, I'm going to do it. Today, the only thing I think about is getting to the Copa America well and being able to compete,\" Messi told the Star Plus platform in December. \"Fighting for it again, as we always did, trying to be champions.\"\n\nArgentina's all-time top scorer, with 26 World Cup appearances, Messi is also eyeing records in the Copa America. He seeks to become the tournament's leading scorer, currently holding 13 goals across six editions, just four behind record-holders Norberto M\u00e9ndez of Argentina and Zizinho of Brazil with 17. Additionally, Messi aims to set the record for the most appearances in Copa America, a title he currently shares with former Chilean goalkeeper Sergio Livingston at 34 games.\n\nMessi's teammates are hopeful he will continue with the national team. \"We'll see how long, but while he's here we're going to enjoy it to the fullest,\" said Argentina defender Cristian Romero. \"We grew up watching him. We are part of those tournaments.\"\n\nAs the Copa America unfolds, the world will watch closely to see if this tournament becomes the grand finale of Lionel Messi's international career.", "source": {"uri": "thezimbabwemail.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Zimbabwe Mail"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Miami_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inter Miami CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buenos_Aires", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Buenos Aires"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Buenos Aires"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballon_d'Or", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ballon d'Or"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordi_Alba", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordi Alba"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_Busquets", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sergio Busquets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Argentina national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Su\u00e1rez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luis Su\u00e1rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FC Barcelona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristian_Romero_(footballer,_born_1998)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cristian Romero (footballer, born 1998)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norberto_Doroteo_M\u00e9ndez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Norberto Doroteo M\u00e9ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zizinho", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zizinho"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goalkeeper (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brazil national football team"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Petanque", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Petanque", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Handball/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Handball/Tournaments", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thezimbabwemail.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Messi-1.jpeg?fit=1200%2C830&ssl=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9664788", "eventUri": "eng-9664788", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Buenos Aires"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

Read on to know more.\n\nLionel Messi is a once-in-a-lifetime generational talent. The Argentine maestro has won and achieved everything that there was on offer on the field of football. However, he still has sights on another trophy. The 8-time Balon d'Or winner will feature in the Copa America 2024 competition. Thus, Messi's skills will be once again on display on the international stage. When it comes to skillset, Messi possesses a plethora of the sort but there is a common facet that is missing from his resume.\n\nAlso Read | Messi could be playing in his final tournament with Argentina\n\nLionel Messi feels embarrassed to speak English\n\nFrom cutting through narrow spaces to dribbling past the defenders like a Beyblade, Messi is the master in every craft that there is in Football. However, outside of it, there is one skill that he is still working on. Having spent the majority of his club career in Barcelona and being an Argentine, Messi speaks fluent Spanish but when it comes to English, Messi does not back himself from slotting it on the right spot. In an interview with Abitare, the Barcelona, PSG, and Inter Miami icon revealed that he understands English but \"out of embarrassment\" refrains from speaking it.\n\nSpeaking to Abitare, he said: \"I understand everything, or almost everything in English. But out of embarrassment I don't speak - but I think I can actually.\"\n\nThus, even the Greatest of All Time has some limits. Cristiano Ronaldo fans might take pride in this subject as their idol has given several interviews in English during his time at Manchester United.\n\nAlso Read | Chelsea icon Frank Lampard shares amazing tale about Cristiano Ronaldo\n\nMission Copa America 2024\n\nLionel Messi will return to action during the Copa America 2024, which is scheduled to start on Thursday, June 20, 2024, in the USA. Argentina and Messi would have the onus of defending the trophy they won two years ago. Argentina's squad is ever strong and it will be intriguing to see what Lionel Scaloni's men will have in store.

He's clearly past his peak at Inter Miami after two decades of playing at the highest level in Europe.\n\nMessi has not set a date for his retirement and has kept the door open to playing in a sixth World Cup in 2026 to defend his title from Qatar. But he already recognizes his shortcomings.\n\n\"I don\u00b4t think about that yet. The moment I feel that I am not going to help my team, I will retire,\" Messi said in March in an interview with Saudi broadcaster Riyad Season. \"I always ate well, trained. But as I grew I became aware that the physical effort we make is getting harder. As you grow old, things become more difficult.\"\n\nLast year, the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner struggled with muscular injuries while playing in MLS and for Argentina. That didn't change much in 2024.\n\nMessi has shown he enjoys going out at night with his wife, Antonella, and his friends in Miami. He spends time with his three children, starts new businesses and lives as if soccer is slowly becoming a smaller part of his life.\n\nStill, he has 12 goals and 13 assists for Inter Miami this season.\n\n\"I have a good time at the club. I am lucky to have teammates and friends (Luis Su\u00e1rez, Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba, all former Barcelona players) by my side,\" Messi told ESPN. \"I have a good time in the national team, where I have teammates and friends, too.

That has also brought more questions about whether the team's biggest star will remain on the squad.\n\n\"As long as I feel like I\u00b4m fine and I can continue contributing, I\u00b4m going to do it. Today, the only thing I think about is getting to the Copa America well and being able to compete in it,\" Messi told the Star Plus platform in December. \"Fighting for it again, as we always did, trying to be champions.\"\n\nArgentina\u00b4s all-time top scorer and the national team's leader with 26 World Cup appearances is also seeking records in the continental competition.\n\nMessi, who won the South American championship in 2021, wants to become the Copa America's leading scorer.

Barricades and police officers along Peachtree Street protecting the back entrance of the Westin Hotel, and a giant throng of fans in Messi jerseys surrounding an empty charter bus, waiting for a chance to get a glimpse of their beloved hero.\n\nThe scheduled training session was four hours away, but fans were camped out, desperate to see the team board the bus.\n\nEdy and Ana Alonzo, natives of Guatemala, drove from North Augusta, South Carolina on Tuesday with their sons, Hop, 10, and Marco Tulio, 5, who has been obsessed with Messi from the time he could walk. They have been sitting on folding chairs for four hours, hoping to see Messi. They waited three hours on Monday but had no luck, so they returned for another try.\n\nHow long will they stay? \"Until we see him, because I think my son loves Messi more than he loves me,\" Alonzo joked.\n\nTheir eldest daughter spent $1,800 to buy Edy and Marco Tulio a pair of tickets to the soldout game at Mercedes-Benz Stadium (8 p.m., FS1).\n\nThe fervor for Inter Miami star Messi and his Argentina teammates is on full display as Copa America gets underway. Just before nightfall Wednesday, Peachtree Street was a sea of sky blue and white, as thousands of fans took to the streets, waving banners and singing in Spanish.\n\nYerba mate has replaced Coca-Cola as the drink of choice in downtown Atlanta this week, and Argentina's iconic sky blue and white striped jerseys far outnumber Atlanta United's black, red and gold striped jerseys.\n\nMessi and his World Cup champion Argentina teammates begin defense of their Copa America title and tens of thousands of diehard fans have flocked here from Buenos Aires, Miami, and all over the United States to see what will likely be Messi's last time playing in the prestigious tournament.\n\n\"Hands down, Argentina has the most fans traveling for Copa America,\" said Antonio Paz, a partner at Absolut Sport, the official travel partner for the tournament. \"Eighty percent of the packages we sold have been for fans coming from Argentina. They are traveling to all three Argentina group games in Atlanta, Miami and New York/New Jersey. Many are also buying tickets for the quarterfinals, semifinal and the final at Hard Rock Stadium.\"\n\nNorberto Torres is among the Argentinean tourists. The 37-year-old from Buenos Aires flew to Atlanta via Miami on Thursday with his father and nephews. From Atlanta they will go to New York for Argentina's second group stage game against Chile and then on to Miami for the June 29 game against Peru at Hard Rock Stadium.\n\nTorres has racked up a lot of frequent flier miles following La Albiceleste (sky blue and white). He attended previous Copa America finals in Chile and the United States, and World Cups in South Africa, Brazil and Qatar.\n\nMore than 40,000 Argentineans traveled 8,200 miles to Qatar for the 2022 World Cup, despite inflation approaching 100%. There were reports of fans who sold their cars and emptied their savings accounts to make the trip. It is common to see fans with giant tattoos of Messi.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\n\"The passion began before Messi, with Diego Maradona,\" Torres said. \"When you're a little kid in Argentina and people ask you what you want to be, you say, 'World Champion.' Our love of futbol is in our blood. The Copa America is the tournament we have won more than any other, so it means a lot to our fans.\"\n\nTickets for Argentina's games are the hottest sellers of the 16-team tournament, being played at 14 stadiums across the United States.\n\nAccording to StubHub, Copa America has an average ticket price of $283 this year making it 98% more in-demand than the tournament was back in 2016 the last time the U.S. was host. Argentina is the most in-demand team with an average ticket price of $462, and the matchup between Argentina and Peru at Hard Rock Stadium is the hottest matchup of Copa America with an average ticket price of $519, and the best deal being $318.\n\nSeveral hundred Argentine fans who traveled from South Florida planned to meet up with Argentine supporter groups from other U.S. cities. Among their meeting points, a pep rally in the West End of the city co-hosted by the Argentine consulate in Atlanta.\n\nChris Moramarco, co-founder of Inter Miami supporter group Vice City, was one of the organizers of the South Florida trip to Atlanta. He is from Rosario, Argentina, the same hometown as Messi and Inter Miami coach Tata Martino, and his soccer roots run deep. His uncle, Federico Vairo Moramarco, played for the Argentine national team in the 1957 Copa America and the 1958 World Cup.\n\nMoramarco has an impressive collection of Argentine soccer memorabilia, including a piece of the goal net from the Qatar final game.\n\n\"You can't really explain what the team means to people from our country,\" he said. \"No matter what tickets cost, Argentineans find a way to be there.\"\n\nInter Miami radio announcer Fernando Fiore, a native of Argentina, said fans of the team are more passionate than ever because of the Copa and World Cup wins, and the possibility that Messi is nearing the end of his career.\n\n\"He has fewer days ahead than behind, so people want to enjoy and be part of this long swan song, this last Messi dance,\" Fiore said.\n\nJuan Jose Montes, a Colombia native who lives in Columbus, Georgia, was among the fans hanging around Argentina's hotel on Wednesday, with his son, Jeronimo. They wore Colombia jerseys but carried Messi shirts and posed for photos in front of a Messi banner outside the Westin.\n\n\"To watch Messi, the greatest player, with a team like Argentina, is brilliant to see those of us who love futbol,\" Montes said. \"Even though we are Colombian and rooting for our team to win, we also appreciate Messi and the Argentine style of game. And, it may be the last time he plays Copa America, so this is a moment you can't miss.\"\n\n\u00a92024 Miami Herald. Visit miamiherald.com.

Ar-gen-tin-a!\" fans of the World Cup champions said in unison, anxiously waiting for beloved soccer star Lionel Messi to step off the team's bus parked in front of The Westin Peachtree Plaza in Atlanta on Wednesday night.\n\nMessi walked up the stairs to the hotel entrance, briefly waving toward the fans as they chanted his name, the night before Copa Am\u00e9rica 2024 begins in the United States with Argentina facing Canada at Mercedes-Benz Stadium on Thursday.\n\n\"Well, we don't have this in Canada, eh?\" said Kevin Rodriguez, who flew in from Ottowa for the game and walked out of a bar next door to experience the commotion.\n\nMessi has revealed in recent interviews he is trying to enjoy each moment because the end of his illustrious soccer career is near. He hasn't set a retirement date in stone, and says his health will determine if he'll play in the next World Cup, co-hosted by the U.S., Canada and Mexico.\n\nStill, Argentine fans want to soak in all they can from their country's most famous living icon (yes, to some, even more famous than Pope Francis).\n\nThey've waited outside the team's hotel since their arrival Sunday, hoping to get a glimpse of Messi and the reigning Copa Am\u00e9rica and World Cup champions as they board and exit the team bus for practices this week at Kennesaw State University.\n\n\"It's full of Argentinians. We're a little crazy, jumping and singing in the street. That is what we do,\" said Clemson University researcher Max Ortiz, who is from Argentina and staying at the same hotel ahead of Thursday's match.\n\nOrtiz, the only one in his family to earn a college degree, made a sign asking Messi: \"Leo, your autograph for my dad and brother, please? Could you please leave it in the hotel reception?\"\n\nOrtiz also saw Messi play in Barcelona and during his MLS debut with Inter Miami.\n\n\"It's like surreal. He's an inspiration for all of us on so many levels,\" Ortiz said. \"He's a good father. He's a good husband, good friend. We don't know him [personally], but Argentinians recognize him for not giving up.\"\n\nThanks to Argentine news outlets, such as TYCSports and DSports, providing live coverage to fans back home, many Argentine fans know exactly when and where to be to see their favorite player and favorite team in whatever city they're playing.\n\nMany others, walking along Peachtree Center Avenue, see a collection of Argentina jerseys, and hang around to connect with fellow fans.\n\nArgentine midfielder Leandro Paredes and coach Lionel Scaloni shared their appreciation for the fans during a news conference Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"For us, they are the strength to keep up and continue competing. We really appreciate their warmth, their companionship, and we hope we can measure up,\" Paredes said.\n\nAdded Scaloni: \"This is a great time to see the national team, and we are very proud of our victories. I hope for them, they can enjoy watching their national team in Copa Am\u00e9rica. And of course, I thank them for their support.\"\n\nArgentine fan Mauro Puliafito always dresses for the occasion - this time in full costume as Lady Liberty with a crown, torch and tablet to honor Copa Am\u00e9rica being held in the United States for the second time. He's also quick to show off his tattoos: a portrait of him and Messi inked on the back of his left leg, and Messi's autograph along on his left forearm.\n\n\"I'm living a dream,\" said Puliafito, who attended the last three World Cups in Brazil, Russia and Qatar - where he dressed up like a camel in the desert country - and the 2019 Copa Am\u00e9rica in Brazil.\n\nGiselle Saldana, 54, a provisional translator from Buenos Aires, said Thursday's match will be the first time she gets to see Messi and the national team play in person.\n\nShe has tickets to each potential Copa Am\u00e9rica match Argentina could play, except the final because she was behind 60,000 others in the Ticketmaster queue.\n\n\"It's visceral. You feel it. It's totally an out-of-body experience,\" Saldana said of being an Argentine fan after they won the World Cup. \"I've never seen him play live, because in Argentina it's impossible to get tickets whenever the national team plays. So, for me to get the chance to see him play, considering this is could be his last tournament with the national team, is incredibly exciting. Your heart is pounding all the time. And for me to get the chance to see them is very emotional, too.\"\n\nAnna Baez and her daughter Emma, 12, said they would faint if they saw Messi in person. Along with husband, Rodrigo, and 8-year-old son Liam, the family native to Mendoza, Argentina traveled to Atlanta from their home in Rochester, Michigan (about 40 minutes north of Detroit).\n\nBaez and her husband wanted their kids to experience Messi and the national team with their own eyes. They're already saving money to afford World Cup tickets in two years.\n\n\"He's the best,\" Liam Baez said of Messi.\n\n\"It's very exciting. I'm happy to be here. And I'm grateful because I get to see Messi and all of them,\" Emma Baez said.\n\nOne Westin hotel employee, who wished not to share his name, was able to shake Messi's hand as he walked by.\n\n\"Leo,\" Messi said, introducing himself to the employee. \"Mucho gusto.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Argentina fans swarm team hotel for Lionel Messi before Copa

Hence, the club finished 14th in the conference at the end of the 2023 season.\n\nInterestingly, the 2024 season has been a different ball game so far this season as Inter Miami have recorded 11 wins, 5 draws, and three defeats in 19 league games.

A solitary strike from Angel Di Maria etched Argentina's fifteenth Copa America title into history, marking Lionel Messi's long-awaited grasp of a senior international trophy with his beloved national team.\n\nUnder the guidance of head coach Lionel Scaloni, a rejuvenated Argentina side claimed their first major trophy since 1986. A generation of youngsters, who grew up watching Messi's heartbreaks in the 2014 World Cup final against Germany, and the 2015 and 2016 Copa America finals versus Chile, pledged unwavering allegiance. They vowed to stand as one, even to the brink of war, should Messi call.\n\nEmiliano Martinez watched the 2018 World Cup as a fan, driven by a vow to ascend to Argentina's starting goalkeeper position by the 2022 World Cup tournament. Enzo Fernandez, a flourishing midfielder from Buenos Aires, wrote a heartfelt letter to his idol Messi in 2016, following Messi's decision to temporarily retire from international duty after successive final disappointments. And at just 24 years of age, Julian Alvarez has now adorned himself with trophies both for his club and his nation. Yet, when first called up to the national team, he asked his idol Messi for a picture during the sparring sessions. These narratives weave together among countless others -- testaments of young Argentine footballers shaped by Messi's tearful tribulations in the Albiceleste jersey.\n\nDuring Copa America 2021, amidst the persistent specter of the Covid-19 pandemic, stadiums sat under partial occupancy, and players endured over 50 days of isolation from their loved ones and the outside world. This crucible forged a bond that resonates to this day -- a unity forged in adversity.\n\nTen days prior to the final, Martinez's wife had given birth to their child. Rather than returning home to see his newborn daughter, Martinez chose to remain steadfastly by his teammates' side. \"Emiliano is here, foregoing the chance to meet his newborn daughter, to stay with us,\" said Messi in his famous speech before the final.\n\nAfter a grueling 90 minutes of football, Messi sank to his knees, overcome with emotions, as the referee's final whistle confirmed a hard-fought 1-0 triumph over Brazil.\n\nOver the past three years, Messi has conquered every trophy with the national team. There will be no more disappointments for Messi wearing the national jersey -- these players embody a bond forged by love and determination, a unity not easily severed. As Messi steps onto the field for the Copa America on Thursday, it marks yet another opportunity to witness greatness.\n\n\"It's like everything has changed, yet nothing has changed,\" Messi said in an interview earlier this month.

He cememted his legacy as the GOAT the following year, when he led Argentina to its first World Cup since Diego Maradona did it four decades earlier.\n\nUSA 2024 presents Messi with a golden opportunity to further burnish his resume. Another Copa crown would give Messi his third triumph at a major tournament, equaling Brazilian great Pel\u00e9. Winning three in a row would put Argentina in rare company as one of the few nations -- and first since the great Spanish team from 2008-12 -- ever to accomplish the feat.\n\nCoach Lionel Scaloni's personnel hasn't changed much since they hoisted the most coveted piece of hardware in sports in Qatar in late December 2022. In addition to Messi, fellow veterans \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda, Emiliano Mart\u00ednez and Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi are still there. The most notable addition is 19-year-old Manchester United forward Alejandro Garnacho, who debuted for his country last year.\n\nArgentina hasn't rested on it laurels over the last 18 months.\n\nThe Albiceleste has posted a gaudy record of 13W-1L-0T since the World Cup. And they are the prohibitive favorites to repeat as champs, with Brazil a relatively distant second pick.\n\nHe's been slowed by injuries since his dream start with MLS club Inter Miami last summer. Messi has appeared in just 12 of the Herons first 18 league games this season. But he's still lethal when healthy, though, which Messi demonstrated by scoring twice in a 4-1 win over Guatemala last weekend in Argentina's final preparation match.\n\nCanada, a 2022 World Cup participant, will be a step-up in competition. Les Rouges finished first in Concacaf qualifying for Qatar and have a legit all-world talent in Bayern Munich fullback/winger Alphonso Davies who, at 23, was just named Canada's captain. They also have a younger team now led by a new coach, American Jesse Marsch. Marsch, who was passed over for the U.S. job last year, is desperate to make a good first impression at the world's longest-running international tournament. Stopping Messi will be the top priority. But not the only one.\n\n\"As he's gotten older, his biggest weapon has become his passing,\" Reds defender Kamal Miller recently said of Messi, his former Inter Miami teammate. \"We've got to do a good job of not only focusing on him, but respecting the whole team.\"\n\nMeantime, Argentina's South American rivals Chile and Peru are even more formidable opponents.\n\nMeantime, South American rivals Chile and Peru will be a step up from the Canadians. The Chileans beat Argentina in consecutive Copa Am\u00e9rica finals in 2015 and '16, the latter marking the last time the U.S. hosted the event.\n\nBut there's a clear path to the 2024 final if Mess & Co. can handle their business. Brazil and Uruguay -- the bookies' third favorite -- are both on the other side of the bracket. Mexico could be their biggest roadblock, but El Tri enters the competition with its weakest squad in recent memory.\n\nWinning the July 14 decider at Hard Rock Stadium in his adopted home city of Miami would provide a storybook ending to Messi's already unparalleled career should he decide to drop the mic and walk away from international play while the confetti is still falling.\n\nOr, maybe a third consecutive title will inspire him to shoot for an unprecedented fourth, especially with another World Cup here in North America just two summers from now.\n\n\"If I feel good,\" he has said repeatedly this year, \"I will keep playing.\"\n\nEither way, all eyes will be on the biggest star of all at this Copa Am\u00e9rica starting Thursday, if only to see what sort of magic Messi might be able to conjure as an encore.", "source": {"uri": "foxsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)",

While there, he hopes to become the highest goalscorer in the tournament's history.\n\nHe has 13 goals in the tournament already, the first against Peru in 2007 and the latest against Chile in 2021 on his way to winning his first major international trophy with Argentina.\n\nWith four more, he will draw level with Brazil's Zizinho and Messi's countryman Norberto Mendez to tie a record that has stood since 1957. With five, he will stand alone at the top.\n\nIn anticipation of more this summer, The Athletic looked back through every goal he has scored at the tournament to examine the evolution of one of football's greats...\n\nHow to follow the European Championship and Copa America on The Athletic...\n\nAt this stage, he was more of a final-third player than the playmaker-creator-finisher he became, often profiting from chances made by his more experienced team-mates. On this occasion, the assist came from Juan Roman Riquelme, one of Messi's footballing idols.\n\nThe former Boca Juniors and Barcelona No 10 spotted the run of Messi, who was attacking the centre space from the right wing.\n\nRiquelme slid the pass into Messi's path, and Messi controlled it with the outside of his left foot, with the Peru goalkeeper quickly closing the space.\n\nMessi could have passed it to Carlos Tevez, but instead calmly passed through the 'keeper's legs and into the net before linking arms with Tevez and celebrating as a trio with Riquelme.\n\nAfter receiving a pass from Esteban Cambiasso, Javier Zanetti whipped a 30-yard pass into Tevez, who does well to bring it under his control. Tevez feeds Messi, who was unmarked and in space on the right wing -- possibly the first and only time this has ever happened.\n\nMessi takes the ball onto his left foot with his first touch and graciously picks out the far corner with a lob over Oswaldo Sanchez in the Mexico goal.\n\nDeciding to shoot from an acute angle, catching the goalkeeper off guard with a looping effort near the corner of the 18-yard box, makes this goal particularly special.\n\nThis semi-final goal helped Argentina to a 3-0 win, setting up a tie against old foes Brazil in the final. While it was only his second goal at the tournament, it is arguably still his best.\n\nSomewhat astonishingly, Messi did not score in 2011 despite Argentina hosting the tournament. His next would come in a 2-2 group stage draw with Paraguay in 2015.\n\nLike his first, the goal to end the eight-year drought at the tournament will not live long in the memory. This was from the penalty spot, where Messi has sometimes struggled for Argentina in the biggest moments, but he was composed and technically reliable here.\n\nTo beat Antony Silva in the Peru goal, Messi staggered his run-up, dragging his trailing right foot before making contact with the ball. At this stage, Messi does not seem as confident in his penalty-taking technique as he would later become, as he only quickly glances up at the goalkeeper to read his movement, and, by that time, it seems Messi was set on shooting into the bottom-right corner anyway.\n\nThe goalkeeper guessed correctly, but the placement and power of the shot were too good for him to get near.\n\nFor the first in a hat-trick against Panama, Messi profited from some hilarious good fortune.\n\nPanama defender Roderick Miller tries to clear the ball from the edge of the box, but his mishit effort cannoned back off Gonzalo Higuain's face and into the path of Messi.\n\nWith Miller trailing behind him, Messi takes one touch out of his feet and into the 18-yard box before curling a left-footed effort past Jaime Penedo in the Panama goal.\n\nAround 25 yards from goal, it would take something special from Messi to beat Penedo from an awkward angle.\n\nHe took a short run-up with one setting step before a proper, in-rhythm step ahead of whipping his left foot around the ball. With pace and bend, it flies over the wall and towards the corner.\n\nDespite Penedo getting an outstretched hand on the curling ball, he cannot prevent it from nestling in the net. It was a trademark example of Messi's genius, and it may not even be his best set-piece goal from the 2016 Centenario edition.\n\nMarcos Rojo strolled into the middle of the pitch from left-back with several passing options ahead of him. He opts for an unmarked Messi, who takes one touch into the box.\n\nMessi is quickly converged upon by Felipe Baloy in the heart of Panama's defence, but sells Baloy before cutting back onto his stronger left. He then curled a left-footed shot around the goalkeeper.\n\nHere, Argentina caught Venezuela in transition led by Messi, Higuain and Nico Gaitan.\n\nMessi drove the ball into the final third and picked out Gaitan, who now plays for the Chicago Fire in MLS. Gaitan took one touch towards the box and returned a pass for Messi ahead of his run and into space behind Oswaldo Vizcarrondo in the Venezuela defence.\n\nWith only the goalkeeper to beat, Messi took a touch with his left foot, bringing the ball closer to the six-yard box, and slid a shot through Dani Hernandez's legs and into the goal.\n\nIf Messi's brilliant second goal at Copa America has competition for his best of the tournament, this is it.\n\nMore than 25 yards from goal and on an angle that would favour a right-footer, the chances of Messi converting from this position are very slim.\n\nWith so much distance from the goal, convention would suggest attempting a shot over the wall. There is plenty of space to get the shot up and down while retaining the power needed to beat Brad Guzan in the USMNT net, and owing to the goalkeeper's position on the other side of the goal, there is a larger target to aim at.\n\nInstead of going over the wall, he ferociously whipped an effort that needed to be perfect to score.\n\nAnticipating it going the other way, Guzan took a step to his right, and by the time he realised the shot was directed towards his other post, it was too late. The ball is placed exactly in the space between the post and crossbar, sometimes referred to as the \"upper 90\", with Guzan's diving effort proving no match for Messi's left foot. With this finish, Messi became Argentina's record goalscorer.\n\nHaving lost 2-0 to Colombia in the first game of the group stage, this was a pressure penalty for Messi, with Argentina trailing by one goal to Paraguay.\n\nHere, he did not look at the goalkeeper at all before firing into the net. Messi took three steps back from the ball, put his head down and charged towards it, signalling he would prioritise power over accuracy.\n\nMessi fired towards the bottom-right corner, with Paraguay goalkeeper Gatito Fernandez failing to stop it.\n\nBefore Messi changed his penalty-taking technique during the 2022 World Cup, it was seen as one of the weaker areas of his otherwise spotless game. Messi tends to take two types of penalties, one with a slower run-up and one where he sprints towards the ball.\n\nFor those penalties with a slower run-up, he very rarely aims for the top corner. For the others, he often does. This is one with a slower run-up, suggesting he will aim either for one of the bottom corners or the middle of the goal with a delicate chip.\n\nThe slower run-up puts the ball in the goalkeeper's court. If the goalkeeper moves before the taker shoots, the taker should place it in the opposite direction. If the goalkeeper does not move until the shot is taken, he will struggle to generate the physical momentum to dive towards the ball if it is placed well in the corner. Brentford and England striker Ivan Toney is a master of this technique, as was former Belgium attacker Eden Hazard, and is arguably the most effective route to goal from 12 yards if executed properly.\n\nHere, Messi approaches the ball slowly, waiting for Bolivia goalkeeper Carlos Lampe to commit to either side. Just as Messi is taking his final step towards the ball, Lampe puts his body weight towards his left side before quickly shifting it towards his right.\n\nMessi keeps his eye on the goalkeeper throughout the run-up and places his shot in Lampe's bottom-left corner.\n\nThe goalkeeper is unable to shift his body weight back towards his left side and collapses in the middle of the goal, while Messi's shot travels to the corner.\n\nThis is a rare role-reversal for Sergio Aguero and Messi, with the former turning creator for his team-mate. Aguero dropped onto the halfway line and received a pass from the defence before he turned and spotted the run of Messi, who was darting into space beyond the Bolivia back line.\n\nAguero weighted a lofted pass perfectly between the defender and Lampe, allowing Messi to reach the ball in the ideal spot to loft a shot over Lampe and into the Bolivia net.\n\nIt's an elementary skill for a player with 106 international goals. He then wheeled away to celebrate with Aguero.\n\nIf it is not already clear, Messi is among the greatest free-kick takers ever. But even he needs a little help sometimes.\n\nDespite it being closer to goal than any other free-kick on this list, Messi's job is actually made harder. Normally, the optimal distance to get a shot over the wall and down in time to score is around 22 yards. At 18 yards, this is much more challenging.\n\nThe options are: a chip over the wall; a driven effort between Jhegson Mendez and Pervis Estupinan on the right edge of the wall; or relying on Nico Otamendi, Lautaro Martinez and Marcos Acuna to split quickly enough to shoot in the gap they vacate.\n\nThankfully (for their and Messi's sakes), they managed to get out of the way of Messi's shot, which was destined for their heads.\n\nA little further away from his effort against Ecuador later on in this list, but closer and at a much kinder angle than his stunner against USMNT, this one is veritably \"free-kick distance\".\n\nGiovani Lo Celso, Otamendi and Martinez take position to disrupt Chile's wall, but the effect is partly negated due to Gary Medel standing right behind them. Messi has two options: bend around the wall or shoot over the wall, towards the top-right corner.\n\nMessi picked out the side netting in the top right corner with aplomb, beating former Barcelona team-mate Claudio Bravo.\n\nIt is the most recent of his 13 Copa America goals and one of his finest.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors":

There he was - 5-6 of footballing genius, the GOAT, the all-time leader in Ballons d'Or wins, less than nine months removed from lifting the World Cup - being presented to America.\n\nIn a sense, this was the culmination of Major League Soccer's dream. The immigration of superstars started with David Beckham in 2007, and had steadily chugged along in the 16 years since. But not until Messi was handed the pink jersey for the first time did it feel like MLS had really made a splash. This was not only a landmark moment for the league, but also legitimacy for the wider world. Messi gave MLS the co-sign, the ultimate street cred it needed.\n\nA year on, and the league has changed immensely - not in competition necessarily, but certainly in notoriety. Apple paid $2.5 billion (\u00a32bn) to secure TV rights for league matches, and directed some of that money to give Messi's salary a bump. Jersey sales have skyrocketed, while global interest has demonstrably spiked.\n\nBut perception is a difficult thing to negotiate. For all of the positives that Messi has brought to MLS - magical left foot, money, marketing appeal, mania among fans - this is still a competition looked down upon with scorn by many in the footballing populous.\n\nGood thing, then, that the Copa America arrives on American shores this week. Messi will represent Argentina, and in doing so, become the de facto ambassador for MLS - a litmus test for the quality of play in the league. Pressure doesn't really exist for Messi, but MLS certainly needs the legendary Argentine to perform, if only to prove that they are a quality home for Messi - the greatest to ever do it - to kick a ball in his twilight years.", "source": {"uri": "goal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Goal.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "thomas_hindle@goal.com", "name": "Thomas Hindle", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DRV_PNK_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DRV PNK Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Beckham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "David Beckham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "De facto"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Jersey"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro_Leagues", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Negro Leagues", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cue_Sports/Pool", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cue Sports/Pool", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 65}], "image": "https://assets.goal.com/images/v3/blt939d9f04f52e7490/Messi.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9664788", "eventUri": "eng-9664788", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 156, "relevance": 1}

Before the final line-splitting stab pass. Before the final feint of the ball. Before the final nutmeg. Before the final slick touch. Before the final free kick curled in the top bin. And before the final oohs and aahs.\n\nThe nudge - without a date on it - comes ahead of Argentina's Copa America campaign. It was the competition that set Messi and Co on their way to the big prize, wasn't it? Cast your minds back to the summer of 2021. It was the manner in which Argentina scraped through in the semis and the final that gave the first sign -- this was a much more dogged national team than the ones that Messi had featured in the past.\n\nMessi himself, came across as a much more vocal captain, overcoming a particular complaint pundits had against him in the past.\n\n\"He's not a leader,\" Diego Maradona had fired the shots himself following the 2018 World Cup exit. \"He's another Messi when he plays for Argentina.\"\n\nIf only he was around to drink in the Messi in the Albiceleste 10 that summer. When he jumped and pumped his fists from the halfway line to yell at Yerry Mina after his miss in the penalty shootout: \"Dance now! Dance now, huh! Come on, dance!\"\n\nOr when \"he lost his mind\", per Angel Di Maria, in his goosebumps-inducing pre-final dressing room speech. When had we ever seen this version of Messi before? One closer to Maradona than himself. One who got the job done. But can he do his predecessor one better?\n\nArgentina sits on an opportunity few teams have had in the past, and one even fewer have succeeded in nabbing - a successful title defence.\n\nA new plan\n\nArgentina manager Lionel Scaloni said on the eve of the tournament that he had \"renewed ideas and strength\" to defend the title.\n\nThis, after he'd been poked on whether the team had plans in place for a future without Messi and Angel Di Maria - the two most experienced players in the team. While the team that won the double was quintessentially built around Messi, it is critical to note Di Maria's value within the system. He was, after all, a goal-scorer in both finals.\n\nScaloni may have brushed aside the question for now - as has Messi - but it remains an important one for the team to answer sooner rather than later in the new cycle. Whether he makes it to 2026 or not, Messi is only likely to remain the man to orchestrate the play as long as he's around.\n\nBut as he continues to cut down on his runs and walk more - a growing feature of his game in recent years - there is bound to be an increase in the expectations from the younger supporting cast. The likes of Enzo Fernandez, Julian Alvarez, and Alexis Mac Allister, all of whom have had a tough time getting used to the Premier League for different reasons, will have to cover even more yards to enable the attacking play.\n\nA familiar turf\n\nThere has seldom been a place where the Albiceleste don't find support in numbers. The United States though, is as good as any to lend them a clear-cut 12th man advantage.\n\nSince his arrival to the States last summer, Messi has established himself in the country's pop culture, let alone the sports scene. One moment he pops up in a Super Bowl commercial, the next he's promoting the new Bad Boys film with Will Smith.\n\nIn Washington ahead of a friendly, thousands gathered outside the team hotel, wearing the fabled sky blue-white Argentine shirt - the majority of them flashing 10. Just as they did in Atalanta ahead of their opening game on Friday.\n\nFor now, Scaloni and the rest of Argentina can breathe easy, Messi is there to make them favorites for a title defence.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rahul_pandey@indianexpress.com", "name": "Rahul Pandey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Argentina national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_kick_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free kick (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dummy_(football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dummy (football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Maradona", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Diego Maradona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\u00c1ngel_Di_Mar\u00eda", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "\u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yerry_Mina", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yerry Mina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Scaloni", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Scaloni"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pundit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pundit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manager (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_Mac_Allister", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alexis Mac Allister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12th_man_(football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "12th man (football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzo_Fern\u00e1ndez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Enzo Fern\u00e1ndez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atalanta_B.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atalanta B.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_turf", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial turf"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men's_national_soccer_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States men's national soccer team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibition_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exhibition game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Smith", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Will Smith"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rope_Skipping/Clubs_and_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rope Skipping/Clubs and Teams", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/06/Messi-Copa-America.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9664788", "eventUri": "eng-9664788", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

Ar-gen-tin-a!\" fans of the World Cup champions said in unison, anxiously waiting for beloved soccer star Lionel Messi to step off the team's bus parked in front of The Westin Peachtree Plaza in Atlanta on Wednesday night.\n\nMessi walked up the stairs to the hotel entrance, briefly waving toward the fans as they chanted his name, the night before Copa Am\u00e9rica 2024 begins in the United States with Argentina facing Canada at Mercedes-Benz Stadium on Thursday.\n\n\"Well, we don't have this in Canada, eh?\" said Kevin Rodriguez, who flew in from Ottowa for the game and walked out of a bar next door to experience the commotion.\n\nMessi has revealed in recent interviews he is trying to enjoy each moment because the end of his illustrious soccer career is near. He hasn't set a retirement date in stone, and says his health will determine if he'll play in the next World Cup, co-hosted by the U.S., Canada and Mexico.\n\nStill, Argentine fans want to soak in all they can from their country's most famous living icon (yes, to some, even more famous than Pope Francis).\n\nThey've waited outside the team's hotel since their arrival Sunday, hoping to get a glimpse of Messi and the reigning Copa Am\u00e9rica and World Cup champions as they board and exit the team bus for practices this week at Kennesaw State University.\n\n\"It's full of Argentinians. We're a little crazy, jumping and singing in the street. That is what we do,\" said Clemson University researcher Max Ortiz, who is from Argentina and staying at the same hotel ahead of Thursday's match.\n\nOrtiz, the only one in his family to earn a college degree, made a sign asking Messi: \"Leo, your autograph for my dad and brother, please? Could you please leave it in the hotel reception?\"\n\nOrtiz also saw Messi play in Barcelona and during his MLS debut with Inter Miami.\n\n\"It's like surreal. He's an inspiration for all of us on so many levels,\" Ortiz said. \"He's a good father. He's a good husband, good friend. We don't know him [personally], but Argentinians recognize him for not giving up.\"\n\nThanks to Argentine news outlets, such as TYCSports and DSports, providing live coverage to fans back home, many Argentine fans know exactly when and where to be to see their favorite player and favorite team in whatever city they're playing.\n\nMany others, walking along Peachtree Center Avenue, see a collection of Argentina jerseys, and hang around to connect with fellow fans.\n\nArgentine midfielder Leandro Paredes and coach Lionel Scaloni shared their appreciation for the fans during a news conference Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"For us, they are the strength to keep up and continue competing. We really appreciate their warmth, their companionship, and we hope we can measure up,\" Paredes said.\n\nAdded Scaloni: \"This is a great time to see the national team, and we are very proud of our victories. I hope for them, they can enjoy watching their national team in Copa Am\u00e9rica. And of course, I thank them for their support.\"\n\nArgentine fan Mauro Puliafito always dresses for the occasion - this time in full costume as Lady Liberty with a crown, torch and tablet to honor Copa Am\u00e9rica being held in the United States for the second time. He's also quick to show off his tattoos: a portrait of him and Messi inked on the back of his left leg, and Messi's autograph along on his left forearm.\n\n\"I'm living a dream,\" said Puliafito, who attended the last three World Cups in Brazil, Russia and Qatar - where he dressed up like a camel in the desert country - and the 2019 Copa Am\u00e9rica in Brazil.\n\nGiselle Saldana, 54, a provisional translator from Buenos Aires, said Thursday's match will be the first time she gets to see Messi and the national team play in person.\n\nShe has tickets to each potential Copa Am\u00e9rica match Argentina could play, except the final because she was behind 60,000 others in the Ticketmaster queue.\n\n\"It's visceral. You feel it. It's totally an out-of-body experience,\" Saldana said of being an Argentine fan after they won the World Cup. \"I've never seen him play live, because in Argentina it's impossible to get tickets whenever the national team plays. So, for me to get the chance to see him play, considering this is could be his last tournament with the national team, is incredibly exciting. Your heart is pounding all the time. And for me to get the chance to see them is very emotional, too.\"\n\nAnna Baez and her daughter Emma, 12, said they would faint if they saw Messi in person. Along with husband, Rodrigo, and 8-year-old son Liam, the family native to Mendoza, Argentina traveled to Atlanta from their home in Rochester, Michigan (about 40 minutes north of Detroit).\n\nBaez and her husband wanted their kids to experience Messi and the national team with their own eyes. They're already saving money to afford World Cup tickets in two years.\n\n\"He's the best,\" Liam Baez said of Messi.\n\n\"It's very exciting. I'm happy to be here. And I'm grateful because I get to see Messi and all of them,\" Emma Baez said.\n\nOne Westin hotel employee, who wished not to share his name, was able to shake Messi's hand as he walked by.\n\n\"Leo,\" Messi said, introducing himself to the employee. \"Mucho gusto.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [],

What are you doing here?\" the legendary striker laughed.\n\n\"You have to do well in the Copa America. If you don't play well, then I won't invite you to drink mate at my house anymore.\"\n\nWith Argentina seeking back-to-back Copa America success, Aguero welcomed his fellow countrymen with a herd of goats, to acknowledge their status as the greatest team on the planet.\n\nThe goat who made a beeline for Aguero ended up walking away, which is what soccer fans fear may happen to Lionel Messi, soccer's true GOAT, at the end of the Copa America, which starts Thursday in Atlanta with Argentina taking on Canada.\n\nWhile Lionel Scaloni's reigning world - and Copa champions - are fancied strongly to life the trophy again in Miami next month, all the talk is, as always, about Messi.\n\nThe current Inter Miami ace admitted: \"I don't know how I will be in that moment\" when asked about the chances of appearing in the next World Cup in the United States, where he now lives.\n\nMessi will be 39 years old when the greatest show on earth comes to town.\n\nBut Premier League legend and Stake ambassador Aguero, one of Messi's best friends, reckons there will be one, glorious last waltz for the little maestro.\n\n\"After the Copa we will see, I think he's in good shape and can continue,\" Aguero told The U.S. Sun.\n\n\"It's too early to say , but I think he can play 100%. Even Messi at 30% is better than most other players.\"\n\nMessi's minutes on the pitch have been managed well by his bosses at Inter Miami.\n\nOne of the most amazing sporting careers is coming to an end, but while he's still lighting up MLS, there's always a chance of him turning on the style for his country too.\n\n\"It depends on him but I can certainly see him doing another year.,\" added Aguero.\n\n\"But when that year is over, it's only 12 months until the World Cup. I see him playing in 2026.\"\n\nAguero is confident the next generation of Argentine superstars will carry La Albiceleste forward, whenever Messi decides to hang up his golden cleats.\n\n\"Of course, there will be a void,\" he admitted. \"But when Maradona retired it was the same. We have a good future.\"\n\nThis edition of South America's continental competition is the first to be played outside of the continent and is perfect preparation for the World Cup.\n\nAll 10 South American teams are competing, but, as in 2016, will be joined by the United States, Mexico, Jamaica, Canada, Costa Rica and Panama.\n\nArgentina, who lifted the title - Messi's first international honor in 2021 which just involved the 10 teams from the continent - are the favorites, especially after they romped to glory in Qatar in 2022.\n\nIf Scaloni's side defends their title, it will see them lift the prestigious trophy for a record 16th time.\n\nArch-rivals Brazil, who were beaten in Rio by Messi and co in the last Copa final, will be desperate for revenge.\n\nBut Aguero, who made 100 appearances for his country, isn't worried at all by the Samba stars.\n\n\"The only team who could beat us are Uruguay. No, not Brazil,\" he said with a smile.\n\n\"They are in transition, even though they are Brazil, lot of young players and haven't really built a team.\"\n\nArgentine fans will see their former coach, Marcelo Bielsa, in charge of the Uruguayans, and know his wisdom could prove key.\n\n\"Bielsa knows Scaloni well,\" Aguero admitted. \"And they are the only team to beat us since winning the World Cup.\"\n\nFor the unfancied American side, a good showing in the Copa can lay the foundations for a patriotic push for glory when the World Cup begins the summer after next.\n\nGregg Berhalter's team is in a group with Uruguay, Panama, Bolivia, and would do well to reach the latter stages.\n\nAguero, who is now based in Miami, thinks the country has all the tools in place to ensure a rip-roaring soccer fiesta.\n\n\"The US is the best place for a global event, maybe football isn't the main sport, not what you'd associate with the US but everything is here.\n\n\"They thought the same thing about Qatar and that was great.

Having him behind me is the best thing that can happen to me.\"\n\nAt Tottenham, he's currently taking home \u00a3165,000 per week, although Real Madrid have reportedly been sniffing around him in recent weeks. Watch this space.\n\nThe Brazilian winger was in and out of the Arsenal XI last season as he struggled to find his top form for Mikel Arteta's side.\n\nDespite not scoring for Arsenal since March, Martinelli can still be a game-changer on his day. Given the wide options Brazil have at their disposal, the 23-year-old will likely be used as an impact player during the tournament.\n\nHis club career hasn't quite hit the same heights as his international career, but there's still plenty of time for the 23-year-old to make a name for himself at Chelsea.\n\nFollowing his \u00a3107million switch to Stamford Bridge last year, he was handed an eight-and-a-half-year contract which is worth an eye-watering \u00a3180,000 per week.\n\nREAD NEXT: The 4 players at Copa America 2024 born after Lionel Messi made his Argentina debut\n\nTRY A QUIZ: Can you name every team to win the Copa America?\n\nIn Europe's top five leagues, only four players scored more goals than Martinez did last season. The Inter Milan forward is set to lead the line for Argentina this summer and is currently earning a healthy \u00a3184,000 per week.\n\nBelieve it or not, Messi is only the seventh highest-paid player at Copa America this year. He's still the highest-paid player in MLS, but compared to players playing in Europe, his wages are on the lower end.\n\nOf course, when you factor in the brand and commercial deals that Messi receives, he'll be earning significantly more than \u00a3186,000 per week. However, that's what he's earning as his base wage at Inter Miami.\n\nIt's also worth pointing out that Messi reportedly turned down an offer of \u00a3434m per season to play in Saudi Arabia last year, in favour of joining Inter Miami.\n\nTRY A QUIZ: Can you name the 14 international teams Lionel Messi hasn't scored against?\n\nDespite not being a regular starter for Barcelona last season, Raphinha was still among the most productive players at the club. In La Liga, he averaged a goal or assist every 91.5 minutes which is some going.\n\nThere has been some speculation that he could be on the move this summer, with clubs from the Premier League and Saudi Arabia said to be interested.\n\nFresh off winning the Champions League with Real Madrid, Rodrygo will be looking to win his first-ever trophy with Brazil this summer.\n\nCurrently earning around \u00a3207,000 per week, it's no wonder that he ranks among the highest-paid players at the tournament.\n\nDespite missing the bulk of last season with an ACL injury, Militao has recovered in time to take part in Copa America this year.\n\nHaving previously won the tournament back in 2019, his experience could prove to be vital in the later stages of the competition.\n\nEarning a yearly salary of around \u00a314.5million, it's no wonder that Marquinhos has spent the last decade playing for PSG.\n\nAlong with being one of the highest-paid players in the Brazil squad, Marquinhos is also one of the most experienced. With 85 international caps under his belt, he'll have a crucial role to play this summer.\n\nWho else? Vinicius is by far the highest-paid player at Copa America, taking home a whopping \u00a3345,000 per week at Real Madrid.\n\nHe's the current front-runner for the Ballon d'Or and if he manages to lead Brazil to victory this summer, surely that prize has got his name on it?\n\nWhile the 23-year-old often showcases his class in club football, he's not quite been up to the same standard on the international stage. In 30 appearances for Brazil, he's only managed to score three goals - a record he'll be looking to change this summer.", "source": {"uri": "planetfootball.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Planet Football"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_stewart@planetfootball.com", "name": "Ben Stewart", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Brazil"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Miami_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inter Miami CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tottenham Hotspur F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenal_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arsenal F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Madrid_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real Madrid CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikel_Arteta", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mikel Arteta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Soccer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UEFA"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stamford_Bridge_(stadium)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stamford Bridge (stadium)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chelsea_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chelsea F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Milan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inter Milan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Saudi Arabia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raphinha", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Raphinha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodrygo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rodrygo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballon_d'Or", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ballon d'Or"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marquinhos", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marquinhos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cap_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cap (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Saint-Germain_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paris Saint-Germain F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Barcelona", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "FC Barcelona"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "La Liga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Premier League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Champions_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "UEFA Champions League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brazil national football team"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian_Rules", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian Rules", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Statistics", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Tennis/Social", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Handball/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Handball/Tournaments", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images.ps-aws.com/c?url=https%3A%2F%2Fd3nfwcxd527z59.cloudfront.net%2Fcontent%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F06%2F19151537%2FCopa-America-highest-paid.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9664788", "eventUri": "eng-9664788", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

Lionel Messi - the world's greatest player - was left flabbergasted and speechless after the full-time whistle. The Copa America final, their second in as many years, slipped from Argentina's grasp once again.\n\n\"I tried my hardest,\" said a disconsolate Messi. \"It's been four finals, and I was not able to win. I tried everything possible. It hurts me more than anyone, but it is evident that this is not for me. I want more than anyone to win a title with the national team, but unfortunately, it did not happen.\"\n\nA 2014 FIFA World Cup final, three Copa America finals - with the third being that dreadful evening at MetLife Stadium in June of 2016, a loss in penalties to Chile - were weighing on his then 29-year-old mind. The Argentine was asked, one last time, if he would ever again wear the crest of La Albiceleste.\n\n\"I don't think so,\" he replied, with tears on his face. \"I've thought about it. Like I said earlier, I tried everything possible to win. And that's it. It's four finals lost.\"\n\nDistraught over his performance, Messi had convinced the world - and himself, seemingly - that he was done. No longer would he represent his country on the international stage, and no longer would he wear the crest of Argentina on the pitch.\n\nGoosebumps covering arms, cottonmouth on their tongues, the world read and watched as the then-Barcelona superstar expressed an unforgettable moment of vulnerability.\n\nNow, eight years from that moment, the Inter Miami star is set to lead La Albiceleste once again as captain. Copa America 2024 is here, and Argentina arrives as the reigning World Champion from the 2022 World Cup, ready to kickoff the tournament against Canada Thursday night in Atlanta.\n\nBut this storyline wasn't always a given. Everything could be so, so different. What if Messi really did opt to retire in 2016? For at least two months, the world was convinced he did.\n\nGOAL revisits those harrowing two months from 2016, and tries to answer a question that has loomed over international soccer since that memorable night: What the hell happened after that Copa America final at MetLife Stadium, and will we truly ever know?", "source": {"uri": "goal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Goal.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jacob_schneider@goal.com", "name": "Jacob Schneider", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_national_football_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina national football team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lionel Messi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Argentina"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Goal (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am\u00e9rica_Centenario", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MetLife_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MetLife Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FIFA World Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Penalty shoot-out (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chile", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chile"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Chile"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter_Miami_CF", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Inter Miami CF"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Association football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Stadiums", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/CONMEBOL", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Team_Handball/Tournaments", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Team Handball/Tournaments", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Cacerolazo", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://assets.goal.com/images/v3/blt5af4c480d3dfbea9/Reliving%20Messi's%20Copa%20retirement.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9664788", "eventUri": "eng-9664788", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

Guido Rodriguez scored the only goal of the clash.\n\nIn their third match, La Albiceleste again eked out a 1-0 win against Paraguay, with Papu Gomez getting on the scoresheet.\n\nIn Argentina's final group match against Bolivia, it clinched a convincing 4-1 win. Gomez again opened the scoring, followed by a Messi brace, which included a penalty. Lautaro Martinez scored the fourth goal for the Albiceleste.\n\nQuarterfinals\n\nIt was a straightforward quarterfinal for Argentina after it beat Ecuador 3-0. Rodrigo De Paul scored the opener in the 40th minute. It stayed 1-0 for a long time after that, with the second goal coming only in the 84th minute with Lautaro Martinez. Messi provided the icing on the cake in the third minute of second-half added time, scoring Argentina's third.\n\nSemifinals\n\nArgentina faced Colombia in the semifinal. It was a nervy outing for Argentina, with the match]h finishing 1-1 at the end of 90 minutes, Messi and Diaz got on the scoresheet for their respective teams.\n\nWith the match going to penalties, Argentina found a hero in goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez, who made three saves - Davidson Sanchez, Yerry Mina and Edwin Bedoya's spot-kicks. On Argentina's end, Messi converted Albiceleste's first penalty. De Paul missed the next, but Leandro Paredes and Lautaro scored the next two.\n\nAfter Sanchez and Mina's miss, Bedoya had to score to keep the shootout going, but Martinez saved to take Argentina to the final.\n\nFinal\n\nThe final was perfectly poised, with arch-rival Argentina facing Brazil at the historic Maracana Stadium. The game began with a note of caution from both sides, but it was Argentina, which made the breakthrough after De Paul's aerial lob sent Di Maria clear on goal.\n\nOne-on-one with the keeper, Di Maria kept his calm to lob the ball over Brazil keeper Ederson for the opener.\n\nThe match did not have any more goals, with Messi coming close to scoring a second late in the match.\n\nArgentina held on and won its first major trophy in 28 years, and captain Messi won his first-ever major title in national colours.\n\nLatest on SportstarIndia vs Afghanistan LIVE Score, T20 World Cup 2024: IND 167/7 (19); India falters at death, loses three wicketsTeam SportstarEuro 2024: Why was there a moment of applause before the Denmark vs England match?Team SportstarT20 World Cup 2024 Fastest Fifties: Suryakumar Yadav slams fourth quickest half-century of tournament Team SportstarDenmark vs England, Euro 2024: Eriksen equals national record; Southgate names unchanged 11; Major talking points from DEN v ENGTeam SportstarBatter R.

But he'd do two or three things during the game that would win the game. That's what he is. He's just a special special person.\"\n\nPulis, however, isn't convinced that Messi is the greatest of all time.\n\n\"No I've spoken to people about this,\" he added. \"I'm a [19]50s baby so you know, I can remember Pele, [Diego] Maradona.\n\n\"Then I'd go Messi, [Cristiano] Ronaldo, they would be four standout and then you've got you know, again, it's great players of their time.\"\n\nRory Delap, another cult hero at the Britannia, has no doubts about Messi doing the business at Stoke.\n\n\"I don't think so, I don't think so. No, I think the thing you saw with the top players, we made it hard for teams but we never got a result,\" he told SPORTbible.\n\n\"Against United, they were the top team at the time. With Sir Alex Ferguson, he'd seen it all before with the Wimbledons and the teams of that era.\n\n\"He set the team up to go and win and I think they won every game when I was at Stoke so I think the top players don't let stuff like that affect them. Arsenal were a great side at that time, maybe it got to them a bit.\n\n\"Chelsea, we always struggled against Chelsea. They were the top three teams at that stage.

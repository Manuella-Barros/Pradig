Camila Cabello:I feel like this whole album is like signed C,XOXO because it\u2019s signed by me \u2014 from me to you. What\u2019s up, guys? I\u2019m Camila Cabello and welcome to my Billboard cover shoot. So we are at my Billboard cover shoot in East Hollywood. We\u2019ve got a little kiddie pool over here because we\u2019re really trying to like, bring Miami to East Hollywood. As you can see, I\u2019m wearing a little bikini here. Because you know, we\u2019re repping Miami on this album, or repping the Miami girls. We got some heat that decided to show up for us today. It is actually sauna level hot, fun fact. It\u2019s going to be really fun. There\u2019s a really cute little dog, and here we go. Erica Hernandez:What I\u2019m most excited to capture today with Camila is we\u2019re in grandma\u2019s house. And I\u2019m just really excited to lean into this vibe that she\u2019s created for herself and to capture her in her new moment. And I think it\u2019s going to be beautiful. Jared Ellner: Camila\u2019s rebrand connects to this shoot because we have lots of metallics, clear, she loves blue. Things that really feel sort of like mismatched, nothing that\u2019s like too coordinated. So we\u2019re pulling a lot from her vibe. Camila Cabello:I feel like this new era, everything for me starts with the music and starts with the songwriting. And I do my exploring to figure out, you know, what is like the voice for this album? Keep watching the video to learn more!", "summary": "Billboard cover star Camila Cabello talks about her upcoming album, C,XOXO, and how she\u2019s evolved her creative style to emulate her new era.

The forward will fall well short of the \u20ac117.5m Manchester City paid for Jack Grealish in 2021, but just ahead of Douglas Luiz's \u20ac51.5m move to Juventus this summer. Just 12 months after joining the club for what was a club record transfer fee at the time of \u20ac55m, Diaby is set to depart the Villa Park side having made 54 appearances in all competitions for Unai Emery's team and bagging 10 goals and nine assists.\n\nDespite being considered a consistent performer for Villa last season, Diaby is set to depart the club as a necessary sale to compensate for the club's high spending in the summer transfer window. To date, the English side have made 13 signings that have cost no less than \u20ac176m in transfer fees. That currently makes Villa the biggest spenders across all of Europe's top leagues, outspending the likes of Manchester United (\u20ac104.5m spent on transfer fees), Olympique Lyon (\u20ac134.3m) and even Bayern Munich (\u20ac145.4m). And considering the fact that Villa have only earned \u20ac67.4m in fees for players sold this summer, it certainly made a lot of sense for the club to seriously consider and then accept the substantial offer from Al-Ittihad.\n\nPlayed across the front line during his time in Birmingham, Diaby's departure could be seen as a considerable loss for Emery's side. However, Villa have done well to bring in other attacking options that should compensate for the Frenchman's sale. In this transfer window alone the club have signed Lewis Dobbin, Samuel Iling-Junior and former Villa youth academy player Jaden Philogene, who are all predominantly left wingers. Not to mention the return of Ross Barkley, who can play as a No.10 through the middle of the pitch. When coupled with the impressive form of Leon Bailey and the return of Emiliano Buend\u00eda from a long-term injury as options on the right wing, it's clear to see why Emery shouldn't go wanting for options in attack, despite Diaby's departure from the club.\n\nUpon completing his move to Al-Ittihad, Diaby will undoubtedly be heralded as the first major signing from a Saudi club in this summer's transfer window. After spending a remarkable \u20ac950.4m on new players in last summer's transfer window, the Saudi Pro League then rather surprisingly spent just \u20ac27.1m in the proceeding winter transfer window. The arrival of the Aston Villa star would undoubtedly make headlines, but it would also only raise the league's spending this summer to around \u20ac121m, putting the Middle Eastern competition just sixth among all top divisions for money spent on new signings.

To date, the English side have made 13 signings that have cost no less than \u20ac176m in transfer fees. That currently makes Villa the biggest spenders across all of Europe's top leagues, outspending the likes of Manchester United (\u20ac104.5m spent on transfer fees), Olympique Lyon (\u20ac134.3m) and even Bayern Munich (\u20ac145.4m). And considering the fact that Villa have only earned \u20ac67.4m in fees for players sold this summer, it certainly made a lot of sense for the club to seriously consider and then accept the substantial offer from Al-Ittihad.\n\nPlayed across the front line during his time in Birmingham, Diaby's departure could be seen as a considerable loss for Emery's side. However, Villa have done well to bring in other attacking options that should compensate for the Frenchman's sale. In this transfer window alone the club have signed Lewis Dobbin, Samuel Iling-Junior and former Villa youth academy player Jaden Philogene, who are all predominantly left wingers. Not to mention the return of Ross Barkley, who can play as a No.10 through the middle of the pitch. When coupled with the impressive form of Leon Bailey and the return of Emiliano Buend\u00eda from a long-term injury as options on the right wing, it's clear to see why Emery shouldn't go wanting for options in attack, despite Diaby's departure from the club.\n\nUpon completing his move to Al-Ittihad, Diaby will undoubtedly be heralded as the first major signing from a Saudi club in this summer's transfer window. After spending a remarkable \u20ac950.4m on new players in last summer's transfer window, the Saudi Pro League then rather surprisingly spent just \u20ac27.1m in the proceeding winter transfer window. The arrival of the Aston Villa star would undoubtedly make headlines, but it would also only raise the league's spending this summer to around \u20ac121m, putting the Middle Eastern competition just sixth among all top divisions for money spent on new signings. Whether Diaby is a sign of things to come before the window draws to a conclusion or ends up standing out as a notable outlier remains to be seen.", "source": {"uri": "transfermarkt.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "transfermarkt.co.uk"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moussa_Diaby", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Moussa Diaby"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Ittihad_Club_(Jeddah)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Al-Ittihad Club (Jeddah)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_(association_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Transfer (association football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_window", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Transfer window"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympique_Lyonnais", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Olympique Lyonnais"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FC_Bayern_Munich", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "FC Bayern Munich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aston_Villa_F.C.", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aston Villa F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manchester United F.C."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Iling-Junior", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Samuel Iling-Junior"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Youth system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Barkley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ross Barkley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Birmingham"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emiliano_Buend\u00eda", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emiliano Buend\u00eda"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Bailey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leon Bailey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Professional_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saudi Professional League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Midfielder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Signage", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Signage", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Freeware", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian_Rules", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Australian Rules", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Badminton/Clubs", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Badminton/Clubs", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads_and_Highways/Signs_and_Signals", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Roads and Highways/Signs and Signals", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://tmssl.akamaized.net/images/foto/big/moussa-diaby-aston-villla-2023-1693911123-115931.jpg?lm=1693911143", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9761118", "eventUri": "eng-9761118", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 211, "relevance": 1}

Instead of joining newly-promoted Ipswich, he opted to return to Villa, who are essentially paying around \u00a313m for him after the 30 per cent sell-on clause comes into play.\n\nDiaby becomes the sixth player to leave Villa permanently so far this summer. Douglas Luiz joined Juventus for \u00a342m, a move which put Villa in the clear regarding the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Regulations.\n\nOmari Kellyman also left for Chelsea in a deal worth \u00a319m, while Tim Iroegbunam joined Everton for up to \u00a313m. Sebastian Revan and Viljami Sinisalo have also left the club permanently.\n\nVilla have sold around \u00a3120m of talent so far this summer and have spent a similar amount after Amadou Onana completed his transfer from Everton. The Belgian signed a five-year contract to become the seventh addition after Lewis Dobbin, Ian Maatsen, Ross Barkley, Enzo Barrenechea, Samuel Iling-Junior and Philogene.\n\nWhat do you make of the deal?

after his arrival at the club.\n\nDiaby was tempted by a move to Saudi side Al Nassr last summer but ultimately opted to join Villa in a deal worth over \u00a350m, after which he struggled to showcase his best form on a consistent basis.\n\n90min confirmed last week that Diaby had once again received an approach from Saudi Arabia, this time from Al Ittihad, and had expressed an interest in heading to the Middle East 12 months after rejecting a switch.\n\nWhile Villa were reluctant to agree to a sale, Fabrizio Romano reports that a deal has been struck to take Diaby to Al Ittihad for a fee of around \u20ac60m (\u00a350.5m).\n\nA five-year deal, which includes a salary of almost \u20ac15m (\u00a312.6m), is currently in the process of being finalised.\n\nVilla were among the sides forced to do business before June 30 to avoid financial rule breaches, and they have once again been incredibly active in the summer transfer market ahead of their Champions League journey.\n\nIan Maatsen, Cameron Archer, Jaden Philogene, Samuel Iling Junior, Lewis Dobbin, Enzo Barrenechea and Ross Barkley have all joined Villa this summer for over \u00a3100m combined.\n\nHaving already seen Douglas Luiz, Tim Iroegbunam, Morgan Sanson and Viljami Sinisalo depart, Diaby's proposed \u00a350.5m move to Al Ittihad would go a long way towards helping Villa raise that money back in sales.\n\nShould his move go through, Diaby would join Fabinho, Luiz Felipe, Karim Benzema, Houssem Aouar, N'Golo Kante and Jota at Al Ittihad, who are also in talks to sign Manchester City goalkeeper Ederson.", "source":

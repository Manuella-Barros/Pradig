{"id": 225012810, "title": "VIDEO: Historic moment as \u00a3116m Levenmouth rail link opens", "text": "History has been made with the arrival of the first train into Leven in more than half a century. The milestone follows the completion of the \u00a3116 million Levenmouth rail link, which provides a direct train to and from Edinburgh every hour. First Minister John Swinney and transport secretary Fiona Hyslop joined overjoyed rail campaigners, community organisations and local politicians for the first trip from Waverley Station on Wednesday morning. However, members of the public will have to wait until Sunday to get their hands on tickets. The Scottish Government-funded railway includes two new stations at Leven and Cameron Bridge as well as six miles of double track. And it has been hailed as having the potential to transform lives and communities. Mr Swinney officially opened the line and unveiled a plaque at each station. He said: \u201cThis is a day of unbridled joy for the communities of Levenmouth and the Kingdom of Fife. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely delighted that after 50 years of this community being excluded from the rail network, we have resolved that today\u201d. He also paid tribute to members of Levenmouth rail campaign, who were instrumental in ensuring the railways return. \u2018Even better than old Leven train service\u2019 Among the 300 or so people on board the first train was Levenmouth councillor David Alexander, who was just a teenager when rail last serviced the area. And the Fife Council SNP leader declared new Levenmouth rail link \u201cmagnificent\u201d. Mr Alexander regularly travelled to Dunfermline by train to watch football in the \u201960s. He said: \u201cWhen the trains stopped, we had to get the bus and it took an hour and a half \u2013 more than double the time.\u201d Mr Alexander, 69, says the new facilities are far better than the original ones. \u201cThe problem with Cameron Bridge station back then was the stairs were enormous,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were no lifts so if you had a disability you couldn\u2019t get on the train. \u201cAnd trying to go on holiday with heavy bags was a nightmare. \u201cThankfully these days are gone.\u201d It was a poignant day for Labour councillor Colin Davidson, whose grandad Fred was killed while working on the Leven railway in the 1950s. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s an exciting day and one we\u2019ve been looking forward to but I can\u2019t help thinking about him today too.\u201d Levenmouth rail link includes \u00a310m of extra benefits The Scottish Government announced the return of rail to Levenmouth in August 2019. It marked a huge victory for a campaign which secured the backing of community groups and politicians of all parties. And it included a further \u00a310m of investment for things such as active travel routes and bus services to and from the stations. Supporters say the rail link opens up opportunities for education, leisure and employment for Levenmouth people. And it\u2019s predicted it will boost visitor numbers by making it easier to travel into the area. The original Leven railway closed to passenger trains in 1969. It remained open to freight only to serve Cameronbridge Distillery and Methil power station. But it closed completely when the power station was mothballed in 2001.", "summary": "Public passenger trains begin running on the new line this Sunday.", "url": "https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/news/fife/4994037/levenmouth-rail-link-opens/", "image": "https://www.thecourier.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2024/05/KSmi_Leven_New-Rail-Link-7_58085350-2ncgjdmrb-scaled.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:22:15", "author": "Claire Warrender", "authors": ["Claire Warrender"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.153}

These accolades celebrate their outstanding contributions to raising awareness about climate change. Reji Varghese and Parvathi Nayar Honored with TRUMPF India and Wolters Kluwer Environment Awards On April 13th 2024, their collaborative piece titled \u201cOcean\u2019s Breath\u201d was inaugurated as part of the permanent \u201cThe Living Ocean\u201d exhibition at Dakshinachitra Museum, Chennai. The installation, which beautifully captures the essence of the ocean and the microscopic diatoms that inhabit it, underscores the critical role these organisms play in producing around 40 percent of the oxygen in our atmosphere. This piece aims to emphasize the urgent need to protect our oceans amidst the growing threat of climate change. Parvathi Nayar, a multidisciplinary visual artist, was recognized not only for her curation of \u201cThe Living Ocean\u201d exhibition but also for her conceptualization and direction of the film \u201cSeaspeaker.\u201d Her consistent creative endeavors have significantly contributed to environmental advocacy, making her a worthy recipient of this honor. In addition to Forms & Gears and Parvathi Nayar, awards were presented to S. Palayam for his extensive work in recording ocean data, Dakshinachitra Art Museum for producing the enlightening \u201cLiving Ocean\u201d exhibition, and Shoba Menon for her two decades of dedication to urban greening and biodiversity regeneration. Pradeep Patil, Managing Director of TRUMPF India, remarked, \u201cAs a family business, we prioritize long-term sustainability and are committed to our responsibilities. Our climate strategy spans our entire value chain, from sites to products and the supply chain. We are developing increasingly energy-efficient products that produce minimal waste, aligning with the 1.5-degree reduction pathway of the Paris Climate Agreement. This World Environment Day, we are thrilled to acknowledge the efforts of these individuals who are dedicated to climate action and environmental preservation.\u201d Wolters Kluwer also hosted an event at their premises to felicitate the awardees.

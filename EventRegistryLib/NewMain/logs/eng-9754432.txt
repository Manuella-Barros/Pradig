He said renting was paying off someone else's loan and that the amount of money spent annually on rent could sometimes be more than home loan repayments\n\nThe tough rental conditions appear to be encouraging cashed-up renters to buy their own homes, PropTrack economic research director Cameron Kusher said.\n\nFirst-home buyer loans over the year to May jumped by 6.2 per cent while investor loans grew by 7.9 per cent.\n\n'Increased lending activity to first-home buyers has seen renters with the means exiting the market to purchase, while increased lending to investors will also likely alleviate some rental pressures,' Mr Kusher said.\n\nSydney fared the worst during the June quarter as renters faced the lowest supply of available properties for the month in more than a decade, with new rental listings declining by 2.8 per cent and total rentals down by 4.8 per cent.\n\nDespite recording an increase in vacancy rates to 1.7 per cent, median advertised rents in the harbour city rose by $60 to top the nation at $740 a week.\n\nIt was not much better for NSW's regional renters with listings contracting by 19 per cent over the year, resulting in tougher competition between prospective renters.\n\nMelbourne's rental supply remained tight in June as 16.8 per cent fewer new listings hit the market over the year, but total listings remained relatively stagnant.\n\nThe rental vacancy rate grew by 0.34 per cent over the quarter to reach a 12-month high of 1.5 per cent but that also signalled a rise in median rents to $575 a week, a $55 increase from a year

renters are still likely to downsize - realestate.com.au", "body": "Renters can expect to see a slowdown in rental growth over the coming months, but the persistent shortage of homes available to rent will keep the pressure on tenants.\n\nNational rents remained flat at $600 per week over the three months to June, according to the latest PropTrack Rental Report.\n\nHowever, national rents have increased by $50 per week or 9.1% since June last year in what has been a significant hit to the hip pocket of many renters.\n\nPropTrack director of economic research Cameron Kusher said rental price growth had slowed over the past year, although it still exceeded both the rate of inflation and household income growth.\n\n\"Weakening rental growth likely reflects the trade-offs that renters are making due to the heightened cost of rent and living,\" Mr Kusher said.\n\n\"Some of these trade-offs may include renting smaller properties, renting in less desirable locations where rental costs are cheaper or sharing rental accommodation with other tenants.\"\n\nTenants' Union of NSW chief executive Officer Leo Patterson Ross said high rents had put real pressure on people's ability to meet their other needs, including food and healthcare.\n\n\"We continue to hear from people who are struggling to meet those needs because of high rents and an uncertain future,\" Mr Patterson Ross said.\n\n\"This is true both for people trying to find a new home facing thousands of dollars more a year and for people who already have a home and are worried about their ability to keep it in the face of no grounds evictions and soaring rents.\"\n\nWhile conditions remain challenging, there are some signs that finding an available home to rent may be getting slightly easier as well.\n\nNew rental listings were 2.5% higher during the June quarter, compared to the previous quarter, and 2.8% higher than the same period last year.\n\nTotal rental listings grew by 10.7% throughout the June quarter, however total listings were still 4.4% lower when compared to the same period last year.\n\nCritically, the national rental vacancy rate rose to 1.4% in the June quarter, up from 1.1% in the March quarter.\n\nHowever, the national vacancy rate remained much lower than the pre-pandemic era, when the rate hovered around 2.5%.\n\nOther factors such as renter enquiries and the amount of time that a rental home spent on the market also pointed to a slight improvement for tenants.\n\nThe number of enquiries per listing fell below the levels recorded in the previous quarter and the same time last year, while the median number of days that a rental property spent on realestate.com.au was 21 days in June, up from 18 days in the previous quarter.\n\nDespite these small wins, meaningful improvements for renters won't come unless Australia builds more homes quickly.\n\nGreater consideration towards the financing of new housing projects and Australia's home building capacity was needed to improve housing supply, according to PropTrack.\n\nBut the latest housing completions data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed new home supply in the first quarter of the year was well below the levels needed to house the country's growing population.\n\n\"The supply of homes available for renters still consistently trails the demand for rentals, with this imbalance being persistently exacerbated by limited new housing construction and a heightened number of investors exiting the market in recent years with the rebound in investor purchasing only being witnessed over the past year,\" Mr Kusher said.\n\n\"While rental growth is expected to slow, we anticipate that it will continue to outpace the rate of inflation, with rental prices unlikely to stabilise in the short or medium term.\"", "source": {"uri": "realestate.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Real Estate Australia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renting",

He said renting was paying off someone else's loan and that the amount of money spent annually on rent could sometimes be more than home loan repayments\n\nThe tough rental conditions appear to be encouraging cashed-up renters to buy their own homes, PropTrack economic research director Cameron Kusher said.\n\nFirst-home buyer loans over the year to May jumped by 6.2 per cent while investor loans grew by 7.9 per cent.\n\n'Increased lending activity to first-home buyers has seen renters with the means exiting the market to purchase, while increased lending to investors will also likely alleviate some rental pressures,' Mr Kusher said.\n\nSydney fared the worst during the June quarter as renters faced the lowest supply of available properties for the month in more than a decade, with new rental listings declining by 2.8 per cent and total rentals down by 4.8 per cent.\n\nDespite recording an increase in vacancy rates to 1.7 per cent, median advertised rents in the harbour city rose by $60 to top the nation at $740 a week.\n\nIt was not much better for NSW's regional renters with listings contracting by 19 per cent over the year, resulting in tougher competition between prospective renters.\n\nMelbourne's rental supply remained tight in June as 16.8 per cent fewer new listings hit the market over the year, but total listings remained relatively stagnant.\n\nThe rental vacancy rate grew by 0.34 per cent over the quarter to reach a 12-month high of 1.5 per cent but that also signalled a rise in median rents to $575 a week, a $55 increase from a year prior.\n\nWhile rentals in regional Victoria tightened and new and total listings declined, prices remained unchanged at $450 a week.\n\nBrisbane renters faced a sunnier outlook as market conditions eased over the June quarter, bringing with it a growing rental supply and listings while competition eased.\n\nVacancy rates rose to 1.2 per cent over the quarter and median rents for both Brisbane and regional Queensland sat at $620 per week.\n\nAdelaide and Perth experienced an increase in rental supplies and also increases to their asking rents as conditions eased across both markets.\n\nThe median rent for Adelaide in the June quarter rose to $570 while Perth had an advertised median rent of $650.\n\nRental asking prices in the nation's capital remained stagnant at $600 over the year to June despite tighter supply and growing demand.\n\nWhile rental growth continues to slow, Mr Kusher anticipates it to continue outpacing the inflation rate as prices are unlikely to stabilise in the short and medium term.\n\n'Weakening rental growth likely reflects the trade-offs that renters are making due to the heightened cost of rent and living,' he said.\n\n'Some of these trade-offs may include renting smaller properties, renting in less desirable locations where rental costs are cheaper or sharing rental accommodation with other tenants.'\n\nResearch showed renters were choosing to

They're looking at share housing and other things. If they've got family nearby, maybe they're moving back in with their family,\" Mr Kusher said.\n\n\"I just don't think that people have the capacity to pay some of the rent anymore, and that's why we're seeing the rental growth slow.\"\n\nPerth's median rental price increased the most of all capital cities in the past 12 months, rising by 18.2 per cent, followed by Adelaide at 11.8 per cent and Melbourne at 10.6 per cent.\n\nAnd within each capital city, Mr Kusher said that the biggest rental growth was in areas further away from their city centres, where there was increasing competition for homes.\n\n\"People can't afford the rent where they prefer to live, so they're sacrificing on location to get that cheaper price,\" he said.\n\nMelbourne's outer east had the lowest vacancy rate of just 0.65 per cent, while the city's inner suburbs had 1.85 per cent of rentals available in June.\n\nHe added there'd been a pick-up in regional rental markets as well, speculating that there was a second wave of tenants opting to move out of the city occurring.\n\n\"If we go back 12 months ago, it was an $80 gap between regional and capital city prices. It's now a $100 gap,\" he said.\n\nThe median weekly rental cost in regional Australia rose by $40 in the 12 months to June from $500 a week to $540 a week.\n\nAcross the nation's capital cities, it increased by $60 a week from $580 to $640.\n\nBetter Renting executive director Joel Dignam said tenants were forced to do what they could to reduce their rental costs.\n\n\"For some people, they can no longer afford to live where they used to live and so they do get pushed further out and they can end up finding a place that's a bit cheaper,\" Mr Dignam said.\n\n\"Often it's actually just what they were paying before, but further out and a worse property.\"\n\nReal Estate Institute of Australia president Leanne Pilkington said there was a fundamental lack of supply driving rental availability and affordability with the national vacancy rate still well below a healthy indicator of 3 per cent.\n\n\"Unless supply catches up with demand it is unlikely there will be any ease to the current conditions for renters,\" Ms Pilkington said.\n\n\"Governments must get to work on the National Housing Accord to deliver relief now.\"\n\nThe national rental vacancy rate in June sat at 1.4 per cent.\n\nSign up to the Herald Sun Weekly Real Estate Update.

While the overall balance between supply and while demand has continued to improve during the second quarter of this year, the latest snapshot of the rental market highlights how busy it remains compared to more normal levels seen pre-pandemic.

Any new legislation designed to protect the rights of tenants must therefore be careful that it doesn't come with a high price tag.\"\n\nData from estate agency brand Hamptons suggests that rather than leaving the sector, landlords aren't adding to their portfolios.\n\nIts research suggests landlords purchased 10% of all homes sold across Great Britain during the first half of this year, the lowest share since 2010.\n\n\"Rather than a mass landlord sell-off, the lack of homes available to rent has been caused by fewer investors entering the market,\" says Aneisha Beveridge, head of research at Hamptons.\n\n\"Tax and regulatory changes introduced since 2016 have been the main culprit, but these disincentives to invest have been compounded more recently by higher interest rates and political uncertainty around the threat of more rental reform.\"\n\nRightmove data shows that despite overall rental supply slowly improving from last year, rising 14%, the number of rental properties available is still 20% below pre-pandemic levels.\n\nThe property website suggests around 120,000 more rental properties are needed to bring rental price growth back towards more normal pre-pandemic levels but support is needed for landlords.\n\n\"There is an opportunity to encourage landlords to continue to invest in good quality homes, for example through tax changes, incentives to help with energy-efficient upgrades or a general sentiment change in government towards working alongside and with landlords,\" adds Bannister.\n\n\"Landlords have previously told us that the government's perception of landlords is one of their main concerns about the sector.

In Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, prices have shot up by 30.4 per cent in the last year.\n\nMeanwhile in Blackburn, Lancashire, the average asking rent has climbed by 18.1 per cent while Batley in West Yorkshire has seen prices increase by 17.1 per cent.\n\nLeeds, Corby, Clacton-On-Sea, Preston, Wellingborough, Widnes and Lichfield are also among the areas where rents have increased the most in the last year.\n\nSeparate research by Citizens Advice exclusive to found that 52 per cent of private renters have faced a rent hike in the last year.\n\nOn average rents increased by \u00a350 a month, but one in five renters said they had been asked to pay \u00a3100 more. Some 11 per cent of renters said they were being asked to find more than \u00a3200 extra every month.\n\n'I was worried I wouldn't be able to feed my children'\n\nOver the last year, Citizens Advice said it has seen a 107 per cent increase in private renters asking for help with rent increases.\n\nOne of those who has gone to the organisation for help is mother-of-three Hayley (not her real name) who has been in emergency accommodation for eight weeks with her partner and young children after they were turfed out of their home.\n\nHayley and her family were served a Section 21 \"no-fault\" eviction notice after they complained to their local environmental health team about dangerous mould in the property.\n\nThe 25-year-old had been scared about the impact that living in a cold, damp and mouldy home would have on her children's health and had repeatedly raised her concerns to the letting agent.\n\n\"There were thick, massive black circles of [mould] on the bedroom ceilings and walls. It caused my children to get eczema and other skin issues - whenever the mould flared up on their bedroom walls, their skin would flare up too. They'd cough and cough throughout the night,\" she said.\n\nHayley said the family was \"totally ignored\" whenever they tried to contact the estate agent, and the problems went unfixed.\n\nDespite the lack of improvements to the property, she would receive a letter each year telling her the rent was increasing.\n\nShe told that she would simply accept the rent increases because she was \"anxious and nervous that if we said 'no', we were going to get evicted\".\n\nWhen the family were evicted, they struggled to find anywhere else they could afford - especially as they did not have a guarantor who could be added to a rental agreement.\n\n\"Nobody will work with you. Nobody will make any compromise,\" Hayley said.\n\nRental properties in her area are upwards of \u00a31,300 a month for the size the family needs, and at that price Hayley says she wouldn't be able to feed her children and would have to rely on food banks.\n\nShe has been left in a \"massive state of anxiety\" and remains in the emergency accommodation with her children aged one, three and five years old.\n\nDemand still too high\n\nOne of the problems compounding the rental crisis is the lack of properties available.\n\nRightmove said the number of enquiries each property is receiving from would-be tenants is now 17.\n\nThis is down from an average of 26 at this time last year, but it is still more than double pre-pandemic levels and means there are still a large number of tenants competing for each property.\n\nIndustry insiders reported an explosion in demand and a huge increase in rental prices between 2021 and 2022, with the effects still being felt now despite things beginning to level out.\n\nRightmove said the slowing down of enquiries is driven by more rental properties becoming available and fewer tenants looking to move.\n\nThe number of available properties is currently 14 per cent higher than this time last year, while tenant demand is down 16 per cent.\n\nLucy Beasley, lettings manager at Jones Robinson in Newbury, said: \"Recently, we have observed an increase in available properties coming to market, but we haven't noticed much of a reduction in demand from tenants which remains robust.\n\n\"Rents are still high for many, and we have noticed that larger properties sometimes need to reduce their prices to secure tenants.\n\n\"While rents are showing a slight decrease this year, they are still above where they were two years ago, with many tenants facing an affordability blocker when looking for homes to rent.\"\n\n'Government needs to do more'\n\nRental campaigners and estate agents are now calling on the Government to go further to make renting more affordable.\n\nIt was revealed in the King's Speech last week that a Renters' Rights Bill will come into force providing enhanced protections for tenants, including through banning no-fault evictions and allowing renters to challenge rent increases.\n\nThe Government also set out measures to start a building boom by shaking up planning rules - something that is hoped will increase housing supply.\n\nRightmove's director of property science Tim Bannister said more changes need to be implemented, including encouraging landlords to invest in good quality homes through tax changes and incentives to help with energy-efficient upgrades.\n\n\"We need landlord investment to increase stock and help achieve a healthier supply and demand balance in the market,\" he said.\n\n\"Support for both tenants and landlords will be key to achieving long-term stability in the rental market.\"", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "inews.co.uk"},

Some have quit the market and sold their properties, many of which have gone to home owners, and others who may have become landlords in the past have decided not to due to higher taxes and regulations in recent years.\n\nTim Bannister, a property expert at Rightmove, thinks that unless landlords are incentivised, rents will continue to rise and tenants will continue to compete with dozens of others over every available property.\n\n'With 17 enquiries for every available rental property, the market remains out of balance and difficult for tenants,' said Bannister.\n\n'There is an opportunity to encourage landlords to continue to invest in good quality homes, for example through tax changes, incentives to help with energy-efficient upgrades or a general sentiment change in Government towards working alongside and with landlords.'\n\nA recent Rightmove study showed that around 120,000 more rental properties are needed to bring rental price growth back towards more normal pre-pandemic levels of around 2 per cent, based on current demand.\n\nHow to rent the home you want\n\nIf the average renter is competing against 17 other applicants, it's vital to do everything possible to make themselves stand out from the crowd.\n\nBuilding relationships with letting agents or offering to pay more are the obvious tactics, but there are a number of other things renters can do to show they are an attractive prospect for a landlord.\n\nMarc Von Grundherr, director at Benhams & Reeves estate agents, says that having references and paperwork ready to go or asking for a longer tenancy could win a landlord over\n\nHaving references and paperwork ready to go is one way they can stand out from the competition, according to Marc Von Grundherr of estate agent Benham and Reeves.\n\n'When you view a rental property and decide you want it, you'll have to act quickly if you're going to secure it,' said Von Grundherr.\n\n'This means you should collect references and proof of income before you start your search.\n\n'Also be very clear about when you can move in, how much notice you need to give on your current property, and so on.\n\n'If you can impress the agent and landlord with your preparedness and reliability, you'll become a preferred tenant, jumping right to the front of the queue.'\n\nProving they are financially able and ready right from the outset is also important, according to Von Grundherr.\n\n'If you have your deposit and first month's rent ready and waiting to go as soon as you view a property you like, you'll be ten steps ahead of most renters,' he says.\n\n'This, combined with the aforementioned proof of income and reliable payments will tell your new landlord you can be trusted.'\n\nHow much can you afford?\n\nFind out how much you can afford to borrow for a monthly payment amount with This is Money's mortgage affordability calculator.\n\nAdding a personal touch to applications can also tip the landlord in a tenant's favour.\n\n'It's good to add a personal touch to your applications,' says Von Grundherr.\n\n'Nobody wants to read an essay about your life, but if you can offer a small glimpse into yourself, such as your interests and a little about why you're moving to the area, it can help create a sense of personality which will make you stand out from the other faceless applications.'\n\nWhen it comes to offering in a hot market where rents are on the rise, beginning with a low offer or attempting to negotiate down isn't advisable either.\n\n'There will always be a tenant willing to pay the advertised price. Instead, set yourself a realistic budget and don't stretch yourself,' adds Von Grundherr.\n\n'If an agent is struggling to find a tenant, leave it to them to reduce the price and offer it to you. It never works the other way around.'\n\n> When will interest rates fall?\n\nBe flexible: Renters who are happy to be more flexible on when the tenancy starts or who are willing to sign up to a longer contract or remove break clauses may be more appealing\n\nLandlords may also be more partial to a renter who is prepared to take a longer tenancy than the standard one year, or who is prepared to remove the break clause which is usually at six months.\n\n'Many landlords are looking for reliability and certainty in their properties. So if you can commit yourself to two years instead of one, for example, it can be very attractive,' says Von Grundherr.\n\n'This is especially useful if competing tenants are able to offer a higher rent and you can't.\n\n'A landlord will often choose two years of certainty for the original asking price over just one year at a slightly higher price.\n\nHe adds: 'In agreeing to a fixed term without a break clause, you're demonstrating a greater commitment to the rental property which will give the landlord an added level of certainty and security and help you stand out from other applicants.'\n\nThe same could be said for renters who are more flexible about the start date or willing to agree to a summer end date.\n\n'By agreeing to end the tenancy during the summer months, between June and September, you will also make yourself more attractive as a tenant.\n\n'This is because the summer months are the best time for a landlord to try and re-let a rental property as demand is often at its highest.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rightmove", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rightmove"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landlord", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Landlord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letting_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Letting agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estate_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Estate agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leasehold_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leasehold estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/07/22/18/87632845-0-image-m-33_1721667726842.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9754432", "eventUri": "eng-9754432", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-07-", "textStart": 406, "textEnd": 415}], "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

However, this is down from the five-year median to June 2024 of 25 days, reflecting current tight rental conditions.\n\n* Enquiries per listing eased as properties nationally received 21.8 enquiries on average in June, down from 28.9 enquiries in March 2024 and 22.9 enquiries in June 2023.\n\n* Rental yields were unchanged over the quarter at 4.4% in June, however grew slightly from 4.1% the year prior.\n\n* Tough rental conditions appear to be encouraging renters to purchase, as first home buyer loans over the year to May 2024 grew 6.2% and the number of loans to investors increased by 7.9% annually.\n\n* Over the year to June 2024, capital city rent growth (+10.3%) outpaced that of regional markets (+8%), with weekly rents costing $640 across the combined capitals and $540 in the regions.\n\n* Nationally, houses maintained a significantly lower rental vacancy rate (1.1%) compared to units (2.1%) in June.\n\n* Regional markets saw a larger annual drop in total rental listings in June, down 12.5%, compared to capital cities decreasing by 1.7%. Total listings for regional markets sat 35.8% below the decade average to June 2022, while capitals were 24.2% lower.\n\n* The relative rental affordability of regional markets saw enquiries per listing up 21.4% year-on-year in June to reach 16.9, while the combined capitals fell 10.8% to 23.6 enquiries per listing.\n\nThe GI chart below is a measure of Sydney house prices, rents, wages and inflation where 100 = September 2003.\n\n*Prices, rents and inflation are for Sydney only, whereas wages are for all of NSW.\n\n**Wages are measured via the Wage Price Index, which abstracts from the quality and quantity of work, so may understate growth in household labour income over time.\n\nThere's a growing class divide in Australia, according to fresh joint research out of UNSW and UTS and our lack of affordable housing is at its heart.\n\nIf the trend continues like it is in Sydney, then buying a home is going to remain out of reach for much of the population until at least the 2030s.\n\nThat's according to a new study from the University of New South Wales (UNSW) and University of Technology Sydney (UTS) which looks at the relationship between housing affordability and employment contracts.\n\nIt found that not only is the rising proportion of part-time workers completely priced out of the city's property market, but full-time earners are facing increasing financial challenges standing in the way of home ownership.\n\nIn a recent quarterly essay, the economist, journalist and all-round effort-maker Alan Kohler write ominously about the kind of Australia this divide is likely to leave us with.\n\n\"More and more people, particularly young families, will have to get their heads around the idea that they will never own a house and will rent all their lives.\"\n\nAnd the effective loss of property acquisition as an access point to financial security has serious social and economic implications for this country, according to Kohler.\n\n\"As a society, we may not be able to do that anymore.\"\n\nCracking economist and Aussie thinker, University of New South Wales Prof Richard Holden says the various local attempts to tackle housing affordability have generally focused on supply-side efforts, such as reforms to zoning restrictions and medium-density rules, and policies aimed at curbing demand through tax reform.\n\nPolitical missteps on demand-side measures mean that current engagement focuses primarily on shoring up supply.\n\n\"It's unlikely Australia can densify its cities to the extent needed to solve the issue from the supply side only, thanks in part to political challenges around changing zoning laws.\"\n\nAnd then there's immigration which Kohler says is having an outsized impact.\n\nWhile immigration has hiot record levels these last few years, the rate of new people to new houses also outstripped housing supply for the decade between 2005 and 2015.\n\nKohler argues it was actually that decade where we lost the plot on property ownership.\n\n\"The period when housing in Australia became unaffordable.\"\n\nAs a result of these distortions, the ratio of house prices to annual income has exploded; prices are now at eight times income, compared with four times income in 1999. That translates to a median house price in Sydney, for example, of more than $1 million, when it should be $500,000.\n\nHousing approvals per capita are at all-time lows not just in Australia but in advanced economies generally, as surging immigration continues to be a global challenge.\n\nAccording to Kohler, the policy goal must be to return to our pre-2000 price-to-income ratio , which was at a far more doable and sustainable level of 4x income.", "source": {"uri": "stockhead.com.au", "dataType": "news", "title": "Stockhead"}, "authors": [{"uri": "christian_edwards@stockhead.com.au", "name": "Christian Edwards", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CoreLogic", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CoreLogic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renting", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Renting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inflation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grattan_Institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grattan Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_(architecture)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capital (architecture)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_bowling", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fast bowling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Technology_Sydney", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Technology Sydney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_New_South_Wales", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of New South Wales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordable_housing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Affordable housing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Holden_(British_politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Richard Holden (British politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kohler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alan Kohler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply-side_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supply-side economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real estate economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zoning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demand", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Demand"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Developed country"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New South Wales"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New South Wales"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://stockhead.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1161719766.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9754432", "eventUri": "eng-9754432", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2003-09-", "textStart": 5043, "textEnd": 5057}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 162, "relevance": 1}

Becoming a successful landlord takes the perfect mix of common sense, industry knowledge and resourcefulness.\n\nDeciding whether to rent or sell your property is a significant decision, especially if you didn't initially buy to rent. A great way to decide is to crunch the numbers -- a financial comparison of renting versus selling your property might be the answer you're looking for.\n\nA rent vs. sell calculator can factor in the value of your property, the price you paid for it, your mortgage, appreciation rate and other important factors that will help you compare renting vs. selling your property.\n\nFamiliarizing yourself with the Fair Housing Act is a great place to start. This federal act protects potential tenants from discrimination based on a set of protected classes, including race, religion, sex, national origin, familial status or disability.\n\nThe laws will be different depending on your geographical location, but here are some avenues to keep in mind.\n\n* Lease Agreements: Brush up on the ins and outs of lease agreements to ensure that you and your tenants are adequately protected.\n\n* Zoning Laws: Not all areas may allow you to rent your property. Reach out to the zoning board in your area to learn if your neighborhood allows rental units.\n\n* HOA Regulations: If you're a part of a homeowners association (HOA), consult rental property regulations. Some HOAs limit the number of rental properties allowed, how long a lease can be or even the rent you can charge.\n\n* Permits And Taxes: Depending on where you live, the local government may require licenses, permits and inspections before you can welcome tenants. You'll also need to consider how rental income may affect your taxes, as you must include it on your tax return and pay taxes on it.\n\nBefore you start looking for a tenant, it's essential that your property is in rentable condition. If you've lived in your home until you rent it, you might think that automatically qualifies it as \"rent-ready.\" But you might be surprised.\n\nHere are seven things you should do to get your home rent-ready.\n\n1. Complete all property upgrades and repairs. That squeaky door or loose cabinet? Now's the time to fix those types of problems.\n\n2. Inspect your property for mold. Mold has a habit of hiding, so have your property professionally inspected before tenants move in.\n\n3. Check that all appliances are in working order. All appliances should be functioning properly, from the microwave to the washer and dryer.\n\n4. Inspect and service your HVAC system. When you already have tenants, it isn't easy to schedule repairs. Get ahead of any potential problems by having an inspection completed beforehand.\n\n5. Re-paint the property. Painting your property is a great way to give it a fresh look and a clean slate for new potential tenants to envision their lives there.\n\n6. Deep clean and deodorize the property. Your rental property should be thoroughly cleaned from top to bottom.\n\n7. Re-key the property or replace the locks. This will give new tenants peace of mind that no one can access their new home.\n\nFor first-time landlords, setting your monthly rent price can be tricky. You don't want to overprice or underprice your rental -- you need a competitive rate that attracts tenants but isn't so expensive you're left with costly vacancies.\n\nSpend some time looking at the rental market in your area to get an idea of what comparable properties are listed for. When you're looking, search for properties similar to yours in size, amenities, features and location. Also, look at the time of year the property was rented -- in my experience, you can get up to 10% more during the summer months based on location.\n\nIt's also a good idea to act like a consumer. Look for a property that matches yours. See what is out there from a consumer standpoint, and then see how your pricing holds up to comparable properties.\n\nIf you're still struggling to set your rent, using an online rent calculator is a great place to start.\n\nThe odds are that you had insurance to protect your property. But when you rent it out to tenants, insurance might no longer be enough to cover your needs.\n\nLandlord or rental property insurance can provide more liability and property damage coverage. It can even offer coverage for loss of rental income when a property is damaged due to a covered event.\n\nBecause of the current insurance crisis, insurance premiums have skyrocketed. Having an understanding of how much your rental property insurance will cost and building those costs into your rent is important to maintain an income from your property.\n\nYou'll also want to consider requiring tenants to purchase their own renter's insurance as an added layer of protection. This helps ensure that if something does go wrong, they have the proper coverage in place for their property.\n\nHere are six components of an excellent tenant screening process.\n\n1. Pre-Screening: To ensure people meet your basic requirements.\n\n2. Credit Checks: To understand how they previously managed their money and credit.\n\n6.

The figures come months after housing charity Shelter's chief executive Polly Neate said private renting had \"reached boiling point\".\n\nMs Neate said this meant landlords were free to \"hike up the rent, safe in the knowledge that if their tenants can't pay, they can issue a no-fault eviction with just two months' notice and get a new tenant at a higher rent\".", "source": {"uri": "birminghammail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Birmingham Mail"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_rodger@birminghammail.co.uk", "name": "James Rodger", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rightmove", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rightmove"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "England"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "London"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "London"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owner-occupancy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Owner-occupancy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skipton_Building_Society", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Skipton Building Society"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HM_Revenue_and_Customs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "HM Revenue and Customs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landlord", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Landlord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Chancellor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lord Chancellor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelter_(charity)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shelter (charity)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockout_(industry)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lockout (industry)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Fiscal_Studies", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Institute for Fiscal Studies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Renting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charitable organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eviction", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eviction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage_loan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mortgage loan"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Philanthropy", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Philanthropy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://i2-prod.birminghammail.co.uk/news/cost-of-living/article29592612.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_rent.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9754432", "eventUri": "eng-9754432", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

It said rents had risen 10% over the past year and the supply of rental properties had gone down by one third.\n\nBroadcaster NOS said earlier this month that big institutional investors like Vesteda and Bouwinvest are not selling off property and that they expect little impact from the new rent rules.\n\nHowever, earlier research by NVM statistics unit Brainbaby showed that the size of rental properties is increasing, which indicates smaller apartments, which do now fall under rent controls, are more likely to be sold off.\n\nTenants rights\n\nMeanwhile, tenants' rights group Stichting Woon has warned that single rooms are still being offered for rents which break the new controls introduced on July 1.\n\nLocal councils will not start checking up on landlords until the new year, by which time all landlords will have to tell tenants how many points a room has - which in turn determines the rent.\n\nStichting Woon's Gert Jan Bakker is recommending that people still sign the lease on single rooms in shared property, even if they suspect the rent is too high.\n\n\"Rent the room, report it to the rent tribunal the same day, wait a couple of months and then the tribunal will probably say the rent should be around \u20ac300,\" he said on social media.", "source": {"uri": "dutchnews.nl", "dataType": "news", "title": "DutchNews.nl"}, "authors": [{"uri": "robin_pascoe@dutchnews.nl", "name": "Robin Pascoe", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landlord", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Landlord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate_economics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Real estate economics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Netherlands"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent_regulation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rent regulation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leasehold_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leasehold estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estate_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Estate agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lobbying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_music", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video game music"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nederlandse_Omroep_Stichting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nederlandse Omroep Stichting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renting", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Renting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribunal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tribunal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_investor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Institutional investor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apartment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Residential", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Residential", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Car_Rentals", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Car Rentals", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Apartment_Living", "label": "dmoz/Home/Apartment Living", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Instruments_and_Supplies/Lab_Space_or_Instruments_for_Lease_or_Rent", "label": "dmoz/Science/Instruments and Supplies/Lab Space or Instruments for Lease or Rent", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://www.dutchnews.nl/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_60931-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9754432", "eventUri": "eng-9754432", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 1895, "textEnd": 1901}], "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 137, "relevance": 1}

New figures from property website Rightmove that showed advertised rents hit a record \u00a31,314 during the second quarter of 2024.\n\nRightmove's director of property science Tim Bannister said: \"With 17 inquiries for every available rental property, the market remains out of balance and difficult for tenants. We need landlord investment to increase stock and help achieve a healthier supply and demand balance in the market.\n\n\"Support for both tenants and landlords will be key to achieving long-term stability in the rental market.\" The figure was up 6.8% annually and rose 1.8% on a quarterly basis.\n\nREAD MORE HMRC checking social media pictures to see if they 'tally' with how much tax you pay\n\nLondon rents have also risen to a new record of \u00a32,661, according to Rightmove, 4% higher than last year. The number of enquiries each property is receiving from would-be tenants is now 17 which, while down from 26 in 2023, is more than double the eight at this time in 2019, Rightmove said.\n\nDiscretionary housing payment - \u00a3634\n\nDiscretionary Housing Payment (DHP) can include one-off payments to cover short term rental costs, be put towards a rent deposit on a new property or even rent in advance. In total last year 175,000 households in the UK received a slice of he \u00a3100million available as part of the scheme - making the national average payout \u00a3634.\n\nThe exact amount you get depends on where you live.\n\nWelfare Assistance Schemes - \u00a31,000\n\nYour local council may be able to help you get hold of items of furniture - as well as helping with other issues, such as debt advice, food and fuel poverty. They do this through what are known as their local welfare assistance schemes (LWASs), also known as local welfare provision (LWP) or crisis support.\n\nNot all councils have these schemes, and some do not provide help with furniture and white goods. If they do help with furniture, most provide it for free, while others will only offer you a loan to get the items yourself. You can usually only apply a limited number of times within a given period.\n\nSome areas offer up to \u00a31,000 whereas some councils do not have any scheme in place at all.\n\nHousehold Support Fund - \u00a3300\n\nThe Household Support Fund is a government fund that offers eligible households support with fuel, food and other essentials. It will run until 30th September 2024. Residents in Walsall can get up to \u00a3300 in cash paid directly to their bank accounts to help with living costs.\n\nIf you do not fall into any of the eligible groups, you can still apply for support to the Liverpool Citizens Support Scheme for assistance which has been partly funded by the Household Support Fund or visit the government's cost of living hub for other help available.\n\nBenefits\n\nCitizens Advice explains: \"You might be able to get extra money to help you pay your rent. Lots of people miss out on benefits they're entitled to - so it's worth checking what you can get. You might be able to get Universal Credit for housing costs if all the following apply: you're on a low income - this will depend on your circumstances, you have savings below \u00a316,000, you rent a home or you live in the UK.\"\n\nIn some situations you'll have to claim Housing Benefit instead of Universal Credit.\n\nReach out\n\nIt is always worth contacting your provider to see if there is anything they can do to help you. Citizens Advice says: \"You should speak to your landlord or letting agency and tell them if you can't pay your rent. They don't have to help, but they might give you extra time to pay or reduce your payments. There's a risk that your landlord or letting agency might try to evict you, even if you haven't missed any payments yet. If you're worried that you might get evicted, talk to an adviser.\"\n\nCharities\n\nEntitledto's free calculator works out whether you qualify for various benefits, tax credits and Universal Credit.

A year ago, the average monthly advertised rent across Britain, excluding London, was \u00a31,231, Rightmove said. Advertised rents in London have also risen to a record of \u00a32,661, up from \u00a32,567 a year earlier.\n\nUnsurprisingly, given it's popularity with commuters and family-friendly vibe, Surrey is top of the list when it comes to expensive rent costs. Prices have soared in the county, with one area in particular seeing the highest annual charge surge in the UK. he dataset is compiled from the asking rents of properties coming onto the market on RightMove from from 1st April - 30th June 2024\n\nWith it's idyllic riverside situation, and nifty town centre complete with supermarkets, restaurants and shops, Walton-on-Thames has been named one of the priciest.

But in 2024, this was \u00a31,960. This is a 30.4% increase - the largest average increase compared to anywhere else in the UK.\n\nIt takes just 29 minutes to hop on a train to London Waterloo from Walton-on-Thames, and it's perfectly placed for those who drive. It's just under six miles to the M3, and five miles to join the M25.\n\nWalton-on-Thames is also relatively close to the A3, which is six miles away, and is a 25-minute drive away from Heathrow Airport. It's also close to Kingston-on-Thames, which is a great shopping destination.\n\nWith prices are surging across the UK, it is no wonder tenants are feeling the pinch, and are now weighing up their options. It comes as Labour has pledged to get 1.5 million more homes built, which could help ease the burden of the housing crisis.\n\nBut Rightmove says the number of enquiries per property is decreasing The slowing in number of enquiries per property is driven by more rental properties becoming available, and fewer tenants entering the market to move, RightMove said. The number of available properties is currently 14 per cent higher than in July 2023, while tenant demand is down 16 per cent compared to last year.\n\nRightmove's Director of Property Science Tim Bannister says: \"With 17 enquiries for every available rental property, the market remains out of balance and difficult for tenants. We need landlord investment to increase stock and help achieve a healthier supply and demand balance in the market.\n\n\"There is an opportunity to encourage landlords to continue to invest in good quality homes, for example through tax changes, incentives to help with energy-efficient upgrades or a general sentiment change in government towards working alongside and with landlords. Landlords have previously told us that the government's perception of landlords is one of their main concerns about the sector.

The latest official figures put the average rise at 5.7 per cent against inflation of 2 per cent. However, the above figure for average rents, covering the second quarter of the year from property website Rightmove, is up nearly 7 per cent compared with a year earlier. Rents in London are rising more slowly, at 3.7 per cent, but the average rental property in the capital will now set you back a staggering \u00a32,661 - twice that of the rest of the UK.\n\nThe members of Generation Rent are being brutally squeezed wherever they hang their hats. True, the pace of increase has slowed a bit - the annual rises were 8.5 per cent outside London and 5.3 per cent in the capital during the first quarter of this year - but that doesn't offer much comfort to those trying to navigate these treacherous waters.\n\nThe eye-watering cost of renting is not the only issue - finding somewhere to call home is also becoming an increasingly difficult task. Each property typically receives 17 inquiries from prospective tenants, more than double the pre-pandemic figure of eight at this time of year, while supply is down 20 per cent over the same period.\n\n\"A severe drought of genuinely affordable social homes has left private renting creaking under the weight of demand. Millions of renters have no option but to battle it out for overpriced and often shoddy homes, with rents soaring to record highs as a result,\" says Shelter CEO Polly Neate. \"With rents skyrocketing and protections from evictions paper thin, many are faced with an impossible choice: accept an eyewatering rent hike or risk being hit with a no-fault eviction.\"\n\nThis explains why talk about a housing crisis is entirely justified, and why people arguing for rent controls during the election campaign received such an enthusiastic hearing. But the problem with populist measures like this is the law of unintended consequences, certainly when it comes to the more radical varieties of proposed controls such as a hard cap. The latter would certainly be popular among tenants, but it could easily result in landlords selling up at the first opportunity, exacerbating the supply shortage dogging the rental market.\n\nThe ultimate solution is obvious: Britain needs more homes - affordable ones in particular. The new Labour government says it is serious about fixing the issues that have prevented this happening, such as a sclerotic planning process. However, if it is to deliver on its newbuild promises it will at some point have no choice but to take on the nimbyism that thwarted the previous government's attempts to get homes built in places where demand is highest, such as the leafy shires of the South East.\n\nThe government's \"official\" southeast region is made up of Kent, east Sussex, west Sussex, Hampshire, the Isle of Wight, Surrey, Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire. This was previously natural Tory territory. In 2019, they took 78 seats against Labour's eight, with one each for the Lib Dems and the Greens. However, Labour is now the largest party, putting a sizeable crack in the blue wall with 36 seats, followed by the Conservatives now on just 30, the Liberal Democrats (24) and the Greens (one).\n\nHow much will electoral calculations play a role in policy in this area? Labour's rhetoric about \"delivery\" will be hollow indeed if they serve to neuter the dire need for new, affordable homes.\n\nRightmove notes with approval \"some early positive signs from the new government regarding improvements in the rental market for tenants\" - including proposals to end \"no-fault\" evictions, and talk about a ban on landlords encouraging prospective tenants to \"bid up\" rents against each other.\n\nBut these words must now be put into action. The housing crisis has been shunted from government to government without any meaningful action for decades. Voters want roofs over their heads, and Starmer must act now to make that a more affordable reality by targeting the nimbys who have thwarted similar efforts for years. If he doesn't, it will cost him at the ballot box.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

of property hits new record", "body": "RENTAL costs have hit a new record high and households - but there is help for households struggling to keep up with their spiralling bills.\n\nThe average rent being asked outside London has reached fresh highs of \u00a31,314 per month, according to Rightmove.\n\nAdvertised rents in London have also risen to a record of \u00a32,661, up from \u00a32,567 a year earlier.\n\nDespite overall rental supply slowly improving from last year, the number of available properties is still below pre-coronavirus pandemic levels, the property website said.\n\nIts latest rental figures cover the second quarter of 2024.\n\nEnquiries for rental properties have also shot up, with each property home receiving 17 inquiries from prospective tenants.\n\nRightmove's director of property science Tim Bannister said: \"With 17 inquiries for every available rental property, the market remains out of balance and difficult for tenants.\n\n\"We need landlord investment to increase stock and help achieve a healthier supply and demand balance in the market.\n\n\"Support for both tenants and landlords will be key to achieving long-term stability in the rental market.\"\n\nWith other cost of living pressures still to contend with,\n\nit is no wonder that people are falling into debt when trying to keep a roof over their heads.\n\nIf you are struggling with your living costs there are schemes out there that might be able to help you out.\n\nIf you are struggling with problem debt or think that it is only a matter of time before you are, here are six things that may help you.\n\nDiscretionary Housing Payment (DHP) is a pot of money available to help low income households cover their housing costs.\n\nThis can include one-off payments to cover short term rental costs, be put towards a rent deposit on a new property or even rent in advance.\n\nFor those with disabilities, it can also be used to cover the costs of adapting your home to meet your health needs.\n\nThe payment does not cover things like bills or council tax on the home you live in.\n\nIn total last year 175,000 households in the UK received a slice of he \u00a3100million available as part of the scheme - making the national average payout \u00a3634.\n\nThe exact amount you get depends on where you live as each local authority dishes out the cash on a case-by-case basis.\n\nExclusive data from The Sun showed that in London, the average payout came in at \u00a31,298 - more than twice the national average.\n\nHowever in the North-East the average pay out came to \u00a3428.\n\nLiverpool made the most awards of 7,784, averaging at \u00a3212, while the fewest were made in Rutland, typically worth \u00a3620.\n\nBut if you are on housing benefits, or receiving the housing element of universal credit, you may be eligible for the support.\n\nEach local council decides how the application process will work, so you'll need to contact them directly to see how to apply.\n\nMany local authorities have Welfare Assistance schemes in place.\n\nHelp varies from free cash and food vouchers to money towards rent and energy bills.\n\nSome areas offer up to \u00a31,000 whereas some councils do not have any scheme in place at all.\n\nIf you are struggling check with your local council to see what help is available for you.\n\nIf you are not sure which council you come under you can check by entering your postcode on the government website.\n\nThe Household Support Fund (HSF) is another council scheme that is designed to help struggling families with rising living costs.\n\nAs with the other government schemes what you get and how much you can get varies depending on where you live.\n\nMost local council websites have details of what is on offer and how you can apply.\n\nFor example, locals in Walsall can get up to \u00a3300 in cash paid directly to their bank accounts to help with living costs.\n\nYou may be entitled to further cost of living payments if you claim pension credit, income support or universal credit.\n\nA good way to check what you are entitled to is to use free online benefit calculators.\n\nEntitledto's free calculator works out whether you qualify for various benefits, tax credits and Universal Credit.\n\nDebt charity StepChange also has a benefits checker which is free to use and won't record your results.\n\nIf you are struggling it is important not to bury your head in the sand.\n\nIt is always worth contacting your provider to see if there is anything they can do to help you.\n\nEach company has a different policy but it is worth asking if they can help you either from a hardship fund or by giving you more time to pay.\n\nThere are many charities that offer free debt advice and it is completely confidential.\n\nCitizens Advice is a free service that can help you come up with a plan to get on top of your debt.\n\nIt has a useful page with helpful advice but you can also contact them over the telephone or in person.\n\nStepChange is another free advice service offering support and guidance online or over the phone, and it's completely confidential.\n\nWhere possible, their advisers will help you come up with a plan to repay all your debts but in a way that you can afford.\n\nNational Debtline is a charity run offering free and confidential advice to people in England, Wales and Scotland.\n\nYou can contact them online or over the phone on 0808 808 4000, between 9am and 8pm Monday to Friday, and 9.30am to 1pm on Saturdays.", "source": {"uri": "thesun.co.uk", "dataType":

Renters here are also in good company, with the city having the highest share of renters (56.1%) among the top 10 rental markets.\n\n\"Living in markets with a high share of renters indicates excellent access to urban amenities, including public transportation, entertainment, dining options, and cultural attractions, which are highly appealing to renters,\" explains Jiayi Xu, the Realtor.com economist who wrote this report.\n\nTo find the best rental markets, the data team ranked 325 cities and towns with a population of more than 75,000 located within the 50 largest metro areas on the following factors, in terms of what makes a place great for renters.\n\nThis includes analyzing rental affordability, which is estimated by rent-to-income ratios, as well as rental availability. It also takes into account job stability, estimated by the forecasted unemployment rate as well as the number of job opportunities, based on online jobs availability data, and the average commute time to work. The analysis also considered the number of renters among households over the age of 25.\n\nSpoiler alert: All top 10 rental markets are located in the South and Midwest, with none from the Northeast or West.\n\nEven the top rental markets in the Northeast (Lawrence, MA) and in the West (Denver) failed to make the top 10.\n\n\"The relatively low rental affordability and low rental vacancy rates have caused these two cities to drop off the top 10 list,\" says Xu.\n\nSo which other cities did make the cut? The top 10 rental markets in the United States are as follows, according to the Realtor.com report:\n\nAustin is one of the fastest-growing U.S. cities. With major tech companies like Google, Apple, and Oracle expanding into the area, it's become a bustling technology hub with loads of job opportunities and a low unemployment rate (3.3%).\n\nThe Texas state capital also features culturally diverse neighborhoods and a vibrant music scene.\n\nRealtor.com recently named Austin the top rental market for 2024 college graduates.\n\nOklahoma City is the most affordable rental market in the top 10, with a rent-to-income ratio of 17.7%.\n\n\"A lower rent-to-income ratio is desirable, as it means a smaller portion of monthly income goes toward rent, leaving more budget available for other expenses,\" Xu says.\n\nAnd there are lots of fun things to spend those savings on, including award-winning restaurants, Oklahoma City Thunder basketball games, and OKC Philharmonic concerts.\n\nThis scenic city has great breweries, top-tier health care, and plenty of incredible places to hike, bike, and fish.\n\nIt also has the highest number of vacant rentals (12.3%) among the top 10.\n\n\"This means renters could have an abundance of rental properties to choose from and may wield greater bargaining power when negotiating with landlords,\" Xu says.\n\nSan Antonio, with its foodie culture and excellent music venues, is often compared to Austin.\n\nBut one thing that sets it apart is the iconic San Antonio River Walk, which is one of the top attractions in Texas. The 15-mile walkway offers amazing restaurants, chic hotels, and excellent boutiques.\n\nThe price of all that entertainment can add up, so luckily San Antonio ranks high for job openings, meaning there are plenty of employment opportunities.\n\nAdditionally, San Antonio has a large military presence, which offers strong community support, quality services, cultural diversity, and enhanced security, making it an even more attractive place to live.\n\nMinneapolis is an outdoor lover's paradise, with more than 22 lakes in the city limits and lots of green spaces, including parks, gardens, and biking trails.\n\nThe Midwest city is economical as well: Minneapolis is the second most affordable rental market within the top 10. The Minneapolis metro area also ties with the Nashville metro for the lowest forecasted 2024 unemployment rate (2.9%) among the top 50 rental markets.\n\nA lower forecasted unemployment rate indicates that renters might face less competition when looking for jobs and enjoy better job security, says Xu.\n\nSandy Springs is just 14 miles from Atlanta, so it offers a nice mix of urban and suburban living. This charming city has excellent schools, a diverse dining scene, and more than a dozen beautiful parks.\n\nMore than half of residents rent in Sandy Springs. It has the third-highest share of renters (54.6%) among the top 10 cities.\n\nHere's why that's a good thing: \"Markets with a high share of renters are more likely to have well-established tenant protection policies, such as rent controls, eviction protections, and high habitability standards,\" Xu explains.\n\nNashville is known for its amazing restaurants, fun nightlife, and incredible music scene, so renters will have no shortage of things to do here.\n\nAnd the Music City's job market is booming. The Nashville metro has the lowest forecasted unemployment rate (2.9%) among the top 50, tying with Minneapolis for the No. 1 spot.\n\nEven though tons of people are moving to the city for business and pleasure, there are still plenty of rental properties to choose from, since Nashville has a 9.2% rental vacancy rate.\n\nAccording to Xu, one reason for the higher vacancy rates in top markets like Nashville could be the surge in new multifamily construction and completion in the South and the Midwest, which expands the overall rental inventory.\n\nKansas City is famous for its barbecue, live jazz scene, and championship football team. This big city with a small-town feel is also home to a vibrant arts community, with world-class museums and galleries galore.\n\nKansas City made the top 10 due to its ample job opportunities and affordability -- two traits that also attract real estate investors.\n\nRaleigh is a buzzing tech hub that ranks high on our list for affordability. You can get more bang for your buck here and enjoy incredible craft beer, plentiful food trucks, and great golf courses. (Plus, the beach is only a two-hour drive.)\n\nAnd speaking of drives, the average commute in Raleigh is 25 minutes, which is shorter than the city/town average of 30 minutes.\n\n\"This translates to a potential saving of 43 hours per year for a commuter traveling five days a week,\" Xu says.\n\nNorfolk is a beautiful community with miles of spectacular beaches with plenty of boating and fishing spots. It's also a great place to visit historic battleships, the Chrysler Museum of Art, and the Virginia Zoo.", "source": {"uri": "realtor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Realtor.com"}, "authors":

Before you turn over the keys to a tenant, it's important to be aware of the legal considerations that can affect your role as a landlord.\n\nEach state has its own set of landlord-tenant laws, which outline the duties and rights of both landlords and tenants. These laws cover a variety of topics, including security deposits, lease requirements, tenant screening, the right to enter rental property, maintenance, and procedures for evicting tenants. It's crucial to familiarize yourself with these laws in your state to avoid legal disputes, and consider consulting a lawyer who specializes in real estate law to get specific guidance.\n\nThe lease agreement is the fundamental document that outlines the terms and conditions of the tenancy. A well-crafted lease should include:\n\nEnsure that the lease agreement complies with local laws and regulations; it's advisable to have a lawyer review the document before it is signed.\n\nSecurity deposits are a common source of disputes between landlords and tenants. State laws dictate how much you can charge, where you must store the deposit, and how long you have to return it after the tenant moves out, usually with an itemized list of any deductions for damages beyond normal wear and tear. Make sure you understand and follow these regulations to avoid legal complications.\n\nThe Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, or disability - this applies to all aspects of the renting process, from advertising and tenant screening to evictions. Violations of this act can lead to severe legal penalties. Always ensure that your tenant selection criteria and property rules are based on legitimate business needs and are applied consistently to all applicants.\n\nLandlords are legally required to keep rental properties habitable under the warranty of habitability, a legal doctrine that requires landlords to offer and maintain livable conditions in a rental property; this includes necessary repairs to critical elements such as plumbing, heating, and electricity. Failure to make necessary repairs could lead to penalties, including allowing tenants to withhold rent or handle repairs themselves and deduct the cost from their rent.\n\nRental properties must comply with state and local building codes and safety regulations; this includes ensuring that smoke detectors, carbon monoxide detectors, and fire extinguishers are in place and functional. Regular inspections and maintenance are essential to remain compliant and ensure the safety of your tenants.\n\nEvictions must be handled legally and delicately. Grounds for eviction typically include non-payment of rent, violating lease terms, or causing significant damage to the property. Still, the process involves legal steps, such as providing proper notice and obtaining a court order - improper eviction processes can lead to lawsuits and financial liabilities.\n\nModern challenges in managing rental properties necessitate the use of efficient rental property management software. This technology can streamline operations, ensure legal compliance, and securely document all tenant interactions and transactions.\n\nKey advantages include:\n\nUnforeseen domestic issues, such as disputes between tenants or significant life events impacting tenancy, can pose complex challenges for landlords. These situations not only disrupt the rental environment, but can also have legal and financial ramifications for your rental business.\n\nHandling these domestic issues effectively requires a proactive approach, with a focus on legal compliance and empathetic management. This ensures that your rental business remains a stable and positive environment for all tenants.\n\nBeing a landlord involves more than just collecting rent; it requires a proactive approach to legal compliance and a thorough understanding of the laws that govern rental properties. By taking the time to understand and adhere to these legal requirements, you can provide a safe, stable, and legal rental experience for your tenants while protecting your investment.", "source": {"uri": "ajs.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "American Judicial System"}, "authors": [{"uri": "edward_gates@ajs.org", "name": "Edward Gates", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landlord", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Landlord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renting", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Renting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_(list)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Outline (list)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_deposit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Security deposit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leasehold_estate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leasehold estate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eviction", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eviction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housing_discrimination_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Housing discrimination in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habitability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Habitability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warranty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Warranty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumbing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plumbing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damages", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Damages"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electricity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Disability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nationality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Religion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_monoxide_detector", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carbon monoxide detector"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_liability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Legal liability"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property_Rights", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property Rights", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.ajs.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Legal-Considerations-Before-Renting-Out-a-House.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9754432", "eventUri": "eng-9754432", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

Get exclusive offers here.\n\nDespite various challenges, the rental market presents an exceptional opportunity for investors, with promising returns on the horizon.\n\nSouth Africa's residential property scene reveals an intriguing story. The demand for rental properties significantly surpasses supply, signalling strong returns for landlords as the year progresses.\n\nAt the beginning of 2024, TPN's Vacancy Survey Report provided valuable insights into the rental landscape. This survey encompassed both full-title and sectional-title properties, showcasing the overall dynamics of the sector. An increase in households opting to rent has been observed, while the appeal of homeownership continues to decline.\n\nSpecifically, the percentage of families owning homes decreased from 64.4% in 2022 to 62.9% in 2023, while the rental market saw a rise from 22.5% in 2022 to 23.9% in 2023.\n\nThe shift in the housing market narrative is closely tied to various socio-economic factors. High-interest rates, economic uncertainty, and low employment rates have led many to prefer renting over owning. This trend resulted in historically low national residential vacancy rates in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nDuring the first three months of 2024, the national residential vacancy rate fell to its lowest level since TPN began its survey in 2016, reaching just 4.42%, a drop from 6.69% in the previous quarter. This imbalance between supply and demand has pushed the rental market significantly above equilibrium.\n\nThe dynamics within the rental property market are influenced by multiple factors. Landlords and investors often compete for financing against other investment options, which may yield higher returns. Elevated interest rates make securing loans for new ventures costly, thereby squeezing net profits.\n\nDespite these hurdles, the currently low vacancy rates offer a safety net for investors, minimising the risk of properties remaining vacant. The location of the property and rental pricing are crucial considerations for landlords, who must also be mindful of the potential rise in rent defaults due to financial strain on households.\n\nAccording to TPN's data, the Western Cape and Gauteng are identified as the prime regions for landlords and investors. The trend of preferring rentals over homeownership is anticipated to continue into the second quarter of 2024, especially amid high-interest rates.\n\nWhile the property market is expected to see a reduction in interest rates later in the year, this forecast remains uncertain due to ongoing domestic and international economic pressures. The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) announced in May 2024 that the repo rate will stay at 8.25%, allowing local banks to maintain their prime lending rate at 11.75%.\n\nPersistently high-interest rates, unchanged for six consecutive quarters, continue to burden consumers with debt.\n\nAs we gaze into the future of South Africa's housing market, the evolving trends in homeownership and renting present an intriguing narrative.

While most of the North Island saw changes, the biggest drop was the Manawatu/Whanganui region which was down -1.8 per cent.\n\nThe South Island was a different picture - with all regions apart from the West Coast seeing a drop in the price of rentals, said Lloyd. Marlborough recorded the biggest fall of 7.8 per cent - this was largely due to the large increase recorded last month.\n\n\"The South Island has generally been pretty resilient in terms of month on month prices - particularly Christchurch which hasn't seen a drop over two per cent in over a year but in June prices fell by 2 .6 per cent to $560 .\"\n\nThe demand for rental properties fell in June for the eight consecutive month, down nine per cent month on month.\n\n\"It's pretty common to see demand dwindle in winter,\" said Lloyd. \" There are a number o f reasons why it tends to drop - Kiwi tend to want to stay put in the colder months and the added expense of moving house at the moment will be putting a lot of people off moving - especially as living costs are increasing,\" said Mr Lloyd.\n\nGisborne and Otago experienced the largest month on month drop of 23 per cent. Despite the public sector job cuts in Wellington, the region recorded one of the smaller declines this month of 4 per cent.\n\nOverall, the supply of listings dropped by three per cent compared to the previous month - however there is still a large number of listings available compared to last year, up 28 per cent.\n\nThe national median rent for 5 + bedrooms stayed flat a t $1050 for June, however the capital city saw a 12 per cent decrease - with prices now $990 a week.\n\n\"Landlords may need to look at reducing rents for larger properties as they sit vacant for longer, while competition for smaller houses is driving up prices for 1 and 2 bedroom properties.\n\n\"Anecdotally we've heard people are downsizing to smaller houses and share rooms to help manage with the rent increases we have been seeing over the last couple of years in the capital,\" said Lloyd\n\nSmaller properties across the country have all recorded increases in the 1 -2 bedroom size, with Wellington City seeing the highest increase of 9.1 per cent to $600 per week followed by Christchurch up 8.7 per cent to $500 - which is still the most affordable option out of the three main city centres.", "source": {"uri": "scoop.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "Scoop"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_Me", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Trade Me"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_national_rugby_league_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Zealand national rugby league team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aotearoa", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Aotearoa"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manawat\u016b-Whanganui", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manawat\u016b-Whanganui"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast,_New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Coast, New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Coast, New Zealand"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Island", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Island"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Island"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Auckland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Auckland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whanganui", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Whanganui"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Whanganui"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiwi_(bird)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kiwi (bird)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Otago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Otago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gisborne,_New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gisborne, New Zealand"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gisborne, New Zealand"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christchurch", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christchurch"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Christchurch"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wellington", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wellington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wellington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homemaking/Frugality", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homemaking/Frugality", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 81}], "image": "http://img.scoop.co.nz/stories/images/1908/scoop_image.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9754432", "eventUri": "eng-9754432", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

In her day job, Martins-Phipps is a residential certified appraiser and Realtor emeritus at the Phipps Team at Compass Inc. She is also a member of the National Association of Realtors' Real Property Valuation Committee. Martins-Phipps has been a licensed real estate agent in Rhode Island since 1978 and a state-certified residential appraiser since 1993, currently serving on the Rhode Island Appraisal Board, and has also been a Massachusetts-licensed agent since 2009. She has a bachelor's degree from Providence College, a master's in education from Rhode Island College and did graduate work in holistic counseling at Salve Regina University. PBN: We have some new Rhode Island laws that recently went into place, allowing residents to remain in their rental properties temporarily after a fellow tenant's death. What's the lowdown about this? What should property owners know? MARTINS-PHIPPS: A new law went into effect in late June, giving residents who are 18 or older the right to remain temporarily in a rental unit after the death of the only tenant who signed a rental agreement. These residents, including the live-in caregiver of the deceased tenant, must provide written documentation to the landlord to show that they have been living in the rental unit. After doing so, they can stay for a maximum of three months or the remainder of the lease, whichever is shorter. These temporary tenants must continue to pay rent and are subject to the original conditions of the lease. They are subject to eviction if they don't comply. PBN: We also have requirements for notice ahead of a rental rate increase for apartments. What do property owners need to know most about this and what's your advice? MARTINS-PHIPPS: Another law also went into effect in late June that increases the amount of notice that a landlord must give a tenant before raising rent. Tenants who are 62 or under are entitled to 60 days' written notice, up from 30 days. Tenants who are over 62 must be given 120 days' written notice, up from 60 days. If they don't give proper notice, the increased rental amount cannot go into effect. These increased notice requirements do not apply to federal or state housing or assisted living. PBN: There are other new requirements regarding disclosure of information to tenants by the landlord. What is the biggest worry here for the owners of rental properties? MARTINS-PHIPPS: I wouldn't say there are worries, but starting on Jan. 1, 2025, a landlord must clearly list all utilities and fees in a rental agreement, such as renter's insurance, that a tenant must pay to make the full costs more transparent for tenants. The new law will also prohibit landlords from charging tenants a \"convenience fee\" to pay their rent by credit card or another method that costs extra to use. A tenant would be entitled to a refund of any fees that are not properly disclosed. PBN: There has been a lot of talk about the lead registry related to lead paint on the walls or lead elsewhere in the house. What steps should landlords take? MARTINS-PHIPPS: A law passed in 2023 requires owners of rental units that were built before 1978 to register their units and lead certificates showing that the property had been inspected by a licensed lead inspector with the R.I. Department of Health by Sept. 1, 2024. This year, the governor's proposed budget called for a delay of implementation until 2025 but that did not pass. Landlords can incur fines or be prevented from evicting tenants for nonpayment of rent until the landlords obtain lead certificates and register their pre-1978 rental units with the Department of Health. With only 35 licensed lead inspectors listed on the RIDOH site and a deadline just weeks away, it is likely that delays could occur, and it is unclear how this will affect compliance and enforcement. We do know that this is an issue that is of particular concern to Rhode Island's attorney general. PBN: What are your final words of advice for landlords in Rhode Island regarding these new rules and regulations that they'll be facing here from now on? MARTINS-PHIPPS: Landlords should keep informed and make sure their rental units, leases and rental agreements comply with the most current laws, as there are varying penalties and ramifications for not complying. Those landlords with pre-1978 rental units should contact a lead inspector as soon as possible to have their units inspected. It's important to become involved, too. Elected officials need to hear from landlords about how proposed legislation could affect them and their tenants. Marc Larocque is a PBN contributing writer. Contact him at Larocque@PBN.com.

Each of these leading cities is experiencing economic growth, attracting many young professionals. Austin (No. 1 on the list) and (No. 9) were also named top rental markets for 2024 college graduates.\n\n\"Over the last year, we continued to see strong demand for rental properties, especially among younger generations prioritizing the benefits of renting, like flexibility and relative affordability, while home prices and mortgage rates remain high,\" said , Chief Economist at Realtor.com. \"Despite high demand, there are some bright spots in the rental market around the in cities and towns that offer renters good job opportunities, a decent commute, flexible lease terms, maintenance free amenities, and more rental options to choose from at relatively affordable prices.\"\n\nWhile no cities from the Northeast or West made it into the top 10, , in the metro area, is the top rental market in the Northeast, and leads in the West; however, the relatively low rental affordability and low rental vacancy rates in both of these markets caused them to rank below the top 10.\n\nThese Cities Lead the Way When It Comes to Affordable Rent\n\nThe ratio of median rent to household income shows the percentage of income spent on housing. Lower is better, since that typically means households have more income to spend on other things. The top markets as a group are located in metro areas that have an average rent-to-income ratio of 21.0%, suggesting rents made up 21% of a typical household income, on average.

(12.3%), boasts the highest rental vacancy rate and (5.2%) has the lowest rate. Additionally, cities in Southern metros such as (9.2%) and Austin (9.0%) both rank prominently for rental availability. One important explanation for the higher vacancy rates in the top markets could be the surge in new multi-family construction and completion in the South and Midwest, which expanded the overall rental inventory.\n\nEconomic Opportunities Lead to a Stable and More Opportunities\n\nA lower forecasted unemployment rate indicates that renters might face less competition when looking for jobs, suggesting better job security. The top 10 markets as a group are located within metro areas that have an average forecasted 2024 unemployment rate of 3.3%, lower than the 4.0% forecasted town/city average.

For example, many renters in our top 10 markets benefit from shorter commutes. The top cities on our list boast an average expected commute time of 25 minutes in 2024, this translates to a potential saving of 43 hours per year for a commuter traveling five days a week.

Within the region, the city of San Diego also experienced a rise in its vacancy rate to 4.22%, compared to 2.64% last year.\n\nAccording to the rental housing association, the increase in vacancies can be attributed to the addition of new properties to the market and higher than usual vacancy rates in older properties.\n\nWhen there are more homes on the market, rent prices tend to fall. Fittingly, throughout the county, the average rent dropped from $2,338 in 2023 to $2,170 in 2024, a drop of slightly over 7%. In San Diego, the average rent fell from $2,266 in Spring 2023 to $2,189 in Spring 2024, a decline of over 3%.\n\n\"The 2024 Annual Survey indicates what industry members have been experiencing: higher vacancies and lower asking rents,\" said Alan Pentico, executive director of the SCRHA. \"While we still face a housing shortage in California, this change in the local market is good news for renters.\"\n\nThe data were collected through surveys mailed to around 6,000 San Diego County rental property owners and managers in March 2024, with responses representing about 11,400 units. Participants provided information on rental rates, the number of bedrooms, square footage, property age, location and occupancy status, the SCRHA statement read.\n\nThe association has been tracking rental and vacancy rate data in the San Diego Region since the 1950s.", "source": {"uri": "nbcsandiego.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC 7 San Diego"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_County,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "San Diego County, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego County, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southern California"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_districts_of_Russia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal districts of Russia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Appraisal", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Appraisal", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Homeless", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Homeless", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Consumer", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Consumer", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.nbcsandiego.com/2019/09/FOR-RENT-1.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9754432", "eventUri": "eng-9754432", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 114, "relevance": 1}

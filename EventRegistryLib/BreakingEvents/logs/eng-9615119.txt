The impact between the two teammates launched Ocon's A524 into the air, before crashing down on the Monte Carlo streets. As a result of the damage to the floor of Ocon's A524, his race was over.\n\nRace stewards investigated the collision and found Ocon \"wholly responsible,\" issuing a ten second penalty. With Ocon having retired from the race, that penalty was converted to a five place grid drop, which the driver will serve at the next race.\n\nImmediately following the incident Team Principal Bruno Famin spoke with French outlet CANAL+ and indicated there would be \"consequences\" for Ocon's attempted pass. Those statements sparked speculation that Ocon would be benched for the Canadian Grand Prix, which is next weekend in Montreal.\n\nOcon apologized to the team internally, as well on social media.\n\nHowever, the driver took to social media again to address the comments he has seen since Sunday. \"While I have received many messages of support, I have been deeply saddened by the amount of abuse and negativity that I have received online regarding my character, my driving, and my career,\" began the statement in part.\n\n\"I have always been a tough competitor, and, like most drivers, I've had my share of incidents.

The rumors around his exit gained traction after a contentious moment at the Monaco Grand Prix, where Ocon collided with teammate Pierre Gasly. The incident not only intensified scrutiny of Ocon's approach to racing but also cast doubt on his future with Alpine and possibly within Formula 1.\n\nThe French driver's aggressive maneuvers, especially against teammates, have frequently sparked debates about sportsmanship and team dynamics in Formula 1. The recent Monaco incident forced Ocon to retire from the race with suspension damage and also resulted in a five-place grid penalty for his next race. Commentators like Martin Brundle have pointed out that such behavior could severely limit his options within top F1 teams. He stated in his column for Sky Sports F1:\n\n\"Ocon is a fine and fast racing driver, but history clearly demonstrates that he has an irrational red mist when it comes to racing, particularly against his teammates....It will cost Esteban heavily as no front-running team would entertain that kind of mentality, or even perhaps any team.\n\n\"He has been heavily criticised before by Sergio Perez and Fernando Alonso for his intra-team aggression and contact, and now Gasly too.\n\n\"It will cost Esteban heavily as no front-running team would entertain that kind of mentality, or even perhaps any team.\"\n\nFollowing the incident in Monaco, BBC Sport F1 reporter Andrew Benson reported:\n\n\"Ocon is tipped to leave Alpine at the end of the season.\"\n\nIt is also speculated that Ocon could be benched for the upcoming Canadian Grand Prix as punishment for the Monaco maneuver.

Many of these reports have claimed that Ocon is not a good teammate. On going through the same, the 27-year-old has put out an emotional statement via his social media account. A snippet of his statement read,\n\n\"Of course, I have made honest mistakes. We are not robots. We are athletes pushing ourselves to the limit every day to achieve our dreams of winning races. F1 is a sport where emotions run high, and passions run deep. I see and feel this every weekend at the track and on social media...the good and the bad. But the misinformed statements and gross distortions that I have seen online in recent days about my ability to work with a team have been inaccurate, hurtful, and damaging\".\n\nOcon's clarification comes at a time when he has been the victim of immense social media criticism and abuse. Moreover, it is not just the fans and F1 experts that have seemingly issued harsh statements against the Frenchman.\n\nEven Alpine team principal Bruno Famin slammed Ocon after the 27-year-old's ambitious move on Gasly in Monaco. Although Ocon immediately apologized to his team after the incident, Famin claimed that he may take some harsh action against him.\n\nThis could also include benching the Frenchman for a race. As the team continues to add more pressure on Ocon in this fashion, some members of the F1 community have also voiced their support for the #31 driver following his emotional post on social media.\n\nLewis Hamilton's former physio, Angela Cullen, is well aware of the stresses that an F1 driver faces. Having gone through the highs and lows alongside the seven-time F1 champion, Cullen also has an idea of how important it is to support a driver when they are going through mental anguish, just like Esteban Ocon is currently going through.\n\nTherefore, within an hour of reading Ocon's post, Cullen immediately offered her support to the Frenchman. She wrote, \"Stand strong my friend\".\n\nAlongside Cullen, several of the fans also voiced their support for Ocon, mentioning that he does not deserve the hate he has been receiving over the past few days. Meanwhile, in response to those reports that claimed that Alpine may bench him for the upcoming Canadian Grand Prix, the Frenchman confirmed that he will race in Montreal.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vidit_dhawan@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Vidit Dhawan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobiles_Alpine", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Automobiles Alpine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esteban_Ocon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Esteban Ocon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Gasly", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pierre Gasly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Hamilton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lewis Hamilton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Montreal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montreal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Psychological_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Psychological Abuse", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Teams", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/05/a93b5aa4-esteban-ocon-and-pierre-gasly-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9615119", "eventUri": "eng-9615119", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

White joined the organization back in 2004, and played a role in Renault winning titles in both 2005 and 2006. BBC Sport first reported the news on Friday.\n\n\"As part of the team's wider operational restructure, we can confirm the departure of Rob White,\" said an Alpine spokesperson to BBC Sport.\n\n\"The team is thankful for Rob's efforts during his long career both at Enstone and at Viry-Chatillon, where he led the championship-winning engine project in 2005 and 2006. We wish him the best in his future endeavours.\"\n\nThe move is the latest in a series of changes made by the team over the past calendar year.\n\nLast season saw Team Principal Otmar Szafnauer and Sporting Director Alan Permane sacked the week of the Belgian Grand Prix, and this year began with the team seeing the resignations of Technical Director Matt Harman and Head of Aerodynamics Dirk de Beer. Those moves came following a difficult start to the year as the A524 -- Alpine's challenger for the 2024 season -- came in overweight and forced the team onto the back foot to start the season.\n\nAt the start of March the team announced an internal restructuring, replacing the single Technical Director format with three newly-created technical roles. The team unveiled what they call a \"three-pillared approach,\" with a Technical Director (Performance), a Technical Director (Aerodynamics), and a Technical Director (Engineering). Alpine introduced Joe Burnell as the team's new Technical Director (Engineering), David Wheater as the team's new Technical Director (Aerodynamics), and Ciaron Pilbeam as their new Technical Director (Performance).\n\nThen earlier this month Alpine announced that David Sanchez had joined the team as their Executive Technical Director, to lead their design facility.\n\nAll of these moves have seen the team improve performance, but perhaps not at the pace fans are hoping for. Esteban Ocon delivered the team's first point of the season with a tenth-place finish in the Miami Grand Prix, and after a pointless week at the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix Alpine seemed on track for a much better result in the Monaco Grand Prix. Pierre Gasly advanced to Q3 for the first time all season and started the race in P10, while Ocon was right behind him in P11.\n\nBut an opening-lap crash between the teammates caused substantial damage to Ocon's A524, knocking him out of the race. The team was able to repair the damage to Gasly's A524 during the ensuing red flag -- which came as a result of the massive shunt on the same lap involving Sergio P\u00e9rez, Kevin Magnussen, and Nico H\u00fclkenberg -- and Gasly was able to finish in tenth for his first point of the season.\n\nHowever, frustration lingers at Alpine over Ocon's bold move on the opening lap, which according to Gasly violated team instructions. \"It was a clear instruction from the team on what to do, what we were supposed to do, and this wasn't respected [by Ocon],\" said Gasly following his tenth place finish.\n\nSpeaking during the race to French outlet CANAL+, Team Principal Bruno Famin indicated there would be \"consequences\" for Ocon's audacious attempt. Ocon apologized to the team both internally and on social media, but Famin's comments to CANAL+ sparked speculation of a benching for the Canadian Grand Prix. Ocon already faces a five-place grid drop at his next race as a result of the incident, as race officials in Monaco found him \"wholly responsible\" for the collision and docked him a ten second penalty. But with Ocon unable to continue, that was converted to a five place grid drop.", "source": {"uri": "sbnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SB Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_schofield@sbnation.com", "name": "Mark Schofield", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_F1_Team", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Alpine F1 Team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_White_(Formula_One)", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rob White (Formula One)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Sport", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "BBC Sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerodynamics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aerodynamics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Permane", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alan Permane"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otmar_Szafnauer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Otmar Szafnauer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Belgian Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Monaco Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renault_in_Formula_One", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Renault in Formula One"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viry-Ch\u00e2tillon", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viry-Ch\u00e2tillon"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Viry-Ch\u00e2tillon"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enstone", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Enstone"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Enstone"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirk_de_Beer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dirk de Beer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emilia_Romagna_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emilia Romagna Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esteban_Ocon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Esteban Ocon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canadian Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Magnussen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Magnussen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nico_H\u00fclkenberg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nico H\u00fclkenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canal+", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Canal+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergio_P\u00e9rez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sergio P\u00e9rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Gasly", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pierre Gasly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Monaco"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rope_Skipping/Clubs_and_Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rope Skipping/Clubs and Teams", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure_Racing/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Adventure Racing/Teams", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Education_and_Training/Team_Building", "label": "dmoz/Business/Education and Training/Team Building", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l5KWKtRrk0DWwulvvJdg1QRxdWo=/0x500:6048x3524/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25472134/2154464338.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9615119", "eventUri": "eng-9615119", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

This development comes amidst speculation over Esteban Ocon's future at Alpine due to incidents including a collision at the Monaco Grand Prix.\n\nCurrently established at Alpine's Enstone base as a reserve driver, Doohan's potential promotion to a main seat in 2025 would be a significant shift within the team. This change is underscored by Alpine team principal Bruno Famin's vague yet impactful comments on the \"consequences\" following Esteban Ocon's collision at the iconic Monaco Grand Prix, a situation that paints a somewhat precarious future for the French driver at Alpine.\n\nHaving recently completed an intensive two-day test session driving Alpine's 2022 F1 car at Zandvoort, the Australian reserve driver displayed his readiness and determination to advance to racing full-time.\n\nDuring an interview with Racing News 365, Doohan commented on his chances of securing a permanent F1 seat in 2025. He explained:\n\n\"I just want to make sure that I can get in the seat next year.\n\n\"I want to be in there with Alpine. I have objectives to do out of the car, in the car, whether that's in the simulator or on the track, but also here testing.\n\n\"Making sure that I'm maximising, ticking all of the boxes. I feel that's what I'm doing now. With the position that I'm in and what I've done, I feel I should be in with a good chance for a seat next year.\n\n\"We obviously chose the decision not to race this year, to prepare me more for F1.\n\n\"With the simulator, there's also on-track testing so it will be a natural transition to continue on this path with Alpine and join as a full-time driver next year.\"\n\nDoohan continued:\n\n\"To be signed as an Alpine F1 driver for 2025 and beyond [is the dream].\n\n\"[I want to] join the team, continue to progress and continue to work forward with that new philosophy, moving forward with the team and getting to the place where we want to be.\n\n\"Alpine have dedicated a lot to me and gave me a great opportunity.\n\n\"I really want to have the chance to repay that and get to where we want to be.\n\n\"Not just driving in F1, but getting to where I know all that work ethic is going towards, which is hopefully being on the podium and winning races in the future.\"\n\nThis comes with reports of Ocon being benched for the upcoming Canadian Grand Prix following his controversial crash into teammate Pierre Gasly in Monaco.

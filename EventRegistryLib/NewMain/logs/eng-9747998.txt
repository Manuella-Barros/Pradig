Meta for alleged multiple violations of the FCCPC Act and other data privacy breaches.\n\nMeta is an American company and the parent company of WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram.\n\nThe commission, in a statement on Friday, on X, signed by Acting Executive Vice Chairman/ Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Adamu Abdullahi, disclosed that it found Meta culpable of denying Nigerian data subjects the right to self-determine, unauthorised transfer and sharing of Nigerian data, including cross-border storage in violation; discrimination and disparate treatment, abuse of dominance, and tying and bundling.\n\nAccording to FCCPC, between May 2021 and December 2023 and over this period of 38 months, a joint investigation by the commission and the Nigeria Data Protection Commission (NDPC) into Meta Parties conduct, privacy policies, the operation thereof and Meta Parties practices has evolved, revealing many things.\n\nFCCPC, which said though Meta Parties have provided some information/evidence that are in part responsive to document request and summons under the joint investigation, noted that Meta by themselves and retained counsels have also repeatedly engaged with and met with investigators and analysts from the commission and the NDPC, including as recently as April 4, 2024.\n\n\"The totality of the investigation has concluded that Meta Parties over a protracted period of time have engaged in conduct that constitute multiple and repeated, as well as continuing infringements of the FCCPA and NDPR, particularly, but not limited to abusive and invasive practices against data subjects/consumers in Nigeria, such as appropriating personal data or information without consent, discriminatory practices against Nigerian data subjects or separate treatment of consumers/dat subjects compared with other jurisdictions with similar regulatory frameworks, abuse of dominant market position by forcing unscrupulous, exploitative and non compliant privacy policies which appropriated consumer personal information without the option or opportunity to self-determine or otherwise withhold or provide consent to the gathering, use and/or sharing of such personal data.\"\n\nFCCPC said the Final Order mandated steps and actions Meta Parties must take to comply with prevailing laws and cease the exploitation of Nigerian consumers and their market abuse as well as desist from future similar or other conduct that do not neet nationally applicable standards and undermine the rights of consumers.\n\nThe Commission said the Final Order also imposed a monetary penalty of $220 million, which penalty is in accordance with the FCCPA 2018 and the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection (Administrative Penalties) Regulations 2020 (ARR).\n\nThe Commission said it remained committed to its respective mandates to protect the privacy of Nigerians under the Constitution and all data protection laws and regulations as well as to ensure that

The investigation examined Meta's conduct, privacy policies, and operations.\n\nThe FCCPC said it began its investigations in May 2021 based on available evidence that Meta, through its platforms, had violated provisions of the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Act (FCCPA) 2018 and the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation 2019 (NDPR), which were in force before the enactment and operationalisation of the Nigeria Data Protection Act 2023 (NDPA).\n\nThe competition protection body noted that Meta provided some information in response to document requests and summons. It said, \"Meta parties by themselves, and retained counsels have also repeatedly engaged with, and met with investigators and analysts from the commission, and the NDPC, including as recently as April 4, 2024.\"\n\nThe FCCPC highlighted that its investigation revealed that Meta engaged in conduct that included abusive and invasive practices against data consumers in Nigeria, such as collecting personal data or information without consent and discriminatory practices against Nigerians, among others.\n\nIt noted that Meta was provided with opportunities to defend itself during the investigation before entering a final order. The order is in respect to infringements, particularly regarding:\n\n\"Denying Nigerian data subjects the right to self-determine; unauthorised transfer and sharing of Nigerian data-subjects personal data, including cross-border storage in violation of then, and now prevailing law; discrimination and disparate treatment; abuse of Dominance; and tying and bundling.\"\n\nThe FCCPC added, \"The Final Order of the Commission mandates steps and actions Meta Parties must take to comply with prevailing law and cease the exploitation of Nigerian consumers and their market abuse, as well as desist from future similar or other conduct/practices that do not meet nationally applicable standards and undermine the rights of consumers.\"\n\nCommenting on this order on X, Babatunde Irukera, the FCCPC's former chairman, said, \"In this matter of protecting consumers and fair market regulation, Nigeria didn't proceed at dawn, but as a testament to Nigerian ingenuity and resilience, we have made such progress ahead of dusk! Leading continental digital markets accountability is reflective of who Nigerians are.\"\n\nMeta's $220 million fine announcement coincides with the dismissal, by the Federal High Court sitting in Abuja on Friday, of a N30 billion alleged illegal advertisement lawsuit instituted against it and its agent AT3 Resources Limited by the Advertising Regulatory Council of Nigeria.\n\nIn 2023, the European Union fined Meta a record $1.3 billion for privacy breaches and ordered it to stop transferring users' personal information in a decadelong case. In 2022, South Africa's Competition Commission said it was seeking a maximum abuse of dominance fine against Meta for allegedly trying to restrict an online \"chatbot\" from using WhatsApp to provide public health information to citizens on behalf of the government.", "source": {"uri": "newmail-ng.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New Mail Nigeria"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adebari_oguntoye@newmail-ng.com", "name": "Adebari Oguntoye", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Competition_and_Consumer_Protection_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Exchange rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrimination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Discrimination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Information privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Personal data"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Privacy policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Protection_Commissioner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Data Protection Commissioner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "HTTP cookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Protection_Act_1998", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Data Protection Act 1998"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "High Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Accountability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_protection", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consumer protection"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Public health"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawsuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawsuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Privacy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuja", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Africa"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Fraud", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://newmail-ng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/META.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9747998", "eventUri": "eng-9747998", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

(formerly called Facebook Inc.) jointly referred to as 'Meta Parties' in respect to this investigation.\n\nThe subject of the ONSC was to relay the Commission's investigative report in respect of its findings that the Meta Parties by their conduct have violated the above stated provisions of the FCCPA and NDPR (which was in force prior to the enactment and operationalisation of the NDPA (Nigeria Data Protection Act), 2023) and for the Meta Parties to show reasonable cause why the Commission should not proceed to enter its orders as final and enforceable pursuant to the FCCPA, particularly sections 17, 18, 155, and 159.\n\nBetween May 2021 and December 2023, and over this period of 38 months, a joint investigation by the Commission, and the Nigeria Data Protection Commission (NDPC) into Meta Parties conduct, privacy policies, the operation thereof, and Meta Parties practices has evolved. Meta Parties have provided some information/evidence that are in part responsive to document requests and summons under the joint investigation. Meta Parties by themselves, and retained counsels have also repeatedly engaged with, and met with investigators and analysts from the Commission, and the NDPC, including as recently as April 4, 2024.\n\nThe totality of the investigation has concluded that Meta Parties over a protracted period of time have engaged in conduct that constitute multiple and repeated, as well as continuing infringements of the FCCPA and NDPR, particularly, but not limited to abusive, and invasive practices against data subjects/consumers in Nigeria, such as appropriating personal data or information without consent, discriminatory practices against Nigerian data subjects/consumers or disparate treatment of consumers/data subjects compared with other jurisdictions with similar regulatory frameworks, abuse of dominant market position by forcing unscrupulous, exploitative, and non-compliant privacy policies which appropriated consumer personal information without the option or opportunity to self-determine or otherwise withhold or provide consent to the gathering, use, and/or sharing of such personal data.\n\nBeing satisfied with the significant evidence on the record, and that Meta Parties have been provided every opportunity to articulate any position, representations, refutations, explanations or defences of their conduct and practices under law, the Commission have now entered a Final Order, and issued a penalty against Meta Parties. The Final Order more elaborately describes the specific conduct or practices of the Meta Parties, relationship between Meta Parties with respect to the infringements, particularly with regard to:\n\n(1) Denying Nigerian data subjects the right to self-determine;\n\n(2) Unauthorized transfer and sharing of Nigerian data-subjects personal data, including cross- border storage in violation of then, and now prevailing law;\n\n(3) Discrimination and disparate treatment;\n\n(4) Abuse of Dominance; and\n\n(5) Tying and bundling.\n\nThe Final Order of the Commission mandates steps and actions Meta Parties must take to comply with prevailing law and cease the exploitation of Nigerian consumers and their market abuse, as well as desist from future similar or other conduct/practices that do not meet nationally applicable standards and undermine the rights of consumers.\n\nThe Final order also imposes a monetary penalty of Two Hundred and Twenty Million U.S. Dollars only ($220,000,000.00) (at prevailing exchange rate where applicable) which penalty is in accordance with the FCCPA 2018, and the Federal Competition and Consumer Protection (Administrative Penalties) Regulations 2020 (APR).

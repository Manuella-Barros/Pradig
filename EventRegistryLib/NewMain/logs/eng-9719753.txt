At 8-2 with a 3.34 ERA this year, Rea has been a steady and reliable arm for a rotation that has lost key names over recent years.\n\nTo that point, the Brewers have won in four of his last five starts, and Rea has given up more than two earned runs in just one start since May 20th. But when looking at the underlying metrics, Rea may be due for some massive regression in the near future.\n\nRea ranks in the 50th percentile or better in just extension (67th), walk rate (62nd), and ground ball rate (54th). None of those marks are particularly eye-opening, and they aren't particularly impressive categories relative to rank.\n\nFor comparison, his barrel rate (25th percentile) and hard-hit rate (38th percentile) demonstrate that he should be giving up more hits and runs. This is further conveyed by his expected batting average (seventh percentile) and expected ERA (11th).\n\nHis fastball isn't impressive (25th percentile in velocity), and he isn't good at getting batters to whiff (fifth percentile) or chase outside the zone (12th), which leads to his low strikeout rate (14th).\n\nRea is due to get knocked around and sent off the mound early at some point, and now is a great time to capitalize, given that his market suggests he's a far better pitcher than his underlying metrics say he is.\n\nPirates vs Brewers same-game parlay (SGP)\n\nIn Rea's one outing against the Pittsburgh Pirates this year, he allowed three earned over six innings en route to a 8-6 loss. It wasn't a bad outing by any means, but it was one of the five losses the Brewers have taken across his 17 starts this year.\n\nIf the Pirates can chase Rea off the mound early enough, Milwaukee's bullpen should struggle a tad with their long relievers (Bryse Wilson and Jakob Junis) having pitched on Saturday and Sunday.\n\nAnd one player in particular who may help get to Rea is Bryan Reynolds, who, for his career, is 5-for-9 with two doubles (.556 BA, .778 SLG). His total bases line sits at 1.5 tonight with some solid juice on the Over.\n\nLearn how to bet a same-game parlay with these helpful tips and strategies.\n\nPirates vs Brewers spread and Over/Under analysis\n\nPirates vs Brewers trend\n\nPittsburgh has gone 45-41-4 to the Under this year, good for the 11th-highest rate. But, in games with a total of 8.5 or more, it has gone 22-17-2 to the Under.

Oneil Cruz hit a two-run homer and Joshua Palacios added a solo shot for the Pirates.\n\nMilwaukee, which was idle Monday, is coming off a 9-2 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers on Sunday to finish a 3-4 road trip. Christian Yelich and Eric Haase each had a two-run homer, and Blake Perkins added a solo shot for the Brewers.\n\nMilwaukee is 22-6 in its past 28 home games after a 5-7 start and has won its past nine home series.\n\nRea, who has become one of the Brewers' most consistent starters, is coming off his best outing of the season, tossing seven scoreless innings in a 3-0 win at Colorado on Wednesday.\n\n\"You might change your strategy, you might change your emphasis, but you've still got to go compete pitch to pitch and figure out a way,\" Milwaukee manager Pat Murphy said after Rea's last start. \"You just can't let it get in your head. Colin Rea didn't, that's for sure. And that tells you everything you need to know about that young man.\"\n\nRea is 5-0 with a 2.56 ERA in his past eight outings, including six starts.\n\nHe is 2-2 with a 5.56 ERA in five career games (four starts) versus Pittsburgh.

Pirates manager Derek Shelton told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that Cruz's hamstring tightened up while running the bases in the sixth inning and that he was pulled out of an \"abundance of caution.\"\n\nPittsburgh reliever Carmen Mlodzinski has an 0.87 ERA and .169 batting average against him in his past 15 outings dating back to May 31.

After watching his team go ahead by a pair of runs, the Milwaukee Brewers called upon reliever Bryse Wilson to replace starter Colin Rea and face the Pittsburgh Pirates' catcher with no outs and the bases loaded.\n\nBart stepped in the box with an opportunity to make a splash, to truly turn the game on its head. And on a 2-2 pitch, he did.\n\nThe veteran backstop connected on a curveball left over the center of the plate, sending it 392 feet to left center field for a grand slam, his second of the season. The bases-loaded blast served as the game's turning point, setting up a 12-2 victory for the Pirates on Tuesday evening at American Family Field.\n\nBart's home run was preceded by his teammates tallying five straight singles. Bryan Reynolds and Rowdy Tellez started the party, which was followed by Nick Gonzales reaching on a play that was originally ruled to be an error on third baseman Vinny Capara, but later changed to a hit. Two more singles from Ke'Bryan Hayes and Jack Suwinski, the latter driving home Tellez, set the stage for Bart's big swing.\n\nThe grand slam was the seventh of the season by the Pirates, already matching the most ever in a single season in club history, joining the 1996 and 1978 seasons. Pittsburgh's seven grand slams this season matches the Brewers for the most in Major League Baseball.\n\nOn the mound\n\nAs the Pirates' bats hammered away, Quinn Priester upheld his end of the bargain. After being activated off the 15-day injured list prior to the start of Tuesday's game, Priester entered after Josh Fleming threw a scoreless bottom of the first.\n\nSimilar to his team's offensive output, Priester needed a bit of time to find a groove. The 23-year-old righty followed a scoreless first frame by allowing a pair of runs to score in the top of the third, the first being unearned.\n\nHowever, with the score tied and more potential runs on base, he locked in and remained on point. Priester kept the Brewers bats quiet for the remainder of his outing, finishing his work day with six strong innings to his credit. The righty struck out a career-best eight batters while allowing just four hits and a pair of walks en route to his first win of the season.\n\nAt the plate\n\nWhile Bart's homer was the most impactful, he was far from the only Pirate to go deep Tuesday evening. Reynolds got the club on the board in the top of the third with a two-run homer to left-center. The big-fly marked No. 115 in Reynolds' career, putting him ahead of Bobby Bonilla for the most home runs for a switch hitter in franchise history.\n\nTellez added on to the fun in the top of the seventh with a solo shot to right field. The homer marked Tellez' seventh of the season and sixth since June 8. Suwinski piled on the next frame, hitting a solo bomb to right field, his third of the month. Joshua Palacios added one more longball for good measure later that inning, sending a 2-2 pitch deep into the right field seats for his second home run in as many days.\n\nProbable pitchers: LHP Mart\u00edn P\u00e9rez (1-4, 4.72) for Pirates; RHP Tobias Myers (5-3, 3.52) for Brewers.\n\nKey matchup: Perez has received one run of support or fewer when he has been in the game in eight of his last nine starts.\n\nHidden stat: Reynolds' home run in the second inning made it 12 straight games the Pirates tallied a long ball in Milwaukee.\n\nThursday: Pirates at Brewers, 2:10 p.m., American Family Field.\n\nProbable pitchers: RHP Paul Skenes (4-0, 2.12) for Pirates; RHP Aaron Civale (2-6, 5.18) for Brewers.\n\n____", "source": {"uri": "theolympian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Our MLB odds series has our Pirates-Brewers prediction, odds, and pick for Tuesday.\n\nThe Pirates make the trip to Milwaukee to face the Brewers! The Pirates have struggled with consistency this season, while the Brewers have been one of the best teams in the MLB. Both teams have not been playing well leading into this series. Our MLB odds series has our Pirates-Brewers prediction, odds, and pick for Tuesday.\n\nLast Start: Pitched 7.1 innings and gave up one run on seven hits with one walk and two strikeouts in a Pirates loss.\n\nLast Start: Pitched seven innings and gave up zero runs on six hits with zero walks and four strikeouts in a Brewers win.\n\nTV: SportsNet Pittsburgh / Bally Sports Wisconsin\n\nThe Pirates have been inconsistent this season on their way to a 43-47 record. They have also lost two straight leading into this series and three out of their last four games. They have struggled behind the plate, but their pitching has been average and in the middle of the pack this season. Connor Joe, Bryan Reynolds, Oneil Cruz, Andrew McCutchen, and Jack Suwinski have been solid behind the plate despite the offensive struggles as a whole. Jared Jones and Mitch Keller have been solid for the pitching staff. It is also worth noting that Paul Skenes has been great too. The Pirates have struggled to find consistency all this season and it's the main thing holding them back.\n\nThe Pirates have not announced who they are starting yet, but based on their schedule it will be Martin Perez. He has a 1-4 record, a 4.72 ERA, and a 1.54 WHIP. Through 68.2 innings, he has allowed 40 runs on 84 hits with 22 walks and 52 strikeouts. He has started in 13 games this season, and the Pirates have gone 4-9 in those games. He started the season playing well but has struggled recently. He also gets a massive challenge against the Brewers behind the plate.\n\nThe offense for the Pirates has struggled this season. They are 24th in the MLB in team batting average at .230 after having a batting average of .239 last season. Bryan Reynolds is the leader in almost every batting category. Reynolds leads in batting average at .278, in home runs at 16, in RBI at 54, in OBP at .343, and in hits at 101. This is a difficult matchup for a struggling offense because of how well Colin Rea has been playing on the mound for the Brewers.\n\nWhy The Brewers Will Cover The Spread/Win\n\nThe Brewers have been great this season with a 53-38 record. Their offense has been great and is top five in the league, while their pitching has been a top 10 unit overall. William Contreras, Rhys Hoskins, Sal Frelick, Brice Turang, Jackson Chourio, and Willy Adames have led the way for the Brewers behind the plate, making this offense extremely hard to play against, regardless of the team. Freddy Peralta and Colin Rea have been the biggest keys on the mound with both being great and Robert Gasser has also been solid recently.\n\nThe Brewers are starting Colin Rea on the mound where he has an 8-2 record, a 3.34 ERA, and a 1.20 WHIP. He has allowed 37 runs on 85 hits with 28 walks and 66 strikeouts through 94.1 innings. In his 17 appearances this season, the Brewers are 12-5. Rea has been great on the mound and has been the ace for the Brewers when needed this season. He also gets a favorable matchup in this game against a struggling Pirates offense this season.\n\nThe offense for the Brewers has been red-hot this season. The Brewers are fourth in team batting average at .256 compared to finishing last season with a .254 average. Rhys Hoskins, William Contreras, and Willy Adames lead the Brewers in most batting categories. Contreras leads in batting average at .297, in OBP at .360, and in total hits at 105. Adames and Hoskins are tied for the lead in home runs at 13 and then Adames leads in RBI at 58. This offense has been one of the best in the MLB and gets a favorable matchup against Martin Perez on the mound for the Pirates.\n\nFinal Pirates-Brewers Prediction & Pick\n\nThe Pirates have struggled leading into this matchup on a two-game losing streak. They have struggled behind the plate, while the Brewers have been one of the best in the league. If the Pirates start Perez, the Brewers will have the advantage on the mound with Rea. The Brewers should win and cover because of those advantages and it helps with the game being at home.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jake_faigus@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Jake Faigus", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Brewers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Brewers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bally_Sports_Wisconsin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bally Sports Wisconsin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connor_Joe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Connor Joe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Reynolds_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bryan Reynolds (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Rea", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colin Rea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oneil_Cruz", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oneil Cruz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Keller", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mitch Keller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mart\u00edn_P\u00e9rez_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mart\u00edn P\u00e9rez (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_McCutchen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andrew McCutchen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "On-base percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Walks plus hits per inning pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Contreras", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William Contreras"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddy_Peralta", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freddy Peralta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willy_Adames", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Willy Adames"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Contreras", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Contreras"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhys_Hoskins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rhys Hoskins"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Themes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Collecting/Themes", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Pirates-vs-Brewers-prediction-odds-pick.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719753", "eventUri": "eng-9719753", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

Plus, the Brewers came into the game with a 27-13 record at home.\n\nThe Pirates (44-47) responded in a big way with a 12-2 victory and their first two-game winning streak since June 25-26. The victory was the result of a six-run sixth inning, catcher Joey Bart's grand slam and four other home runs and an outstanding relief effort from Quinn Priester, whose most recent outing occurred in Triple-A Inndianapolis on a rehab assignment.\n\nActivated from the injured list (right lat muscle injury) just hours before the game, Priester relieved opener Josh Fleming, who worked only a scoreless first inning, threw 24 pitches and walked three batters.\n\nPriester struck out a career-high eight batters in six innings, the most by a Pirates relief pitcher since 1961. He allowed two runs (one earned), four hits and two walks in his first outing for the Pirates since June 2.\n\nBrewers starter Colin Rea entered the game with an 8-3 record and 3.34 ERA, but the Pirates scored six times to break a 2-2 tie in the sixth. Singles by Bryan Reynolds, former Brewers player Rowdy Tellez, Ke'Bryan Hayes and Jack Suwinski -- sandwiched around an error by third baseman Vinny Capra on Nick Gonzales' 1o3.2 mph groundball -- led to Bart's grand slam. It was the Pirates' seventh slam of the season, tying a club record, and the second of Bart's career (both with the Pirates this season).\n\nThe Pirates took an 8-2 lead into the seventh inning, and followed that outburst with three home runs in the seventh and eighth for a total of five.\n\nIn the seventh, Tellez's sixth home run in his past 12 games -- No. 100 for his career, eighth this season and his first against a left-handed pitcher -- landed 410 feet from home plate and opened up a 9-2 lead. An inning later, Suwinski followed with his ninth homer of the season, giving the Pirates a double-digit run total for the second time in the past five games. Before the Brewers could get a third out, Josh Palacios homered for the second day in a row, bringing the Pirates' run total in the past five games to 38.\n\nThe Pirates have hit 15 home runs in those five games, only the sixth time since 1901 they recorded at least that number in that span.\n\nThe Pirates jumped out to a 2-0 lead in the third when Reynolds homered -- his 17th of the season -- with Michael A. Taylor on base after a walk. The ball left Reynolds' bat at 104.6 mph and landed 408 feet from home plate.\n\nIt was Reynolds' 115th career homer, the most all-time by a Pirates switch hitter, surpassing the mark previously held by Bobby Bonilla.\n\nThe Brewers (53-39) answered with two runs in the bottom of the third.

Pittsburgh, who hadn't named a starting pitcher until late this afternoon, will go with reliever Josh Fleming, who has made two starts (though both were brief) and 21 relief appearances for the Pirates this season. He has been basically the epitome of a league-average pitcher this season. In one of his two starts this year he did pitch four innings, so it's possible Pittsburgh will be looking to get more than just a \"first guy in a bullpen game\" outing, but that outing is the only one this season in which Fleming has thrown more than three innings.\n\nIt should also be noted, though, that the Pirates activated starter Quinn Priester from the injured list today, so it's entirely possible that Fleming is working as an opener for him. In six starts this year, the 23-year-old Priester has a 4.83 ERA/5.73 FIP, but he is a big prospect (top 60 for three years prior to last season via MLB's rankings) and has looked pretty good in seven minor league appearances this season.\n\nMilwaukee will go with Colin Rea this evening. Rea has been solid all year and is coming off one of his best outings, when he threw seven scoreless innings in a 3-0 victory over the Colorado Rockies on Wednesday.\n\nJackson Chourio is back in the leadoff spot tonight, and Blake Perkins, following his big day on Sunday, is hitting fifth. Eric Haase and his 1.182 OPS remain in the lineup, as William Contreras will be tonight's designated hitter.\n\nFirst pitch at 7:10 p.m. on Bally Sports Wisconsin and the Brewers Radio Network.", "source": {"uri": "brewcrewball.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brew Crew Ball"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Brewers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Brewers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Family_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Family Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Fleming_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Fleming (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinn_Priester", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quinn Priester"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bally_Sports_Wisconsin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bally Sports Wisconsin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Haase", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Eric Haase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Contreras", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William Contreras"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Rea", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colin Rea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadoff_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Leadoff hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Designated hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Rockies", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Rockies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5YYfy2mVY2vdvDHxlIRxhBPq4rA=/0x0:6587x3294/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25524318/usa_today_23710058.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719753", "eventUri": "eng-9719753", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Pirates opener Josh Fleming had issues with control in the first inning: Jackson Chourio got things started with a walk but he was erased on a William Contreras double play. Fleming then walked Christian Yelich and Willy Adames back-to-back with two outs, and they moved to second and third on a double steal, but Blake Perkins popped out, and despite three walks, the Brewers were unable to score.\n\nA Willy Adames error on a Jack Suwinski ground ball prevented Rea from getting his second straight three-up, three-down inning in the second, and Suwinski moved into scoring position with two outs by stealing second. But Joey Bart hit a fly ball to Chourio in right field, and Rea was through two no-hit innings.\n\nAs was expected when he was activated off the IL earlier today, Quinn Priester (who is a starter) took over for Fleming in the second inning. Priester got the first two he faced before walking Eric Haase, but Vinny Capra struck out and the inning ended.\n\nThe strike zone tightened up a bit on Rea in the top of the third and he issued a one-out walk to Michael A. Taylor, Pittsburgh's number nine hitter. He'd come to regret it: with two outs, Bryan Reynolds, one of the Pirates' two All-Stars, got hold of a fastball that wasn't quite high enough and hit it into Milwaukee's bullpen to give the Pirates a 2-0 lead.\n\nChourio led off the bottom of the third by getting on base for the second time -- the play was officially ruled a throwing error by Pirates shortstop Jared Triolo, though it really looked like it should have been ruled an infield hit. Chourio then advanced to second on a passed ball, and Contreras immediately paid it off when he smashed a double into the right field gap (108 mph exit velocity to the opposite field!) which scored Chourio and made it a 2-1 ballgame.\n\nYelich then walked to put two on with nobody out, and the Brewers were looking to take advantage of Priester, who hadn't appeared in a big league game in more than a month. Adames struck out looking (swing the bat, Willy), but Perkins snuck a single through the right side, and despite a close-ish play at home, Contreras got in there to tie the game at two. Hoskins grounded into a fielder's choice and Brice Turang grounded out to end the inning, but Milwaukee had evened it up heading into the fourth.\n\nNick Gonzales drew a walk to start the fourth, but Rea got the next three to put up a zero. Priester settled in in the fourth, and struck out Haase and Capra and induced a Chourio groundout. Rea also pitched a quick top of the fifth, and Priester worked around a one-out Yelich single to keep it tied in the bottom of the inning.\n\nReynolds led off the sixth with his second hit, a bit of a cheapie out to shallow left, and Rowdy Tellez followed with a ground ball that just got by Hoskins at first base. Rea hadn't given up a ball that was hit harder than 86 mph, but there were runners on the corners with nobody out. Pittsburgh took the lead when Gonzales hit a hard grounder at Capra, a fairly difficult play that was initially ruled an error and was later changed to a hit but could easily have been a double play. Ke'Bryan Hayes followed with another tough-luck base hit, a 72 mph blooper to center field, and the bases were loaded with nobody out. Rea, who'd been efficient tonight, stayed in to face Suwinski. He got ahead of him 0-2 but Suwinski worked the count full, and then lined a single into right that scored a second run. With the bases still loaded, Pat Murphy was forced into a move and brought in Bryse Wilson.\n\nThings went sideways quickly. Wilson got ahead of Bart but couldn't put him away, and Bart got a hanging curveball that he blasted into the Brewer bullpen for a grand slam. So much for the bloopers. Pittsburgh took a six-run lead. Wilson got the next three without any trouble. It seemed so easy!\n\nIt was an incredibly unlucky sixth inning and no favors from his defense that undid Rea, who looked about the same tonight as he has all year but ended up being charged with seven runs, all earned. This is the type of start that Rea (and the fanbase) should just set aside and move on from. It didn't tell us much. It was just a drag. That's baseball.\n\nLeading off the bottom of the sixth, Hoskins was given a reprieve when he watched what seemed on obvious third strike go by, and on the next pitch he lined a double into the left field corner. On the next pitch Turang grounded out but advanced Hoskins to third, but Haase and Capra struck out, and the Brewers spoiled Hoskins' leadoff double.\n\nHoby Milner was the next pitcher out of the bullpen for the Brewers -- notable perhaps because Wilson only threw 18 pitches and one inning, which isn't how he's typically been used as a Brewer. In any case, Milner struck out Reynolds but got too much of the plate with a one-out sinker to Tellez, who hit his 100 career home run to make it 9-2.\n\nMilwaukee went down in order in the seventh, and Suwinski led off the eighth with a home run off of Joel Payamps, and a few batters later, with two outs and a runner on, Joshua Palacios hit another one. and Payamps' struggles with the home run ball continued: he has now given up six home runs in 32 1/3 innings on the season, a rate of 1.7 per nine innings.\n\nThe most notable thing to happen over the rest of the game was that Jake Bauers pitched for the third time this season and became the first Brewer pitcher of the night to not allow a run. He has a 0 ERA in three innings this year.\n\nThe Brewers will rue their early missed opportunities in this one: they had a great chance to put at least a run or two on the opener, Fleming, and could have scored more than the two they got in the third. But Priester locked in after that and dominated the Brewers for another four innings. It may not have mattered, as the Pirates hit five home runs in this game (the most that the Brewers have given up in a game all season), but things certainly could have unfolded differently.\n\nThe loss tonight means that the Brewers' lead over the Cardinals has shrunk to just four games, the smallest their lead in the division has been since May 28.

Our MLB odds series has our Pirates-Brewers prediction, odds, and pick for Wednesday.\n\nThe Pirates make the trip to Milwaukee to face the Brewers! The Pirates have struggled with consistency this season, while the Brewers have been one of the best teams in the MLB. Both teams are coming off a win heading into this series too. Our MLB odds series has our Pirates-Brewers prediction, odds, and pick for Wednesday.\n\nLast Start: Pitched 7.1 innings and gave up one run on seven hits with one walk and two strikeouts in a Pirates loss.\n\nLast Start: Pitched six innings and gave up four runs on eight hits with one walk and five strikeouts in a Brewers loss.\n\nTV: SportsNet Pittsburgh / Bally Sports Wisconsin\n\nThe Pirates have been inconsistent this season on their way to a 43-47 record. They have struggled behind the plate, but their pitching has been average and in the middle of the pack this season. Connor Joe, Bryan Reynolds, Oneil Cruz, Andrew McCutchen, and Jack Suwinski have been solid behind the plate despite the offensive struggles as a whole. Jared Jones and Mitch Keller have been solid for the pitching staff. It is also worth noting that Paul Skenes has been great too. The Pirates have struggled to find consistency all this season and it's the main thing holding them back.\n\nThe Pirates are starting Martin Perez on the mound. He has a 1-4 record, a 4.72 ERA, and a 1.54 WHIP. Through 68.2 innings, he has allowed 40 runs on 84 hits with 22 walks and 52 strikeouts. He has started in 13 games this season, and the Pirates have gone 4-9 in those games. He started the season playing well but has struggled recently. He also gets a massive challenge against the Brewers behind the plate in this game with how well they have played on offense all season.\n\nThe offense for the Pirates has struggled this season. They are 24th in the MLB in team batting average at .230 after having a batting average of .239 last season. Bryan Reynolds is the leader in almost every batting category. Reynolds leads in batting average at .278, in home runs at 16, in RBI at 54, in OBP at .343, and in hits at 101. This is a difficult matchup for a struggling offense because of how well Tobias Myers has played for the Brewers this season on the mound.\n\nWhy The Brewers Will Cover The Spread/Win\n\nThe Brewers have been great this season with a 53-38 record. Their offense has been great and is top five in the league, while their pitching has been a top 10 unit overall. William Contreras, Rhys Hoskins, Sal Frelick, Brice Turang, Jackson Chourio, and Willy Adames have led the way for the Brewers behind the plate, making this offense extremely hard to play against, regardless of the team. Freddy Peralta, Colin Rea, and Tobias Myers have been the biggest keys on the mound with both being great and Robert Gasser has also been solid recently.\n\nThe Brewers are starting Tobias Myers on the mound where he has a 5-3 record, a 3.52 ERA, and a 1.19 WHIP. He has allowed 25 runs on 57 hits with 19 walks and 56 strikeouts through 64 innings. In his 13 appearances this season, the Brewers are 7-6. Myers has been solid on the mound and a bright spot for the Brewers this season. He also gets a favorable matchup in this game against a struggling Pirates offense that has struggled to find any consistency this year.\n\nThe offense for the Brewers has been red-hot this season. The Brewers are fifth in team batting average at .256 compared to finishing last season with a .254 average. Rhys Hoskins, William Contreras, and Willy Adames lead the Brewers in most batting categories. Contreras leads in batting average at .297, in OBP at .360, and in total hits at 105. Adames and Hoskins are tied for the lead in home runs at 13 and then Adames leads in RBI at 58. This offense has been one of the best in the MLB and gets a favorable matchup against Martin Perez on the mound for the Pirates.\n\nFinal Pirates-Brewers Prediction & Pick\n\nThe Brewers are just the better team. They have the pitching advantage with Myers over Perez and the much better offense behind the plate, compared to the Pirates. Neither team has a lot of momentum leading into this matchup, but the Brewers should win and cover at home thanks to their great offense and behind the arm of Myers on the mound.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jake_faigus@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Jake Faigus", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Brewers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Brewers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobias_Myers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tobias Myers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bally_Sports_Wisconsin", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bally Sports Wisconsin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connor_Joe", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Connor Joe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Reynolds_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bryan Reynolds (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_McCutchen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andrew McCutchen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Contreras", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "William Contreras"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Keller", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mitch Keller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mart\u00edn_P\u00e9rez_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mart\u00edn P\u00e9rez (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "On-base percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Walks plus hits per inning pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhys_Hoskins", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rhys Hoskins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddy_Peralta", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freddy Peralta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Rea", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colin Rea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willy_Adames", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Willy Adames"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Contreras", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Contreras"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Pirates-vs.-Brewers-prediction-odds-pick.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719753", "eventUri": "eng-9719753", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

Sure, the club has been reliable contenders for years now despite modest payrolls, but the loss of manager Craig Counsell to the rival Cubs and the trade of ace starter Corbin Burnes to the Orioles this spring seemed to herald a bit of retrenchment, if not an outright rebuild.\n\nAnd here are they are a week from the All Star break, comfortably leading the NL Central with a 53-38 record. Sure, they've had some standout performances in the field, chiefly from All Star starters Christian Yelich and William Contreras. But their run prevention has been just as impressive as their offense, if not more so. They have the 4th best ERA with the 4th fewest runs allowed in the NL, and that's with staff ace Freddy Peralta doing barely better than league average work.\n\nColin Rea has been the unlikely staff ace for the Brewers. Yup, that Colin Rea, the one who was selected on the 12th round of the 2011 draft out of Indiana State by the Padres. The same Colin Rea who made 19 basically replacement level starts for those Padres before injuries, ineffectiveness and a side trip to Japan limited him to all of 20 more major league innings before 2023, his age 32 season.\n\nSince his return, Rea has been a revelation for the Brewers, logging 219 innings while posting a better than league average 4.03 ERA. By that measure, his best work has been done this season, as he's taken a regular turn while logging a 8-2, 3.34 mark, good for an 82 ERA-.\n\nYou watch Rea pitch and you wonder how exactly he is getting this done. His stuff is - well - unremarkable, to say the least. He averages 92.7 mph with his four-seam fastball, and his 7.4% swinging strike rate is remarkably low compared to contemporary norms.\n\nTo understand - at least to an extent - his success, and in fact his very presence in the Brewer rotation we have to take a step back and understand the way this club does business.\n\nYes, the Brewers are competitive every year, but they have completely dug in and decided they are not going to pay the going rate for high end pitching. To prevent runs, they instead are going to field an exemplary team defense and run starting pitchers out there who aren't going to beat themselves. Get out there, go around the lineup twice without incident, don't walk anyone and let the defense earn its keep.\n\nRea is the poster child for this approach. His 7.1% BB rate is solidly below league average. His 16.8% K rate (way down from last year's 21.3%) is even more significantly below league average. He has avoided the big inning this season - his 3.34 ERA is much lower than his 3.84 component ERA, or what his ERA should be given his actual OBP and SLG allowed. Through some combination of guile and good fortune, Rea is escaping innings with less damage than he should be.\n\nBut it only begins there. In 2023 and 2024, Rea has allowed significantly higher overall (89.8 mph in both years), fly ball (92.8 and 92.0 mph) and line drive (94.6 and 95.1 mph) average exit speeds. He's trended the wrong way in all batted ball frequency rates (4.4% to 3.4% pop up, 33.3% to 34.6% fly ball, 18.6% to 19.9% line drive and 43.8% to 42.1% grounder rates). He hasn't exhibited a go-to pop up or grounder tendency, and hasn't shown a proclivity to limit contact authority or frequency.\n\nLooking at his arsenal on a pitch-by-pitch basis doesn't make things any better. My pitch grading system, which rates bat-missing and contact management on a pitch-specific basis compared to league norms, doesn't think highly of him either. His sweeper has been a \"B+\" pitch this year (an incredible 40 Adjusted Contact Score paired with an awful 8.9% whiff rate), while his four-seamer (\"C+\", 165, 11.7%), sinker (\"C+\", 97, 3.4%) and cutter (\"D+\", 138, 6.9%) have all been below average offerings.\n\nSo far this season he's posted a 110 \"Tru\" ERA- (my batted ball-based proxy for ERA- and FIP-), way worse than his 82 ERA- and actually better than his 114 FIP-. In 2023, he actually had an exactly league average 100 \"Tru\"-, better than his 104 ERA- and 111 FIP-. His contact management performance (105 and 104 Adjusted Contact Scores in 2023 and 2024) has been essentially unchanged, while his \"Tru\" ERA- has worsened due to his significant K rate drop.\n\nI would assume that the Brewers are well aware that Rea is not built to have massive success relative to the league over the long haul. But they are getting a nice bang for their relatively modest investment in him in the short term. He's earning $4.5 million this season, and the team has an affordable $5.5 million team option on him for 2025. In the unlikely event he continues to record better than league average results both quantitiatively and qualitatively until he reaches free agency after the 2025 season, the club - rightly - will allow someone else to belly up and pay market price for him. The club will instead attempt to unearth the next Colin Rea (who they may already have in Tobias Myers).\n\nThe plight of the small t0 mid-market team is real. You need to sift through the castoffs of other clubs to find hidden gems. Some clubs, like the Rays and Brewers, are really good at this. Colin Rea's greatest strengths are his availability every fifth or sixth day, and his resilience to keep his head in tight spots, maintain his stuff from the stretch, and other things that aren't always that easy to measure. Players like him eventually hit their expiration date, but deserve credit for their underrated contributions to team success.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Rea", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colin Rea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ace (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batted_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Batted ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Brewers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Brewers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Contreras", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "William Contreras"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corbin_Burnes", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corbin Burnes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddy_Peralta", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Freddy Peralta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Yelich", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christian Yelich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Counsell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Craig Counsell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-seam_fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Four-seam fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_Central", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National League Central"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Orioles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Orioles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Cubs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Cubs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Run (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_independent_pitching_statistics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defense independent pitching statistics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "On-base percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/668b297d655f9d61aca787fa/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719753", "eventUri": "eng-9719753", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

The legendary broadcaster has been covering games since 1971 after he retired from playing the game. His impact on the culture can still be felt to this very day. So much so that Paul Skenes had nothing but one wish when the Pittsburgh Pirates faced the Pat Murphy-led squad.\n\nPaul Skenes meets his idol\n\nPaul Skenes finally got rewarded for his MLB All-Star selection and it's not through a trophy or memento. Instead, he got to meet his broadcasting and baseball idol, Bob Uecker. The Brewers allowed the Pirates pitcher to meet one of their greats before the two squads slugged it out on the field. This 22-year-old could not contain his excitement after seeing the legendary voice behind the radio and television.\n\nThe Pirates pitcher specifically requested to meet the legend and got that request granted. This request to see the Brewers great happened back in May when Pat Murphy's squad hosted the newly minted MLB All-Star. Back then, the Pirates were on the verge of a two-game winning streak against the Brewers. But, the home team made sure to get even by also winning two straight against the Pirates. Their last meeting was even a slugfest that the Brewers won with a 7-5 scoreline.\n\nSince then, the Brewers have risen to the top of the NL Central standings. Despite splitting their last 10 games, they still have 53 wins under their belt while only enduring 38 losses. The St. Louis Cardinals are the closest team to usurping them but even then it would take them five more wins and some luck to do so.\n\nMeanwhile, the Pirates have been on a slump as of late. They have only won four out of their last 10 games. Those numbers have not been a huge help to their record as Skenes' squad continues to sink with a 43-win record despite playing 90 games. But, being 9.5 games back is no reason for them to back down on a challenge. They've notched two wins against the division-leading team before and can surely do it again.\n\nStar pitcher before the Pirates vs. Brewers clash\n\nThe season that this rookie is having can only be described as phenomenal. He has pitched for the Pirates on 59.1 innings and delivered in every single one of them. Throughout that run, Skenes notched a 2.12 ERA alongside 78 strikeouts.\n\nHe has only played 10 games for the Pirates so far which means that those numbers are likely going to get bigger over time. His 1.01 WHIP all but proves that he is capable of playing more innings for his squad such that they could get more wins off him. Will he be able to prove himself in this Brewers series?", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jay_postrado@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Jay Postrado", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Skenes", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paul Skenes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Brewers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Brewers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Uecker", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bob Uecker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_Central", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National League Central"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Walks plus hits per inning pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/North_America", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/North America", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Paul-Skenes-legend-request-granted-ahead-of-Brewers-series.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719753", "eventUri": "eng-9719753", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

After watching his team go ahead by a pair of runs, the Milwaukee Brewers called upon reliever Bryse Wilson to replace starter Colin Rea and face the Pittsburgh Pirates' catcher with no outs and the bases loaded.\n\nBart stepped in the box with an opportunity to make a splash, to truly turn the game on its head. And on a 2-2 pitch, he did.\n\nThe veteran backstop connected on a curveball left over the center of the plate, sending it 392 feet to left center field for a grand slam, his second of the season. The bases-loaded blast served as the game's turning point, setting up a 12-2 victory for the Pirates on Tuesday evening at American Family Field.\n\nBart's home run was preceded by his teammates tallying five straight singles. Bryan Reynolds and Rowdy Tellez started the party, which was followed by Nick Gonzales reaching on a play that was originally ruled to be an error on third baseman Vinny Capara, but later changed to a hit. Two more singles from Ke'Bryan Hayes and Jack Suwinski, the latter driving home Tellez, set the stage for Bart's big swing.\n\nThe grand slam was the seventh of the season by the Pirates, already matching the most ever in a single season in club history, joining the 1996 and 1978 seasons. Pittsburgh's seven grand slams this season matches the Brewers for the most in Major League Baseball.\n\nOn the mound\n\nAs the Pirates' bats hammered away, Quinn Priester upheld his end of the bargain. After being activated off the 15-day injured list prior to the start of Tuesday's game, Priester entered after Josh Fleming threw a scoreless bottom of the first.\n\nSimilar to his team's offensive output, Priester needed a bit of time to find a groove. The 23-year-old righty followed a scoreless first frame by allowing a pair of runs to score in the top of the third, the first being unearned.\n\nHowever, with the score tied and more potential runs on base, he locked in and remained on point. Priester kept the Brewers bats quiet for the remainder of his outing, finishing his work day with six strong innings to his credit. The righty struck out a career-best eight batters while allowing just four hits and a pair of walks en route to his first win of the season.", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_slam_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Grand slam (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryse_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bryse Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joey_Bart", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joey Bart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Rea", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colin Rea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curveball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Curveball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Center fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Brewers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Brewers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Family_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Family Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ke'Bryan_Hayes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ke'Bryan Hayes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Reynolds_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bryan Reynolds (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowdy_Tellez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rowdy Tellez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Gonzales", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marco Gonzales"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Third baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Fleming_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Fleming (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinn_Priester", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quinn Priester"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://resources.arcamax.com/newspics/297/29722/2972226.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719753", "eventUri": "eng-9719753", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 164, "relevance": 1}

He allowed four runs in six innings in a 4-3 defeat against the Colorado Rockies on Thursday.\n\nMyers made his major league debut at Pittsburgh on April 23, allowing just one run on a leadoff homer by Andrew McCutchen in five innings. He took the loss in a 2-1 defeat, however.\n\nPerez allowed just one run in 7 1/3 innings Thursday in his most recent start. He did not record a decision in a 3-2, 10-inning loss against St. Louis.\n\n\"Good rebound start,\" Shelton said. \"He executed all of his pitches. I think he gave us 90-plus and did a good job, was able to go out in the eighth and keep the matchup that we liked. But overall, I thought he was really good.\"\n\nPerez has lost his last four decisions but has received one run or less of support when he has been in the game in eight of his last nine starts.\n\nPerez is 0-2 with an 8.31 ERA in four career games, including three starts, against Milwaukee.\n\nTellez, who spent the previous 2 1/2 seasons with Milwaukee, is batting .366 (15-for-41) with six homers and 12 RBIs over his last 13 games.

Stop worrying about anything else. Play to my strengths,\" said Priester, relating the brief conversation.\n\nIn the end, Priester recorded his first victory in six decisions this season only hours after being recalled from a rehab assignment in Triple-A Indianapolis. Recovered from a right lat muscle injury and pitching for the Pirates for the first time since June 2, Priester relieved opener Josh Fleming in the second inning and went on to strike out a career-high eight batters in six innings, allowing only four hits and two walks.\n\nGetting an 8-2 lead in the sixth surely helped.\n\n\"The offense was plentiful. It was easy to go out there and fill up (the strike zone),\" he said.\n\nPriester used a sinker, four-seam fastball and slider to take the sting out of Brewers bats that have carried the team into first place in the National League Central.\n\n\"We were able to limit the damage in that inning and continue to roll through the rest of the outing,\" he said. \"That feels like something I'm getting better at with each outing. Being able to learn the game through the experience I'm getting, through the (catchers) behind the plate, going back in the dugout and learning from those mistakes, those (big innings) are going to show up a lot less as I continue to grow as a pitcher.\"\n\nWhat's to become of Priester now that the Pirates have two huge holes in their starting rotation with Jared Jones and Bailey Falter on the injured list? Will he return to a starting role? Or will long relief be in his future?\n\n\"I'll help the team in whatever way,\" he said. \"I think of myself as a starter. But if there's a better way to help the team win, that's what I'm going to do.\"\n\nPriester admitted the relief role was \"a litte weird, routine a little bit different.\"\n\n\"No challenge that I wasn't ready for,\" he said. \"The coaching staff knew that I could dominate. Having their faith really pushed me to do that.\"\n\nManager Derek Shelton has a decision to make going forward, but he was pleased Tuesday night that Priester was able to help his injury-plagued pitching staff.\n\n\"He executed pitches,\" the manager said. \"He put the ball on the ground when he needed to and he got strikeouts. Outstanding. He did a really good job. Proud of how he came back and executed.\"", "source": {"uri": "triblive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TribLIVE"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jerry_dipaola@triblive.com", "name": "Jerry DiPaola", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Brewers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Brewers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Family_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Family Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joey_Bart", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joey Bart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coach_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coach (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slider_(pitch)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slider (pitch)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Fleming_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Fleming (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-seam_fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Four-seam fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_Central", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National League Central"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_zone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strike zone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-A_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Triple-A (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey_Falter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bailey Falter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_list", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Injured list"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_Shelton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Derek Shelton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_reliever", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Long reliever"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dugout_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dugout (baseball)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://assets-varnish.triblive.com/2024/07/7520248_web1_AP24192023904789.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719753", "eventUri": "eng-9719753", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-02", "textStart": 945, "textEnd": 951}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 124, "relevance": 1}

His last two outings have been bumpy, allowing seven runs over 12 innings (5.25 ERA), but his xFIP over those two games is 3.68. He gave up some hard contact across those two starts, but part of what led to his run of form was inducing weak contact.\n\nSince June 1, the Pirates have a collective 94 wRC+ against righties, ranking 20th in baseball. It will be on Myers' shoulders to help stifle a Pittsburgh squad that blew open last night's game.\n\nThe lineup takes a familiar look besides the recent swapping at third base. After Vinny Capra made a pair of starts, Andruw Monasterio is back in the lineup, batting eighth. In Joey Ortiz's absence, the hot corner has been a puzzle for Milwaukee. Over the last 14 days, the Brewers have received a disastrous .170/.204/.213 (19 wRC+) slash line from their third basemen, according to FanGraphs.\n\nThe rest of the infield sees Willy Adames, Brice Turang, and Rhys Hoskins in their usual spots. Adames has struggled recently with just a .198 batting average since June 1, but he takes a four-game hitting streak into this matchup.\n\nJackson Chourio has become a staple atop the lineup as he leads off against lefty Martin Perez. Chourio has put up poor splits this year with just a .189 batting average against lefties. It shows the trust the team has in Chourio in his development moving forward. His performance against southpaws has been slightly better since June 1 with a .222 batting average since then, but it will be a fascinating factor in his development to follow.\n\nWith Chourio in left field, Blake Perkins takes center field with Sal Frelick in right field. This is one of the best defensive outfields in baseball, with Perkins (8th), Chourio (14th), and Frelick (36th) all among the best players in Defensive Runs Saved, according to BaseballSavant.\n\nWilliam Contreras will be on catching duties as he works with Myers to combat the Pittsburgh lineup.\n\nThat leaves Christian Yelich to take on the role of designated hitter tonight. Yelich's impeccable season is his personal best since his standout 2019 campaign. He's on pace for his lowest strikeout rate since 2018 and his best xwOBA since 2019.\n\nPerez, the Pirates starter, has a 4.85 ERA this season and a 1-4 record. His season has been quite tumultuous, but his most recent start was a 7 / inning showing against the St. Louis Cardinals in which he allowed just one run. His performances have been so volatile, though, that he has a 7.23 ERA over the last five starts. It's certainly an opportunity for the Brewers to take advantage of his bumpy form.\n\nFirst pitch at 7:10 p.m. on Bally Sports Wisconsin and the Brewers Radio Network.", "source": {"uri": "brewcrewball.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brew Crew Ball"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Third baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Pirates", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Pirates"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Brewers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Brewers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinny_Capra", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vinny Capra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andruw_Monasterio", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andruw Monasterio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brice_Turang", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brice Turang"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FanGraphs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FanGraphs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willy_Adames", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Willy Adames"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_against", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting average against"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mart\u00edn_P\u00e9rez_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mart\u00edn P\u00e9rez (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitting_streak", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hitting streak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhys_Hoskins", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rhys Hoskins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Brewers_Radio_Network", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Brewers Radio Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bally_Sports_Wisconsin", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bally Sports Wisconsin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Contreras", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William Contreras"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Yelich", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christian Yelich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_Runs_Saved", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Defensive Runs Saved"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfield", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Outfield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pkp4hYbLXqiM7d59U0WG0gWIk1Y=/0x0:3332x1666/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25525842/usa_today_23711025.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719753", "eventUri": "eng-9719753", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-01", "textStart": 467, "textEnd": 473, "freq": 3}], "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 458347669, "relevance": 2}

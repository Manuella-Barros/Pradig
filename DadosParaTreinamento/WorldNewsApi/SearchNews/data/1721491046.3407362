{"id": 237082220, "title": "As Chicago Cubs remain stuck under .500, eerily concerning offensive similarities to 2023 squad emerge", "text": "The Chicago Cubs learned the hard way last season how difficult and taxing it can be to dig out of a hole to stay in the postseason hunt. As the offense continues its six-week flounder, especially with runners in scoring position, it\u2019s creating an eerily similar and concerning trend as the Cubs approach the midpoint of the season. The Cubs\u2019 34-38 record entering Monday matches their mark last year through 72 games, except they feature a negative run differential (minus-17) instead of a positive run differential (plus-17). The timing of poor play nearly aligns with the timeframe of last year\u2019s costly slump, and as president of baseball operations Jed Hoyer acknowledged Monday afternoon, the offensive challenges are almost indistinguishable. \u201cWhen we came out of those struggles we hit,\u201d Hoyer said. \u201cYou go back and we were scoring eight, nine runs a game, we were opening games up and I think that\u2019s what\u2019s ultimately going to lead to us getting out of this rut this time is going to be scoring runs. We\u2019re going to have to do it the way we did last year.\u201d Their efforts to recover from falling 10 games under .500 took a toll, which concerns Hoyer if the Cubs keep dropping series. Being in chase mode makes it hard to give players days off and creates no margin for error. \u201cI hope not to relive that but, yeah, we need to start playing well soon to get out of that,\u201d Hoyer said. That it is again the offense falling short during this bad stretch makes the struggles particularly frustrating for Hoyer and the organization. For the pitching staff, the offensive slump puts unsustainable pressure on them to perfect. This becomes even more heightened for the relievers, most notably in the late innings when games have often featured the Cubs up or down a run or tied. The Cubs have already played in 29 one-run games (13-16), three more than any other team in the majors this season. Seven of the Cubs\u2019 last 12 games have been decided by one run (3-4). \u201cThat\u2019s a really hard way to live,\u201d Hoyer said. \u201cWe\u2019ve played the same game pretty much for over a month now.\u201d While Hoyer reiterated that the answers must come from the organization, he also made clear that does not mean he isn\u2019t on the phone all the time talking to other teams to look for possibilities. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be doing my job if I wasn\u2019t doing that,\u201d Hoyer said. \u201cI\u2019m also realistic about what the trade market is and the opportunity so I think that yes, of course, if there was the right offensive player that could come in and could spark us we would absolutely look into that. It\u2019s just very difficult to find this time of year.\u201d As Hoyer and the front office weigh their options in the coming weeks leading up to the July 30 trade deadline, the Cubs must determine how much prospect capital from a deep farm system they are willing to give up. \u201cThe team\u2019s performance is going to have a significant bearing on that,\u201d Hoyer said.", "summary": "The Chicago Cubs learned the hard way last season how difficult and taxing it can be to dig out of a hole to stay in the postseason hunt.", "url": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/2024/06/17/chicago-cubs-similarities-to-2023/", "image": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/CTC-L-Chicago-Cubs17_197065456.jpg?w=1024", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-18 00:18:36", "author": "Meghan Montemurro", "authors": ["Meghan Montemurro"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.281}

He's still a bit of a misanthrope. He's still egotistical, he's still a man-child in many ways. But we found way to make him funny without the baggage of that character from 35 years ago. Nobody wants to see that. So we try to find other ways for him to be funny and I think we've succeeded.\"\n\nLarroquette credits the show's writers with making him funny but Rauch says he's the secret weapon. \"It's that Buster Keaton quote that comedians do funny things but good comedians do things funny,\" she says. \"You can watch him pick up a pencil or just have a reaction and there's brilliance in every move and every look. It's a true master class getting to watch him work.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nOn the original series, several actors were over 6-feet tall. Now, because Rauch is under 5 feet, the disparity between her and Larroquette is noticeable.\n\n\"People would look at me in real life during the original and go, 'Oh my god, you're so much taller than I thought you were.'\" Now, it's much different.\n\nAs much as viewers remember the core actors on the original \"Night Court,\" \"there was almost a revolving door,\" the first years of the series, Larroquette says. Producer Reinhold Weege was looking for the right mix. \"The court clerks changed and certainly the defense attorney changed a lot, so it was finding its way.\"\n\nNow, the new \"Night Court\" has passed its shakedown period and, thanks to additions the second season, has what Larroquette calls a \"solid foundation.\"\n\nAfter the sixth season of the original, executives talked about spinning his Dan Fielding into his own series.\n\n\"I declined to do that because, I thought, it's a very indelible character and once this is over, (I want to) go on and hopefully do something else.\"\n\nThe talk subsided. Larroquette did his own show, won a Tony on Broadway for \"How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying\" and appeared in films and other television series.\n\nThen Rauch came calling.\n\nOnce Larroquette said yes and got involved, he realized the decision was a right one. Rauch and her husband, Executive Producer Winston Rauch, \"really had the heart of the show in their hands. I became sort of pleased with coming back. So much of my career was sort of buoyed by this show, so it's very important to me in many ways. I'd like to continue doing it for a while, if I can.\"\n\n\"Night Court\" airs on NBC and Peacock.\n\nClassic TV quotes that are now part of everyday vocabulary 'Heeeere's Johnny!'

So we try to find other ways for him to be funny and I think we've succeeded.\"\n\nLarroquette credits the show's writers with making him funny but Rauch says he's the secret weapon. \"It's that Buster Keaton quote that comedians do funny things but good comedians do things funny,\" she says. \"You can watch him pick up a pencil or just have a reaction and there's brilliance in every move and every look.

Producer Reinhold Weege was looking for the right mix. \"The court clerks changed and certainly the defense attorney changed a lot, so it was finding its way.\"\n\nNow, the new \"Night Court\" has passed its shakedown period and, thanks to additions the second season, has what Larroquette calls a \"solid foundation.\"\n\nAfter the sixth season of the original, executives talked about spinning his Dan Fielding into his own series.\n\n\"I declined to do that because, I thought, it's a very indelible character and once this is over, (I want to) go on and hopefully do something else.\"\n\nThe talk subsided. Larroquette did his own show, won a Tony on Broadway for \"How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying\" and appeared in films and other television series.\n\nThen Rauch came calling.\n\nOnce Larroquette said yes and got involved, he realized the decision was a right one. Rauch and her husband, Executive Producer Winston Rauch, \"really had the heart of the show in their hands. I became sort of pleased with coming back.

When he walked on the set of the reboot, Larroquette says he felt a sense of sadness.\n\n\"I am literally the only one left on the door, like Leo in 'Titanic,' and I wondered, 'Will I make it?'\" he says. \"It was a bit of a ghost town.\"\n\nWhen executive producer and star Melissa Rauch pitched the idea of a return, he told her, \"You don't need me. ...

It began to appeal to me,\" he says.\n\nNow, as the comedy nears its third season, the four-time Emmy winner says it is possible to go home again.\n\nDan Fielding, the character he played in both versions, hasn't changed in some ways.\n\n\"His ego is still larger than the room,\" Larroquette says. \"He's still a narcissist. He's still a bit of a misanthrope. He's still egotistical; he's still a man-child in many ways. But we found a way to make him funny without the baggage of that character from 35 years ago. Nobody wants to see that. So we try to find other ways for him to be funny, and I think we've succeeded.\"\n\nLarroquette credits the show's writers with making him funny but Rauch says he's the secret weapon.\n\n\"It's that Buster Keaton quote that comedians do funny things but good comedians do things funny,\" she says. \"You can watch him pick up a pencil or just have a reaction, and there's brilliance in every move and every look. It's a true master class getting to watch him work.\"\n\nOn the original series, several actors were over 6 feet tall. Now, because Rauch is under 5 feet, the disparity between her and Larroquette is noticeable.\n\n\" People would look at me in real life during the original and go, 'Oh my God, you're so much taller than I thought you were,'\" he says. Now, it's much diff erent.\n\nAs much as viewers remember the core actors on the original \"Night Court,\" \"there was almost a revolving door\" the first years of the series, Larroquette says. Producer Reinhold Weege was looking for the right mix. \"The court clerks changed and certainly the defense attorney changed a lot, so it was finding its way.\"\n\nNow, the new \"Night Court\" has passed its shakedown period and, thanks to additions the second season, has what Larroquette calls a \"solid foundation.\"\n\nAfter the sixth season of the original, executives talked about spinning his Dan Fielding into his own series.\n\n\"I declined to do that because, I thought, it's a very indelible character, and once this is over, (I want to) go on and hopefully do something else,\" he says.\n\nLarroquette went on to star in his own show. He also won a Tony on Broadway for \"How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying\" and appeared in films and other television series.\n\nThen Rauch came calling. Once Larroquette said yes and got in-\n\nvolved, he realized the decision was a right one. Rauch and her husband, executive producer Winston Rauch, \"really had the heart of the show in their hands,\" Larroquette says. \"I became sort of pleased with coming back.

He's still a bit of a misanthrope. He's still egotistical, he's still a man-child in many ways. But we found way to make him funny without the baggage of that character from 35 years ago. Nobody wants to see that. So we try to find other ways for him to be funny and I think we've succeeded.\"\n\nLarroquette credits the show's writers with making him funny but Rauch says he's the secret weapon. \"It's that Buster Keaton quote that comedians do funny things but good comedians do things funny,\" she says. \"You can watch him pick up a pencil or just have a reaction and there's brilliance in every move and every look. It's a true master class getting to watch him work.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack\n\nOn the original series, several actors were over 6-feet tall. Now, because Rauch is under 5 feet, the disparity between her and Larroquette is noticeable.\n\n\"People would look at me in real life during the original and go, 'Oh my god, you're so much taller than I thought you were.'\" Now, it's much different.\n\nAs much as viewers remember the core actors on the original \"Night Court,\" \"there was almost a revolving door,\" the first years of the series, Larroquette says. Producer Reinhold Weege was looking for the right mix. \"The court clerks changed and certainly the defense attorney changed a lot, so it was finding its way.\"\n\nNow, the new \"Night Court\" has passed its shakedown period and, thanks to additions the second season, has what Larroquette calls a \"solid foundation.\"\n\nAfter the sixth season of the original, executives talked about spinning his Dan Fielding into his own series.\n\n\"I declined to do that because, I thought, it's a very indelible character and once this is over, (I want to) go on and hopefully do something else.\"\n\nThe talk subsided. Larroquette did his own show, won a Tony on Broadway for \"How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying\" and appeared in films and other television series.\n\nThen Rauch came calling.\n\nOnce Larroquette said yes and got involved, he realized the decision was a right one. Rauch and her husband, Executive Producer Winston Rauch, \"really had the heart of the show in their hands. I became sort of pleased with coming back. So much of my career was sort of buoyed by this show, so it's very important to me in many ways. I'd like to continue doing it for a while, if I can.\"\n\n\"Night Court\" airs on NBC and Peacock.\n\nClassic TV quotes that are now part of everyday vocabulary Classic TV quotes that are now part of everyday vocabulary 'Heeeere's Johnny!'

When he walked on the set of the reboot, Larroquette said he felt a sense of sadness.\n\n\"I am literally the only one left on the door, like Leo in 'Titanic,' and I wondered, 'Will I make it?' It was a bit of a ghost town.\"\n\nWhen executive producer and star Melissa Rauch pitched the idea of a return, he told her, \"You don't need me...it stands on its own.\"\n\nAfter they talked, however, the now 76-year-old Larroquette realized it might be interesting to revisit a character he played more than three decades earlier. \"Where's the funny in him considering he can't be who he was in the '80s? It began to appeal to me.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

He's still a bit of a misanthrope. He's still egotistical, he's still a man-child in many ways. But we found way to make him funny without the baggage of that character from 35 years ago.

{"id": 223753168, "title": "'Furiosa,' 'Garfield' lead slowest Memorial Day box office in decades", "text": "\u201cThe Garfield Movie,\u201d animated and family-friendly, was the other big new offering this weekend from Sony\u2019s Columbia Pictures and Alcon Entertainment. It is claiming No. 1 for the four-day holiday weekend with an estimated $31.9 million in ticket sales through Memorial Day. Sony estimates its three-day earnings to be $24.8 million. Aside from Memorial Day in 2020 when theaters were closed due to COVID-19, these are the lowest earning No. 1 movies in 29 years, since \u201cCasper\u201d earned $22.5 million (not adjusted for inflation) in its first four days in 1995. Big earners are more typical for the holiday weekend, which has had ten movies crack $100 million, led by \u201cTop Gun: Maverick\u2019s\u201d record-setting $160 million launch in 2022. Last year, the live-action \u201cThe Little Mermaid\u201d joined the group with a $118 million debut. Audiences even turned out in greater numbers over the pandemic-addled weekend in 2021 for \u201cA Quiet Place Part II,\u201d which made over $57 million. \u201cFuriosa\u201d was never expected to join the $100 million opener club, which Warner Bros. released on 3,804 screens in the U.S. and Canada. But it was supposed to have a slightly stronger showing in the $40 million range over its first four days. That would have been more in line with its predecessor, \u201cMad Max: Fury Road,\u201d which opened to $45.4 million in May 2015. \u201cFury Road,\u201d starring Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy, went on to gross nearly $380 million worldwide.", "summary": "Movie theaters are looking more and more like a wasteland this summer. Neither &#8221; Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga &#8221; nor &#8221; The Garfield Movie &#8221; could save Memorial Day weekend, which is cruising towards a two-decade low. &#8221; Furiosa,&#8221; the Mad Max prequel starring Anya Taylor-Joy and Chris Hemsworth, claimed the first place spot [&#8230;]", "url": "https://nationalpost.com/pmn/entertainment-pmn/furiosa-garfield-lead-slowest-memorial-day-box-office-in-decades", "image": "https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/nationalpost/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Bais-Chaya-Mushka-Elementary-School-in-North-York..png?quality=5&strip=all&w=100&sig=7j1TMsAKK6s0x5B8-tHjWA", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 16:00:01", "author": "The Associated Press", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "language": "en", "source_country": "ca", "sentiment": -0.191}

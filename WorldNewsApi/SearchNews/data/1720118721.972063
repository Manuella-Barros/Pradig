Bellingham spoke to CBS Sports after the match to discuss a number of topics, including his role in the final and how he had dropped deeper than usual to get the ball. Ex-Arsenal forward Thierry Henry also mentioned that Bellingham does not get the credit he deserves for his work off the ball. Responding to that comment, Bellingham replied: \"I couldn't give a s*** really what people think.\" Henry and Carragher, along with Micah Richards were taken back by the comment and started laughing. Bellingham apologised immediately with Carragher then popping a joke following the comment he made which angered Kate Abdo's former boxer boyfriend.

It gets a bit hard at times and you wonder if it's worth it and all those kind of things. Nights like tonight make you realise. \"I was alright until I saw my mum and dad's face there, the amount of nights where they could be at home by seven o'clock and they're doing trips at 11, 12 at night to take me to football. My little brother who I try to be a role model for, I can't put it into words. It's the best night of my life.\" Join our new WhatsApp community and receive your daily dose of Mirror Football content.

They have been great behind the plate thanks to a loaded roster behind the plate where Jurickson Profar. They need to get their pitching fixed up because it has struggled this season as a unit, despite some additions to boost that part of the staff.\n\nProfar leads a star-studded lineup in San Diego with Jake Cronenworth, Manny Machado, Fernando Tatis Jr., and Jackson Merrill. They are the second-best offense in the MLB right now and show no signs of slowing down.\n\nThe season has been a bumpy ride in San Diego. They have not figured things out on defense. Yu Darvish and Michael King have been solid, but no one has been amazing. They added Dylan Cease in the offseason and he has been average and not lived up to the expectations he had going into the season.\n\nAs the Padres enter the second half of the season, they face an interleague foe in Cleveland Guardians to get things started. The Padres are well-positioned to go on a run in the second half of the season. They managed to hang on to a winning record heading into the All-Star break and should only get better as the season moves forward.\n\nThe San Diego Padres are poised to surpass the 83.5-win mark in the 2024 season. This could be seen as at least a little ambitious, but the Padres have a lot to like leading into the second half of the year.\n\nThe Padres have one of the best offenses in baseball, which has been led by a star-studded lineup of sluggers. They have depth and are versatile behind the plate. They have a top-five that is one of the best in baseball. Jurickson Profar, Jake Cronenworth, Manny Machado, Fernando Tatis Jr., and Jackson Merrill match up well with every team in baseball.\n\nThey should get better on the mound as time goes on this year. They have a good duo between Yu Darvish and Michael King. They need more out of Dylan Cease and Matt Waldron to round out the lineup and fortify the depth.\n\nThe Padres' schedule is not challenging during the rest of the season. The NL is not as good as the AL, so the Padres should be able to find some wins where needed this year to help them get over this number.\n\nThe Padres have the talent and depth to surpass the 83.5 win mark and sneak back into the playoffs after disappointing last year. The NL does not have much depth, so sneaking into the playoffs is not out of the realm of possibility.\n\nWhy the Padres Will Hit the Under\n\nThe San Diego Padres have a lot to like when looking at the second half of the MLB season. They have the offense, but it was a bumpy road to get through the first half of the year, and there is no reason to think it might not be more of the same from here on out.\n\nThe Padres have had issues with their pitching staff all season. The quality of play has not been where it should be. Michael King and Yu Darvish aside, no pitcher has done much to impress this year. Dylan Cease has not lived up to expectations and Joe Musgrove has struggled in the pitching lineup this season in San Diego.\n\nOn offense, things have been going well for the most part except for Xander Bogaerts. He has taken a step back this season after signing a massive contract after coming over from the Red Sox in free agency in 2022 before the 2023 season. The team disappointed last season and this year they are playing much better, but Bogaerts has not lived up to his end of the deal.\n\nFinally, the NL West is still one of the most competitive divisions in the MLB. The Dodgers are one of the best teams in the MLB and then the Diamondbacks are still the defending NL champions and are right there with the Padres. The schedule is also no walk in the park and still has its fair share of landmines.\n\nThe Padres have a path to hitting over this number, but they just as easily could miss it.\n\nFinal Padres 2024 Over/Under Win Total Prediction & Pick\n\nThe Padres have the Diamondbacks nipping at their heels in their division. However, the Padres have an offense that has been so good that they can hang with anyone in the MLB. That offense is the reason why they should hit over this number. Their pitching has not been all that impressive as a whole, but this offense can compete with anyone, so I think they will hit over this number just barely.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jake_faigus@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Jake Faigus", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurickson_Profar", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jurickson Profar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Cronenworth", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jake Cronenworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Tat\u00eds_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Fernando Tat\u00eds Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_Cease", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dylan Cease"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yu_Darvish", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Yu Darvish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manny_Machado", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manny Machado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Guardians", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Guardians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interleague_play", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interleague play"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Musgrove", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Musgrove"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Bogaerts", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Xander Bogaerts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_West", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National League West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Diamondbacks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Diamondbacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Red_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston Red Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Padres-2024-Over-Under-Win-Total-Prediction-Pick.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745220", "eventUri": "eng-9745220", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

Their 59-37 overall mark trails only Philadelphia (62-35).\n\n\"We've got a good balance where we are right now, somewhere between let's keep doing what we're doing and let's turn it up a lot,\" Bibee said. \"We're in a major buy-mode (at the trade deadline), I hope.\"\n\nBibee (8-4) worked 5 2/3 innings, limiting San Diego to two hits and not allowing a runner past second base. Cade Smith, Hunter Gaddis and Nick Sandlin wrapped up Cleveland's ninth shutout of the season.\n\n\"We've all known that Tanner is a bona fide ace,\" Fry said. \"Now, the whole league is finding out. They're circling his name and he's still putting up zeroes.\"\n\nLuis Arraez and Jake Cronenworth had two hits apiece for San Diego, which is 1 1/2 games out of the final NL wild-card spot. Arraez sat out the All-Star Game in Texas this week to rest his jammed left thumb.\n\n\"We started off pretty good and got Bibee's pitch count up, but we couldn't get anything going,\" San Diego third baseman Manny Machado said. \"We are hitting the ball hard, but right at people.\"\n\nThe Guardians took a 1-0 lead in the fifth on Daniel Schneemann's double off Matt Waldron (5-9). Fry scored on the play and went 3 for 3, three days after singling home a run in his All-Star debut.\n\nWaldron gave up six hits, did not issue a walk and struck out six. The righty was drafted by Cleveland and traded to the Padres in a nine-player deal that included Josh Naylor.\n\n\"Matt has been a stronghold for our pitching staff,\" Machado said. \"He's been doing really well.\"\n\nThe Padres, who have played an MLB-high 100 games, slipped to .500.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nPadres: OF Fernando Tatis Jr. (right leg stress reaction) missed his 18th straight game, but is swinging a bat and playing catch. \"It's still there -- the actual stress reaction -- but the swelling and fluid is pretty well gone,\" manager Mike Shildt said. \"That's obviously a positive.\"\n\nGuardians: LHP Matthew Boyd (Tommy John surgery) struck out seven over three innings, allowing an unearned run, in his initial rehab appearance for the Arizona Complex League Guardians.

At (50-49) they are tied ...\n\nThe San Diego Padres are a team to pay attention to as the second half of the MLB season begins. At (50-49) they are tied with the Arizona Diamondbacks for 2nd in the NL West Division. They ended the first half on a poor note, finishing 4-6 in their final 10 games. However, the Friars will be getting some crucial players back from injury in the next few weeks and that should help propel them to potential playoff contention. Stay with us as we make a Padres playoff prediction as the second half of the MLB season gets underway on Thursday.\n\nLet's be real, a team this talented should make the postseason. They had five players represent San Diego in the Summer Classic and even though they traded away Juan Soto before the year, they are getting almost the same offensive play from Jurickson Pofar, who is making just $1 million this season. The Padres then traded for one of the best hitters in the sport in Luis Arraez, who is 2nd in the league in hits behind Bobby Witt Jr. The Friars have the talent on offense to make a lot of noise.\n\nFernando Tatis Jr. is recovering from multiple injuries and will be back around early September, or earlier if all goes well. He was playing some of the best ball of his career before the injury. Yu Darvish is set to return to the rotation after recovering from an injury, as well as a personal matter. Joe Musgrove is still multiple weeks away but is lined up to return to the team before the postseason. Last but not least, Xander Bogaerts. The former WS champion returned to the lineup against the Atlanta Braves in the final series before the break. His presence is needed on the field and now the Padres have a full lineup if healthy. Remember, the Friars traded for Arraez right after the Bogaerts injury. Once healthy, they don't have any holes outside of catcher.\n\nJackson Merrill is by far the best offensive rookie in the National League. If it wasn't for Paul Skenes' historic season, Merrill would go on to win the NL ROY. To him, the award doesn't matter. If Merrill can continue to play the way he is at such a young age, then the franchise has a lot to look forward to. In Bleacher Report's latest top 10 \"right now\" center fielder's list, Merrill was right behind superstar, Aaron Judge.\n\nAs a team, the Padres are 2nd in the league in batting average at .261 behind the Houston Astros (.262). However, they lead the league in hits by 10 over the Astros as well. If they can put it all together offensively, then there is no telling why they can't make another postseason run as they did in 2022.\n\nWhy the Padres Won't Make the Playoffs\n\nThe Padres are a rollercoaster of a team. They show signs of being an elite club, and then proceed to go on a losing streak. Their inconsistency could be a major factor if they don't make the postseason.\n\nAnother thing is their injuries. The Friars have been banged up all season and that could cost them. It's going to be a close race to the end and the Padres need their stars available.\n\nThe National League is competitive. The Padres, Diamondbacks, St. Louis Cardinals, New York Mets, and Chicago Cubs should all be in the race toward the postseason. Two of those teams will make it unless the Atlanta Braves collapse, which is unlikely. However, the Braves are only four games up from the final Wild Card spot.\n\nFinal Padres 2024 Playoffs Prediction & Pick\n\nThe Padres are one game out from the final Wild Card spot. They have a tough month of July to begin the second half, but right after they play the Dodgers to end July, their strength of schedule drops drastically. They face the Pittsburgh Pirates twice, Colorado Rockies twice, and Miami Marlins for the first five series of August. Then, they face the Mets for a crucial series. If the Padres are in contention by then, then I expect them to capitalize against weaker opponents to work their way to the postseason for the 3rd time in five seasons.\n\nClick Here for more betting news & predictions", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_spiering@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Chris Spiering", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Bogaerts", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xander Bogaerts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Soto", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juan Soto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_West", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National League West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Diamondbacks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Diamondbacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Musgrove", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Musgrove"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yu_Darvish", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yu Darvish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Rookie_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Astros", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Houston Astros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleacher_Report", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bleacher Report"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Cardinals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St. Louis Cardinals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami Marlins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Center fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Judge", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Judge"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Youth", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill_or_Bust", "label": "dmoz/Games/Dice/Fill or Bust", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Padres-prediction-odds-to-make-2024-MLB-Playoffs.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745220", "eventUri": "eng-9745220", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

Only, like always, it is not close to a full half.\n\n\"We're more than over half the games played,\" president of baseball operations A.J. Preller said this week. \"We've basically got a 60-game sprint now.\"\n\nTo be exact, the Padres will play 63 more games en route to determining their fate. They are 50-49, one game back of the National League's final wild-card spot and one of six teams that are within 3 1/2 games. Amid a jumbled race, the first 61 percent of the season was uneven. It also left San Diego within striking distance of its goal.\n\n\"Probably the biggest thing is we're in contention,\" Preller said this week. \"We've had a team that has a lot of fight. We've had some moments where, offensively, we've put a lot of pressure on other teams. We've definitely had some big comeback wins and a team that looks like they're going to compete innings one through nine. And we're in a spot where I think we can play into October.\n\n\"But we also understand that we got to get better in some areas. ... I have a lot of confidence in (Padres manager Mike Shildt), the coaching staff and the players to get together and (go), 'Hey, what are the areas we need to improve on over the next few months to get to October?'\"\n\nHere are three storylines to watch as the Padres embark on the final 39 percent of their schedule.\n\nIf nothing else, Preller will not sit still. At minimum, he will try very hard to do something.\n\nThe looming question ahead of July 30: What more will he be allowed to do?\n\nPreller already has pulled off the sport's two biggest trades since the start of spring training, acquiring Dylan Cease in March and landing Luis Arraez in April. The Padres are roughly $12 million from the luxury tax threshold. An ownership group that remains in transition following the death of Peter Seidler, Preller's biggest supporter, appears determined to stay below that line. People around the industry, including some inside the organization, believe the Padres may have to make the postseason for Preller to keep his job.\n\nFor all the minor-league talent Preller has dealt away in the past decade, catcher Ethan Salas might be as untouchable as any prospect he's ever had. The Padres would need a star-level player with a relatively low salary to move 17-year-old shortstop Leodalis De Vries. Such a potential return very well might not exist. Even if Preller would consider moving one of his two best prospects, ownership might not let him. The success of Jackson Merrill, who was in high school just three years ago, is a point in favor of retaining Salas and De Vries.\n\nBut, with limited depth left in the farm system, the Padres will be challenged to obtain clear major-league upgrades. And in a market that includes few obvious sellers, other teams could more easily put together enticing packages for Garrett Crochet, Tarik Skubal or whomever else Preller fancies.\n\nAnother consideration: If the Padres play themselves out of contention in the next 10 days, would ownership prod Preller to explore a sell-off involving the likes of Ha-Seong Kim and Luis Arraez? Such a scenario seems unlikely, but the upcoming schedule is not easy; San Diego will return from the All-Star break with a three-city trip through Cleveland, Washington and Baltimore.\n\nShould the Padres make it to October, they cannot realistically expect to make much of a postseason run with their current cast of pitchers. Since June 1, the rotation has produced a 4.18 ERA. The bullpen has coughed up a 4.93 ERA. Joe Musgrove is hoping to return in August. Yu Darvish is uncertain to return this season. Even if both starters make it back, they would continue to be significant injury risks. Meanwhile, Michael King might be 50 innings or so from hitting a limit.\n\nThese are all reasons why Preller has been on the hunt for pitching reinforcements basically since he reeled in Arraez. The Padres must account for the likelihood of some internal attrition as they move deeper into the summer. At the upper levels of their system, there isn't much big-league-ready help. Adam Mazur's first seven starts with the team demonstrated the gap between Triple A and the majors could be as wide as ever.\n\nIn more encouraging developments, Dylan Cease ended an up-and-down first half with one of his best starts of the season. King and Matt Waldron have buoyed the rotation. Randy V\u00e1squez has been serviceable. Sean Reynolds showed well in his major-league debut.\n\nStill, the Padres need more, maybe much more, if they want to ensure 2021 does not repeat itself.\n\nThe Padres arguably did well to go into the break with an above-.500 record. Their five highest-paid players -- Manny Machado, Fernando Tatis Jr., Xander Bogaerts, Darvish and Musgrove -- have all played through injuries and/or missed chunks of time. Their best performer, Jurickson Profar, continues to manage patellar tendinitis. Arraez sat out the All-Star game to rest a left thumb that has bothered him since he jammed it in late June.\n\nBogaerts' recent return from a fractured shoulder should help an offense that has blown hot and cold. While the Padres do not have firm timetables for Darvish and Musgrove, Tatis also represents a major question mark. The star right fielder revealed last week that he initially feared he would miss the rest of the season after being diagnosed with a stress reaction in his right leg. Now, he's optimistic that he will be back at some point.\n\nMaybe Tatis returns in, say, late August and helps keep the Padres in contention (or helps propel them back into contention). Maybe he ends up needing more time than that. In any event, the Padres know not to expect Tatis, Musgrove and Darvish until sometime after the trade deadline. The statuses of those players could complicate the decision-making process as July 30 gets closer. Those players also could end up serving as impactful post-deadline additions.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dennis_lin@nytimes.com", "name": "Dennis Lin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Shildt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Shildt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._J._Preller", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "A.

Prior to their drop over the last two weeks, the Padres ranked No. 12 for three straight weeks. They have primarily ranked either 12th or 13th in MLB, making this one of their lowest rankings of the entire season.\n\nThe Padres recently held a 49-43 record that had them comfortably in second in the National League West, but lost two games each to the Seattle Mariners, Arizona Diamondbacks, and Atlanta Braves. They now are 50-49, and have fallen to third in the NL West, behind the Diamondbacks, who are 49-48.\n\nSan Diego is dealing with several injuries that could be holding them back, including injuries to their top two starters, Yu Darvish and Joe Musgrove. In addition, Fernando Tatis Jr. is out with a stress reaction in his femur and star hitter Luis Arr\u00e1ez is playing through a thumb injury.\n\nStill, the Padres have been a back-and-forth team for much of the year. They will regularly win a string of games, then lose most of their next games on the calendar. This losing streak is far from encouraging, but appears to be another part of the team's see-saw season.\n\nCompetition won't get any easier for the Padres when they return from the All-Star break on Friday.

Our MLB odds series has our Padres-Guardians prediction, odds, and pick for Saturday.\n\nThe Padres make the trip to Cleveland to face the Guardians! These two teams have been playing differently. The Guardians are playing great baseball and then the Padres have been inconsistent. However, neither team is playing well entering this matchup. Our MLB odds series has our Padres-Guardians prediction, odds, and pick for Saturday.\n\nLast Start: Pitched six innings and gave up zero runs on one hit with three walks and 11 strikeouts in a Padres win.\n\nLast Start: Pitched five innings and gave up two runs on three hits with three walks and two strikeouts in a Guardians win.\n\nThe Padres have been inconsistent but have an overall winning record of 50-49 this season. They have lost six out of their last seven games leading into this matchup. The key has been their offense this season where they are second in the league. In comparison, their pitching is in the bottom half of the MLB. Fernando Tatis, Manny Machado, Xander Bogaerts, Jurickson Profar, Jackson Merrill, and Jake Cronenworth have been the biggest keys behind the plate, and why the Padres have surprised a bit as a team. Their pitching needs help with only Michael King and Yu Darvish playing well so far up to this point in the season.\n\nThe Padres are starting Dylan Cease on the mound. He has an 8-8 record, a 3.99 ERA, and a 1.08 WHIP. Through 115 innings, he has allowed 54 runs on 88 hits with 36 walks and 149 strikeouts. He has started in 20 games so far this season and the Padres have gone 11-9 in those games. Cease has been inconsistent on the mound for the Padres this year, but he has more good games than bad this year. The Guardians have not been that impressive behind the plate, making this an interesting matchup in Cleveland.\n\nThe Padres' offense has been great this year. They are second in team batting average at .261 after finishing with a .244 average last season. The offense is highlighted mainly by Jurickson Profar and Fernando Tatis Jr. in most of the batting categories. Profar leads the way in batting average at .305, is tied with Tatis Jr. in home runs at 14, and leads in RBI at 59, in OBP at .394, and finally in total hits at 103. Their offense can compete with any team in the MLB. This is an interesting matchup against Williams for the Padres because Williams has been solid in a more limited capacity for the Guardians.\n\nWhy The Guardians Will Cover The Spread/Win\n\nThe Guardians have had a great season with a 58-37 heading into this series. Their bats are average this year, while their pitching has been a top-10 staff all year. Steven Kwan, Jose Ramirez, Andres Gimenez, Tyler Freeman, and Josh Naylor have carried the Guardians on offense. Tanner Bibee and Ben Lively have held down the fort in the pitching staff despite Shane Bieber getting Tommy John Surgery. They have been one of the best teams in the MLB this season, not just in the AL.\n\nThe Guardians are starting Gavin Williams on the mound. He has a 0-1 record, a 3.77 ERA, and a 1.40 WHIP. Williams allowed seven runs on 14 hits with six walks and nine strikeouts through 14.1 innings. In his three starts, the Guardians were 1-2 in those games. Williams has been solid in a limited capacity for the Guardians this year after missing time due to an injury. He gets a difficult matchup against the Padres and their red-hot offense behind the plate.\n\nThe Guardians are a talented team behind the plate but have been average this year. They are 16th in team batting average at .243 after finishing last season at .259. The offense is led by Jose Ramirez and Steven Kwan in almost every batting category. Kwan leads in batting average at .352 and in OBP at .407. Then, Ramirez leads in home runs at 23, in RBI at 77, and in total hits at 100. This offense has talent and has shown flashes, and they get an interesting matchup against Dylan Cease where he has been solid in his own right.\n\nFinal Padres-Guardians Prediction & Pick\n\nThe Guardians are the better team entering this matchup against San Diego. The difference in pitching is marginal between Dylan Cease and Gavin Williams, despite Cease having more experience this season. The Padres have a much better offense when compared to the Guardians. Since this should be a pitching duel, expect the Guardians to keep this close at home and cover and potentially win.\n\nClick here for more betting news and predictions", "source": {"uri":

The San Diego Padres open the second half of the season with a weekend series against the Guardians in Cleveland.\n\nIn the meantime, the Padres have been busy signing draft picks and making not-insigificant roster moves. Oh, and Fernando Tatis Jr. got some encouraging news. Catch up on all the headlines you might have missed:\n\nThe San Diego Padres made a significant selection in the eighth round of the MLB Draft by picking Nick Wissman from Dayton, marking the highest pick ever from the Dayton baseball program. This strategic choice underscores the Padres' commitment to harnessing top-tier talent from diverse sources.\n\nIn a strategic roster move, the Padres promoted outfielder Tirso Ornelas to their 40-man roster, assigning him to Triple-A El Paso. This decision comes in the wake of pitcher Yu Darvish's placement on the restricted list before the All-Star break.\n\nBreaking the mold, the Padres have signed Alex McCoy, a senior outfielder from Hofstra, who stood out not only for his athletic prowess but also for his strong academic achievements. McCoy joins the Padres as an undrafted free agent, pending a physical.\n\nThe Padres have once again tapped into local talent, selecting Jack Costello from the University of San Diego in the 10th round of the 2024 MLB Draft. Costello's selection marks only the ninth time the Padres have chosen a player from the University of San Diego.\n\nIn a relief to many, the latest medical scans brought positive news regarding Fernando Tatis Jr.'s right femur injury. His MRI offers a beacon of hope for Tatis' swift recovery and return to the field.\n\nPadres outfielder Jurickson Profar dispelled questions that a comment from Dodgers catcher Will Smith earlier this year sparked a rise in his performance, emphasizing that his improvements were self-motivated.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Municipal_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Municipal Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peoria_Javelinas", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peoria Javelinas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Fall_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Fall League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dayton,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dayton, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dayton, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Tat\u00eds_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fernando Tat\u00eds Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yu_Darvish", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yu Darvish"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple-A_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Triple-A (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Paso,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "El Paso, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "El Paso, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_San_Diego", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of San Diego"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstra_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hofstra University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Officiating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3324,h_1869,x_0,y_158/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/inside_the_padres/01j35pzdnr8am6a0wbg3.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745220", "eventUri": "eng-9745220", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

The team has already announced the games Friday and Saturday are sellouts.\n\nTanner Bibee, one of the only bright spots in the rotation in 2024, will take the mound opposite Matt Waldron, one of the few knuckleballers left in baseball.\n\nThis game was closer than the score indicates, but the Guardians opened the second half with a shutout win over the Padres Friday night. Nick Sandlin worked the ninth inning.\n\nGuardians break game open against Padres with six-run eighth inning\n\nThe Guardians gave themselves some breathing room in the eighth.\n\nAfter Jose Ramirez's two-run single, David Fry walked in a run, Brayan Rocchio brought home two runs with a single and Tyler Freeman tacked on another run with a sacrifice fly, making it 7-0.\n\nAnd with that, Emmanuel Clase, who was warming up, has sat back down. Nick Sandlin will pitch the ninth.\n\nJose Ramirez two-run single adds to Guardians lead over Padres\n\nWith two runners on, Angel Martinez popped up a bunt that Manny Machado fielded, but he then slipped, allowing Martinez to reach first base and load the bases for Jose Ramirez with nobody out.\n\nRamirez came through for the Guardians, singling back up the middle to score two runs and extend Cleveland's lead to 3-0. Ramirez is now at 79 RBIs, second in the AL behind only Aaron Judge.\n\nIt's sort of amazing that, if the season concluded tonight, Ramirez would likely earn his fourth MVP Finalist nod (top three) without winning once.\n\nHunter Gaddis pitches scoreless eighth; Guardians lead Padres by a score of 1-0\n\nEmmanuel Clase has gotten all the accolades, which is perhaps deserved, but Hunter Gaddis' value to the Guardians bullpen almost couldn't be overstated.\n\nGaddis pitched another scoreless eighth inning, as he's often done this season, and the Guardians are still holding onto a 1-0 lead. Gaddis' ERA is now 1.17.\n\nTanner Bibee taken out in sixth inning; Guardians lead Padres by one run\n\nTanner Bibee's day is done after 5\u2154 innings and 102 pitches. Bibee allowed only two hits, though he walked three and struck out three. Cade Smith entered the game and finished the sixth inning with the Guardians still holding onto a 1-0 lead.\n\nDaniel Schneemann RBI double gives Guardians lead over Padres\n\nThe deadlock has been broken.\n\nIn the fifth, Daniel Schneemann put the Guardians on top with an RBI double to right-center field, scoring David Fry.\n\nWill Brennan likely saves a run with sliding catch\n\nWith a runner on and two outs in the fifth, Luis Arraez drove a ball into the right-center gap. Will Brennan tracked it down and caught it while sliding, likely saving a run and keeping the game scoreless.\n\nGuardians, Padres scoreless through four innings\n\nKnuckleballer Matt Waldron is keeping the Guardians at bay thus far, as he's matched Bibee with four scoreless innings, two hits allowed and three strikeouts.\n\nTwo very different styles, nearly an identical stat line.\n\nGuardians, Padres score update: Tanner Bibee blanks San Diego through four innings of scoreless game\n\nTanner Bibee has looked strong tonight, tossing four scoreless innings thus far with only two hits allowed and three strikeouts. While much of the Guardians rotation has been in disarray all season, Bibee has continued to be one of the only constants.\n\nThe Guardians and Padres remain scoreless.\n\nPadres pitcher Matt Waldron makes catch, nearly hit in the head with a comebacker off the bat of Angel Martinez\n\nThey saw the double play is a pitcher's best friend, but in this case, a pitcher's best friend is reflexes.\n\nPadres pitcher Matt Waldron nearly took a line drive off his head only a few pitches into his outing, as Angel Martinez lined a ball right back to the mound. Waldron somehow contorted himself to not only get out of the way, but catch the liner as well.\n\nBelow is some pregame information.\n\nGuardians announce July 19, July 20 games are sellouts\n\nThe Guardians sold out both Friday's and Saturday's games, which will bring their total to 11 sellouts this season, the most since they had 13 in 2017.\n\nEmmanuel Clase closes out 2024 All-Star Game; David Fry hits RBI single, Steven Kwan scores for American League\n\nThe Guardians sent five representatives to the All-Star Game Tuesday night. All five entered the game, including Emmanuel Clase, who earned his second career All-Star save.\n\nJose Ramirez advances to second round of Home Run Derby\n\nThe Guardians are entering the deadline in first place in the American League Central and could be buyers ahead of July 30. Here's a breakdown of their top needs and targets.\n\nGuardians select Travis Bazzana with No. 1 overall pick in MLB Draft\n\nThe Guardians took Travis Bazzana with the first overall selection in the MLB Draft.\n\nHow can I watch, listen or stream the Cleveland Guardians game today?\n\nThe game will be televised on Apple TV+. It'll be broadcast on the radio by WTAM (1100-AM) and WMMS (100.7-FM).\n\nNext game on Guardians schedule\n\nThe Guardians open the second half with a seven-game homestand that includes three games

That was the Guardians' fifth win in the past seven meetings.\n\nThe visitors have bigger questions to answer. It's fair to wonder where the Padres' electric offense has disappeared to over the last few weeks. They haven't scored more than four runs in any of their past seven contests and were held to one run or fewer in four of those games.\n\nThere are too many proven hitters in this San Diego lineup for an extended slump, but I prefer to trust a Guardians team that keeps finding ways to win. Cleveland ranks ninth in the majors in runs scored and they're 44-6 this season when they score 5+ runs.\n\nWhile the Padres are sending ace Dylan Cease to the mound here with his 1.08 WHIP, he's struggled on the road lately, allowing 3+ runs in five straight starts away from Petco Park. He was chased in the fourth inning against the Rangers in his last road outing after giving up six runs on eight hits.\n\nIn the opposite dugout, Gavin Williams may be short on Big League experience but he's pitched well for Cleveland in his last two appearances, and I see him doing enough here before the Guardians' rock-solid bullpen takes over.\n\nI'm looking beyond these teams' sluggish offensive numbers just before the All-Star break and counting on their overall 2024 numbers to power a high-scoring game tonight.\n\nThe Guardians and Padres both rank in the top half of the league in runs, OPS, and OBP. The Over is 53-45 for San Diego this year and it's hard to envision a repeat of the visitors' four-hit effort while being shut out yesterday.\n\nThis also feels like a good spot for a Jose Ramirez prop. His batting average has dipped in July, but he had a multi-hit game last night and leads Cleveland with 44 extra-base hits this season.\n\nPlus, he's seen plenty of Cease over the years, with a 5-for-24 record and two career doubles under his belt against the right-hander.\n\nLearn how to bet a same-game parlay with these helpful tips and strategies.\n\nThe Guardians have gone Over their team total in 26 of their last 37 home games.

However, the Guardians scored six times in the eighth inning Friday en route to a 7-0 victory over the Padres.\n\nAll-Star players David Fry, Steven Kwan and Jose Ramirez combined for seven hits and three RBIs, and Tanner Bibee allowed two hits over 5 2/3 innings as the Guardians improved to 31-11 at home, where they've won 10 of their past 12 games and have lost just one series this year.\n\n\"This team is so much fun,\" Bibee told Apple TV. \"We're just playing baseball.\"\n\nMeanwhile, San Diego has been outscored 45-17 in losing seven of their past eight games. The Padres managed just four hits Friday, while their beleaguered bullpen allowed six runs and owns a 10.00 ERA over the last nine games.\n\nDespite this tough stretch, San Diego is still in the wild-card hunt in the crowded National League.\n\n\"We're in contention,\" Padres general manager A.J. Preller said on the club's website. \"That's where you want to be ... Now, it's definitely about things we can improve on.\"\n\nSaturday's scheduled Padres starter, Dylan Cease (8-8, 3.99 ERA), went 4-0 with a 1.38 ERA in his first five 2024 road starts but is 0-3 with a 9.53 ERA in the last five away from home. That includes allowing 13 runs, 15 hits, four homers and five walks over 7 1/3 innings of his last two road starts.\n\nHowever, the right-hander allowed one hit, three walks and struck out 11 over six innings of his most recent start -- a 4-0 home victory against Atlanta on July 13.\n\n\"I think I finally got some things to sync up,\" Cease said. \"You just kind of have to battle until you can kind of get it to click.\"\n\nCease is 5-5 with a 3.96 ERA in 12 career starts against the Guardians, all coming with the Chicago White Sox.\n\nCleveland's Josh Naylor, Andres Gimenez and Kwan -- who is batting a major-league-best .354 -- are a combined 19-for-58 (.328) with five doubles and two triples vs. Cease. Teammate Will Brennan is 4-for-8 with a homer against him.\n\nScheduled Guardians starter Gavin Williams (0-1, 3.77 ERA) allowed five runs and seven hits in four innings of his 2024 debut against the White Sox on July 3 after dealing with elbow inflammation since late March. However, the right-hander has yielded just one run and seven hits over 10 1/3 innings of two starts since.\n\nThat run, plus three walks, came through five of those innings at Tampa Bay in his most recent outing July 13.\n\n\"It's still a work in progress, getting him back into the competitive intensity,\" Guardians pitching coach Carl Willis told the Medina (Ohio) Gazette.\n\n\"He's always shown the ability we saw (against the Rays). We saw it numerous times,\" Willis added of Williams posting a 3.29 ERA in 16 starts as a rookie in 2023.\n\nWilliams will get his first look at San Diego All-Star Luis Arraez, who with two hits

Their 59-37 overall mark trails only Philadelphia (62-35).\n\nBibee (8-4) worked 5 2/3 innings, limiting San Diego to two hits and not allowing a runner past second base. Cade Smith, Hunter Gaddis and Nick Sandlin wrapped up Cleveland's ninth shutout of the season.\n\nThe Padres, who have played an MLB-high 100 games, slipped to .500. They are 1 1/2 games out of the final NL wild-card spot.\n\nLuis Arraez led off and served as San Diego's designated hitter, going 2 for 4. The third-time All-Star sat out the Midsummer Classic in Texas this week to rest his jammed left thumb.\n\n\"I know he wanted to play, but being the team guy he is, Luis decided to hold himself out,\" manager Mike Shildt said before the game. \"I think it did his thumb a lot of good.\"\n\nThe Guardians took a 1-0 lead in the fifth on Daniel Schneemann's double off Matt Waldron (5-9). Fry scored on the play and went 3 for 3, three days after singling home a run in his All-Star Game debut.\n\nWaldron gave up six hits, did not issue a walk and struck out six. The righty was drafted by Cleveland and traded to the Padres in a nine-player deal that included Josh Naylor.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nPadres: OF Fernando Tatis Jr. (right leg stress reaction) missed his 18th straight game, but is swinging a bat and playing catch. \"It's still there -- the actual stress reaction - but the swelling and fluid is pretty well gone,\" Shildt said. \"That's obviously a positive.\"\n\nGuardians: LHP Matthew Boyd (Tommy John surgery) struck out seven over three innings, allowing an unearned run, in his initial rehab appearance for the Arizona Complex League Guardians. Boyd is targeting mid-August for his return to the majors.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPadres RHP Dylan Cease (8-8, 3.99 ERA) takes on Guardians RHP Gavin Williams (0-1, 3.77 ERA) in the second game of the series. Cease has thrown 1,078 breaking balls over his 20 starts, the most in the majors.\n\n---\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that the Guardians scored six runs in the eighth inning, not ninth.",

The Padres are just one game back of the third Wild Card spot and have the star-studded lineup to make a run. They also have a General Manager in A.J. Preller who is known to make big trades and has not been shy in doing so already this season. Dylan Cease went from the Chicago White Sox to the Padres before the season started and Luis Arraez came in from Miami in May. How could trade deadline additions of Jazz Chisholm Jr., Yusei Kikuchi, and Isaac Paredes help the Padres get back to the playoffs?\n\nStarting help from Yusei Kikuchi\n\nWith Joe Musgrove and Yu Darvish both sidelined for the better part of a month, the Padres need starting pitcher depth. Across the continent, the Toronto Blue Jays are sputtering in last place in the American League East. With Kikuchi headed to free agency after this season, the Blue Jays should be cashing in on his value.\n\nThe Padres have four starters under team control for 2025, Darvish, Musgrove, Cease, and Michael King, so there would be no pressure to keep Kikuchi this winter. All things considered, this would be on the lower end of MLB trade deadline returns. The Blue Jays need outfield help in their prospect pipeline and they'll get some in this proposal.\n\nThe Padres' star outfielder Fernando Tatis Jr. will be out for an extended period with a stress reaction in his right leg. While Tatis will not be out for the entire season, it is still imperative to replace his production in the interim. The Wild Card race can get away from any of these teams very quickly and Jazz Chishom Jr. would help plug the hole offensively and defensively.\n\nLuis Arraez's current injury situation also must be considered when looking at a Chisholm trade. The Marlins have been playing Chisholm at second base for the first time since 2022 in recent weeks which would help the Padres if Arraez continues to battle his thumb injury.\n\nThe Marlins are looking for infielders to boost their pipeline and they will take advantage of the Padres' depth in that category. Because Chisholm has two more years of team control, this will be a higher price than our first proposal.\n\nPadres receive: INF/OF Jazz Chisholm Jr.\n\nMarlins receive: SS Leodalis De Vries (SD #4, OVR #80), INF/OF Graham Pauley (SD #6), C J.D. Gonzalez (SD #12)\n\nLong-term addition from Isaac Paredes\n\nReturning to the AL East, the Tampa Bay Rays are not having the season they hoped for and could part with infielder Isaac Paredes. With three years of team control after 2024, Paredes would be another versatile infielder to add to San Diego's diamond. He has played at first, second, and third during his career and has hit for power in his time with Tampa Bay.\n\nTampa Bay has a recent track record of producing top-notch starting pitching, namely Blake Snell and Tyler Glasnow, but their pipeline does not have the pitching depth needed to continue that trend. They will target San Diego's arms in their prospect pool in their return for Paredes.\n\nPadres receive: INF Isaac Paredes\n\nRays receive: RHP Dylan Lesko (SD #3, OVR #78), LHP Austin Krob (SD #9), C Brandon Valenzuela (SD #11)\n\nThe Padres have the pieces to make a deep run in the National League this postseason but will need to make a move to fulfill that promise. The trade market is plentiful and considering their history of making deals, it would be surprising if San Diego sat out the MLB trade deadline.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType":

Mandatory Credit: Ken Blaze-USA TODAY Sports / Ken Blaze-USA TODAY Sports\n\nIt took a few innings for the Cleveland Guardians to get back on track following the All-Star Break, but the offense came up big late against the San Diego Padres, giving them a win in the series opener, 7-0.\n\nHere are three observations and takeaways from the Guardians' latest victory.\n\nTanner Bibee didn't pitch a bad game against the Padres, but he certainly wasn't as efficient as he would've liked, either. He only gave up five base runs (two hits and three walks) but threw 5.2 innings, gave up zero runs, and struck out three batters.\n\nBibee's biggest issue on Friday was Padre hitters getting deep into counts. His pitch count was above 50 after the third inning, and the Apple TV+ broadcast mentioned that San Diego had over 30 foul balls against Bibee.\n\nThere were a lot of positives to take away from this start, but Bibee has to figure out how to get hitters away earlier so he can get deeper into games.\n\nDavid Fry is coming fresh off his first All-Star appearance of his career. However, there were some questions heading into the break about whether he should still be an everyday player.\n\nThe 28-year-old started the second half of the season strong, going for three-for-three against the Padres. This included an RBI via a bases-loaded walk and coming around to score two of Cleveland's seven runs.\n\nThe biggest standout was how Fry was patient and continued to work counts against the Padres' pitching. Yes, Fry is a power hitter when he gets ahold of a ball, but what makes him such a good hitter is his plate presence.\n\nIf the Guardians want to be a contender down the stretch, they need Fry to be the player he was in May and June. This performance is a great way for him to get back on track for the final two months of the season.\n\nCleveland's biggest problem heading into the All-Star Break was getting the big hit when they needed it the most. However, the Guardians refound that magic following the first game out of the hiatus.\n\nThe Guardians' offense was mostly quiet throughout the night, but they put together a six-run eighth to put the game out of reach for the Padres. Cleveland hit .444 (4-for-9) with runners in scoring position, which was their calling card earlier in the season and it's a great sign they refound this clutch gene.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Guardians", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Guardians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Kwan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steven Kwan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Progressive Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Left fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_TV+", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple TV+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_count", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitch count"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foul_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Foul ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Power hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clutch_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Clutch (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoring_position", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scoring position"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Sabermetrics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_5509,h_3098,x_0,y_225/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/cleveland_baseball_insider/01j371cpjdn7cypkcjce.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745220", "eventUri": "eng-9745220", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2019-07-", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 6}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

Given both teams' recent struggles at the plate, Waldron and Bibee could use today to lower their ERAs.\n\n* Jurickson Profar leads the charge for the Padres with a .305 batting average and 103 hits, rounding out with 14 home runs and 59 RBIs.\n\n* The Guardians' offensive leans heavily on Jose Ramirez, who leads his team with 23 home runs and 77 RBIs, not to mention his standout 100 hits this season.\n\n* Padres hitters finished the first half leading all of MLB in hits (876), and rank first in the National League in batting average (.261). It's the 1st time in Padres' club history in which they led the Majors in hits prior to the ASG, and it's just the 2nd time they led the NL in average (only other time was 1992 at .263).", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petco_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Petco Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Braves", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Braves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starting_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Starting pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurickson_Profar", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jurickson Profar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Minor League", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Softball/Slowpitch", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Officiating", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3182,h_1789,x_0,y_167/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/inside_the_padres/01j36kny2y68aqygbnsn.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745220", "eventUri": "eng-9745220", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2012-07-", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 6}], "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

The Guardians have hit .229 and averaged 3.4 runs over those 18 games, and they have been shut out twice in the past three.\n\n\"We'd all sign up to be where we are,\" first-year Guardians manager Stephen Vogt said. \"Maybe not how (the All-Star break) got here or why or whatever.\n\n\"We're not even close to being done.\"\n\nDespite the Guardians' recent struggles, Steven Kwan is hitting a major league-best .352, Jose Ramirez is tied for third in the majors with 77 RBIs and Emmanuel Clase leads the American League with 29 saves. Meanwhile, Cleveland's bullpen has an MLB-best 2.62 ERA and the club is 30-11 at home, where it has lost just one series this season.\n\nScheduled Cleveland starter Tanner Bibee (7-4, 3.77 ERA) posted a 1.50 ERA while winning his final three June starts, but has yielded eight runs, 11 hits and five walks over 11 2/3 innings while going 0-2 in July. The right-hander was also roughed by the Padres last season, allowing six runs, eight hits and two walks over four innings in his only appearance against San Diego.\n\nYet, Vogt is excited about his club's return to the diamond.\n\n\"It's going to be really fun and come back Friday ready to go,\" Vogt added.\n\nThe Padres, meanwhile, haven't had much fun of late, either. San Diego is one game over .500 and a game out of the final wild-card spot in the crowded NL but has lost eight of 12.\n\nAfter opening their final home stretch before the break with a 10-8 victory over Arizona on July 5, the Padres were outscored 38-17 while going 1-6 against the Diamondbacks, Seattle Mariners and Atlanta Braves during the rest of the homestand.\n\n\"We need to find a way to be better,\" said San Diego All-Star Jurickson Profar, who is batting .305 with 14 homers and 59 RBIs, all leading the team.\n\n\"We just need to find a way to come in the second half and play consistently good baseball.\"\n\nIf that's to be, San Diego's bullpen needs to improve after posting an 8.64 ERA in the past eight games.\n\nThus, Padres manager Mike Shildt could use another lengthy outing from scheduled starter Matt Waldron (5-8, 3.71 ERA), who has lasted at least six innings in eight of his past nine starts. The right-hander went seven against Atlanta in his last start July 12 and allowed three of his four runs on two homers.\n\nTeammate Xander Bogaerts has been a bright spot of late for the Padres with two hits in each of the two games since his return from missing nearly two months with a shoulder injury. He has batted .311 with nine home runs and 32 RBIs in 48 career games against Cleveland.\n\nMeanwhile, fellow San Diego star Fernando Tatis Jr. continues to work his way back from a leg injury that's kept him out since June 21.\n\n--Field Level Media", "source": {"uri": "theolympian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The  Olympian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "field_level_media@theolympian.com",

Start with pitching. Stir in offensive consistency.\n\nWho, though, can impact the team and the road to come most?\n\nThose thought calisthenics led to picking a pitcher and position player who have the potential to shoulder-shake fates and fight off the storm clouds when the weather sours.\n\nOn the mound, it's Dylan Cease. It's Dylan Cease because he's Dylan Cease. It's also Cease because of injuries to Yu Darvish and Joe Musgrove and the innings odometer that's running on Michael King.\n\nThe Padres' starting rotation is seemingly being held together with duct tape.\n\nIf Cease is not the dependable anchor he's showed he can be, no amount of tape will be enough. It's already a huge ask for those left to keep the ship from listing with the uncertainty of the injuries to Darvish and Musgrove.\n\nDarvish, now on the restricted list for an unexplained personal issue, might not come back at all.\n\nThere is no margin of error for a staff already stretched as thin as typing paper. Though King and knuckleballer Matt Waldron have held the line admirably, Cease is the proven commodity. Over 20 starts with San Diego, Cease is 8-8 with a 3.99 ERA. In spite of a down start here and there, his ability to wipe out hitters remains unmistakable. Cease's 149 strikeouts rank first in the National League and second in the majors; only Chicago White Sox lefty Garrett Crochet (150) has more.\n\nWith Cease shining, the Padres look like a playoff team. Without him? Shudder.\n\nThe Padres need only rewind to the postseason losses of arms Mike Clevinger and Dinelson Lamet in 2020 with the Dodgers on deck to show what a decapitated rotation means when the lights shine brightest.\n\nIf Cease can be good or at least dependably solid, there's pitching to fill some gaps with the trade deadline looming. There's no replacement for him, however.\n\nAmong position players, nobody matters more than Manny Machado. He's been banged up and is coming off an offseason right elbow extensor tendon surgery, so it's hard to know what he could be -- or not be -- by season's end.\n\nWhen Machado is good, the Padres are good. The math is that simple.\n\nSome argue that the healthy and productive return of Fernando Tatis Jr. matters just as much, if not more. There's truth in that, but this is Machado's clubhouse. The Padres feast on his confidence and swagger.\n\nIf Machado is rolling, the Padres roll.\n\nWhen the Padres reached the playoffs in pandemic-shortened 2020, Machado finished third in National League MVP voting with a robust 160 OPS+. In 2022, when the team marched to the NLCS, he finished as an MVP runner-up with 32 home runs and 102 RBIs.\n\nThe production slipped by Machado's lofty standards in 2023, and the Padres missed the playoffs. Machado hit just .258 with an OPS+ of 113, his lowest total since his second season in the big leagues.\n\nThough he hit 30 home runs and finished with 91 driven in, the Padres need more consistent contact along the way.\n\nThe Machado talk assumes coal-shovelers like Jurickson Profar, Jackson Merrill and Luis Arraez continue doing the types of things that propelled them to Tuesday's All-Star Game.\n\nGetting over the hump? Making a run? Creating a cushion? That's where Machado can find another gear and carry a team. Machado has caught fire over the last month, hitting .326 with seven home runs, 19 RBIs and an OPS of .942. The surge has boosted his season totals to a .267 average with 13 homers, 52 RBIs and a .742 OPS.\n\nWill it help if Jake Cronenworth gets hot? If Xander Bogaerts comes back and rediscovers his Boston stroke? If the catching platoon of Kyle Higashioka and Luis Campusano delivers a bit of pop? Of course.\n\nMachado can be a full-fledged game-changer, though.\n\nIn his career, Machado's average and OPS have been 14 and 35 points lower after the break. The Padres can't afford a slide, even a subtle one. They need Machado to be better and do more.\n\nThe National League is a tangled, tantalizing mess. Nine teams remain at least 3 1/2 games from a Wild Card spot. A player or two elevating things can matter mightily as the sorting process gains steam.\n\nThe importance of Cease and Machado are connected, despite the differing roles. If Machado heats up, he needs the pitcher to keep the rotation whole. If Cease holds up his end, he needs Machado to spark more run scoring.\n\nIf the pair excels, though, the ability of the Padres to consistently win ramps up.\n\nThis isn't about catching the Dodgers in the NL West or competing with the Phillies. Not right now.\n\nIt's about doing enough to make the playoffs, then hoping you're healthy and can score enough to trip up teams like that when the moment matters most.", "source": {"uri":

The Padres have lost seven of their last eight.\n\nJose Ramirez and defensive replacement Brayan Rocchio drove in two runs each with singles for the big hits in the eighth. David Fry ended a 3 for 3 night with a bases loaded walk and Tyler Freeman drove in the final run of the inning with a sacrifice fly.\n\nSingles by Bo Naylor, Steven Kwan and Angel Ramirez off Stephen Kolek loaded the bases to start the inning.\n\nSan Diego right-hander Matt Waldron, part of the Guardians' past, made things difficult for their hitters Friday. Waldron, the only pitcher to throw a knuckleball in the big leagues this year according to Statcast, held the Guards to one run over six innings.\n\nWaldron (5-9, 3.59) threw 97 pitches, 50 of them floated like a butterfly and stung like a bee. As Chris Bando, former Indians catcher once said, \"catching a knuckleball is like trying to catch a butterfly with a blanket.\"\n\nThe knuckler dazzled the Guardians for four scoreless innings. It extended Cleveland's scoreless streak to 14 innings going back to before the All-Star break.\n\nThe Guards ended that trail of frustration in the fifth when they took a 1-0 lead on Daniel Schneemann's double. Fry, who singled in the second, hit a hard grounder that Manny Machado played off his body as Fry reached on his second hit of the night.\n\nAndres Gimenez moved Fry to second with a sacrifice bunt, his second of the season. The outbreak of little ball paid off as Fry went to third on a wild knuckler and scored on Schneemann's double to right center.\n\nUntil Schneemann's double, the Guardians were hitting .163 (7 for 43) with runners in scoring position going back to July 8 in Detroit. One of the reasons behind the Guardians' rise to first place in the AL Central has been their ability to hit in the clutch.\n\nWaldon recovered quickly. He retired Will Brennan on a foul pop to catcher Kyle Higashioka and struck out Bo Naylor for the second time in as many at-bats.\n\nThe Guardians drafted Waldon in the 18th round in 2019. They sent him to the Padres as the player to be named to complete the nine-player deal that sent Mike Clevinger to the Padres in August 2020.\n\nBibee pitched into the sixth inning, retiring the first two batters he faced. He was replaced by Smith with Machado at the pate. Smith struck out Machado to protect the 1-0 lead.\n\nToo many pitches meant a short night for Bibee. It took him 102 pitches to get 17 outs.\n\nStill, he didn't allow a run and held the Padres to two hits and three walks. He struck out three.\n\nThe Padres' only threat against Bibee came in the third when Luis Arraez doubled off left fielder Kwan's glove. Kwan tried to make a sliding catch against Arraez near the foul line, but the ball bounced out of his glove.\n\nThe inning ended when Jurickson Profar grounded out to second.\n\nNext: RHP Gavin Williams (0-1, 3.77) vs. RHP Dylan Cease (8-8, 3.99) Saturday at 7:10 p.m. Bally Sports Great Lakes, WTAM, WMMS and the Guardians radio network will carry the game.", "source": {"uri":

It's statistically true, there's no denying it.\n\nThat, though, does not account for timing and situation and mojo-fostering momentum when its needed most.\n\nThe Padres know that living around .500 is risky living, especially in the knotted National League, where a gaggle of teams could play themselves firmly into the playoff hunt with a run or flatten tires and crash into the curb.\n\nThere are only 62 games left after Friday's 7-0 loss to the Guardians that unraveled down the stretch at Progressive Field.\n\n\"It just got away from us,\" Padres manager Mike Shildt said.\n\nThe Guardians offered a master class in transforming little things into big and game-altering things. The difference between winning and losing games, making or not making the playoffs, can be as small as the fifth inning.\n\nDesignated hitter David Fry led off with a ball Manny Machado bobbled at third that was ruled a hit. Andres Gimenez moved him along with a sacrifice bunt and Daniel Schneemann doubled for the game's first run.\n\nAn inning that felt harmless became anything but that.\n\nThe real pain, however, was yet to come.\n\nIn the eighth, the Guardians pieced together a patchwork that looked like a bad Etch A Sketch in the scorebook, but a Picasso on the scoreboard. Bo Naylor rifled a ball off of reliever Stephen Kolek, ricocheting it toward third for a single.\n\nIt was like a snowball gaining steam and becoming a mountain-clearing avalanche.\n\nSteven Kwan blooped a single. Angel Martinez popped up a bunt, but a charging Machado who had been playing in slid, losing his footing on the wet grass. Instead of chasing down an out and possibly doubling up another runner, it loaded the bases with no outs.\n\nJose Ramirez drove in two by sneaking a ball past drawn-in second baseman Xander Bogaerts. Josh Naylor was hit by a pitch. Fry walked to plate another run.\n\nThen pinch hitter Brayan Rocchio, a .210 hitter, blooped a two-run single to short right.\n\nThis series and stretch is about power washing the palate to erase the bitter and briny taste of 2023, where the Padres missed the playoffs by two games to a team that tip-toed all the way to the World Series.\n\nIt's about winning enough now to weather the storm until All-Star and Gold Glove outfielder Fernando Tatis Jr. returns, along with front-line starter Joe Musgrove.\n\nIt might not be about playing their way into it for the Padres right now, as much as ensuring they don't play their way out of it.\n\nThe AL Central-leading Guardians now and AL East-pacing Orioles later make this roadtrip, with apologies to the Nationals sandwiched in between, as tricky as it is important.\n\nThe pair are talented and stingy, making every possible win amplified. The longer a team can keep their nose in things, especially when the sledding toughens, the better the chances others stub toes along the way.\n\n\"There's not a lot of games left,\" Padres first baseman Jake Cronenworth said. \"It's very short stretch.\"\n\nFor the first time in franchise history, the Padres led the majors in hits (876) at the All-Star break. It's just the second time ever, and first since 1992, that the club led the NL in batting average (.261) at this point.\n\nNo team has played more than the 100 games by the Padres, who started the season against the Dodgers in South Korea. But they've struck out the least.\n\nThe size and timing of that contact matters mightily, a Friday along Lake Erie reminded. And four hits is not nearly enough.\n\nThe inability to score magnified the unjust fate of Padres starter Matt Waldron, who pitched into the seventh while allowing one scratched-out run with five strikeouts and no walks.\n\n\"He was fantastic,\" Shildt said. \"A-plus.\"\n\nThe frustrations of the night were bundled into a Machado strikeout to end the sixth inning. He spiked his batting helmet, flipping his bat into a gymanstics-floor-routine tumbling run that finished in a screen in front of field-level seats.\n\nThe level of urgency and energy, frankly, felt refreshing.\n\n\"Just get him in the zone, that's all,\" Machado said of his irritation with that at-bat. \"I think those pitches were off. ... You put yourself in a hole real quickly there.\"\n\nAs much as Shildt despises the words roller coaster to define his team, the Padres streaked to a 12-3 mark from June 19-July 5 after losing five straight.\n\nThey've now lost seven of the last eight.\n\n\"Every game is important at this point,\" Bogaerts said. \"The whole road trip is important. This is another good time to answer back. I think we've proven enough times this year we're capable of doing that.\"\n\nIs anything lost? No, not yet, but a clear opportunity was missed.", "source": {"uri": "sandiegouniontribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "San Diego Union-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bryce_miller@sandiegouniontribune.com", "name": "Bryce Miller", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manny_Machado", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Manny Machado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Shildt", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Shildt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_San_Diego_Union-Tribune", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The San Diego Union-Tribune"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Progressive Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrifice_bunt", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sacrifice bunt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Designated hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Kwan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steven Kwan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Glove_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold Glove Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo_Naylor", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bo Naylor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Tat\u00eds_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fernando Tat\u00eds Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Naylor", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Josh Naylor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Musgrove", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Musgrove"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xander_Bogaerts", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Xander Bogaerts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunt_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bunt (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_by_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hit by pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Second baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinch_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pinch hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Out (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Ram\u00edrez_(infielder)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00edrez (infielder)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Cronenworth", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jake Cronenworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "South Korea"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rounders", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rounders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Skyline_Fallback_Image_flat.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745220", "eventUri": "eng-9745220", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-19", "dateEnd": "2024-07-05", "textStart": 4448, "textEnd": 4462}], "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 152, "relevance": 1}

He also has 48 K's and has allowed 20 walks in 10 starts.\n\nTanner Bibee (7-4) with a 3.77 ERA, 123 strikeouts, 1.12 WHIP in 105 innings.\n\nLast Start: 7.0 innings, five hits, four earned runs, three walks, and eight K's in the 5-4 loss to the Detroit Tigers.\n\n2024 Home Splits: (3-2) with a 4.69 ERA, 59 K's, 12 walks in 48 innings. He pitches much better on the road.\n\nThe Padres were well represented in Texas for the All-Star Game. Luis Arraez and Fernando Tatis Jr. did not play but Jurickson Profar, Jackson Merrill, and Robert Suarez all contributed. The Friars are loaded with talent but have had trouble putting it all together in the first half of the season. At 50-49, the Friars are one game out of a Wild Card spot in the NL. They are in a good position to make the postseason but need to get healthy and the offense needs to get hot again. The Padres' offense remains the league's best in terms of hits as they lead the league with 876 (10 more than the Astros).\n\nThe rotation has been good for the most part, however, they are holding on for dear life with the injuries to Joe Musgrove and Yu Darvish. Waldron, Dylan Cease, and Michael King are holding down the fort until those two return, but the other two starters, Adam Mazur and Randy Vasquez have not been good. The Padres have also lost the last three games that Waldron has started but he also has four quality starts in his last six starts.\n\nWhy The Guardians Will Cover The Spread/Win\n\nCleveland ended the first half with the best record in the American League and second-best overall. As a result, they were also well represented in Texas. Emmanuel Clase, Jose Ramirez, Steven Kwan, Josh Naylor, and David Fry all played roles in the AL's win. The Guardians can hit and pitch at an elite level. Kwan leads the league in batting average at .352 while Jose Ramirez is putting up another MVP-caliber season with 23 homeruns and 77 RBIs. Josh Naylor (who was traded to Cleveland from the Padres), is also having a stellar offensive year with 22 homers and 70 RBIs. The Padres right-handed pitchers will have a tough time against those three stars.\n\nBibee has been the Guardians' top hurler. Ben Lively is a close second but the Guardians win more often than not when Bibee is on the mound. He leads with a 1.2 WAR while being 13th in the league in Ks with 123. His WHIP is top 25 also while having a top 40 ERA. If he is on his game, then the Guardians should cover this spread.\n\nFinal Padres-Guardians Prediction & Pick\n\nThis is going to be a fun series kicked off by a great pitching matchup for the opener. If Matt Waldron can control his knuckleball, then the Guardians will have a tough time hitting. However, I feel like the Guardians will have a slight edge in this one with Bibee starting anyway. Take the Guardians to win and the over at 7.5.\n\nClick here for more betting news and predictions", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors":

Then the Guardians opened the scoring in the bottom of the fifth.\n\nFry opened the inning by reaching on an infield single when Padres third baseman Manny Machado couldn't handle the ground ball. Fry went to second on Andres Gimenez's sacrifice bunt, then to third via Waldron's wild pitch before scoring when Schneemann split the right field gap.\n\nThings remained quiet until the bottom of the eighth when San Diego's Stephen Kolek loaded the bases with nobody out.

One out later, Brayan Rocchio added a two-run single and Tyler Freeman delivered a sacrifice for a 7-0 lead.\n\nCleveland relievers Cade Smith, Hunter Gaddis and Nick Sandlin yielded two singles over 3 1/3 innings.\n\n--Field Level Media", "source": {"uri": "theolympian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The  Olympian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "field_level_media@theolympian.com", "name": "Field Level Media", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Padres", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Diego Padres"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Guardians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Guardians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_All-Star_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball All-Star Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Diego"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos\u00e9_Ram\u00edrez_(infielder)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00edrez (infielder)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Kwan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steven Kwan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Cronenworth", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jake Cronenworth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_League", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Gaddis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Gaddis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Sandlin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nick Sandlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Naylor", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Naylor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manny_Machado", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manny Machado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrifice_bunt", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sacrifice bunt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Right fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Infielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Third baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batted_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batted ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Center fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wild pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Austin, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Dating", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Dating", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Walking", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Walking", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Women", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/qhufuo/picture290257564/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/bc031680-663e-4c10-b5d6-0b121df505f6", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9745220", "eventUri": "eng-9745220", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

No corresponding move is required at this time.\n\nThe 24-year-old free agent signed with the Padres as an international free agent out of Tijuana, Mexico. The Padres gave him a $1.5 million signing bonus back in 2016. His journey to this point has not been a straight line, as the outfielder's career has had several ups and downs.\n\nOrnelas has played outfield and first base, but most of his playing time has been in right and left field throughout his professional career. With Fernando Tatis Jr. on the injured list with a stress reaction in his right femur, the Padres are taking an extra precaution adding an outfielder to the roster.\n\nOrnelas put up respectable numbers in rookie ball back in 2017, hitting .276/.399/.408. However, his 2019 season saw a dramatic dip to .217/.303/.279 across Rookie ball and High-A.\n\nMinor league baseball was cancelled in 2020 and Ornelas' numbers improved during the 2021 and 2022 seasons. Last year with Double-A he slashed .284/.381/.473 with 11 home runs in 72 games. He also reached Triple-A last season, appearing in 55 games and batting .285/.358/.425.\n\nThis season has been unreal in El Paso.

His voice resonated with frustration even as he somehow sounded upbeat.\n\nHe was asked what kept him going, what kept him believing it would turn around.\n\nHis answer was as revealing as it was unexpected.\n\n\"'Shildty,' honestly, is a big, big factor in this,\" he said. \"He's been huge (in) talking to me about it -- that it's about the long haul. Just keep working. Don't think about today. Don't think about the 0-for-4 or the losses or whatever it is. Just keep working, keep working, keep working.\"\n\nThat pretty much sums up the tenet at the core of manager Mike Shildt's conviction regarding how a season is built.\n\nImprovement might be the only thing he talks about more than unity.\n\n\"The biggest thing that I can hang my hat on is we're together and we're moving together towards consistent improvement,\" Shildt said last week. \"And we do that, it's all we can ask of ourselves. And there's optimism in that.\"\n\nThe Padres know they could have a better record. They also know they played most of the season's first 3\u00bd months without two of their top starting pitchers and for much of it with Fernando Tatis Jr. and Xander Bogaerts sidelined by injury and Machado playing through injury.\n\nThey assert that clean baseball, skilfully running the bases and generally having a good approach at the plate will eventually pay consistent dividends.\n\nAll things considered, they like where they are.\n\n\"I think overall we had a good first half,\" Machado said. \"We played a lot of good baseball, and we did a lot of great things. We did a lot of bad things as well. But we learned from those and we turned them around pretty quickly as a team. So as a group, I think that's all we could ask for, is how we bounce back from those losses, how we bounce back from those errors or mental errors and move forward with. 'How can we get better?'\n\n\"This group has been great at it all year.\"\n\nFrom the outside, the fits and starts and middling record through 99 games could be held up as reason to think such an assessment is somewhat curious.\n\nBut inside the Padres' clubhouse, there is a belief the team is heading in the right direction and a commitment to sustain that trajectory.\n\nA big part of that belief and commitment stems from the attitude and culture instilled by a man who sees a lemon and immediately searches for some sugar.\n\n\"I think we believe in ourselves and we know what we have here,\" Machado said. \"But having a manager go out there and stand up for it and actually believe it, I mean, that's important. That's huge. That's giving you that extra confidence. Like, 'All right. (Heck) yeah.'\"\n\nThe second half, it seems, is Shildt season.\n\nIn the three 162-game seasons in which he managed the Cardinals, they went a combined 133-81 after the All-Star break. During the 60-game 2020 season, COVID-19 outbreaks forced the Cardinals to play seven doubleheaders and a total of 29 games in the final 23 days. They went 16-13 to make the postseason.\n\nThe only one of those four seasons the Cardinals did not make the playoffs was 2018, a season in which Shildt started as bench coach and took over as manager in July.\n\nThat is at least something to hold onto as a team that lost six of seven leading up to the All-Star break heads toward the stretch run.\n\nIt's understandable to wonder how good the Padres will end up being in 2024. There are many things to be decided over the season's final 63 games.\n\nThe next two weeks will be full of talk about what they might do and could do -- and then what they did or didn't do.\n\nMajor League Baseball's trade deadline is July 30, and to what extent the Padres are able to bolster their thin rotation and/or plug the leaks in their bullpen may well be a deciding factor in whether the team makes the playoffs.\n\nThey do expect Tatis back, perhaps in August. His MRI this week showed continued healing, clearing him to incrementally increase his activity. Same with starting pitcher Joe Musgrove, who threw a bullpen session over the break. (There appears to be no predicting whether starting pitcher Yu Darvish returns from his personal leave this season.)\n\nHope is not a strategy, however, and many also-ran teams have been left only with the empty echoes of what-ifs.\n\nThe reality is that the season resumes its churn Friday for a team that has ridden a see-saw throughout what is traditionally called the season's first half.\n\n\"A lot of ups and downs,\" Jurickson Profar said. \"... We need to find a way to come in the second half and play consistent baseball.\"\n\nEntering this weekend's three-game series against the Guardians, the Padres are 50-49 and one game out of playoff position.\n\nThe long game is getting short.\n\n\"We've basically got a 60-game sprint now,\" Padres President of Baseball Operations A.J. Preller said.\n\n\"Yeah,\" Shildt acknowledged, \"it is time.\"\n\nThat was in response to an assertion that a quest for improvement has to eventually lead to more frequent victories.\n\nIt was as close as Shildt would come to discussing results over the process in a nearly 20-minute conversation late on the Saturday night before the All-Star break.\n\nThe manager steers virtually every conversation to how players prepare and are prepared.\n\n\"It's our best chance,\" he said. \"That's all I can ask. Every night I don't know what the game is gonna be. But we have an expectation that we're prepared for every scenario and players are put in a good position and they're ready physically, emotionally and mentally to compete. And then we do it every single day. And we do that, then we've gotten the most out of what we have, and that's all we can ultimately ask. And here's the thing: We're still learning to be better at it. But we've done that this year. That's the positive. I look at it from a different lens than some people.\"\n\nThat is for sure. But it doesn't mean Shildt doesn't see things clearly.\n\nJust because he focuses on the positives publicly and plays them up privately does not mean he fails to address what is not right.\n\n\"When you play 162 (games), you've got to try to find the positives,\" Musgrove said. \"Obviously, you don't ignore the negatives, but he's never gonna go out there and air us out to the fans and the media. He obviously wants to keep us in a good light to the fans that are watching every day. But all that stuff is addressed in here. And it's never like it's never scolding or shaming somebody for not getting the job done. It's like, 'This is what we need to be better. This is how we can be better. This is what I think you did right, but we could have been a little better.' It's just always a positive approach. There's always something that he sees out there that he likes or doesn't like that's going to help you get better.\"\n\nPlayers leave no doubt that Shildt and the coaching staff are constantly pushing for improvement.\n\n\"This guy, he always teaches us,\" Profar said. \"He won't give his power away. He doesn't show it (publicly) maybe, but he holds us accountable all the time.\"\n\nSaid Musgrove: \"We've gotten our ass chewed a couple times.\"\n\nOne easily noticeable sign of the culture of commitment Shildt has fostered comes in the hours before games. While the number of players on the field for pregame drills does not tell a complete story of who is working or how diligently they are working, the Padres' attendance is far more commensurate with what is seen from the perennial contenders than in recent years.\n\n\"The thing I stay persistent about is improvement,\" Shildt said. \"We spend a lot of time, and we don't (talk) out of school about it, because I don't think it's anybody's business how we internally do it. ... What's important is, 'Are we individually (and) collectively getting better with all the nuances that take place in this game?' And that's what I spend my time on. What I see is a group that is running that race.\"\n\nThe Padres have several times this season seemed poised to sustain the best version of themselves, only to go into a skid.\n\n\"Two steps forward, one step back,\" Jake Cronenworth said by way of description on more than a couple occasions and with more than a little weariness.\n\nThe back and forth has been wearying. And dizzying.\n\nOver the first month of the season, the Padres were never more than two games above or below .500. They were 14-18 on April 29 and 18-18 on May 4. They were exactly .500 (32-32) on June 4, but they had been three games above .500 three days before that and would fall to two games under .500 two days after that.\n\nBy July 4, they were 48-43 and the next would get to a season-high six games over .500.\n\nIn the week leading up to the All-Star break, they lost five consecutive games for the fourth time this season.\n\nThe Padres are one of five teams to have endured that many five-game losing streaks in 2024. The others are the teams with the three worst records in the major leagues -- the White Sox, Marlins and Rockies -- and the World Series champion Rangers (46-50).\n\n\"Look at any World Series winner, and you look at their stretches that aren't as positive,\" Shildt said. \"They're there.\"\n\nThis is true, though not entirely reassuringly so.\n\nSeveral World Series winners have had losing streaks of longer than five games. Six had three losing streaks of at least five games during their championship seasons.\n\nHowever, no team since at least 1989 has won a World Series in a season in which it had four losing streaks that long.\n\nThrough the injuries to the pitching staff, Tatis and Bogaerts and every other setback, including bullpen blowups and Dylan Cease's inconsistency, Shildt has maintained a positivity that perhaps could only be rivaled by the fictional character Ted Lasso.\n\n\"It's real,\" Cronenworth said. \"He believes in us. And I think that every day no matter where we're at, that is something that's very easy to gain from.\"\n\nShildt will not a throw a pitch or take a swing or make a trade. But he just might be the biggest reason why\n\nthe Padres eventually become what they expect to be in 2024.\n\nThe most overtly passionate of Padres has become a disciple of the most overtly positive of Padres.\n\n\"I just love him,\" Profar said. \"The number one thing is the wanting to win. We have a manager that wants to win really, really, really bad. He's very very competitive. You can see the fire in him. I love that, because I'm like that.\"\n\nIt is an interesting observation. Often this season -- especially in the aftermath of losses -- there have been no two people who offer more seemingly divergent views for public consumption than Profar and Shildt.\n\nProfar blames himself and diplomatically calls out others. He points out what he thinks is missing and what has to happen.\n\nShildt pushes back on almost every question he deems negative or suggesting of troubling trends. He is prone to focus on a good at-bat a utility player had in a 5-2 loss or the scoreless inning thrown by a middle reliever in a game in which a starting pitcher gave up six runs. He emphasizes a first-to-third dash and minimizes a runner getting picked off at first. He recalls winning two of three and all but dismisses losing three of four.\n\nHe is not only prone to focus on the process, as a teacher first and foremost. He has a deep-seated belief his job is to have his players' backs.\n\n\"At a starting point, like, I'm here to serve the players,\" Shildt said. \"I got into coaching to help people get the most out of their God-given ability. And I'm here 100 percent every day to serve them, help lead them, give them direction, structure, love them, tough-love them. But I show up every day for them. I just happen to be in the big leagues.\"\n\nThe public assessment of the job Shildt is doing in his first season as Padres manager is almost certainly colored by the shortcomings of previous Padres teams, in particular the 2023 squad that squandered its talent amid a leadership void and other dysfunction.\n\nBut it also seems to be based on his penchant for positivity in what might seem like odd moments to be so.\n\nWho he is, however, resonates where it must.\n\n\"I think that championship-caliber clubs believe in accountability, believe in work, believe in routine, believe in positivity,\" Machado said. \"And, you know, that's what he's bringing. He's bringing that championship mentality.\"", "source": {"uri": "sandiegouniontribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "San Diego Union-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The Padres took two of three last year in San Diego. They are 24-21 this year on the road.\n\nCleveland Guardians (58-37)\n\nThe Guardians' .611 winning percentage is second best in the majors, behind only the Phillies (.646). They are 30-11 at home and have not lost a series in Cleveland this year and they rank fourth in the majors with a plus-85 run differential. Cleveland is also 11th in on-base percentage (.316), 12th in slugging (.406) and seventh in ERA (3.71), numbers propped up by baseball's best bullpen (2.62 ERA).\n\nPadres RHP Matt Waldron (5-8, 3.71 ERA) | The 27-year-old rookie was originally drafted by the Guardians in the 18th round in 2019 and send to San Diego as the player to be named later in the Mike Clevinger trade. Waldron has a 2.72 ERA over his last 12 starts and has completed seven innings four times over that stretch. This is his first appearance against the team that drafted him.\n\nGuardians RHP Tanner Bibee (7-4, 3.77 ERA) | The runner up for last year's AL Rookie of the year, Bibee has already allowed as many home runs (13) as he did last year in 142 innings (2.98 ERA). Bibee allowed six runs in four innings in a loss last year against the Padres.\n\nSaturday\n\nPadres RHP Dylan Cease (8-8, 3.99 ERA) | He's coming off 11 strikeouts over six shutout innings of one-hit ball in his last start, the team's only win against the Braves last weekend. Cease is 5-5 with a 3.96 ERA in 12 career starts the Guardians. He went 1-2 with a 4.50 ERA in three starts against them last year.\n\nGuardians RHP Gavin Williams (0-1, 3.77 ERA) | The second-year starter is making his fourth start after starting the season on the injured list with elbow discomfort. He has struck out nine against six walks but has not allowed a home run yet in 14\u2153 innings. This is Williams' first appearance against the Padres.\n\nSunday\n\nPadres RHP Michael King (7-6, 3.41 ERA) | His career-high 111 innings has six-plus more than he threw last year, although King did throw 161\u2153 innings in 2018 in the minors. King has faced the Guardians five times as a reliever, striking out 18 over 10\u2154 scoreless innings, including 3\u2154 shutout innings last year.\n\nGuardians RHP Ben Lively (8-5, 3.58 ERA) | The 32-year-old veteran's ERA is down significantly than the 5.38 he posted last year with the Reds. Before that, his last time in the majors was in 2019 with the Royals, as he spent two years in Korea and all of 2022 at the Reds' Triple-A affiliate.

His helmet followed, thrown hard into the dirt on the other side of the plate. He peeled off his batting gloves, one at a time and then discarded them as a pair before.\n\nThat was the frustration and the futility of Friday night encapsulated in a moment.\n\nMachado's strikeout had ended the sixth inning. His inability to corral a grounder the previous inning had helped the Guardians to the only run they would really need to beat the Padres and their whispering offense.\n\nThe Padres ended up losing 7-0, but that margin, which the Guardians achieved with a six-run eighth inning, was not what mattered as the second half began Friday night.\n\nThe Padres have lost seven of their past eight games and have batted .199 and scored a total of 12 runs in the last seven of those. Both are season lows over a seven-game span.\n\nThe Guardians scored the first and deciding run on an infield single that probably should not have happened, a sacrifice bunt and double by a San Diegan.\n\nDavid Fry, one of the Guardians' five All-Stars, began the fifth inning by pulling a ball that short-hopped up and off Machado's glove and then his chest.\n\nAndres Gim\u00e9nez's sacrifice bunt moved Fry to second base. He got to third on a wild pitch by Waldron, though that would end up not mattering because Bonita Vista High School alumnus Daniel Schneemann followed with a line drive to the gap in right-center field.\n\nThat was all it took for Matt Waldron (5-8, 3.59) to be tagged with the loss in his first start against the team that drafted him in the 18th round in 2019.\n\nA year later, he was the player to be named later in the massive trade the sent Mike Clevinger from Cleveland to San Diego.\n\nThree years after that, he has been the Padres' most dependable pitcher.\n\nFriday was the 11th time this season he has gone at least six innings, second most on the team to Dylan Cease's 13. Over his past 13 starts, since May 11, Waldron has a 2.63 ERA, better than all but seven pitchers in the major leagues.\n\nHe threw his knuckleball more often (55.7 percent) than he had in any of his previous 25 career starts and was highly effective doing so, allowing six hits over six innings.\n\nThe last of those hits was a single by Fry leading off the bottom of the seventh, which brought manager Mike Shildt from the dugout and Yuki Matsui from the bullpen.\n\nMatsui stranded Fry by striking out all three batters he faced.\n\nThe Guardians began the bottom of the eighth inning with four consecutive singles off Stephen Kolek on their way to taking a 7-0 lead. Austin Davis relieved Kolek with no outs and two on, hit a batter to load the bases and walked a batter to bring in a run before getting an out and being replaced by Sean Reynolds. Three more runs scored before the Padres got their final chance to avoid their second shutout in five games.\n\nThey did not, though they did get their second runner into scoring position.\n\nOver the game's final four innings, the Padres got only Luis Arraez's two-out single in the eighth. They had just four hits all game. Arraez, who doubled with two outs in the third inning, and Xander Bogaerts, who reached on a fielder's choice and advanced to second on defensive indifference in the ninth, were the only Padres runners to get beyond first base.\n\nThe only other inning in which their offense murmured was the fifth, but two walks led to nothing when Ha-Seong Kim was thrown out trying to steal second base in the middle of them.", "source": {"uri": "sandiegouniontribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "San Diego Union-Tribune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kevin_acee@sandiegouniontribune.com", "name": "Kevin

It's Comic-Con week and let's face it, there is no room for a Major League Baseball team during the greatest popular culture event of the year.\n\nBut, this year the 10 day, nine game roadie is especially tough.

The opener of the trip was not pleasant.\n\nDespite a stellar start from the knuckleballing Matt Waldron, the Friars got ripped 7-0 thanks to a punchless offense and a bullpen that is going to need to be addressed ahead of the MLB trade deadline. Waldron tossed 6.0 innings of 1-run ball with five strikeouts and no walks, arguably his best outing of the season. But, he took the loss because the San Diego offense only had four total hits, two each by Luis Arraez and Jake Cronenworth.\n\nIt was still a 1-0 game in the 8th inning when Stephen Kolek took the mound. He's had a pattern of fantastic outings followed by awful ones. This was the latter. Kolek allowed four straight singles before being pulled for Austin Davis ... who promptly hit Josh Naylor with a pitch and walked David Fry with the bases loaded. Davis was only able to get one out and gave up two runs without allowing a single hit.

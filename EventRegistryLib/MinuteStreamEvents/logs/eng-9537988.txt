Interestingly when the sides last met in September 2017, it was the last game that the Tribesmen won that season, before being relegated to the First Division.\n\nIn a physical affair, the hosts were well worthy of the point against last season's Premier Division runners-up. The hosts started the better and were unfortunate not to take the lead after 12 minutes, when an effort by Vincent Borden's effort was excellently saved by Derry keeper Brian Maher.\n\nIt must be noted that Derry did dominate the ball for much of the opening exchanges, with Cork man Adam O'Reilly dictating much of the play for the Candystripes.\n\nNorth Galway native Regan Donelon was replaced just before half time due to injury, this was Donelan's first game back for Galway in a number of weeks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReferee Rob Hennessy waved away Derry shouts for a penalty in the 29th minute, following a Daniel Kelly cross. Interestingly in May 2017 when the sides met at the Terryland venue, Rob Hennessy was referee and was again for this fixture.\n\nDerry had the last meaningful effort of the half, however O'Reilly's long range effort was comfortably saved by Brendan Clarke and the sides went in level at the break.\n\nThe visitors started the second half, brightly but failed to create a good chance until the 83rd minute when Ben Doherty, saw his effort whistle wide.\n\nThe Tribesmen's defensive display was very impressive throughout, however the Candystripes hit the bar in the 90th minute following a long-range Will Patching effort.\n\nAll in all a draw was probably a fair result, and John Caulfield will be happy with his sides defensive display.\n\nGalway United are back in action on Monday evening against Bohemian FC, in Dalymount Park.

from nicking the points in stoppage-time as Will Patching's long-range strike rattled the crossbar, were disappointing in the final third for long periods.\n\nWhile Patching hit the crossbar, Brian Maher had to tip an effort onto the crossbar in the first half, as United themselves looked a threat from set-pieces.\n\nThe Candystripes, who went into the encounter looking for their third victory on the bounce for the first time in a year, made one change to the side that beat Waterford last time out.\n\nWinger Daniel Kelly came in for Ben Doherty, who dropped to the bench, but Michael Duffy who came on as substitute at the RSC last week missed out completely.\n\nThe Brandywell men, not for the first time this season, had a lot of the ball, but like on so many occasions they never threatened in the final third, particularly in the opening 45 minutes.\n\nThe visitors should have taken an 11th-minute lead as Paul McMullan's superb left-wing centre flashed just across the six-yard box with Pat Hoban and Kelly inches away from getting that crucial touch.\n\nAn outstanding finger-tip save by Brian Maher a minute later kept the game scoreless, as Vincent Borden's drive from 12 yards was tipped onto the crossbar by the City keeper.\n\nOn 37 minutes Derry went close as the ball fell to Daniel Mullen inside the box, but the striker's effort from close range was straight at United goalkeeper Brendan Clarke.\n\nJust after the hour mark Maher was called into action as he kept out McJannet's misplaced header, after another Edward McCarthy long throw-in caused problems in the Derry penalty box.\n\nA great passing move by the Foyelsiders five minutes from time nearly ended with a fortunate opening goal, but Ben Doherty, who replaced McMullan on 77 minutes, saw his cross-cum-shot pushed away by Clarke.\n\nMoments later a clever through ball by Adam O'Reilly found Sean Patton, but the young substitute's close-range shot from the right-hand angle whistled just past the left post.\n\nDerry were inches away from winning the contest as Cameron McJannet found Patching on the halfway line, the midfielder was given too much time and space, but his 25-yard drive, which had Clarke beaten, crashed off the bar.", "source": {"uri": "irishnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Hardly. But as William Munny once said, deserves got nuthin' to do with it.\n\nWith Waterford shocking Shamrock Rovers and Galway United leapfrogging Bohemians earlier in the day, the pressure around the Brandywell could be felt by an anxious home crowd.\n\nDerry had avoided defeat in this fixture the previous nine times, not being beaten by Shels since another Monday night in August 2022. A win here would send out a signal about their title ambitions.\n\nBy half time, the nervous anticipation had grown into a sickness. The hunger around these parts for a league goes beyond the entitlement of most clubs with the investment of club Chairman Philip O'Doherty.\n\nManager Ruaidhr\u00ed Higgins picked a team with pace and a left flank of Ciaran Coll, Ben Doherty and Paul McMullan was designed to go after Sean Gannon and Patrick Barrett down the Shels' right flank.\n\nThe intention to play fast ball was signalled by the power washer on the field, soaking the pitch in a mist to add a bit of zip.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe very first chance fell to Liam Burt for the visitors, a rising effort well wide of the target.\n\nAnd from there, Shelbourne struggled to get a proper foothold. It wasn't until the last minute of the first half until they got their first corner, coming about after John Martin pressured Coll into deflecting it out.\n\nIn the meantine, the Candy Stripers were feeding Will Patching for the former Manchester City trainee to ping the 40 yards passes, opening up the play and being more expansive than of late.\n\nA move involving captain Cameron McJannet and Ben Doherty down the left brought Pat Hoban into play and though his lifted ball to Doherty was clever, Shels 'keeper Conor Kearns was on the scene first.\n\nOn twenty minutes the first big chance arrived. Patching had worked a short corner with Ronan Boyce and when the delivery was only half-cleared, Paul McMullan caught a sweet volley from the edge of the box that smacked the post.\n\nAs if that was their cue, the home team began pressing more aggressively and higher, with Kearns actually cannoning a clearance into McMullan as he chased down a backpass.\n\nHalf chances here and there came, the strongest being a Hoban header bouncing wide, but Shelbourne were delighted to get to the break with their clean sheet intact. Some clever clock-management getting them to the interval.\n\n10 minutes into the second half, the dam burst. A sustained period of high pressure had Shels looking ragged at the back and another couple of minutes of clever pressing left with an untidy ball landing to McMullan.\n\nHis shot wasn't the cleanest of the night, but the direction was perfect and it found the side of the net to put Derry 1-0 up.\n\nAnother bout of chasing by the industrious McMullan left Kearns booting a hoofed clearance onto the roof of the stand to huge cheers. A half chance for Hoban followed.\n\nAnother chase, led by McMullan. A chance for Adam O'Reilly, the follow-up for Hoban. All little dents on the paintwork, but not enough to stop Shelbourne remaining roadworthy.\n\nAgainst the flow, Burt had another effort at goal that he never got hold of and prompted the ironic cheers.\n\nBelatedly, Shelbourne applied some energy and pressure from twenty minutes out. Crucially, Damien Duff made his substitutions early and in Sean Boyd, they had a focal point of their attack. They would only need him once.\n\nBy contrast, despite playing a blue-collar game of chasing and honesty, Derry only made one sub in normal time.\n\nWill Jarvis had been getting his foot on the ball and looking smart down the left side. On 90 minutes, he wriggled into space and got off a cross. Boyd was there to get the vital touch to the net.\n\nUtter deflation and dejection in the Brandywell. No more chances. Shelbourne remain top of the league. The character to come here and snatch this draw took reserves of heart and mental resilience.\n\nDerry City: Brian Maher; Ronan Boyce, Mark Connolly, Cameron McJannet \u00a9, Ciaran Coll; Adam

earn hard-fought draw against Derry", "body": "Derry City 1-1 Shelbourne\n\nPaul McMullan thought he had done enough to fire Derry City top of the table - and so did almost everyone at the Brandywell.\n\nBut nobody told Sean Boyd, the big Shelbourne striker who is so often a thorn in the side of rival teams.\n\nHe came off the bench to equalise with a superb 90th minute finish, getting a long leg in ahead of Cameron McJannet to turn home a Will Jarvis cross at the near post.\n\nIt silenced the Brandywell in an instant and then, after four minutes of injury time, left sections of the home crowd ringing out the boos.\n\nThose supporters thought their team were on track to finish a madcap day in the League of Ireland as the new leaders.\n\nShels have been looking down on the chasing pack for the last two months having nabbed top spot back on March 4.\n\nAnd they looked set to be knocked off their perch on the back of McMullen's first goal for the club on his 35th appearance.\n\nBut Boyd had other ideas and Shels haven't come this far under Damien Duff by being a soft touch and remain the team to catch for now.\n\nSince Derry's win over Shelbourne in the 2022 FAI Cup, these sides had met five times with only three measly goals scored in those games.\n\nEach of the last four meetings have ended all square so while results elsewhere caused a shock, this had a more predictable outcome.\n\nIt would have been quite something for both teams to completely veer off course and go on a madcap goal spree - even if Boyd's equaliser was laced with drama.\n\nIt was a tight affair and while Shels played with confidence in the opening exchanges, their neat passages of play tended to be in their own half and around the centre circle.\n\nRarely did they threaten in the final third during that opening half and a pair of wild, wayward Liam Burt shots was about as good as it got for the visitors.\n\nDerry took time to work their way into the game and while they didn't overburden Conor Kearns, he was still the busier of the two goalkeepers.\n\nMcMullan was Derry's tormentor in chief, playing in the hole off lone striker Pat Hoban, and he crashed a shot off the upright with the best chance of the half.\n\nShels headed clear a Candystripes corner but McMullan watched the looping ball every step of the way and, in space, cracked a 20-yard volley off the post.\n\nAnd two minutes later, he showed great determination to charge down a Kearns clearance from a backpass but the ball skidded out of play, two yards wide of the post.\n\nWhile Shels lacked ideas in the final third, they were never frustrated by it as they looked to keep a lid on the hosts.\n\nBut Derry still played with far more attacking purpose and Hoban wasn't far away with a headed effort off a Ben Doherty cross before half-time.\n\nShels brought Matty Smith on at half-time in the hope of adding a creative spark in attack, but Derry got in their first with the opening goal after 56 minutes.\n\nAnd while McMullan's finish was exquisite, Shels gift-wrapped the breakthrough moment of the game with some shambolic defensive play.\n\nKameron Ledwidge played a ball back to Kearns who laid it off to Gavin Molloy but his short pass to JJ Lunney was misplaced and McMullan pounced.\n\nFrom the edge of the box, he struck first time and crashed a low shot in off Kearns' far post for his first goal for the club in his 35th appearance.\n\nAnd the game would have been done and dusted with 20 minutes to go were it not for Kearns's brilliant save to deny Adam O'Reilly after Will Patching played him in.\n\nIt proved costly because when nobody expected it, in the dying stages, Boyd salvaged the Shels point that keeps them top.\n\nGet the latest sports headlines straight to your

earn hard-fought draw against Derry", "body": "Derry City 1-1 Shelbourne\n\nPaul McMullan thought he had done enough to fire Derry City top of the table - and so did almost everyone at the Brandywell.\n\nBut nobody told Sean Boyd, the big Shelbourne striker who is so often a thorn in the side of rival teams.\n\nHe came off the bench to equalise with a superb 90th minute finish, getting a long leg in ahead of Cameron McJannet to turn home a Will Jarvis cross at the near post.\n\nIt silenced the Brandywell in an instant and then, after four minutes of injury time, left sections of the home crowd ringing out the boos.\n\nThose supporters thought their team were on track to finish a madcap day in the League of Ireland as the new leaders.\n\nShels have been looking down on the chasing pack for the last two months having nabbed top spot back on March 4.\n\nAnd they looked set to be knocked off their perch on the back of McMullen's first goal for the club on his 35th appearance.\n\nBut Boyd had other ideas and Shels haven't come this far under Damien Duff by being a soft touch and remain the team to catch for now.\n\nSince Derry's win over Shelbourne in the 2022 FAI Cup, these sides had met five times with only three measly goals scored in those games.\n\nEach of the last four meetings have ended all square so while results elsewhere caused a shock, this had a more predictable outcome.\n\nIt would have been quite something for both teams to completely veer off course and go on a madcap goal spree - even if Boyd's equaliser was laced with drama.\n\nIt was a tight affair and while Shels played with confidence in the opening exchanges, their neat passages of play tended to be in their own half and around the centre circle.\n\nRarely did they threaten in the final third during that opening half and a pair of wild, wayward Liam Burt shots was about as good as it got for the visitors.\n\nDerry took time to work their way into the game and while they didn't overburden Conor Kearns, he was still the busier of the two goalkeepers.\n\nMcMullan was Derry's tormentor in chief, playing in the hole off lone striker Pat Hoban, and he crashed a shot off the upright with the best chance of the half.\n\nShels headed clear a Candystripes corner but McMullan watched the looping ball every step of the way and, in space, cracked a 20-yard volley off the post.\n\nAnd two minutes later, he showed great determination to charge down a Kearns clearance from a backpass but the ball skidded out of play, two yards wide of the post.\n\nWhile Shels lacked ideas in the final third, they were never frustrated by it as they looked to keep a lid on the hosts.\n\nBut Derry still played with far more attacking purpose and Hoban wasn't far away with a headed effort off a Ben Doherty cross before half-time.\n\nShels brought Matty Smith on at half-time in the hope of adding a creative spark in attack, but Derry got in their first with the opening goal after 56 minutes.\n\nAnd while McMullan's finish was exquisite, Shels gift-wrapped the breakthrough moment of the game with some shambolic defensive play.\n\nKameron Ledwidge played a ball back to Kearns who laid it off to Gavin Molloy but his short pass to JJ Lunney was misplaced and McMullan pounced.\n\nFrom the edge of the box, he struck first time and crashed a low shot in off Kearns' far post for his first goal for the club in his 35th appearance.\n\nAnd the game would have been done and dusted with 20 minutes to go were it not for Kearns's brilliant save to deny Adam O'Reilly after Will Patching played him in.\n\nIt proved costly because when nobody expected it, in the dying stages, Boyd salvaged the Shels point that keeps them top.\n\nGet the latest sports headlines straight to your

Derry were keen to remain on the front foot.\n\nShelbourne refused to give up the ghost. Will Jarvis made a superb break down the left in the 90th minute before he delivered a low cross into the area where substitute Boyd did well to get an excellent touch and deflect the ball into the Derry net.\n\nDERRY CITY: Maher; Boyce, Connolly, McJannet, Coll; Patching (Mullan, 92), O'Reilly; Kelly (Duallo, 80), McMullan, Doherty; Hoban.\n\nSHELBOURNE: Kearns; Gannon (Farrell, 78), Barrett, Molloy, Ledwidge (Wilson, 67); Lunney, Coyle (Farrell, 88); Burt, O'Sullivan (Boyd, 67), Jarvis; Martin (Smith, h/t.)

{"id": 232340288, "title": "Kristi Noem says Trump should pick a woman as his running mate", "text": "The South Dakota governor, Kristi Noem, said on Sunday that Donald Trump should pick a woman to be his running mate amid reports that her fellow Republican\u2019s shortlist is nearly all men. \u201cI think that that would be beneficial, according to the polling that I\u2019ve seen for him and a lot of swing states, is that having a woman that is helping his campaign makes a difference,\u201d she told Dana Bash during an interview on CNN\u2019s State of the Union. \u201cOne in four Republican women haven\u2019t made up their minds because they want to have a woman talking to them about the issues they care about. And women aren\u2019t monolithic. They don\u2019t care about just one issue.\u201d Noem\u2019s comments come amid reports that the former president\u2019s campaign for a second term in the White House is vetting possible picks. Only one of them, congresswoman Elise Stefanik of New York, is a woman. Others include senators JD Vance, Marco Rubio, Tim Scott and Tom Cotton. The North Dakota governor, Doug Burgum, congressman Byron Donalds, and Ben Carson, the former secretary of housing and urban development, are also reportedly under consideration. Noem gave the interview from Wausau, Wisconsin, where she has been stumping for Trump. Until recently, Noem was considered a top possible pick for the No 2 spot on the Republican ticket for November\u2019s election. But her chances reportedly fell significantly after she published a story in her recently published memoir about killing her dog. She said on Sunday that she did not know if she was under consideration. Asked whether she had regrets about publishing that story, Noem suggested that she did not. \u201cThat story\u2019s a 20-year-old story of a mom who made a very difficult decision to protect her children from a vicious animal that was attacking livestock, and killing livestock, and attacking people,\u201d she said. \u201cSo it\u2019s in the book because it was difficult for me.\u201d When Bash tried to press her further, Noem cut in and said \u201cwe\u2019ve covered this\u201d. Noem\u2019s book also exposed her to criticism after she needed to retract an anecdote about meeting Kim Jong-un \u2013 and then feeling \u201cunderestimated\u201d by the North Korean dictator during the encounter. The Dakota Scout newspaper was the first to report how Noem\u2019s account of meeting Kim during a prior stint as a congresswoman was unlikely to have happened. Within days of the Scout\u2019s report, Noem said: \u201cThis anecdote shouldn\u2019t have been in the book, and as soon as it was brought to my attention, I made sure that that was adjusted.\u201d", "summary": "<p>South Dakota governor, once a top possible Trump VP pick, makes remarks amid reports his shortlist is nearly all men</p><p>The South Dakota governor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/kristi-noem\">Kristi Noem</a>, said on Sunday that Donald Trump should pick a woman to be his running mate amid reports that her fellow Republican\u2019s shortlist is nearly all men.</p><p>\u201cI think that that would be beneficial, according to the polling that I\u2019ve seen for him and a lot of swing states, is that having a woman that is helping his campaign makes a difference,\u201d she told Dana Bash during an interview on CNN\u2019s State of the Union. \u201cOne in four Republican women haven\u2019t made up their minds because they want to have a woman talking to them about the issues they care about.

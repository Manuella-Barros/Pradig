Calpine investors would get $15.25 a share as part of the deal, which is valued at more than $17 billion including debt, they said.\n\nCalpine is one of the few publicly listed U.S. power generators still selling supplies directly into wholesale power markets. These companies have seen their margins squeezed by cheap natural gas, a surge in renewable energy resources and subsidies that some states have created for nuclear power. The rout has touched off a wave of consolidation with companies including FirstEnergy Corp. and American Electric Power Co. looking to get out of the business altogether.\n\nCalpine declined to comment. An Energy Capital spokesman couldn't immediately be reached for comment.\n\nEnergy Capital has secured co-investors and limited partners for the Calpine deal, according to one of the people familiar with the matter. Calpine was up 9.2 percent at $14.74 in after-markets trading at 7:59 p.m. New York time Thursday. The shares closed at $13.50, giving the Houston-based generator a market value of $4.87 billion.\n\nEnergy Capital has become one of the most active private equity investors in the U.S. power sector. It formed a joint venture last year with Dynegy Inc. to buy Engie SA's U.S. power portfolio for $3.3 billion and agreed to sell its stake in that joint venture to Dynegy before the deal closed. The investor was Dynegy's largest stakeholder as of June, based on data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nEnergy Capital also bought a natural gas plant from Calpine in South Carolina in 2012 for more than $400 million.

The investor group was led by Access Industries and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board.\n\nCalpine is one of the few publicly listed U.S. power generators still selling supplies directly into wholesale markets. These companies have seen their margins squeezed by cheap natural gas resources, a surge in renewable energy and subsidies that some states have created for nuclear reactors. The rout has touched off a wave of consolidation with companies including FirstEnergy Corp. and American Electric Power Co. looking to get out of the business altogether.\n\n\"Calpine is the premier power generator,\" Timothy Winter, a St. Louis-based analyst for Gabelli & Co. who rates Calpine at buy, said Friday by phone. \"The market doesn't appreciate the story. It doesn't appreciate the whole independent power producer business. It seems like private equity does.\"\n\nCalpine's shares closed at $13.50 Thursday, giving the power generator a market value of $4.87 billion. Shares traded at $14.87 at 8:05 a.m. in New York. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2018, pending approval from shareholders and regulators.\n\nCalpine will \"continue to strengthen our wholesale power generation footprint, while benefiting from ECP's support, industry expertise and long-term investment horizon,\" Thad Hill, the company's chief executive officer, said in the statement.\n\nThe Energy Capital deal includes a 45-day \"go-shop\" period, during which Calpine can solicit other offers. The investor consortium will receive a $142 million fee if the agreement is terminated for a better proposal, unless Calpine terminates the deal for another offer \"from certain exempted persons\" before the 106th day after the agreement. In that case, the termination fee will be $65 million.\n\nTyler Reeder, a partner at Energy Capital, said the firm doesn't expect to make any changes to the way Calpine operates or to the company's financial policy and previously announced $2.7 billion debt reduction plan.\n\nEnergy Capital has become one of the most active private equity investors in the U.S. power sector. It formed a joint venture last year with Dynegy Inc. to buy Engie SA's U.S. power portfolio for $3.3 billion and agreed to sell its stake in that joint venture to Dynegy before the deal closed. The investor was Dynegy's largest stakeholder as of June, based on data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nEnergy Capital also bought a natural gas plant from Calpine in South Carolina in 2012 for more than $400 million. Calpine owns 80 power plants and has about 6.5 million retail customers in California, Texas and the U.S. Northeast. Calpine's headquarters will remain in Houston, and the current management team is expected to stay in place.\n\nIn addition to selling electricity, Calpine gets payments from power grid operators for guaranteeing future capacity when they need it. In one capacity auction in May, Calpine cleared 5.3 gigawatts for a total of about $326 million in capacity revenue for the year starting June 2020.\n\nLazard Ltd. is serving as Calpine's financial adviser, while White & Case LLP is the company's legal adviser.

Media reports, however, had identified the suitor as Energy Capital.\n\nRELATED: Calpine confirms its close to a sale\n\nCalpine, which employs about 800 in Houston, has struggled in recent years in the face of persistently low electricity prices, a surge of renewable energy and the high costs of operating fossil fuel power plant. The company reported a second quarter loss of $219 million, significantly larger than $29 million loss in the second quarter of 2016.\n\nCalpine is not alone. NRG, which recently reported a second quarter loss of $642 million, said in July that it will sell up to $4 billion of its assets. Last month, the Houston company launched a round of layoffs across the country, but would not disclose the number of job cuts.\n\nDynegy, another Houston company, is said to be in talks with Dallas-based Vistra Energy about a possible merger. Dynegy earlier this month reported a second quarter loss of nearly $300 million.\n\nCalpine, founded in California, moved its headquarter to Houston from San Jose, Calif. in 2009, after emerging from bankruptcy in 2008. Calpine also owns the retail electricity provider Champion Energy Services, which it bought for $240 million in 2015.\n\nRELATED: Forces combine to squeeze power companies\n\nEnergy Capital Partners, which has offices on Louisiana Street in Houston, is a private equity firm that invests in power plants, pipelines, transmission and other energy assets. The firm helped Dynegy finance its $3.3 billion acquisition of 17 U.S. power plants, including six in Texas, from the French energy company, Engie. Dynegy last year bought out Energy Capital's stake in plants for $750 million.\n\nBloomberg News and Ryan Maye Handy of the Houston Chronicle contributed.", "date": "2017-08-18", "categories":

The company's debt, as a net of current portion, was about $11.31 billion, as of June 30.\n\nLazard was Calpine's financial adviser and White & Case LLP was its legal adviser. Barclays Capital Inc was Energy Capital's financial adviser and Latham & Watkins LLP its legal adviser.

To ED's knowledge, no political leader has been granted interim bail for campaigning even though he is not the contesting candidate.\" The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader was arrested on March 21 and is currently lodged in Tihar Jail under judicial custody.\n\nThe affidavit comes a day before the Supreme Court is set to deliver its order on granting interim bail to Kejriwal in a money laundering case linked to the alleged excise policy scam on May 10.\n\nWhat ED Said in Its Affidavit: Key Points\n\n\"Around 123 elections have taken place in the past three years and if interim bail is granted for election campaigning then no politician can be arrested and kept in judicial custody since elections take place all year round,\" the ED stated.\"Any special concession in Kejriwal's favour granting interim bail for campaigning in the general election would amount to anathema to the rule of law and equality,\" it added.Lambasting Kejriwal for seeking interim bail, the ED said that the AAP leader used the same excuse to avoid the summons earlier, saying there were elections in five states.The central probe agency also contended that no politician could be arrested and kept in judicial custody if they are granted interim bail for poll campaigning.All \"unscrupulous\" politicians would be permitted to commit crime and avoid investigation under the garb of elections, the ED further added.It also said that Arvind Kejriwal or any other politician cannot can claim no special status higher than that of an ordinary citizen.\"It will create two separate classes in the country viz. ordinary people who are bound by the rule of law as well as the laws of the country and politicians who can seek exemption from the laws with the hope of securing interim bail to campaign for elections,\" the affidavit read.The probe agency further contended that there have been instances where politicians contested elections while in judicial custody and emerged victorious, yet they were not granted interim bail. Additionally, it highlighted the possibility of several politicians being held in judicial custody across the nation for non-PMLA (Prevention of Money Laundering Act) offenses.\n\nOn May 7, the Supreme Court had reserved its verdict on interim bail to Kejriwal.The two-judge bench had risen without pronouncing order on granting Kejriwal interim bail to enable him to campaign in the Lok Sabha elections.\n\nThe bench had reserved its decision after hearing the arguments put forth by senior advocate Abhishek Singhvi and Additional Solicitor General S V Raju, who appeared for Kejriwal and the Enforcement Directorate, respectively.\n\nSolicitor General Tushar Mehta, who appeared for the probe agency, had staunchly opposed showing any leniency to Kejriwal on account of the Lok Sabha polls and said granting interim bail to the AAP national convenor would amount to creating a separate class for politicians.\n\nThe bench has divided the hearing on Kejriwal's petition against his arrest into two parts.\n\nHis main petition challenges his arrest by the ED and seeks it to be declared as illegal, while the second aspect pertains to grant of interim bail keeping in mind the ongoing Lok Sabha polls.\n\nThe court reserved the order on the issue of grant of interim bail.\n\nOn Tuesday, a Delhi court has extended Kejriwal's judicial custody in the money laundering case till May 20.\n\nThe Delhi High Court had on April 9 upheld Kejriwal's arrest, saying there was no illegality and the ED was left with \"little option\" after he skipped repeated summonses and refused to join the investigation.\n\nThe matter relates to alleged corruption and money laundering in the formulation and execution of the Delhi government's now-scrapped excise policy for 2021-22.", "source":

However, it had also said that if interim bail is granted, Kejriwal would not be allowed to discharge any official duties as Chief Minister.

Kejriwal, while filing an appeal in the apex court had contended that his arrest after the announcement of the General Elections is \"motivated by extraneous considerations\".\n\nOn April 9, the High Court dismissed his plea for release from jail and rejected his argument of political vendetta amid the looming Lok Sabha elections. The High Court had said that Kejriwal's absence from nine ED summons over six months undermined any claims of special privilege as Chief Minister, suggesting his arrest was an inevitable consequence of his non-cooperation.\n\nKejriwal was arrested by ED on March 21 in connection with a money laundering probe relating to alleged irregularities in the now-cancelled Delhi excise policy 2021-22.

The case is listed as item 50 before Justices Khanna and Dipankar Datta on Friday.\n\nHow is Arvind Kejriwal functioning from Tihar Jail? | Explained'Will create two classes'\n\nGrant of interim bail to Mr. Kejriwal to campaign for the ongoing Lok Sabha election would be anathema to the rule of law and equality, and create a precedent which would permit \"all unscrupulous politicians to commit crimes, avoid investigation under the garb of one election or the other, be it municipal election or panchayat elections or Assembly or general elections, and thereafter, upon being arrested, seek interim bail to campaign for one election or the other\", the ED said. In a federal structure, one election is as good as another, it noted.\n\nGiving the Chief Minister interim bail would create two separate classes of people in the country. \"The ordinary people who are bound by the rule of law and politicians who can seek exemption from laws with the hope of securing interim bail to campaign for elections,\" the ED argued.\n\nNo political leader has ever been granted interim bail to campaign. A contesting candidate in custody is not granted bail for campaigning. Even the right to vote is curtailed while in judicial custody under the Representation of People Act. Mr. Kejriwal, who was arrested on March 21, was remanded to judicial custody for the sixth time till May 20.\n\nThe roller-coaster ride of the Kejriwal case in the Supreme Court'Bad precedent'\n\nAn interim bail for Mr. Kejriwal to canvas votes for the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) as a \"star campaigner\" would incentivise every criminal to be a politician and be in campaign mode throughout the year while committing rampant offences, the ED said. Politicians can claim no special status higher than that of an ordinary citizen; they are as much liable to be arrested and detained for committing offences as any ordinary person, the Central agency reasoned.\n\nBharat Rashtra Samithi leader J. Kavitha, and Mr. Kejriwal's AAP colleague and former Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, both accused in the excise policy case, were denied interim relief by the top court, the ED said. Even AAP leader Sanjay Singh was asked to try for regular bail in the liquor policy case. Mr. Kejriwal, on the other hand, had not even filed any plea for regular or interim bail before the Supreme Court or any other court.\n\nThe legal issues surrounding Arvind Kejriwal's arrest | Explained'Differential treatment'\n\nIf the right to campaign was a ground for interim bail, it would be a breach of the fundamental right to equality if a farmer was denied the same relief for harvest season or the director of a company to attend a board meeting or annual general meeting.\n\n\"There is absolutely no principle which justifies giving a differential treatment to a politician for campaigning over a farmer or a businessman who wishes to pursue his vocation,\" the affidavit pointed out, adding that the right to campaign is not a fundamental right or a constitutional right or a legal right.\n\n\"There are many politicians in judicial custody under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. Their cases were examined by competent courts which upheld their custody. There are also several political leaders in judicial custody throughout the country in non-PMLA offences... If the court extends any interim relief to Mr. Kejriwal, there is no gainsaying that all of them would claim similar treatment claiming that politicians are a class of their own,\" the ED contended.\n\nCan Kejriwal continue to be CM while in custody? Lessons from the Senthilbalaji case'Skipped summons for polls'\n\nBail to Mr. Kejriwal after he avoided multiple summons, and on the ground of campaigning for elections, would give a \"judicial imprimatur\" to the claim that politicians were a separate class, it added.\n\nThe ED said that Mr. Kejriwal had skipped a summons in October 2023, citing elections in five States. He had ducked a summons last December, referring to the Rajya Sabha elections. He had eschewed a summons in January 2024, claiming his presence was required for the Goa polls.\n\n\"His argument that the timing of his arrest before the general elections would render the arrest bad is a complete red-herring and self-contradictory for the reason that for the past six months he had cited one election after another for not complying with the law which an ordinary citizen would be otherwise obliged to follow,\" the Central agency noted.\n\nThe ED claimed that the court had reserved its order on interim bail after hearing Mr. Kejriwal for three days without giving the Central agency an equal opportunity to lay out its case.\n\nRead Comments", "source": {"uri": "thehindu.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hindu"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Raju, who appears for the Directorate of Enforcement in Kejriwal matter that it may pass the order on interim relief to Delhi Chief Minister on Friday.\n\nOn Tuesday (May 7), a bench of Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Dipankar Datta had indicated granting interim bail to Kejriwal to enable him to campaign for the ongoing Lok Sabha elections. However, the court had said that if interim bail is granted, Kejriwal would not be allowed to discharge any official duties as Chief Minister.\n\nThe Solicitor General Tushar Mehta representing the Directorate of Enforcement had vehemently opposed any grant of interim bail to Kejriwal, urging the bench not to treat politicians as a separate category. He had contended that all were equal before the law, be it a Chief Minister or a commoner.\n\n\"How can a Chief Minister be treated differently than a aam aadmi. There can't be any deviation only because he is a Chief Minister. Would campaigning for elections be more important?\" the Solicitor General had told the bench pointing out that the electioneering is a luxury.\n\n\"We are dealing with the Chief Minister of the capital and he has evaded summons for six months. Please do not make an exception as it would demoralise a real common man and it shows that if you are holding a position then you will get benefit\", the Solicitor General had told the bench.\n\nHowever, the bench had said, \"We grant bail in exceptional cases. He is not a repeat offender\" and \"We cannot ignore this aspect (ongoing general elections).\"\n\nKejriwal has approached the top court challenging the Delhi High Court's April 9, 2024, order rejecting his plea against his arrest by the ED and the subsequent remand. The top court had asked the Enforcement Directorate to respond to Kejriwal's plea.\n\nKejriwal in his plea against the High Court order has contended that his arrest after announcement of the General Elections is \"motivated by extraneous considerations\". Describing his arrest as \"motivated\", Kejriwal has contended that a sitting Chief Minister has been arrested in the middle of election cycle and especially after the announcement of the schedule of the 2024 Lok Sabha election.\n\nThe petition by Kejriwal against the High Court order says that the statements and material relied upon by the ED against him was in its possession for the last niner months but why it acted when general elections were on.\n\nThese statements relied upon as grounds of arrest were recorded by the ED from December 7, 2022, till July 27, 2023 and subsequently no further material has been collected against Kejriwal, states the petition.", "source": {"uri": "theindianawaaz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "THE INDIAN AWAAZ"}, "authors": [{"uri": "indian_awaaz@theindianawaaz.com", "name": "Indian Awaaz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chief_ministers_of_Delhi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "List of chief ministers of Delhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_Directorate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Enforcement Directorate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solicitor_General_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Solicitor General of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arvind_Kejriwal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arvind Kejriwal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjiv_Khanna", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sanjiv Khanna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipankar_Datta", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dipankar Datta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Money laundering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tushar_Mehta", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tushar Mehta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equality_before_the_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Equality before the law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_Indian_general_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Next Indian general election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "High Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_High_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delhi High Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 73}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550527", "eventUri": "eng-9550527", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-10", "textStart": 70, "textEnd": 76}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 520, "textEnd": 525}], "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

The agency said that Kejriwal has sought bail to campaign for the Lok Sabha elections. \"It is relevant to note that the right to campaign is neither a fundamental right nor a constitutional right and not even a legal right,\" it added.\n\nThe agency argued that with 123 elections held in the past five years, granting interim bail for campaigning could suggest that no politician can be held in judicial custody as elections occur throughout the year. The ED also highlighted that Kejriwal is not even participating in the current elections. The affidavit was filed by Bhanu Priya, deputy director of the ED.\n\nThis comes just hours after reports surfaced that the agency might file its first chargsheet against Kejriwal in the excise policy case on Friday. This will be the first time Kejriwal will be named as an accused in the money laundering case linked to the now-scrapped excise policy. The ED is expected to label Kejriwal as a \"kingpin\" and principal conspirator in the case.\n\nSeparately, the Supreme Court heard Kejriwal's bail plea on Tuesday and reserved the order. The bench said if it decides to release the AAP chief, \"we are very clear that we don't want you to be performing official duties since it may have a cascading effect.\" \"We do not want interference at all in...[government work]. It's your wish that you want to continue as chief minister. Today, it is not a question of legality but propriety,\" the bench added.", "source": {"uri": "newsbytesapp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsBytes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_Directorate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Enforcement Directorate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arvind_Kejriwal", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arvind Kejriwal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aam_Aadmi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aam Aadmi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affidavit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Affidavit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Money laundering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chief_ministers_of_Delhi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "List of chief ministers of Delhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precedent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Precedent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manish_Sisodia", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manish Sisodia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fundamental rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Goa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Goa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab,_India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Punjab, India"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Punjab, India"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politician"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual_Property", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Intellectual Property", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property_Rights", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property Rights", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://i.cdn.newsbytesapp.com/images/l58520240509172943.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550527", "eventUri": "eng-9550527", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-21", "textStart": 512, "textEnd": 520}], "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

In a federal structure, one election was as good as another.\n\nGiving the Chief Minister interim bail would create two separate classes of people in the country. \"The ordinary people who are bound by the rule of law and politicians who can seek exemption from laws with the hope of securing interim bail to campaign for elections,\" the ED argued.\n\nNo political leader has ever been granted interim bail to campaign. A contesting candidate in custody is not granted bail for campaigning. Even the right to vote is curtailed while in judicial custody under the Representation of People Act. Kejriwal was remanded to judicial custody for the sixth time till May 20. He was arrested on March 21.\n\nAn interim bail for Kejriwal to canvas votes for Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) as a \"star campaigner\" would incentivise every criminal to be a politician and be in campaign mode throughout the year while committing rampant offences. Politicians can claim no special status higher than that of an ordinary citizen. They are as much liable to be arrested and detained for committing offences as any ordinary person, the Central agency reasoned.\n\nBharat Rashtra Samithi leader J Kavitha and Kejriwal's AAP colleague and former Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, both accused in the excise policy case, were denied interim relief by the apex court, the ED reminded.\n\nEven AAP leader Sanjay Singh was asked to try for regular bail in the liquor policy case. Kejriwal, on the other hand, had not even filed any plea for regular or interim bail before the Supreme Court or any other court.\n\nIf the right to campaign was a ground for interim bail, it would be a breach of the fundamental right to equality if a farmer was denied the same relief for harvest season or a director of a company to attend a board meeting or annual general meeting, respectively.\n\n\"There is absolutely no principle which justifies giving a differential treatment to a politician for campaigning over a farmer or a businessman who wishes to pursue his vocation,\" the affidavit pointed out.\n\nThe right to campaign is not a fundamental right or a constitutional right or a legal right.\n\n\"There are many politicians in judicial custody under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. Their cases were examined by competent courts which upheld their custody. There are also several political leaders in judicial custody throughout the country in non-PMLA offences... If the court extends any interim relief to Kejriwal, there is no gain saying that all of them would claim similar treatment claiming that politicians are a class of their own,\" ED contended.\n\nBail to Kejriwal after avoiding multiple summons and on the ground of campaigning for elections would give a \"judicial imprimatur\" to the claim that politicians were a separate class.\n\nThe ED said Kejriwal had skipped summons in October 2023 citing elections in five States. He had ducked summons in December last year referring to the Rajya Sabha elections. He had eschewed summons in January 2024 claiming his presence was required for the Goa polls.\n\n\"His argument that the timing of his arrest before the general elections would render the arrest bad is a complete red-herring and self-contradictory for the reason that for the past six months he had cited one election after another for not complying with the law which an ordinary citizen would be otherwise obliged to follow,\" the Central agency noted.\n\nThe ED said the court reserved its order on interim bail after hearing Kejriwal for three days without giving the Central agency an equal opportunity to lay out its case.\n\nSHARE Copy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditPublished on May 9, 2024", "source": {"uri": "thehindubusinessline.com", "dataType": "news",

Even a contesting candidate is not granted interim bail if he is in custody for his own campaigning.\n\nIt is relevant to note that the right to campaign for an election is neither a fundamental right nor a constitutional right and not even a legal right,\" the ED said. On Wednesday, Justice Sanjiv Khanna, who headed the bench that heard Kejriwal's petition against his arrest in the case, said, \"We will pronounce the interim order (on bail) on Friday. The main matter related to the challenge to arrest will also be taken up on the same day.\" The AAP leader was arrested on March 21 and is currently lodged in Tihar Jail under judicial custody.\n\nThe agency in its affidavit said, \"In light of the above factual and legal submissions, the prayer for interim bail deserves to be rejected as it would not only be contrary to settled principles of law but violate the rule of law which is a basic feature of the Constitution.\" It underscored that grant of any special concession to the Delhi chief minister and enlarging him on interim bail for campaigning in the general elections would be \"anathema to the rule of law and equality and create a precedent\".\n\n\"Grant of interim bail merely for political campaigning would militate against and will be discriminatory to the rule of equality as work/business/ profession or activity of every citizen is equally important to him or her,\" it said, adding it would not be possible to hold that the work of a small farmer or trader is any less important than campaigning by a political leader who admittedly is not contesting.\n\nIt said, \"This Court would take the call about grant/refusal of interim bail/release after 3-day long arguments of the petitioner. As against this, the respondents (ED) have just begun. On this ground also this court may take a final view about the petition after fully hearing the respondent particularly when there is no medical urgency which requires consideration of interim release without fully hearing the respondents.\" The agency said if Kejriwal is extended any interim relief on account of him being a politician for campaigning in the Lok Sabha polls for his party, there is no gainsaying that all jailed politicians would seek similar treatment claiming they are in a class of their own.\n\n\"A politician can claim no special status higher than that of an ordinary citizen and is as much liable to be arrested and detained for committing offences as any other citizen,\" it said in its 44-page affidavit.\n\nThe agency submitted that there is absolutely no principle which justifies giving a differential treatment to a politician for campaigning over a farmer or a businessman who wishes to pursue his vocation.\n\n\"If the right to campaign is treated as a basis for grant of interim bail it would breach the principles of Article 14 for the reason that harvesting for a farmer would be an equally important factor seeking interim bail as would a board meeting or an annual general meeting for a director of a company who commits a crime as these are their respective vocations or professions,\" it said.\n\nPointing out that Kejriwal has not filed petitions for regular or interim bail before the apex court or any other court, the ED said the consistent approach of this court has been to relegate parties to the remedy of bail under CrPC when they had challenged their arrest claiming it to be illegal.\n\nIt referred to the orders passed by the court in the cases of former deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, AAP leader Sanjay Singh and Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) leader K Kavitha, where the court asked them to move bail petitions in the money laundering case related to the Delhi excise policy scam.\n\nThe agency said such an approach would violate the cherished values of the Constitution which upholds the rule of law as a basic feature meaning thereby that \"howsoever high you might be you are not above the law\".\n\nOn May 7, the bench, also comprising Justice Dipankar Datta, had reserved its verdict on whether or not to grant Kejriwal interim bail in the money laundering case linked to the alleged excise scam.\n\nA Delhi court had, the same day, extended Kejriwal's judicial custody in the case till May 20.\n\nThe Delhi High Court had last month upheld the AAP leader's arrest, saying there was no illegality and the ED was left with \"little option\" after he skipped repeated summonses and refused to join the investigation.\n\nThe matter relates to alleged corruption and money laundering in the formulation and execution of the Delhi government's now-scrapped excise policy for 2021-22.

Earlier, the Delhi CM had used same excuse to dodge ED summons when he skipped the summons in the name of campaigning for assembly elections in 5 states late last year.\n\nSaying that granting bail to Arvind Kejriwal will be discriminatory in nature, ED said that no politician could be arrested and kept in judicial custody if they are granted interim bail for poll campaigning.\n\nThe ED mentioned in the affidavit, \"Around 123 elections have taken place in the past three years and if interim bail is granted for election campaigning then no politician can be arrested and kept in judicial custody since elections take place all year round.\"\n\nIt also said that Arvind Kejriwal or any other politician cannot cannot claim a special status higher than that of an ordinary citizen in the name of election campaigning as it would be discriminatory.", "source": {"uri": "opindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OpIndia"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_Directorate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Enforcement Directorate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arvind_Kejriwal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arvind Kejriwal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affidavit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Affidavit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fundamental rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detention_(imprisonment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detention (imprisonment)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Surety_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Surety Bonds", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic_Participation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Civic Participation", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 55}], "image": "https://www.opindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/BeFunky-collage-2023-12-18T184259.660.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550527", "eventUri": "eng-9550527", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-09", "textStart": 216, "textEnd": 221}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-10", "textStart": 408, "textEnd": 414}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-21", "textStart": 449, "textEnd": 457}], "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 196, "relevance": 1}

In an affidavit submitted to the Supreme Court, the agency argued that the right to campaign for elections was not a fundamental right. The affidavit, presented by ED's Deputy Director Bhanu Priya, came a day before the scheduled Supreme Court hearing on Kejriwal's interim bail plea related to the Delhi liquor policy case.\n\nCampaigning not considered fundamental right\n\nAccording to the affidavit, the ED emphasised that campaigning for an election wasn't recognised as a fundamental, constitutional, or legal right. The agency pointed out that no political leader had been granted interim bail for campaigning unless they were contesting candidates.\n\nKejriwal criticised for seeking bail\n\nThe ED criticised Kejriwal for seeking interim bail, highlighting that he had previously evaded summons citing elections in five states.\n\nSpecial concession rejected\n\nThe agency firmly rejected the idea of granting special concessions to Kejriwal, stating that doing so would undermine the rule of law and equality. It argued that granting him bail for election campaigning would create a precedent allowing politicians to evade investigation under the pretext of elections.\n\nEquality before law\n\nThe ED underscored that no politician, including Kejriwal, should claim a status higher than that of an ordinary citizen. Granting special exemptions to politicians would create a divide between ordinary citizens bound by the law and politicians seeking exceptions.\n\nPast incidents cited\n\nHighlighting past incidents, the ED mentioned that politicians have contested elections while in judicial custody without being granted interim bail. It pointed out that several politicians across the country might be in judicial custody for various offences, even beyond the purview of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).\n\nArvind Kejriwal's arrest\n\nArvind Kejriwal was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate on March 21 in connection with the Delhi liquor policy case.

The apex court is scheduled to pass an order on the issue of interim bail to Mr Kejriwal on Friday.\n\nAccording to sources, the ED is also likely to file its first chargesheet against Mr Kejriwal in connection with the ongoing money laundering probe on Friday. If the chargesheet against the AAP national convener is filed, this will be the first occasion when he will be named as an accused in the case and is likely to be called a key conspirator in the now-scrapped Delhi liquor policy \"scam\".\n\nCalling the ED chargesheet, which is likely to be filed soon in a city court, the \"BJP's chargesheet\", the AAP alleged the party in power at the Centre only intends to defame Mr Kejriwal.\n\nAlso, Mr Kejriwal's legal team registered a strong objection to the ED's affidavit opposing interim bail in the apex court. It made the complaint to the top court registry, countering the affidavit submitted after the hearing was completed and just before the decision was to be announced on Friday.\n\nThe AAP denounced the ED's affidavit as a \"blatant disregard of legal procedures\", as the affidavit was submitted without taking the apex court's approval.\n\nIn its affidavit opposing the interim bail plea of Mr Kejriwal in the Supreme Court, the ED said no political leader has ever been granted interim bail for campaigning, even if he is contesting polls.\n\n\"It is relevant to note that the right to campaign for an election is neither a fundamental right nor a constitutional right and not even a legal right,\" reads the ED's affidavit.\n\nThe ED said that, to its knowledge, \"no political leader has been granted interim bail for campaigning. Even a contesting candidate is not granted interim bail if he is in custody for his own campaigning\".\n\nEven the right to vote while in judicial custody, which is considered by the top court to be a statutory or constitutional right, is curtailed by statute by virtue of Section 62(5) of the Representation of Peoples Act.\n\n\"It is pertinent to note that around 123 elections have taken place in the last 5 years and if interim bail is to be granted for the purpose of campaigning in an election, then no politician can be arrested and kept in judicial custody since elections are all-year-round phenomena,\" the agency said.\n\nIt further said: \"In a Federal structure, no set of elections is more significant than another and therefore, every politician at every level will argue that if he is not let out on interim bail, he will suffer irreversible consequences.\"\n\nUnder the Prevention of Money Laundering Act alone, there are many politicians who are in judicial custody at present and their cases are examined by competent courts upholding their custody. There must be several political leaders in judicial custody throughout the country for non-PMLA offences. \"There is no reason why a special prayer for special treatment by the petitioner be acceded to,\" the ED said. .\n\n\"Granting interim bail merely for political campaigning will militate against and be discriminatory to the rule of equality, as work/business/profession or activity of every citizen is equally important to him or her. It will not be possible to hold that the work of a small farmer or a small trader is any less important than the political campaigning of a political leader who admittedly is not contesting,\" it said.\n\nCiting that the top court will take the call about the grant or refusal of interim bail or release after three days of arguments by the petitioner, the ED affidavit said it has just begun.\n\n\"On this ground also, this court may take a final view about the petition after fully hearing the respondent (the ED) particularly when there is no medical urgency, which requires consideration of interim release without fully hearing the respondents,\" the affidavit said.\n\nThe ED said: \"If the petitioner is extended any interim relief on account of him being a politician for the purposes of campaigning in the general election for his party, there is no gain in saying that all politicians incarcerated in some case or another will not seek a similar treatment, claiming that politicians are a class of their own.\"\n\nThe apex court in a larger bench in Vijay Madanlal Chaudhary versus Union of India & Others 2022 has held that \"social and economic offences stand on a graver footing as they not only involve an individual victim but harm society as a whole,\" the ED said, adding that it does not agree with the observations suggesting that the offence of money laundering is a less heinous offence than the terrorism sought to be tackled under TADA or that there is no compelling state interest in tackling the offence of money-laundering.\n\nIn his reply dated November 2, 2023, to summons dated October 30, 2023, the petitioner (Mr Kejriwal), in order to avoid the summons, had used the same excuse of state elections in five states and during the arguments on interim bail, the petitioner is setting up the same ground of campaigning in the Lok Sabha elections to seek relief, the agency said.\n\nThe ED said if the apex court grants interim bail to Mr Kejriwal, it will give judicial imprimatur to the actions of the petitioner -- firstly to avoid summons citing the reason of campaigning in state elections as being a \"star campaigner\" of the AAP and secondly, to seek interim bail for campaigning for the party AAP in the general election, thereby carving out a separate class in favour of politicians who wish to campaign for their respective political parties.\n\n\"Such an approach would violate the cherished values of the Constitution, which upholds the rule of law as a basic feature, meaning that no matter how high you might be, you are not above the law,\" it said.\n\nLikewise, Mr Kejriwal also chose to avoid the summons dated December 22, 2023, as evident from his reply dated January 3, citing his preoccupation with the Rajya Sabha elections to avoid the summons.\n\nThe top court, the ED said, has repeatedly frowned upon the grant of bail to a person only on the consideration that he is a political leader of some prominent political party.\n\nA politician can claim no special status higher than that of an ordinary citizen and is as much liable to be arrested and detained for committing offences as any other citizen, the affidavit said.\n\n\"If the right to campaign is treated as a basis for the grant of interim bail, it would breach the principles of Article 14 for the reason that harvesting for a farmer will be an equally important factor seeking interim bail as will a board meeting or an annual general meeting for a director of a company who commits a crime, as these are their respective vocations or professions,\" the ED said, adding, \"There is absolutely no principle that justifies giving a differential treatment to a politician for campaigning over a farmer or a businessman who wishes to pursue his vocation.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Justice Sanjiv Khanna, who headed the bench that heard Mr Kejriwal's petition against his arrest in the case, said, \"We will pronounce the interim order (on bail) on Friday.

He approached the SC after he lost his case before the trial court and the High Court.\n\nA bench led by Justice Sanjiv Khanna Tuesday indicated it may consider granting bail to Kejriwal, but only for participating in the electoral process, implying the Delhi CM would not be allowed to sign official files.\n\nAs for arguments on the questions of law arising in the petition, the court said that it would hear sometime later, maybe next week.\n\nDuring the hearing both Solicitor General Tushar Mehta and Additional Solicitor General S.V. Raju had urged the court to hear them on the grant of interim bail as well and warned them against treating Kejriwal as a special class of citizen.\n\nAlso Read: Why was Arvind Kejriwal arrested ahead of Lok Sabha polls, Supreme Court asks ED\n\nRepeating their oral arguments, the ED's affidavit emphasises that Kejriwal cannot claim a higher status than an ordinary citizen and was not entitled to a differential treatment.\n\nIt said there was no precedent from the past to support Kejriwal's demand to free him on interim bail so that he can campaign for his party. No political leader has been granted interim bail for campaigning even though he is not the contesting candidate, the agency stated.\n\nEven a contesting candidate cannot be granted interim bail for his own campaigning, the agency asserted. Kejriwal's release on interim bail on the ground that he has to be part of the ongoing elections will create a precedent, which, the ED said, \"will permit all unscrupulous politicians to commit crimes, avoid investigation under the garb of elections.\"\n\nThe ED invoked the SC's order that rejected Kejriwal's colleague and AAP leader Manish Sisodia's bail plea to convince the bench to reconsider its intention. The paragraph cited from that order says: \"Rule of law means that laws apply equally to all citizens and institutions, including the State. Rule of law requires an equal right to access to justice for the marginalised. The rule also mandates objectives and fair treatment to all.\"\n\nThe order denying bail to Sisodia was written by Justice Khanna, who heads the bench hearing Kejriwal's plea.\n\nThe ED affidavit further referred to the Representation of the People's Act to point out that even the right to vote of a person gets curtailed when he/she is in judicial custody. This even as the right to vote is considered as a statutory or constitutional right, it added.\n\n\"It is pertinent to note that around 123 elections have taken place in the last 5 years and if interim bail is to be granted for the purpose of campaigning in an election, then no politician can be arrested and kept in judicial custody since elections are all year round phenomena,\" the ED submitted.\n\nGrant of bail will work against the rule of law as there are many politicians who are in judicial custody for money laundering offences and whose custody is under scrutiny of various courts, it added. Therefore, there is \"no reason why a special prayer for a special treatment by the petitioner (Kejriwal) be acceded to.\"\n\n\"If the petitioner is extended any interim relief on account of him being a politician for the purposes of campaigning in general elections for his party, there is no gain saying that all politicians incarcerated in some cases or the other would not seek a similar treatment claiming that politicians are a class of their own,\" the ED said.\n\nAn order extending any special concession would also discriminate against a small farmer or a trader as it would give importance to the special class of politicians, the ED said, requesting the court to conclude its hearing of Kejriwal's petition and pronounce a final verdict.\n\nGiven that Kejriwal had avoided the ED summons, the agency said interim bail to him would be giving \"judicial imprimatur\" (official permission) to his actions.", "source": {"uri": "theprint.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "ThePrint"},

The letter urged the registrar not to accept ED's affidavit and take it on record because the top court has already reserved its order on the issue of interim bail and that the agency did not have the court's permission to file any additional document.\n\nThe Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) said it has \"raised strong objection to ED's affidavit\".\n\n\"A formal complaint has been lodged his with the Supreme Court's registry denouncing ED's affidavit as a blatant disregard of legal procedures, especially considering that the matter is already slated for a final decision in the SC tomorrow and the affidavit was submitted without taking the SC's approval,\" the party said in a statement.\n\nJustice Sanjiv Khanna, who leads the bench that had earlier this week reserved its verdict on the temporary bail issue, mentioned on Wednesday that the court is expected to deliver its ruling on Friday. During previous hearings, the top court signalled a potential interim bail for Kejriwal considering the ongoing general elections but expressed reservations about allowing him to perform his official duties as the CM during the bail period, citing possible conflicts.\n\nIn its affidavit on Thursday, ED highlighted that the principle of equality should apply uniformly to all citizens regardless of their political status, contending that granting bail to Kejriwal on the grounds of political expediency would not only be detrimental to the rule of law but also unfair to other individuals, such as poor farmers or small-time businessmen, whose livelihoods depend on their freedom. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta and additional solicitor general SV Raju appeared for ED in the case.\n\n\"Such an approach would incentivise every criminal to become a politician and being in campaign mode throughout the year while committing rampant offences and violations of laws in the country...right to campaign for an election is neither a fundamental right nor a constitutional right and not even a legal right,\" stated the agency. It pointed out that no political leader has been granted interim bail for campaigning in past elections, and even contesting candidates are not granted bail for their campaign activities while in custody.\n\n\"Any special concession in favour of the arrestee (Kejriwal) enlarging him on interim bail for campaigning in general election would amount to anathema to the rule of law and equality and create a precedent which would permit all unscrupulous politicians to commit crimes, avoid investigation under the garb of one election or the other and thereafter upon being arrested, seek interim bail to campaign,\" said ED.\n\nImploring the top court to resist the temptation to accord special treatment to Kejriwal for the sake of political campaigns, ED cautioned that interim bail to the Delhi CM would end up carving out politicians as a \"class of their own\" favouring unscrupulous politicians over ordinary citizens, undermining equality before the law.\n\n\"Such an approach would violate the cherished values of the Constitution which upholds the rule of law as a basic feature meaning thereby that howsoever high you might be you are not above the law...A politician can claim no special status higher than that of an ordinary citizen and is as much liable to be arrested and detained for committing offences as any other citizen,\" stated ED's affidavit.\n\nDrawing attention to the judiciary's consistent stance on bail, the affidavit cited previous instances where bail petitions from politicians have been rejected, emphasising the need for consistency and uniformity in judicial decisions.\n\n\"There is absolutely no principle which justifies giving a differential treatment to a politician for campaigning over a farmer or a businessman who wishes to pursue his vocation...There are numerous examples where politicians contested elections in judicial custody, and some have even won but were never granted interim bail on this ground,\" said the agency, pressing for dismissal of Kejriwal's plea.\n\nThe affidavit rebutted the CM's claims of political victimisation, arguing Kejriwal skipped nine summonses citing state polls during six months before he was arrested on March 21. It further referred to the Supreme Court's previous stance on bail, citing the rejection of bail plea by co-accused Manish Sisodia and K Kavitha in the same case, underscoring the principle of equal treatment under the law for all citizens.\n\nThe developments come amid the ongoing general elections, with polling in Delhi scheduled for May 25 and in Punjab on June 1. The court's decision on interim bail for Kejriwal is awaited. The results of the elections are set to be announced on June 4.\n\nThe case stems from allegations of irregularities in Delhi's excise policy, which the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) began probing following a recommendation by Delhi's LG in July 2022. Kejriwal, who is in judicial custody, is the third AAP leader arrested in this connection. Sisodia has been in jail since February 2023, and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh was granted bail by the top court in April this year after six months of custody.\n\nA bench comprises justices Khanna and Dipankar Datta on Tuesday indicated willingness to grant interim bail to Kejriwal but expressed reservations about allowing him to discharge his official functions as the CM during the period of interim bail, saying it \"will lead to conflict\" and may have a \"cascading effect\".\n\nWhile ED urged the court not to release Kejriwal on bail by treating politicians as a class different from ordinary citizens, the court acknowledged Kejriwal's unique position as both the CM and the convener of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) during the ongoing polls, describing it as an \"extraordinary situation\" warranting consideration for interim bail.\n\nAt the same time, the court raised concerns about the potential ramifications of allowing Kejriwal to sign off on official files while on interim bail. \"We don't want you to be performing your official duties. It would lead to conflict. You have continued (as the CM) and that's your choice. We are not dealing with that issue. But today, it's not a question of legality but propriety... We don't want any interference in the working of the government. It will have a cascading effect,\" the bench had on the day told senior counsel Abhishek Manu Singhvi, who appeared for Kejriwal in the case.\n\nThe AAP, in its statement, said Kejriwal's was an \"assault on democracy\".\n\n\"ED has not only been opaque and dictatorial in its approach but also guilty of suggestio falsi (suggesting falsehood) and suppressio veri (suppressing truth)... Kejriwal's arrest constitutes an unprecedented assault on the tenets of democracy based on 'free and fair elections' and 'federalism' both of which form significant constituents of the basic structure of the Constitution,\" said the party.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It said that granting bail to the AAP leader would create \"two separate classes in the country viz. ordinary people who are bound by the rule of law as well as the laws of the country and politicians who can seek exemption from the laws...\".\n\nThe agency said that \"the right to campaign for an election is neither a fundamental right nor a constitutional right and not even a legal right\" and to its knowledge, \"no political leader has been granted interim bail for campaigning even though he is not the contesting candidate\".\n\nThe ED said that \"even a contesting candidate is not granted interim bail if he is in custody for his own campaigning\" and added that \"even the right to vote while in judicial custody which is considered by this Court as a statutory/constitutional right, is curtailed by statute by virtue of section 62(5) of the Representation of Peoples Act, and upheld\" in the 1997 ruling in Anukul Chandra Pradhan v Union of India.\n\nThe affidavit pointed out that \"around 123 elections have taken place in the last 5 years\" and said \"if interim bail is to be granted for the purpose of campaigning in an election then no politician can be arrested and kept in judicial custody since elections are all year round phenomena\".\n\nThe ED said, \"In a federal structure, no set of election is more significant than another and therefore, every politician at every level would argue that if he is not let out on interim bail, he would suffer irreversible consequences.\"\n\nIt added, \"Under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act alone, presently there are many politicians who are in judicial custody and their cases are examined by competent courts upholding their custody. There must be several political leaders in judicial custody throughout the country in non-PMLA offences. There is no reason why a special prayer for a special treatment by the petitioner be acceded to.\"\n\nThe agency contended that \"grant of interim bail merely for political campaigning would militate against and will be discriminatory to the rule of equality as work/business/profession or activity of every citizen is equally important to him or her. It would not be possible to hold that work of a small farmer or a small trader is any less important than political campaigning of a political leader who admittedly is not contesting\".\n\nThe ED said that Kejriwal had cited \"the very same excuse of state elections in 5 states\" in his reply dated November 2, 2023 to summons dated October 30, 2023, \"in order to avoid the summons...and during the arguments on interim bail...is setting up the same ground of campaigning in general elections to seek interim bail\".\n\nIt said that if the court grants Arvind Kejriwal interim bail, \"it will be giving judicial imprimatur to\" his action \"to avoid summons citing the reason of campaigning in state elections being a \"star campaigner\" of the Aam Aadmi Party\" and \"seek interim bail for campaigning for Aam Aadmi Party in the general elections thereby carving out a separate class in favour of politicians who wish to campaign for their respective political parties\".", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chief_ministers_of_Delhi", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "List of chief ministers of Delhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_Directorate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Enforcement Directorate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rule of law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arvind_Kejriwal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arvind Kejriwal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affidavit", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Affidavit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detention_(imprisonment)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Detention (imprisonment)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fundamental rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Statute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Contract"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion_of_India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dominion of India"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aam_Aadmi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aam Aadmi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffrage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Suffrage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Money laundering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property_Rights", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property Rights", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2024/04/Arvind-Kejriwal-jail-2024-04-d78cca5bb8d820686d3c64349d14dd01-1200x675.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550527", "eventUri": "eng-9550527", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

Hence, it would not be appropriate to grant him interim bail especially when he is not contesting the elections.\n\nED has contended that no politician has been granted an interim bail till date just for campaigning for elections, especially when they are not contesting elections. Furthermore, even when they are contesting, the court has refused bail just for campaigning.\n\nAccording to the affidavit \"It is pertinent to note that 123 elections have taken place in the last five years. If interim bail is granted for the purpose of campaigning then no politician can be arrested and kept in judicial custody as elections happen all year round.\"\n\nNoting that many political leaders may be in judicial custody for both money laundering and other offences, the affidavit states that thus there is no special reason for Arvind Kejriwal's interim bail.\n\n\"In a federal structure, no set of election is more significant than another.

ED's affidavit stated that granting interim bail to Kejriwal would be an anathema to the rule of equality and would become a precedent to politicians to commit crime and then avoid investigation because they were contesting elections.\n\nThe Supreme Court is expected to pronounce its order in Kejriwal's interim bail plea on May 10.\n\nOn April 15, the SC refused to grant any immediate relief to Kejriwal. The court, however, issued notice to ED and asked it to respond to the AAP chief's petition by April 24.\n\nKejriwal moved the court against the Delhi High Court order that upheld his arrest.

If he does sign some official papers or does some other work related to the administration it will have a cascading effect.\n\nKejriwal had approached the Apex Court challenging his arrest and the remand thereafter. The Delhi CM had also requested the top court to give him interim bail meanwhile for the campaigning of the Lok Sabha Election.\n\nThe Top court which is hearing the larger matter of Kejriwal's plea against his arrest had earlier said it would consider bail for the AAP leader to allow him to campaign for his party in the ongoing Lok Sabha election.\n\nDelhi has seven Lok Sabha seats, all of which were won by the BJP in the last election. The voting this year is in a single phase on May 25.\n\nThe Apex Court had also told the ED, \"You cannot exclude one aspect. You are depriving a person of their right to life,\" Justice Dipankar Datta had said.\n\nOn the other hand, the Supreme Court also said, \"George Fernandes contested elections from jail and won by a huge margin of votes.

Raju, who appears for the Directorate of Enforcement in Kejriwal matter that it may pass the order on interim relief to Delhi Chief Minister on Friday.\n\nOn Tuesday (May 7), a bench of Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Justice Dipankar Datta had indicated granting interim bail to Kejriwal to enable him to campaign for the ongoing Lok Sabha elections. However, the court had said that if interim bail is granted, Kejriwal would not be allowed to discharge any official duties as Chief Minister.\n\nThe Solicitor General Tushar Mehta representing the Directorate of Enforcement had vehemently opposed any grant of interim bail to Kejriwal, urging the bench not to treat politicians as a separate category. He had contended that all were equal before the law, be it a Chief Minister or a commoner.\n\n\"How can a Chief Minister be treated differently than a aam aadmi. There can't be any deviation only because he is a Chief Minister. Would campaigning for elections be more important?\" the Solicitor General had told the bench pointing out that the electioneering is a luxury.\n\n\"We are dealing with the Chief Minister of the capital and he has evaded summons for six months. Please do not make an exception as it would demoralise a real common man and it shows that if you are holding a position then you will get benefit\", the Solicitor General had told the bench.\n\nHowever, the bench had said, \"We grant bail in exceptional cases. He is not a repeat offender\" and \"We cannot ignore this aspect (ongoing general elections).\"\n\nKejriwal has approached the top court challenging the Delhi High Court's April 9, 2024, order rejecting his plea against his arrest by the ED and the subsequent remand. The top court had asked the Enforcement Directorate to respond to Kejriwal's plea.\n\nKejriwal in his plea against the High Court order has contended that his arrest after announcement of the General Elections is \"motivated by extraneous considerations\". Describing his arrest as \"motivated\", Kejriwal has contended that a sitting Chief Minister has been arrested in the middle of election cycle and especially after the announcement of the schedule of the 2024 Lok Sabha election.\n\nThe petition by Kejriwal against the High Court order says that the statements and material relied upon by the ED against him was in its possession for the last niner months but why it acted when general elections were on.\n\nThese statements relied upon as grounds of arrest were recorded by the ED from December 7, 2022, till July 27, 2023 and subsequently no further material has been collected against Kejriwal, states the petition.\n\n\"Moreover, such statements and material were in possession of the Enforcement Directorate for the last nine months and still the arrest has been made illegally in the middle of general election 2024\", says the petition by Kejriwal.\n\nThe petition says that Kejriwal's arrest also constitutes an \"unprecedented assault on the tenets of democracy\" based on \"free and fair elections\" and \"federalism\", both of which form significant constituents of the basic structure of the Constitution.", "source": {"uri": "thestatesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Statesman"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipankar_Datta", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dipankar Datta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjiv_Khanna", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sanjiv Khanna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_Directorate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Enforcement Directorate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solicitor_General_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Solicitor General of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arvind_Kejriwal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arvind Kejriwal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chief_ministers_of_Delhi", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "List of chief ministers of Delhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Money laundering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tushar_Mehta", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tushar Mehta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equality_before_the_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Equality before the law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "High Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_structure_doctrine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basic structure doctrine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_High_Court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delhi High Court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://www.thestatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_6923.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550527", "eventUri": "eng-9550527", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-07", "textStart": 12, "textEnd": 17, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-10", "textStart": 262, "textEnd": 268}], "sentiment": 0.3568627450980393, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Thus, all 4 incriminating statements are from persons closely linked to the BJP,\" it added.\n\nThe AAP further added that these statements indicate a pattern \"these persons were arrested, they made multiple statements which did not implicate Shri Arvind Kejriwal. The ED repeatedly objected to their bail, they made statements implicating Shri Arvind Kejriwal, they were granted bail/pardon without the ED objecting to it. All the statements where there is no allegation against Shri Arvind Kejriwal were deliberately ignored by the ED.\"\n\n\"Some of these statements do not even indicate the commission of money laundering or any predicate offence. All of the evidence against Shri Arvind Kejriwal as shown in the Grounds of Arrest have come after the arrest of all these people, leading to a suspicion that the arrest has been systematically used as a device to coerce statements against Shri Arvind Kejriwal,\" the AAP shared.\n\nThe AAP mentioned that the ED illegally 'picked up' a sitting Chief Minister and the National Convenor of a national party on 21.03.2024, that is, 5 days after the General Elections were announced and the Model Code of Conduct was put in place. The AAP is in direct opposition to the ruling BJP at the Centre in the ongoing General Elections and voting had already commenced from 17.04.2024. During an election cycle when political activity is at its peak, Shri Arvind Kejriwal's illegal arrest has caused grave prejudice to the AAP and will provide the BJP at the Centre an unjust upper hand in the ongoing elections. A level playing field, which is a prerequisite for 'free and fair elections', has clearly been compromised with the illegal arrest of Shri Arvind Kejriwal.\n\nThe party stated that the ED has not only been opaque and dictatorial in its approach but also guilty of suggestio falsi (suggesting falsehood) and suppressio veri (suppressing truth).\n\n\"Arvind Kejriwal's arrest constitutes an unprecedented assault on the tenets of democracy based on 'free and fair elections' and 'federalism' both of which form significant constituents of the basic structure of the Constitution. The ED abused its power of arrest in the middle of General Election and while relying on the same material as was in possession months before his arrest,\" the release said.\n\nThe AAP further detailed that there is no material to show the involvement of any AAP leader in the process or activity related to POC, be it one of concealment, possession, acquisition, use of proceeds of crime as much as projecting it as untainted property or claiming it to be so.\n\n\"There is no proof that the AAP received any funds from \"South Group\". The ED in its counter affidavit filed before the High Court has already admitted that Shri Arvind Kejriwal was not involved in handling the transfer of any amounts,\" the party said.\n\nThe AAP shared that the ED has categorically stated in their reply filed in these proceedings, that Arvind Kejriwal is not named as an accused in the ECIR; nor is he named as an accused in the scheduled offence registered by the CBI, which is the foundation of the proceedings in the ECIR.\n\n\"The power to arrest in this case is a glaring abuse of the due process of law as well as the procedure established. The ED's approach completely negates the basic tenets and foundation principles of criminal jurisprudence, that is, fair investigation, fair trial and rule of law,\" the party said.\n\nEarlier today, the Directorate of Enforcement (ED) on Thursday filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court opposing the grant of interim bail to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and said a politician cannot claim a higher status than an ordinary citizen and was not entitled to differential treatment.\n\nED, while filing an affidavit in Delhi's excise policy case, said a politician can claim no special status higher than that of an ordinary citizen and is as much liable to be arrested and detained for committing offences as any other citizen.\n\nA bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Dipankar Dutta had hinted of granting interim bail to Kejriwal to enable him to campaign for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections in Delhi. However, it had also said that if interim bail is granted, Kejriwal would not be allowed to discharge any official duties as Chief Minister.\n\nKejriwal was arrested on March 21 by the Enforcement Directorate in relation to the excise policy case.

Justice Sanjiv Khanna, who headed the bench which heard Kejriwal's petition against his arrest in the case, said, \"We will pronounce the interim order (on interim bail) on Friday. The main matter related to the challenge to arrest will also be taken on the same day.\"\n\nJustice Khanna, who was sitting in a different combination with Justices MM Sundresh and Bela M Trivedi, made the remark after Additional Solicitor General SV Raju, who was appearing for the Centre in a matter related to Goods and Services Tax, sought clarification on the listing of Kejriwal's plea. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader was arrested on March 21 and is currently lodged in Tihar Jail under judicial custody.\n\nSolicitor General Tushar Mehta, who also appeared for the probe agency, had staunchly opposed showing any leniency to Kejriwal on account of the Lok Sabha polls and said granting interim bail to the AAP national convenor would amount to creating a separate class for politicians. The bench has divided the hearing on Kejriwal's petition against his arrest into two parts.\n\nDuring the hearing Additional Solicitor General SV Raju told the Supreme Court that the agency has \"evidence\" against the AAP chief. The ASG further asserted that the ED was in no way concerned with the politics surrounding his arrest.\n\nOn May 7, the bench, also comprising Justice Dipankar Datta, had reserved its verdict on interim bail to Kejriwal. The two-judge bench had risen without pronouncing order on granting Kejriwal interim bail to enable him to campaign in the Lok Sabha elections.\n\nThe bench had reserved its decision after hearing the arguments put forth by senior advocate Abhishek Singhvi and Additional Solicitor General S V Raju, who appeared for Kejriwal and the Enforcement Directorate, respectively.\n\nHis main petition challenges his arrest by the ED and seeks it to be declared as illegal, while the second aspect pertains to grant of interim bail keeping in mind the ongoing Lok Sabha polls. The court reserved the order on the issue of grant of interim bail.\n\nOn Tuesday, a Delhi court has extended Kejriwal's judicial custody in the money laundering case till May 20. The Delhi High Court had on April 9 upheld Kejriwal's arrest, saying there was no illegality and the ED was left with \"little option\" after he skipped repeated summonses and refused to join the investigation.

Justice Sanjiv Khanna, who leads the bench that a day ago reserved its verdict on the temporary bail issue, mentioned on Wednesday that the court is expected to deliver its ruling on May 10.\n\n\"We are going to take up Kejriwal's case on Friday... As far as the interim order is concerned, we may also pass that order on Friday,\" justice Khanna told additional solicitor general (ASG) SV Raju, who represents the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in the excise policy case.\n\nEarlier this week, the top court signalled potential interim bail for Kejriwal considering the ongoing general elections but expressed reservations about allowing him to perform his official duties as the chief minister during the bail period, citing possible conflicts.\n\nRaju, appearing for the Centre on Wednesday, was addressing a case concerning various provisions of the CGST Act, which has faced legal challenges through multiple petitions. At the end of the day's proceedings, Raju inquired about the next hearing of the CGST case, as justice Khanna had previously indicated that Kejriwal's matter would be taken up on Thursday.\n\nIn response, justice Khanna said that the bench would continue hearing the CGST case on Thursday, while Kejriwal's matter would be scheduled for Friday, coinciding with the anticipated announcement of the interim bail order.\n\nThe bench, which also comprises justice Dipankar Datta, on Tuesday indicated its willingness to grant interim bail to Kejriwal on the condition that he not discharge his official functions as the CM because it could \"lead to conflict\" and may have a \"cascading effect\".\n\nWhile ED urged the court not to release Kejriwal on bail by treating politicians as a class different from ordinary citizens, the court acknowledged Kejriwal's unique position as both the CM of Delhi and the convener of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) during the ongoing polls, describing it as an \"extraordinary situation\" warranting consideration.\n\nThe court told Kejriwal's senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, who appeared for Kejriwal: \"You have continued [as CM] and that's your choice. We are not dealing with that issue. But today, it's not a question of legality but propriety... We don't want any interference in the working of the government. It will have a cascading effect.\"\n\nSinghvi initially objected to the proposed condition, emphasising his client's democratic and political rights. However, he later agreed that Kejriwal would refrain from signing any official files during the bail period if the lieutenant governor does not stall any government's proposal citing the absence of CM's signature.\n\nThe court then reserved its order on interim bail, emphasising the need to formulate an opinion on the issue and review relevant case files. It also indicated that it would continue hearing ED's submissions opposing Kejriwal's plea to declare his arrest and remand as illegal.\n\nArguing through solicitor general (SG) Tushar Mehta and ASG Raju, the agency on Tuesday opposed the interim bail, cautioning against creating a separate class for political leaders who want to campaign during elections while a common man like a farmer or a small store owner remains incarcerated for want of extraordinary consideration.\n\nPolling in Delhi and Punjab -- states where the AAP is in government -- is scheduled for May 25 and June 1 respectively. The results will be announced on June 4.\n\nThe case stems from allegations of irregularities in Delhi's excise policy, which the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) began probing following a recommendation by Delhi's LG in July 2022. Kejriwal, who is in judicial custody, is the third AAP leader arrested in this connection. Sisodia has been behind bars since February 2023, and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh was granted bail by the top court in April after six months of custody.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_Directorate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Enforcement Directorate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arvind_Kejriwal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arvind Kejriwal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excise", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Excise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjiv_Khanna", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sanjiv Khanna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chief_ministers_of_Delhi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "List of chief ministers of Delhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solicitor_General_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Solicitor General of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipankar_Datta", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dipankar Datta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairperson", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chairperson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Senior counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhishek_Singhvi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abhishek Singhvi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aam_Aadmi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Aam Aadmi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_Parliament,_Rajya_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member of Parliament, Rajya Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tushar_Mehta", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tushar Mehta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Central Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieutenant_governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lieutenant governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_and_political_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil and political rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab,_India", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Punjab, India"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Punjab, India"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Singapore"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2024/05/08/1600x900/The-court-reserved-its-order-on-interim-bail--emph_1715191055634.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550527", "eventUri": "eng-9550527", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-25", "dateEnd": "2024-06-01", "textStart": 3468, "textEnd": 3485}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-10", "textStart": 332, "textEnd": 338}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-04", "textStart": 3533, "textEnd": 3539}], "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

said even the right to vote while in judicial custody which is considered by this court as a statutory/ constitutional right, is curtailed by statute by virtue of Section 62(5) of the Representation of People, Act.\n\nThe ED said that there are numerous examples where politicians contested elections in judicial custody and some have even won but were never granted interim bail on this

Constitution.\n\n\"Such an approach would incentivise every criminal to become a politician and be in campaign mode throughout the year while committing rampant offences and violations of law in the country,\" the ED said.\n\nThe ED emphasised that any special concession in favour of Kejriwal by granting him interim bail for campaigning in the general election would amount to anathema to the rule of law and equality and create a precedent which would permit all unscrupulous politicians to commit crimes and avoid investigation under the garb of one election or the other.\n\n\"There is absolutely no principle which justifies giving a differential treatment to a politician for campaigning over a farmer or a businessman who wishes to pursue his vocation,\" said the ED.\n\nThe ED said if the right to campaign is treated as a basis for grant of interim bail it would breach the principles of Article 14.\n\n\"A politician can claim no special status higher than that of an ordinary citizen and is as much liable to be arrested and detained for committing offences as any other citizen\", it added.\n\nThe ED also said that around 123 elections have taken place in the past three

A formal complaint has been lodged with the Supreme Court's registry denouncing the ED's affidavit as a blatant disregard of legal procedures, especially considering that the matter is already slated for a final decision in the SC tomorrow and the affidavit was submitted without taking the SC's approval.\n\nQuestioning the ED's objection to the interim bail of CM Arvind Kejriwal, the AAP said that it is well known that even after two years of investigation by the ED in the alleged liquor scam, not a single rupee or piece of evidence has been recovered incriminating anybody in Aam Aadmi Party. \"Further, the grounds of arrest of Arvind Kejriwal are based on statements made by other implicated persons viz. Magunta Sreenivasulu Reddy, Sarath Reddy, Satya Vijay Naik, and a close aide of an ex-BJP CM. The ED has relied solely on the statements of these accused turned witnesses with direct links to and benefitting from the BJP. For instance, Magunta Sreenivasulu Reddy, who received an NDA Lok Sabha ticket, gave a statement to facilitate the bail of his son, Raghav Reddy. Another approver, P. Sarath Reddy, sent Rs60 crores to the BJP's account through electoral bonds to secure his own bail,\" the release said.\n\n\"A third person, Satya Vijay Naik, who fought 2022 Goa assembly elections on the AAP ticket, is closely associated with Goa CM Pramod Sawant and fought on the BJP ticket in 2012 and 2017. Another accused turned approver was a close aide of former BJP CM Manohar Parrikar. Thus, all 4 incriminating statements are from persons closely linked to the BJP,\" it added. The AAP further added that these statements indicate a pattern \"these persons were arrested, they made multiple statements which did not implicate Shri Arvind Kejriwal. The ED repeatedly objected to their bail, they made statements implicating Shri Arvind Kejriwal, they were granted bail/pardon without the ED objecting to it. All the statements where there is no allegation against Shri Arvind Kejriwal were deliberately ignored by the ED.\"\n\n\"Some of these statements do not even indicate the commission of money laundering or any predicate offence. All of the evidence against Shri Arvind Kejriwal as shown in the Grounds of Arrest have come after the arrest of all these people, leading to a suspicion that the arrest has been systematically used as a device to coerce statements against Shri Arvind Kejriwal,\" the AAP shared. The AAP mentioned that the ED illegally 'picked up' a sitting Chief Minister and the National Convenor of a national party on 21.03.2024, that is, 5 days after the General Elections were announced and the Model Code of Conduct was put in place. The AAP is in direct opposition to the ruling BJP at the Centre in the ongoing General Elections and voting had already commenced from 17.04.2024. During an election cycle when political activity is at its peak, Shri Arvind Kejriwal's illegal arrest has caused grave prejudice to the AAP and will provide the BJP at the Centre an unjust upper hand in the ongoing elections. A level playing field, which is a prerequisite for 'free and fair elections', has clearly been compromised with the illegal arrest of Shri Arvind Kejriwal.\n\nThe party stated that the ED has not only been opaque and dictatorial in its approach but also guilty of suggestio falsi (suggesting falsehood) and suppressio veri (suppressing truth). \"Arvind Kejriwal's arrest constitutes an unprecedented assault on the tenets of democracy based on 'free and fair elections' and 'federalism' both of which form significant constituents of the basic structure of the Constitution. The ED abused its power of arrest in the middle of General Election and while relying on the same material as was in possession months before his arrest,\" the release said.\n\nThe AAP further detailed that there is no material to show the involvement of any AAP leader in the process or activity related to POC, be it one of concealment, possession, acquisition, use of proceeds of crime as much as projecting it as untainted property or claiming it to be so. \"There is no proof that the AAP received any funds from \"South Group\". The ED in its counter affidavit filed before the High Court has already admitted that Shri Arvind Kejriwal was not involved in handling the transfer of any amounts,\" the party said.\n\nThe AAP shared that the ED has categorically stated in their reply filed in these proceedings, that Arvind Kejriwal is not named as an accused in the ECIR; nor is he named as an accused in the scheduled offence registered by the CBI, which is the foundation of the proceedings in the ECIR. \"The power to arrest in this case is a glaring abuse of the due process of law as well as the procedure established. The ED's approach completely negates the basic tenets and foundation principles of criminal jurisprudence, that is, fair investigation, fair trial and rule of law,\" the party said.\n\nEarlier today, the Directorate of Enforcement (ED) on Thursday filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court opposing the grant of interim bail to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and said a politician cannot claim a higher status than an ordinary citizen and was not entitled to differential treatment. ED, while filing an affidavit in Delhi's excise policy case, said a politician can claim no special status higher than that of an ordinary citizen and is as much liable to be arrested and detained for committing offences as any other citizen.\n\nA bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Dipankar Dutta had hinted of granting interim bail to Kejriwal to enable him to campaign for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections in Delhi. However, it had also said that if interim bail is granted, Kejriwal would not be allowed to discharge any official duties as Chief Minister. Kejriwal was arrested on March 21 by the Enforcement Directorate in relation to the excise policy case.

As a bench headed by Justice Sanjiv Khanna was rising for the day, it told Enforcement Directorate counsel Additional Solicitor General SV Raju that it may pass the order on interim relief to Kejriwal on Friday.\n\nOn Tuesday, the bench had hinted at granting interim bail to Kejriwal to enable him to campaign for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections.

There can't be any deviation only because he is a Chief Minister.

A formal complaint has been lodged in this regard with the Supreme Court's registry denouncing the ED's affidavit as \"blatant disregard of legal procedures\", especially considering that the matter is already slated for a final decision in the top court on Friday. It also claimed that the affidavit was submitted without obtaining the SC's approval.\n\nQuestioning the ED's objection to the interim bail of Kejriwal, the AAP said it is well known that even after two years of investigation by the ED in the alleged liquor policy scam, not a single rupee or piece of evidence has been recovered incriminating anybody in the Aam Aadmi Party.\n\nFurther, the grounds of the arrest of Kejriwal are based on statements made by other implicated persons in the case, viz. Magunta Sreenivasulu Reddy, Sarath Reddy, Satya Vijay Naik, and a close aide of an ex-BJP CM, the AAP claimed.\n\nThe ED has relied solely on the statements of these accused-turned-witnesses with direct links to and benefitting from the BJP, it said.\n\nFor instance, Magunta Sreenivasulu Reddy, who received an NDA Lok Sabha ticket, gave a statement to facilitate the bail of his son, Raghav Reddy, the AAP alleged, adding that another approver, P. Sarath Reddy, sent Rs 60 crore to the BJP's account through electoral bonds to secure his bail.\n\n\"Some of the statements do not even indicate the commission of money laundering or any predicate offence. All the evidence against Arvind Kejriwal as shown in the grounds of arrest have come after the arrest of all these people, leading to a suspicion that the arrest has been systematically used as a device to coerce statements against Arvind Kejriwal,\" the AAP said.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) opposed the interim bail plea moved by Kejriwal, saying that a politician can claim no \"special status\" higher than that of an ordinary citizen and is as much liable to be arrested and detained for committing offences as any other citizen.\n\nThe affidavit filed by ED's Deputy Director said that there is no principle that justifies giving differential treatment to a politician for campaigning over a farmer or a businessman who wishes to pursue his vocation.\n\nThe matter will come up for hearing in the Supreme Court on Friday.", "source": {"uri": "weeklyvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Weekly Voice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magunta_Sreenivasulu_Reddy", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Magunta Sreenivasulu Reddy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_Directorate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Enforcement Directorate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arvind_Kejriwal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arvind Kejriwal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aam_Aadmi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aam Aadmi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affidavit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Affidavit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chief_ministers_of_Delhi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "List of chief ministers of Delhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Democratic_Alliance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Democratic Alliance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Money laundering"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/File_Management", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/File Management", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Surety_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Surety Bonds", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Object-Oriented", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Object-Oriented", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://weeklyvoice.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/2024032825-1.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550527", "eventUri": "eng-9550527", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-10", "textStart": 11, "textEnd": 17}], "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

The BJP's only work remains to defame Kejriwal, they said.\n\nKejriwal, who is also the national convener of the AAP, was arrested on March 21 by the ED and is currently lodged in Tihar jail under judicial custody in the money laundering case.\n\nDelhi BJP president Virendra Sachdeva said the case is sub judice and any comments can be made only after the agency files the charges sheet.\n\nEarlier in the day, the ED also filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court opposing the grant of interim bail to Kejriwal in the money laundering case, saying the right to campaign in the polls is neither fundamental nor constitutional.\n\nThe Supreme Court has reserved its order on interim bail to Kejriwal and is likely to give the verdict on Friday.\n\nSenior AAP leader and Delhi government minister Saurabh Bharadwaj, in a post on X, alleged that Kejriwal is neither convicted nor any trial has begun.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_Directorate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Enforcement Directorate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chargesheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chargesheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arvind_Kejriwal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arvind Kejriwal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aam_Aadmi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aam Aadmi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Money laundering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub_judice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sub judice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defamation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharat_Rashtra_Samithi", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bharat Rashtra Samithi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tihar_Jail", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tihar Jail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Delhi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Government of Delhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affidavit", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Affidavit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saurabh_Bhardwaj", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Saurabh Bhardwaj"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/imagegallery/29_02_2020_16_57_14_7140931.jpg?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550527", "eventUri": "eng-9550527", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-03-21", "textStart": 1247, "textEnd": 1255}], "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

Magunta Sreenivasulu Reddy, Sarath Reddy, Satya Vijay Naik, and a close aide of an ex-BJP CM. The ED has relied solely on the statements of these accused turned witnesses with direct links to and benefitting from the BJP. For instance, Magunta Sreenivasulu Reddy, who received an NDA Lok Sabha ticket, gave a statement to facilitate the bail of his son, Raghav Reddy. Another approver, P. Sarath Reddy, sent Rs60 crores to the BJP's account through electoral bonds to secure his own bail,\" the release said.\n\nAlso Read | Happy Akshaya Tritiya for This Rajasthan Teenage Girl Who Gets Freed From the Shackles of Child Marriage, Read the Tale of Her Journey.\n\n\"A third person, Satya Vijay Naik, who fought 2022 Goa assembly elections on the AAP ticket, is closely associated with Goa CM Pramod Sawant and fought on the BJP ticket in 2012 and 2017. Another accused turned approver was a close aide of former BJP CM Manohar Parrikar. Thus, all 4 incriminating statements are from persons closely linked to the BJP,\" it added.\n\nThe AAP further added that these statements indicate a pattern \"these persons were arrested, they made multiple statements which did not implicate Shri Arvind Kejriwal. The ED repeatedly objected to their bail, they made statements implicating Shri Arvind Kejriwal, they were granted bail/pardon without the ED objecting to it. All the statements where there is no allegation against Shri Arvind Kejriwal were deliberately ignored by the ED.\"\n\n\"Some of these statements do not even indicate the commission of money laundering or any predicate offence. All of the evidence against Shri Arvind Kejriwal as shown in the Grounds of Arrest have come after the arrest of all these people, leading to a suspicion that the arrest has been systematically used as a device to coerce statements against Shri Arvind Kejriwal,\" the AAP shared.\n\nThe AAP mentioned that the ED illegally 'picked up' a sitting Chief Minister and the National Convenor of a national party on 21.03.2024, that is, 5 days after the General Elections were announced and the Model Code of Conduct was put in place. The AAP is in direct opposition to the ruling BJP at the Centre in the ongoing General Elections and voting had already commenced from 17.04.2024. During an election cycle when political activity is at its peak, Shri Arvind Kejriwal's illegal arrest has caused grave prejudice to the AAP and will provide the BJP at the Centre an unjust upper hand in the ongoing elections. A level playing field, which is a prerequisite for 'free and fair elections', has clearly been compromised with the illegal arrest of Shri Arvind Kejriwal.\n\nThe party stated that the ED has not only been opaque and dictatorial in its approach but also guilty of suggestio falsi (suggesting falsehood) and suppressio veri (suppressing truth).\n\n\"Arvind Kejriwal's arrest constitutes an unprecedented assault on the tenets of democracy based on 'free and fair elections' and 'federalism' both of which form significant constituents of the basic structure of the Constitution. The ED abused its power of arrest in the middle of General Election and while relying on the same material as was in possession months before his arrest,\" the release said.\n\nThe AAP further detailed that there is no material to show the involvement of any AAP leader in the process or activity related to POC, be it one of concealment, possession, acquisition, use of proceeds of crime as much as projecting it as untainted property or claiming it to be so.\n\n\"There is no proof that the AAP received any funds from \"South Group\". The ED in its counter affidavit filed before the High Court has already admitted that Shri Arvind Kejriwal was not involved in handling the transfer of any amounts,\" the party said.\n\nThe AAP shared that the ED has categorically stated in their reply filed in these proceedings, that Arvind Kejriwal is not named as an accused in the ECIR; nor is he named as an accused in the scheduled offence registered by the CBI, which is the foundation of the proceedings in the ECIR.\n\n\"The power to arrest in this case is a glaring abuse of the due process of law as well as the procedure established. The ED's approach completely negates the basic tenets and foundation principles of criminal jurisprudence, that is, fair investigation, fair trial and rule of law,\" the party said.\n\nEarlier today, the Directorate of Enforcement (ED) on Thursday filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court opposing the grant of interim bail to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and said a politician cannot claim a higher status than an ordinary citizen and was not entitled to differential treatment.\n\nED, while filing an affidavit in Delhi's excise policy case, said a politician can claim no special status higher than that of an ordinary citizen and is as much liable to be arrested and detained for committing offences as any other citizen.\n\nA bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna and Dipankar Dutta had hinted of granting interim bail to Kejriwal to enable him to campaign for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections in Delhi. However, it had also said that if interim bail is granted, Kejriwal would not be allowed to discharge any official duties as Chief Minister.\n\nKejriwal was arrested on March 21 by the Enforcement Directorate in relation to the excise policy case.

The roster of which judge will hear which case is decided by the Chief Justice of India, who is the 'master of the roster'.\n\nWith the legal proceedings concerning Delhi Chief Minister and AAP supremo Arvind Kejriwal ongoing before Justice Khanna, it would seem fair to assume that he holds the key to the Aam Aadmi Party's political future.\n\nOn May 10, the bench of Justice Sanjiv Khanna and Dipankar Datta is set to consider whether interim bail should be granted to Kejriwal for campaigning in the ongoing general elections. The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has strongly opposed interim bail for Kejriwal on the grounds that the right to campaign for an election is neither a fundamental right nor a constitutional right, and not even a legal right.\n\nRegardless of whether Kejriwal is granted interim bail or not, the top court will also deal with the important question of whether the Delhi Chief Minister's arrest in the ED case was legal in the first place. The final judgment of the Supreme Court in this case is expected to have wider ramifications on the ED's powers to arrest. Through his plea before the Supreme Court, Kejriwal has challenged the legality of his arrest and remand. During the course of the hearing, the bench led by Justice Khanna had stated that in this case, they will rule on Section 19 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), which deals with the powers of the ED to arrest.\n\nOn October 30 last year, a bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna and SVN Bhatti had denied bail to former Deputy CM Manish Sisodia in the Excise policy case. Although Sisodia was denied bail, the bench granted him the liberty to approach the lower court for bail again if his trial is delayed. The same bench also granted bail to liquor giant Pernod Ricard's executive Benoy Babu in December 2023.\n\nA few months later, on March 22, 2024, one day after the Delhi CM was arrested, a bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna, MM Sundresh and Bela M Trivedi refused to grant any relief to BRS legislator K Kavitha in the same case. While refusing to grant her relief, Justice Khanna said, \"All of us, in principle, agree that we should not, merely because there is a political person or somebody who can directly afford to come to the Supreme Court, bypass all the statutory and constitutional values.\"\n\nLess than two weeks after the Kavitha order, another bench comprising Justices Sanjiv Khanna, Dipankar Datta and PB Varale granted bail to Aam Aadmi Party MP Sanjay Singh after the ED hesitatingly agreed to his release.\n\nThough different benches of the Supreme Court, with different judge compositions, have passed orders in the Delhi excise policy case, Justice Khanna has been the common factor in all of these benches.\n\nOn Friday, the bench led by Justice Khanna is expected to rule on whether Arvind Kejriwal will be granted interim bail. The bench in due course will also hear Kejriwal's original plea challenging his arrest. Additionally, Manish Sisodia's bail plea will also eventually reach the Supreme Court, in case the high court turns down his pending appeal.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanjiv_Khanna", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sanjiv Khanna"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enforcement_Directorate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Enforcement Directorate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief Justice of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arvind_Kejriwal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arvind Kejriwal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aam_Aadmi_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Aam Aadmi Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipankar_Datta", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dipankar Datta"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chief_ministers_of_Delhi", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "List of chief ministers of Delhi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manish_Sisodia", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manish Sisodia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fundamental rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharat_Rashtra_Samithi", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bharat Rashtra Samithi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_parliament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Member of parliament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padma_Bhushan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Padma Bhushan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Statute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Money laundering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Legislator"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Courts", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202405/justice-sanjiv-khanna--supreme-court-094840497-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=HBZKlqEg63LyOjZa8m6d58euqdUIG.5K", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550527", "eventUri": "eng-9550527", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-10", "textStart": 3, "textEnd": 9, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "-10-30", "textStart": 2432, "textEnd": 2442}], "sentiment": 0.6313725490196078, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

The party said a complaint has been lodged with the Supreme Court's registry denouncing the ED's affidavit as a \"blatant disregard of legal procedures\", considering that the matter is already slated for a final decision in the top court on Friday.\n\nCalling Mr. Kejriwal's arrest an unprecedented assault on the tenets of democracy based on 'free and fair elections' and 'federalism', both of which form significant constituents of the basic structure of the Constitution, the party in a statement said the Chief Minister was arrested five days after the Lok Sabha election was announced and the Model Code of Conduct was put in place.\n\nBail to Kejriwal to campaign will end arrests of politicians as elections are year-round phenomenon in India, ED tells Supreme Court\n\n\"The ED has not only been opaque and dictatorial in its approach but also guilty of suggestio falsi (suggesting falsehood) and suppressio veri (suppressing truth).

It added that all the statements where there is no allegation against Mr. Kejriwal were deliberately ignored by the ED.\n\n\"During an election cycle when political activity is at its peak, Mr. Kejriwal's illegal arrest has caused grave prejudice to the AAP and will provide the BJP at the Centre an unjust upper hand in the ongoing elections.

This objection was formally communicated through a complaint to the Supreme Court's registry, highlighting a procedural oversight by the ED in their submission process.\n\nAccording to the press release issued by Kejriwal's legal team, the ED's affidavit was submitted without obtaining prior approval from the Supreme Court. This move has been criticized as a clear violation of legal norms, especially since the Supreme Court is expected to make a final decision on the matter shortly. The controversy arises amidst discussions on the nature of electoral campaigning rights in India, with the ED asserting that such rights are neither fundamental nor constitutional.\n\nThe Enforcement Directorate's stance was outlined in a new affidavit aimed at preventing Kejriwal's release on interim bail. The central probe agency argued that there have been instances where politicians have contested elections from judicial custody and have even secured victories without being granted interim bail for campaigning purposes. This assertion underscores the ED's position that electoral campaigning is not recognized as a fundamental, constitutional, or legal right under Indian law.\n\nThis legal battle follows the Delhi High Court's decision last month, which supported Kejriwal's arrest. The court found no illegality in the ED's actions, noting Kejriwal's repeated failure to respond to summonses and his refusal to participate in the investigation. The case in question revolves around allegations of corruption and money laundering linked to the Delhi government's excise policy for 2021-22, which has since been discontinued.\n\nThe Enforcement Directorate's affidavit and the subsequent objection by Kejriwal's legal team have ignited a debate on the rights of political leaders to campaign while facing legal proceedings.

The charge sheet will include money laundering charges and may name AAP as an accused. The ED alleges Kejriwal's non-cooperation and liability for AAP's actions. The \"South Group\" lobby, including Kavitha, is accused of providing kickbacks used by AAP in the Goa elections. The ED claims that Kejriwal is the \"kingpin\" of the alleged scam. The probe began with a CBI investigation recommended by the Delhi Lieutenant Governor. The case involves alleged corruption and money laundering in the formulation and execution of the Delhi government's excise policy. The ED has filed six charge sheets in the case so far and arrested 18 people, including Kejriwal's former deputy Manish Sisodia and AAP MP Sanjay Singh.\n\nThe Enforcement Directorate (ED) is expected to soon file a fresh charge sheet in the Delhi excise policy-linked money laundering case and it may name Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, BRS leader K Kavitha and some others as accused, official sources said on Thursday.\n\nThe federal agency had arrested Kejriwal from his official residence here on March 21 under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) while Kavitha, the MLC daughter of former Telangana chief minister K Chandrashekar Rao, was taken into custody from Hyderabad on March 15.\n\nOfficial sources said a prosecution complaint against half-a-dozen entities, including the two politicians, some linked individuals and companies, has been readied and the agency may file it before a special PMLA court here within the next 4-5 days.\n\nThe accused will be charged with money laundering and the prosecution complaint will be filed under sections 45 and 44(1) of the PMLA, the sources said.\n\nThe agency may also name the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in this charge sheet along with attachment of some fresh assets in the case that was registered in 2022.\n\nThis will be the seventh charge sheet by the ED in this case in which it has arrested 18 people so far including Kejriwal's party colleague and former Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, AAP Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh and others. Singh was granted bail sometime back.\n\nAAP sources alleged that the expected complaint was nothing but the BJP's charge sheet and that the party in power at the Centre only intends to defame Kejriwal.\n\nThe ED sources said the agency is expected to charge Kejriwal with ''non-cooperation'' in its investigation and being ''vicariously'' liable for the offence committed by the AAP, being the national convenor of the said party and because of his role and active involvement in the day-to-day affairs and the conduct of the business of AAP. It may reiterate its earlier charge made against Kejriwal, before a court, that as the AAP national convenor and member of its national executive, Kejriwal was ''ultimately responsible for the funds being used in the election expenses including their generation''.\n\nKejriwal, 55, has been called by the ED the ''kingpin and key conspirator'' of the Delhi excise ''scam'' orchestrated in collusion with ministers of the Delhi government, AAP leaders and other persons.\n\nThe ED has also alleged that Rs 45 crore ''kickbacks'', out of the Rs 100 crore ''bribe'' provided by the 'South Group', were used by the AAP for the Goa assembly election campaign in 2022.\n\nThe 'South Group' liquor lobby allegedly includes Kavitha, TDP Ongole seat Lok Sabha candidate Magunta Sreenivasulu Reddy, his son Raghav Reddy and others.\n\nThe excise case pertains to alleged corruption and money laundering in the formulation and execution of the Delhi government's excise policy for 2021-22, which was later scrapped.\n\nDelhi Lieutenant Governor V K Saxena recommended a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into the alleged irregularities.

Subsequently, the ED registered a case under the PMLA.\n\nThe ED filed its money laundering case on August 22, 2022, taking cognisance of the CBI FIR that was lodged on August 17, 2022.\n\nA day ahead of the scheduled pronouncement of its order on grant of interim bail to Kejriwal in the money laundering case, the ED told the Supreme Court on Thursday that the right to campaign in an election is neither a fundamental nor a constitutional right.\n\nThe central probe agency said there were numerous examples where politicians contested elections while in judicial custody, and some even won, but were never granted interim bail for campaigning.

He is currently lodged in Delhi's Tihar Jail.\n\nOn Tuesday, Additional Solicitor General SV Raju, representing the central agency, alleged that Kejriwal's stay at a hotel during the 2022 Assembly elections in Goa was partially paid for by Chanpreet Singh, who was arrested in the case on April 12.\n\nThe Enforcement Directorate alleged that Singh managed funds for the Aam Aadmi Party's election campaign in Goa.\n\n\"We have found that Arvind Kejriwal stayed in a 7-star grand hotel called Grand Hyatt in Goa during the Goa elections,\" Raju told the court on Tuesday. \"And at that time, part of his bills were paid by the general administrative department of Delhi government, but part of it was paid by Chanpreet Singh.\"\n\nThe additional solicitor-general claimed that the Enforcement Directorate was not concerned with politics. \"It is not as if it is a politically motivated case,\" Raju remarked. \"We are concerned with evidence. And we have evidence.\"\n\nThe bench told Raju that the chief minister had the right to criticise his arrest ahead of the Lok Sabha elections. It also questioned the delay in Kejriwal's arrest despite the central agency allegedly having evidence of his involvement in the case.\n\nIn reply, Raju told the court that if the central agency did not have enough material and started questioning Kejriwal, then it would have been obvious that that the case was malafide.\n\n\"It takes time to understand,\" he said, according to Live Law. \"We wanted to know [the] illegal gains of the [liquor] policy, what type of conspiracy is there.\"\n\nRaju added: \"How an investigation is to be done is prerogative of the investigating officer.\"\n\nThe court deferred its order on granting interim bail to Kejriwal during the hearing. It said that it could consider granting him bail on account of the elections, but on the condition that he should not carry out official duties as the chief minister.\n\nThe Enforcement Directorate is investigating allegations of money laundering in the liquor policy case based on a first information report filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation.\n\nThe two central agencies have alleged that the Aam Aadmi Party government modified Delhi's now-scrapped liquor excise policy by increasing the commission for wholesalers from 5% to 12%. This allegedly facilitated the receipt of bribes from wholesalers who had a substantial market share and turnover.\n\nThe Enforcement Directorate has alleged that Kejriwal was the \"kingpin\" and the \"key conspirator\" in the case and the material evidence showed he was guilty of money laundering.\n\nIt has also claimed that members of a \"South Group\" had paid at least Rs 100 crore in kickbacks to leaders of the Aam Aadmi Party through businessman Vijay Nair, who is currently in jail. Bribes received from the South Group were also used for the Aam Aadmi Party's election campaign in Goa.\n\nThe Enforcement Directorate claimed that funds were sent to Goa through hawala transactions

A formal complaint has been lodged his with the Supreme Court's registry denouncing the ED's affidavit as a blatant disregard of legal procedures, especially considering that the matter is already slated for a final decision in the SC tomorrow and the affidavit was submitted without taking the SC's approval.\n\nQuestioning the ED's objection to the interim bail of CM Arvind Kejriwal, the AAP said that it is well known that even after two years of investigation by ED in the alleged liquor scam, not a single rupee or piece of evidence has been recovered incriminating anybody in Aam Aadmi Party. Arvind Kejriwal Bail Hearing: ED in Supreme Court Opposes Interim Bail to Delhi CM, Says Electioneering Not Fundamental Right.\n\nFurther, the grounds of arrest of Shri Arvind Kejriwal are based on statements made by other implicated persons viz. Magunta Sreenivasulu Reddy, Sarath Reddy, Satya Vijay Naik, and a close aide of an ex-BJP CM. The ED has relied solely on the statements of these accused turned witnesses with direct links to and benefitting from the BJP.\n\nFor instance, Magunta Sreenivasulu Reddy, who received an NDA Lok Sabha ticket, gave a statement to facilitate the bail of his son, Raghav Reddy. Another approver, P. Sarath Reddy, sent \u20b960 crores to the BJP's account through electoral bonds to secure his own bail. A third person, Satya Vijay Naik, who fought 2022 Goa assembly elections on the AAP ticket, is closely associated with Goa CM Pramod\n\nSawant and fought on the BJP ticket in 2012 and 2017. Another accused turned approver was a close aide of former BJP CM Manohar Parrikar. Thus, all 4 incriminating statements are from persons closely linked to the BJP. Arvind Kejriwal Bail Hearing: Supreme Court To Pass Order on Interim Bail to Delhi CM on May 10 in Excise Policy Scam.\n\nThe AAP further added that these statements indicate a pattern: These persons were arrested, they made multiple statements which did not implicate Shri Arvind Kejriwal. The ED repeatedly objected to their bail, they made statements implicating Shri Arvind Kejriwal, they were granted bail/pardon without the ED objecting to it. All the statements where there is no allegation against Shri Arvind Kejriwal were deliberately ignored by the ED.\n\n\"Some of these statements do not even indicate the commission of money laundering or any predicate offence. All of the evidence against Shri Arvind Kejriwal as shown in the Grounds of Arrest have come after the arrest of all these people, leading to a suspicion that the arrest has been systematically used as a device to coerce statements against Shri Arvind Kejriwal,\" the AAP shared.\n\nThe AAP mentioned that the ED illegally 'picked up' a sitting Chief Minister and the National Convenor of a national party on 21.03.2024, that is, 5 days after the General Elections were announced and the Model Code of Conduct was put in place. The AAP is in direct opposition to the ruling BJP at the Centre in the ongoing General Elections and voting had already commenced from 17.04.2024. During an election cycle when political activity is at its peak, Shri Arvind Kejriwal's illegal arrest has caused grave prejudice to the AAP and will provide the BJP at the Centre an unjust upper hand in the ongoing elections. A level playing field, which is a prerequisite for 'free and fair elections', has clearly been compromised with the illegal arrest of Shri Arvind Kejriwal.\n\nThe party stated that the ED has not only been opaque and dictatorial in its approach but also guilty of suggestio falsi (suggesting falsehood) and suppressio veri (suppressing truth). Shri Arvind Kejriwal's arrest constitutes an unprecedented assault on the tenets of democracy based on 'free and fair elections' and 'federalism' both of which form significant constituents of the basic structure of the Constitution. The ED abused its power of arrest in the middle of general election and while relying on the same material as was in possession months before his arrest.\n\nThe AAP further detailed that there is no material to show the involvement of any AAP leader in the process or activity related to POC, be it one of concealment, possession, acquisition, use of proceeds of crime as much as projecting it as untainted property or claiming it to be so. There is no proof that the AAP received any funds from \"South Group\". The ED in its counter affidavit filed before the High Court has already admitted that Shri Arvind Kejriwal was not involved in handling the transfer of any amounts.\n\nThe AAP shared that the ED has categorically stated in their reply filed in these proceedings, that Shri Arvind Kejriwal is not named as an accused in the ECIR; nor is he named as an accused in the scheduled offence registered by the CBI, which is the foundation of the proceedings in the ECIR. The power to arrest in this case is a glaring abuse of the due process of law as well as the procedure established. The ED's approach completely negates the basic tenets and foundation principles of criminal jurisprudence, that is, fair investigation, fair trial and rule of law.", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com",

A formal complaint has been lodged his with the Supreme Court's registry denouncing the ED's affidavit as a blatant disregard of legal procedures, especially considering that the matter is already slated for a final decision in the SC tomorrow and the affidavit was submitted without taking the SC's approval.\n\nQuestioning the ED's objection to the interim bail of CM Arvind Kejriwal, the AAP said that it is well known that even after two years of investigation by ED in the alleged liquor scam, not a single rupee or piece of evidence has been recovered incriminating anybody in Aam Aadmi Party. Further, the grounds of arrest of Shri Arvind Kejriwal are based on statements made by other implicated persons viz. Magunta Sreenivasulu Reddy, Sarath Reddy, Satya Vijay Naik, and a close aide of an ex-BJP CM. The ED has relied solely on the statements of these accused turned witnesses with direct links to and benefitting from the BJP. For instance, Magunta Sreenivasulu Reddy, who received an NDA Lok Sabha ticket, gave a statement to facilitate the bail of his son, Raghav Reddy. Another approver, P. Sarath Reddy, sent \u20b960 crores to the BJP's account through electoral bonds to secure his own bail. A third person, Satya Vijay Naik, who fought 2022 Goa assembly elections on the AAP ticket, is closely associated with Goa CM Pramod Sawant and fought on the BJP ticket in 2012 and 2017. Another accused turned approver was a close aide of former BJP CM Manohar Parrikar. Thus, all 4 incriminating statements are from persons closely linked to the BJP.\n\nThe AAP further added that these statements indicate a pattern: These persons were arrested, they made multiple statements which did not implicate Shri Arvind Kejriwal. The ED repeatedly objected to their bail, they made statements implicating Shri Arvind Kejriwal, they were granted bail/pardon without the ED objecting to it. All the statements where there is no allegation against Shri Arvind Kejriwal were deliberately ignored by the ED.\n\n\"Some of these statements do not even indicate the commission of money laundering or any predicate offence. All of the evidence against Shri Arvind Kejriwal as shown in the Grounds of Arrest have come after the arrest of all these people, leading to a suspicion that the arrest has been systematically used as a device to coerce statements against Shri Arvind Kejriwal,\" the AAP shared.\n\nThe AAP mentioned that the ED illegally 'picked up' a sitting Chief Minister and the National Convenor of a national party on 21.03.2024, that is, 5 days after the General Elections were announced and the Model Code of Conduct was put in place. The AAP is in direct opposition to the ruling BJP at the Centre in the ongoing General Elections and voting had already commenced from 17.04.2024. During an election cycle when political activity is at its peak, Shri Arvind Kejriwal's illegal arrest has caused grave prejudice to the AAP and will provide the BJP at the Centre an unjust upper hand in the ongoing elections. A level playing field, which is a prerequisite for 'free and fair elections', has clearly been compromised with the illegal arrest of Shri Arvind Kejriwal.\n\nThe party stated that the ED has not only been opaque and dictatorial in its approach but also guilty of suggestio falsi (suggesting falsehood) and suppressio veri (suppressing truth). Shri Arvind Kejriwal's arrest constitutes an unprecedented assault on the tenets of democracy based on 'free and fair elections' and 'federalism' both of which form significant constituents of the basic structure of the Constitution. The ED abused its power of arrest in the middle of general election and while relying on the same material as was in possession months before his arrest.\n\nThe AAP further detailed that there is no material to show the involvement of any AAP leader in the process or activity related to POC, be it one of concealment, possession, acquisition, use of proceeds of crime as much as projecting it as untainted property or claiming it to be so. There is no proof that the AAP received any funds from \"South Group\". The ED in its counter affidavit filed before the High Court has already admitted that Shri Arvind Kejriwal was not involved in handling the transfer of any amounts.\n\nThe AAP shared that the ED has categorically stated in their reply filed in these proceedings, that Shri Arvind Kejriwal is not named as an accused in the ECIR; nor is he named as an accused in the scheduled offence registered by the CBI, which is the foundation of the proceedings in the ECIR. The power to arrest in this case is a glaring abuse of the due process of law as well as the procedure established. The ED's approach completely negates the basic tenets and foundation principles of criminal jurisprudence, that is, fair investigation, fair trial and rule of law.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com",

In this election, they will vote for their son Kejriwal,\" he said.\n\nKumar further said, \"The blessings of Bajrang Bali are with Arvind Kejriwal. There can be delay, but not injustice. God is with him; truth and honesty will prevail. CM Kejriwal will be among us soon.\"\n\n\"Our job is to go among the people and appeal to them for votes. Sunita Kejriwal, Bhagwant Mann and our leaders will be with us. We all are going among the people and appealing to each and every person to vote. We have to tell the people about the situation in the country and Delhi. We have to tell them how their popular Chief Minister was put in jail through a conspiracy,\" he added.\n\nVoting for the seven parliamentary seats in Lok Sabha election is scheduled to take place on May 25", "source": {"uri": "thestatesman.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Statesman"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_minister", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chief minister"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arvind_Kejriwal", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arvind Kejriwal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "East Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "East Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delhi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagwant_Mann", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bhagwant Mann"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanuman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hanuman"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Sikhism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Sikhism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Advaita_Vedanta", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Advaita Vedanta", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://www.thestatesman.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-2024-05-09T154724.062.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9550527", "eventUri": "eng-9550527", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-25", "textStart": 1801, "textEnd": 1807}], "sentiment": -0.1058823529411764, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

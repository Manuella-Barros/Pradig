Examples include depictions of full or partial nudity, including close-ups of genitals, buttocks, or breasts; explicit or implied sexual behaviour or simulated acts such as sexual intercourse and other sexual acts,\" it added.\n\nThe social media giant said it believes that users should be able to create, distribute, and consume material related to sexual themes as long as it is consensually produced and distributed.\n\nIt added that sexual expression, whether visual or written, can be a legitimate form of artistic expression, stating, \"We believe in the autonomy of adults to engage with and create content that reflects their own beliefs, desires, and experiences, including those related to sexuality.

It also does not allow sharing Adult Content in highly visible places, such as profile photos or banners.\n\nThese latest developments by X to formally allow adult content \"dovetail well with the company's post-Musk marketing strategy,\" according to Brooke Erin Duffy, an associate professor of communication at Cornell University.\n\nDuffy noted that \"X is unapologetically provocative and has sought to distinguish itself from 'brand-safe' competitors\" like Meta, YouTube, and TikTok.\n\nWith X's recent policy update, she says, \"The company seems to be courting those workers -- including creators and artists -- who have been marginalised by platform guidelines that tend to restrict nudity or sexual expression.\"\n\nBefore Musk took over, Twitter had already allowed pornography. The company estimated that 13% of all posts on the platform contained adult content, Reuters reported in October 2022, just before the official close of Musk's debt-laden deal for Twitter.\n\nTo comply with the new rules, X also encourages users who frequently post adult content to adjust their media settings to place all images and videos behind a content warning.\n\n\"Doing so places all your images and videos behind a content warning that needs to be acknowledged before your media can be viewed,\" it added.\n\n\"You can also add a one-time content warning on individual posts.

That's where a content strategy can help.\n\nA content strategy is an overarching plan for all of your digital content. From blogs and whitepapers, to social media and video content, a strategy is essential for understanding the purpose behind your content.\n\nWhy are B2B content strategies important?\n\nNot all content drives traffic, and not all content converts. To ensure your digital content meets your objectives and reaches the right audience, you'll first need to consider a few points:\n\nWhat kind of users are you targeting with your content? Which format are they most likely to engage with? How should your content look? Where should you position the calls to action? And what exactly do you want your content to achieve?\n\nAn effective content strategy should include the answer to all of these questions. From the user research and content formats to the frameworks and design, a good strategy covers it all. Focusing on the bigger picture enables you to have a clear plan and structure for all of your content efforts, ensuring they're successful and produced with your goals in mind.\n\nSo, before you jump into content creation, how exactly do you put together an effective B2B content strategy?\n\nFirst things first: Who are you creating content for? By understanding exactly who is going to read your content, you can ensure it's written with those people in mind.\n\nA useful way to understand your target audience is through the use of customer personas. These are defined as semi-fictional characters which represent your ideal prospect. Through demographic reports, user interviews, forums, social media and surveys, you can identify key insights into the people and businesses who are likely to read your content.\n\nIdentifying your target audience is key for developing content that resonates with them. By understanding their pain points, how they engage with content and how they make decisions, you can tailor your messaging and streamline the conversion journey.\n\nYour objectives should drive your content strategy. But not all content will have the same aims.\n\nFor example, is it topical content to build authority? Are you aiming to build brand awareness and secure the top ranks within search engine results pages, or SERPs? Which pieces of your content are to generate leads?\n\nKnowing what your goals are for each piece will help you understand the purpose behind the content you're creating. Following the SMART objective method is a useful way to set realistic goals that are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound (SMART).\n\nOnce you've identified your target audience and decided on your objectives, you'll need to establish which content formats are best suited.\n\nEach stage of the buyer's journey (awareness, consideration and decision) will also require different types of content, each with a unique aim.\n\nSome of the most popular B2B content formats include:\n\nA content calendar is an easy way to organize your content plan for the year ahead. Not only is this an effective way to keep track of your content plans, it also helps you consider exactly when this content should be published.\n\nAre there any key industry dates that you could create content around? Are there any upcoming changes within the industry that you need to keep in mind? Is your content aligned with relevant seasonal events? By mapping out your content month by month, you can focus on creating relevant and timely pieces that your audience will engage with.\n\nA content framework or copy brief is a plan or template that acts as a guideline for the person producing the content. Having a framework in place improves efficiency, organization and ensures that everything is produced with your goals and target audience in mind.\n\nSo, what exactly does a content framework include? Whilst there are many different ways to produce and lay out a framework, it should include information on:\n\nDifferent types of content perform best in different places. It all comes back to your objectives for the piece. Are you offering valuable, in-depth content that should sit on your website or blog? Are you trying to raise brand awareness through a social media post? Do you want to generate leads through gated content?\n\nUnderstanding the purpose behind the content you create is key to ensure that it reaches the right audience on the right platforms.\n\nContent isn't just about the words on a page. You'll need to consider where each section should sit and how you'll maximize engagement. From CTA positioning to content formatting, there's plenty to consider.\n\nWhen designing the layout for your B2B content, keep the following in mind:\n\nSo, how did your content perform? Whilst your initial thought might be to report on how many leads were generated, it's important to remember what the aims of the piece were. Was it to generate brand awareness and traffic? Was it a piece aimed at boosting topical authority, therefore less likely to generate leads?

X (formerly Twitter) has been home to numerous NSFW communities, permitting adult content without explicitly outlining it in their rules.\n\nThe first week of June greeted us with some big changes as recently, X updated its policies to officially allow users to post adult and graphic content officially, provided it meets specific guidelines.\n\nX now permits the posting of consensually-produced NSFW content, with the stipulation that such content must be clearly labeled. This policy update also encompasses AI-generated videos and images, per Tech Crunch.\n\nPreviously, the Elon Musk-owned platform had been experimenting with hosting adult content within NSFW communities on the platform. It might take quite a long time to be official, but now it's been confirmed to be coming.\n\nRelated Article: X Tests New Feature to Hide Adult Content in 'NSFW' Groups\n\nAccording to X's page on 'adult content' policies, the platform supports the creation, distribution, and consumption of consensually produced material related to sexual themes, recognizing it as a legitimate form of artistic expression.\n\nThe company emphasizes the importance of user autonomy in engaging with and creating content that reflects their personal beliefs and experiences, including those related to sexuality. However, X is committed to preventing children and users who prefer not to see such content from being exposed to it.\n\nX's guidelines for violent content stipulate that it must not be excessively gory or depict sexual violence. The platform maintains a strict policy against content that threatens, incites, or glorifies violence. These rules aim to allow users to engage in conversations about current events while including relevant images and videos.\n\nTo manage sensitive media, X provides users with the ability to mark their posts accordingly. The platform restricts access to sensitive content for users under 18 or those who haven't specified their birth dates.\n\nWhile X has never outright banned porn, these new clauses could pave the way for the platform to develop services centered around adult content, potentially creating a competitor to OnlyFans to enhance its revenue streams.\n\nIn 2022, approximately 13% of posts on X contained adult content, and this number appears to have increased, partly due to the proliferation of porn bots.\n\nWith the formal allowance of adult content, regulatory bodies are likely to monitor X closely to ensure it effectively prevents the distribution of non-consensual porn and child sexual abuse material (CSAM).\n\nX has faced regulatory actions in the past. Last October, Australia fined X for failing to provide information about child abuse content. Around the same time, India issued notices to multiple social networks, including X, to remove CSAM from their platforms. These actions could mean that no matter how big or small the platform, it needs to comply with content moderation, or else it will be sanctioned.\n\nX's new policies on adult content might be a deal breaker to other users, but this approach is now focused not just on managing NSFW material, but also on regulating it.\n\nWhile this move aims to balance artistic freedom with user safety, it also places the platform under increased regulatory scrutiny. This is unavoidable at all costs and all X needs to do is to prepare for every criticism thrown at it.\n\nWith AI in the driver's seat at present, AI-generated adult content is still on close watch.

Content marketing involves creating and sharing valuable, relevant, and consistent content to attract and retain a clearly defined audience. Let's explore how you can master this powerful marketing approach.\n\nContent marketing is a strategic marketing approach focused on creating and distributing valuable, relevant, and consistent content to attract and retain a clearly defined audience - and ultimately, to drive profitable customer action. Unlike traditional advertising, content marketing does not directly promote a brand but instead aims to stimulate interest in its products or services through informative or entertaining content.\n\n**Define Your Goals**\n\nStart by clearly defining your content marketing goals. Are you looking to increase brand awareness, generate leads, boost customer engagement, or drive sales? Setting specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals will guide your content strategy.\n\n**Understand Your Audience**\n\nConduct thorough research to understand your target audience. Create detailed buyer personas that include demographic information, interests, pain points, and online behaviors. Knowing your audience helps you create content that resonates with them and addresses their needs.\n\n**Develop a Content Strategy**\n\nOutline your content strategy, including the types of content you will create, the topics you will cover, and the channels you will use to distribute your content. Your strategy should align with your overall marketing goals and address the needs and interests of your target audience.\n\n**Create High-Quality Content**\n\nFocus on producing high-quality content that is informative, engaging, and valuable to your audience. This can include blog posts, articles, videos, infographics, podcasts, and more.

X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, is now one of the only mainstream social media platforms to allow adult content.\n\nOver the weekend, Elon Musk's X added new rules to the platform, specifically its \"adult content policy\" page. X's new NSFW rules explicitly allow consensual adult content, which includes full nudity and sexual acts.\n\n\"You may share consensually produced and distributed adult nudity or sexual behavior, provided it's properly labeled and not prominently displayed,\" reads the bolded text at the top of X's adult content policy page.\n\nA few months ago, X started testing an \"adult content\" label for NSFW communities on X in an early attempt to make an adult content policy official.\n\nX defines adult content as \"any consensually produced and distributed material depicting adult nudity or sexual behavior that is pornographic or intended to cause sexual arousal.\" The company says this mandate applies to AI-generated adult content as well, regardless of whether the content is \"photographic or animated content such as cartoons, hentai, or anime.\"\n\nX's Adult Content Policy page encourages users to mark any adult material that they post in order to put it behind a content warning, which requires users' consent to viewing the media in the post before it is shown to them. There are options to mark a single post with a content warning. If a user regularly publishes adult content, they can tweak their settings to mark all media content that they post with an automatic content warning.\n\nAccording to the policy, users under 18 -- or those who do not have a birth date attached to their account -- cannot view media flagged with a content warning. It's unclear if adult material that isn't marked with a content warning is against the platform's official rules.\n\nBased on the policy, it appears that there aren't any repercussions for users who do not mark adult content. The policy states that if X finds that a user continuously doesn't flag adult content in their posts, the platform will simply alter your account settings and mark it for them.\n\nThe rule change on X allowing adult content does come at a fairly awkward time. Just weeks ago, Musk had encouraged users to post photos of their children on the platform.\n\n\"Post your family pics on X!\" Musk said alongside a meme portraying Instagram as a strip club. \"We care & do more to fight child exploitation than any other platform by far.\"\n\nMusk later deleted the post. It's unclear why, but his remarks were certainly inaccurate. X has unofficially allowed adult content to be published on the platform long before Musk acquired then-Twitter in October 2022 -- and that unofficial policy continued under Musk.\n\nThe platform known as Twitter didn't have any specific rules allowing adult content, but it did not take down nor censor such content. X also did not ban accounts posting NSFW posts. In the social media landscape, where platforms like Facebook and Instagram strictly moderate and remove adult content, Twitter has emerged as a haven for sex workers and adult content creators.\n\nHowever, X's policies on adult content have also come with some negative aspects as well. Under Musk's ownership, the platform has had to uniquely struggle with relentless swarms of porn bots, such as the now infamous \"pussy in bio\" spam.\n\nFurthermore, Musk's comments about child exploitation regarding X and Instagram were also at odds with reality. Shortly before Musk bought the company, Twitter even had plans to launch its own built-in OnlyFans competitor. However, issues regarding how the company was failing to deal with child sexual abuse material (CSAM) derailed those plans.\n\nUnder Musk, the CSAM issues have persisted on the platform to varying degrees. Last July, Musk personally stepped in to unsuspend a far-right influencer after that user had posted \"child-exploitation pictures,\" according to Musk.", "source": {"uri": "mashable.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mashable"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consent", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Consent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_safe_for_work", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Not safe for work"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexual_activity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Human sexual activity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornography", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pornography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nudity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_arousal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual arousal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hentai", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hentai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnlyFans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OnlyFans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spamming", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spamming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_celebrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet celebrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_worker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sex worker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_bot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet bot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_pornography", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Child pornography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strip_club", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strip club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Censorship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet meme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Child sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related_Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related Organizations", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Math/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Science/Math/Publications", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Informal_Sports/Kickball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Informal Sports/Kickball", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/05XhgqJa8nktn8FBsgaIdkS/hero-image.fill.size_1200x675.v1717433845.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619555", "eventUri": "eng-9619555", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

The platform has never restricted or banned adult content, but updated rules announced over the weekend reveal new caveats. Musk has previously hosted adult content with NSFW (not safe for work) communities.\n\n\"We believe in the autonomy of adults to engage with and create content that reflects their own beliefs, desires, and experiences, including those related to sexuality,\" X's Adult Content page reads. \"We balance this freedom by restricting exposure to Adult Content for children or adult users who choose not to see it. We also prohibit content promoting exploitation, nonconsent, objectification, sexualization or harm to minors, and obscene behaviors,\" the page continues. \"We also do not allow sharing Adult Content in highly visible places such as profile photos or banners.\"\n\nX defines \"adult content\" as any \"consensually produced and distributed material depicting adult nudity or sexual behavior that is pornographic or intended to cause sexual arousal.\" This also applies to AI-generated, photographic or animated content such as cartoons, hentai or anime. Examples include depictions of \"full or partial nudity, including closeups of genitals, buttocks or breasts\" and \"explicit or implied sexual behavior or simulated acts such as sexual intercourse and other sexual acts,\" X says.\n\nIn a statement to Deadline, a rep for X said: \"We launched Adult Content and Violent Content policies -- but what we enforce against has not changed - we launched these policies to clarify our Rules and increase transparency on our enforcement. These policies replace our former Sensitive Media and Violent Speech policies which means we continue to act on these types of content with the exact same philosophy.\"\n\nBefore Musk took over Twitter in October 2023, Reuters reported the year previously that Twitter estimated adult content constituted 13% of posts on the platform.\n\nAccording to the adult content policies, users who regularly post adult content are being asked to adjust their media settings that places all images and videos behind a content warning that needs to be acknowledged before it can be viewed. There also is an option of adding a one-time content warning on individual posts. According to the policies, failure to mark the posts will result in X adjusting the account settings for the user.", "source": {"uri": "deadline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Deadline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "denise_petski@deadline.com", "name": "Denise Petski", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornography", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pornography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_safe_for_work", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Not safe for work"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowpiercer_(TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Snowpiercer (TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMC_(TV_channel)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "AMC (TV channel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexual_activity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human sexual activity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human sexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nudity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectification", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Objectification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_arousal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual arousal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hentai", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hentai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexualization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexualization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obscenity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Obscenity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minor (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartoon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cartoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Animation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anime"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deadline Hollywood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_organ", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sex organ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buttocks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Buttocks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Breast"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sex_Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sex Education", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexual_Dysfunctions", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexual Dysfunctions", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Advice", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sexology", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sexology", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/X-logo.jpg?w=1000", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619555", "eventUri": "eng-9619555", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

"body": "SAN FRANCISCO, United States (AFP) -- Elon Musk's X, formerly Twitter, has updated its rules to officially allow adult and graphic content on the platform.\n\nAdult content and nudity has been present on Twitter for years and -- unlike Facebook or Instagram -- was never explicitly banned even before Musk's takeover in late 2022.\n\nThe new guidelines, first reported by Tech Crunch on Monday, explicitly permit users to share adult content \"as long as it is consensually produced and distributed adult nudity or sexual behaviour\".\n\nX updated the guidelines over the weekend, stating that \"sexual expression, visual or written, can be a legitimate form of artistic expression\".\n\nUnder the new policy, posting adult content is formally within the rules as long as it is labelled and not prominently displayed, such as in profile pictures or account banners.\n\nAccounts that regularly post adult content will be required to automatically mark their image and video posts as sensitive content.\n\nAdult content will also be prohibited for users identified as children or adult users who choose not to view it.\n\nThe policy extends to AI-generated content, animations, cartoons, hentai and anime.\n\nX's safety team tweeted the new guidelines would \"bring more clarity to our rules and transparency into enforcement of these areas\".\n\nSince acquiring Twitter in 2022 with the stated intention of promoting free speech, Musk has faced criticism for slashing content moderation teams.\n\nUnder his ownership, the platform has also experienced technical issues and reinstated accounts of right-wing conspiracy theorists and former US President Donald Trump.\n\nMusk also aims to expand X's revenue base beyond advertising and transform it into a \"super app\" similar to China's WeChat, which integrates messaging, voice and video calling, social media, mobile payments and online booking services.", "source": {"uri": "jamaicaobserver.com", "dataType":

As long as content is \"properly labeled and not prominently displayed,\" users can share material -- including AI-generated or animated content -- \"that is pornographic or intended to cause sexual arousal.\"\n\n\"We believe that users should be able to create, distribute, and consume material related to sexual themes as long as it is consensually produced and distributed,\" X's policy said.\n\nThe policy update seemingly reflects X's core mission to defend all legal speech. It protects a wide range of sexual expression, including depictions of explicit or implicit sexual behavior, simulated sexual intercourse, full or partial nudity, and close-ups of genitals, buttocks, or breasts.\n\n\"Sexual expression, whether visual or written, can be a legitimate form of artistic expression,\" X's policy said. \"We believe in the autonomy of adults to engage with and create content that reflects their own beliefs, desires, and experiences, including those related to sexuality.\"\n\nSeemingly none of this content can be monetized, though, as X's ad policy says that \"to ensure a positive user experience and a healthy conversation on the platform, X prohibits the promotion of adult sexual content globally.\"\n\nUnder the policy, adult content is also prohibited from appearing in live videos, profile pictures, headers, list banners, or community cover photos.\n\nX has been toying with the idea of fully embracing adult content and has even planned a feature for adult creators that could position X as an OnlyFans rival. That plan was delayed, Platformer reported in 2022, after red-teaming flagged a seemingly insurmountable obstacle to the launch: \"Twitter cannot accurately detect child sexual exploitation and non-consensual nudity at scale.\"\n\nThe new adult content policy still emphasizes that non-consensual adult content is prohibited, but it's unclear if the platform has gotten any better at distinguishing between consensually produced content and nonconsensual material. X did not immediately respond to Ars' request to comment.\n\nFor adult content to be allowed on the platform, X now requires content warnings so that \"users who do not wish to see it can avoid it\" and \"children below the age of 18 are not exposed to it.\"\n\nUsers who plan to regularly post adult content can adjust their account's media settings to place a label on all their images and videos. That results in a content warning for any visitor of that account's profile, except for \"people who have opted in to see possibly sensitive content,\" who \"will still see your account without the message.\"\n\nUsers who only occasionally share adult content can choose to avoid the account label and instead edit an image or video to add a one-time label to any individual post, flagging just that post as sensitive.\n\nOnce a label is applied, any users under 18 will be blocked from viewing the post, X said.", "source": {"uri": "arstechnica.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Ars Technica"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ashley_belanger@arstechnica.com", "name": "Ashley Belanger", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consent", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Consent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornography", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pornography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nudity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexual_activity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Human sexual activity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_arousal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexual arousal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Animation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Autonomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Avatar (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_organ", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sex organ"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buttocks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Buttocks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Breast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_intercourse", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sexual intercourse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human sexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnlyFans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OnlyFans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_slavery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual slavery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Platform game"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sex_Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sex Education", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Advice", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sexology", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sexology", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Women's_Health/Sexuality", "label": "dmoz/Health/Women's Health/Sexuality", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/kitty-in-bio-760x380.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619555", "eventUri": "eng-9619555", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

Going viral means that your content spreads rapidly and widely across the internet, reaching a massive audience in a short period. Achieving virality can significantly boost your brand's visibility, engagement, and growth. Let's explore how you can create content that has the potential to go viral.\n\nViral content is any piece of media that gains rapid and widespread popularity through sharing on social media, word-of-mouth, or other online platforms. It resonates with a large audience, compelling them to like, comment, and share it with their networks.\n\n1. **Understand Your Audience**\n\nStart by researching your target audience. What are their interests, pain points, and online behaviors? Create detailed buyer personas to guide your content creation. Understanding your audience is crucial for creating content that resonates with them.\n\n2. **Create High-Quality, Engaging Content**\n\nFocus on producing high-quality content that is visually appealing, well-written, and engaging. Use striking images, compelling videos, and clear, concise text. Your content should provide value, whether through entertainment, information, or inspiration.\n\n3. **Tap into Emotions**\n\nEmotional content tends to go viral more easily. Aim to evoke strong emotions such as joy, surprise, curiosity, or even empathy. Emotional responses drive people to share content with others. Stories, personal experiences, and heartfelt messages can be powerful.\n\n4. **Leverage Trending Topics and Hashtags**\n\nKeep an eye on current trends and popular hashtags in your industry. Create content that is timely and relevant to what people are already talking about. This increases the chances of your content being discovered and shared.\n\n5. **Craft a Catchy Headline**\n\nYour headline is the first thing people see. Make it catchy, intriguing, and relevant. A great headline grabs attention and entices people to click and share your content. Use numbers, questions, or strong adjectives to make it stand out.\n\n6. **Utilize Visuals and Videos**\n\n.Visual content is more likely to be shared than text-only posts. Use high-quality images, infographics, and videos to enhance your content. Videos, in particular, are highly engaging and shareable, especially on social media platforms.\n\n7. **Incorporate Call-to-Actions (CTAs)**\n\nEncourage your audience to take action by including clear and compelling CTAs. Ask them to share, comment, or tag friends. Engaging your audience directly increases the likelihood of your content being shared.\n\n8. **Optimize for Social Media**\n\nTailor your content for different social media platforms. Use the appropriate formats, sizes, and styles for each platform. Optimize your posts with hashtags, captions, and tags to increase visibility. Consistency in posting also helps build a loyal following.\n\n9. **Collaborate with Influencers**\n\nPartnering with influencers can amplify your content's reach. Influencers have established audiences who trust their recommendations. Collaborate with influencers whose followers align with your target audience to boost shares and engagement.\n\n10. **Analyze and Iterate**\n\nTrack the performance of your content using analytics tools. Monitor metrics such as views, shares, likes, and comments. Analyze what works and what doesn't, and use these insights to refine your content strategy. Continuous improvement is key to achieving virality.\n\nCreating viral content is both an art and a science. By understanding your audience, crafting high-quality and emotionally resonant content, leveraging trends, and optimizing for social media, you can significantly increase your chances of going viral. Remember, persistence and continuous improvement are key.", "source": {"uri": "airevolution.medium.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Medium"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_d@airevolution.medium.com", "name": "Andrew D.", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_phenomenon", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Viral phenomenon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_creation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Content creation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_of_mouth", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Word of mouth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_audience", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Target audience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashtag", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hashtag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(American_TV_series)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leverage (American TV series)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjective", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adjective"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Empathy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotion", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Emotion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_celebrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet celebrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infographic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Infographic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Analytics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Math/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Science/Math/Publications", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Entertainment/Online_Media", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Entertainment/Online Media", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Job_Sharing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Job Sharing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1024/1*ZsMA5Ar63JYS_XDexpbiYA@2x.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619555", "eventUri": "eng-9619555", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

It added that it does not allow sharing adult content in \"highly visible\" places such as users' profile photos or banners.\n\nX's policy stands in contrast to other social media platforms, such as Meta's properties -- Instagram and Facebook -- as well as TikTok and Google's YouTube.\n\n\"The platform's move to allow 'adult content' dovetails well with the company's post-Musk marketing strategy,\" said Brooke Erin Duffy, associate professor of communication at Cornell University. \"X is unapologetically provocative and has sought to distinguish itself from 'brand safe' competitors.\"\n\nThe company appears to be courting people, including creators and artists, who have been marginalized by other social media platforms that have guidelines restricting nudity or sexual expression, she added.\n\nThe policy applies to real as well as artificial-intelligence-generated material.\n\nX is asking users who regularly post adult content to adjust their media settings to place all their images and videos behind a content warning. This requires users to acknowledge that they want to see the posted image before they can view it.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

This change aligns with previous experiments under Elon Musk's leadership, which involved hosting adult content within specific communities.\n\n\"We believe that users should be able to create, distribute, and consume material related to sexual themes as long as it is consensually produced and distributed. Sexual expression, visual or written, can be a legitimate form of artistic expression,\" X's updated 'adult content' policy states.\n\nThe policy further elaborates: \"We believe in the autonomy of adults to engage with and create content that reflects their own beliefs, desires, and experiences, including those related to sexuality. We balance this freedom by restricting exposure to adult content for children or adult users who choose not to see it.\"\n\nUsers can mark their posts as containing sensitive media, ensuring that such content is restricted from users under 18 or those who haven't provided their birth dates.\n\nWhile X's violent content rules have similar guidelines, the platform maintains a strict stance against excessively gory content and depictions of sexual violence. Explicit threats or content inciting or glorifying violence remain prohibited.\n\nX's decision to allow graphic content is aimed at enabling users to participate in discussions about current events, including sharing relevant images and videos.\n\nAlthough X has never outright banned porn, these new clauses could pave the way for developing services centred around adult content, potentially creating a competitor to services like OnlyFans and enhancing its revenue streams. This would further Musk's vision of X becoming an \"everything app,\" similar to China's WeChat.\n\nA 2022 Reuters report, citing internal company documents, indicated that approximately 13% of posts on the platform contained adult content. This percentage has likely increased, especially with the proliferation of porn bots on X.\n\nExplore other upcoming enterprise technology events and webinars powered by TechForge here.", "source": {"uri": "artificialintelligence-news.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AI News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_daws@artificialintelligence-news.com", "name": "Ryan Daws", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornography", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pornography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forrester_Research", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forrester Research"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_celebrity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet celebrity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_safe_for_work", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Not safe for work"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Autonomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human sexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnlyFans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OnlyFans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeChat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "WeChat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_bot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet bot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence_and_Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Violence and Abuse", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sex_Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sex Education", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://www.artificialintelligence-news.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/x-twitter-social-media-elon-musk-adult-content-ai-generated-artificial-intelligence-policy-rules.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619555", "eventUri": "eng-9619555", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 175, "relevance": 1}

Accounts consistently sharing adult content must automatically mark their image and video posts as sensitive content.\n\nFurthermore, adult content is off-limits for users identified as minors or for adult users who opt out of viewing it. The policy extends to various forms of content, including AI-generated material, animations, cartoons, hentai, and anime.\n\nX's safety team took to Twitter to affirm that the updated guidelines aim to provide more clarity and transparency in enforcing these areas.\n\nSince Musk's acquisition of Twitter, his approach to content moderation has drawn criticism, particularly for reducing content moderation teams.

Which it's unofficially been okay with since forever, but it's now making its approach more explicit in this respect.\n\nX says that it still has strong rules against \"content promoting exploitation, nonconsent, objectification, sexualization or harm to minors, and obscene behaviors\", while it also won't allow adult content to be shown in profile photos or profile banners. So overall, its restrictions haven't changed, but it will now be more open to adult material.\n\nSo why the update?\n\nAs noted, X has long allowed porn indirectly, by simply not enforcing it, and letting users post what they like in the app. That's led to various challenges in enforcement and exposure (as well as ad placement, a key note given its more recent struggles on this front), though at the same time, it's also provided a solid driver of traffic and engagement for the app.\n\nSo much so, in fact, that back in 2022, then Twitter management actually explored the possibility of enabling adult content creators to sell subscriptions in the app, as part of a potential push to tap into OnlyFans' $2.5b self-made content market.\n\nGiven that so much of this content is already so present in the app, it seems, potentially, like a logical step to make more money for the platform, by leaning into this element, rather than just turning a blind eye to it.\n\nExcept, Twitter's team eventually decided that it couldn't do it.\n\n\"Before the final go-ahead to launch, Twitter convened 84 employees to form what it called a \"Red Team.\" The goal was \"to pressure-test the decision to allow adult creators to monetize on the platform, by specifically focusing on what it would look like for Twitter to do this safely and responsibly\". What the Red Team discovered derailed the project: Twitter could not safely allow adult creators to sell subscriptions because the company was not - and still is not - effectively policing harmful sexual content on the platform.\"\n\nEssentially, Twitter's team wasn't able to provide any assurance that they would be able to stop this type of exploitation in the app, because its detection measures were not adequate.\n\nBut have they potentially improved under Elon Musk?\n\nMusk has made a lot of noise about addressing child exploitation content in the app, calling it his top priority early on in his tenure as Twitter owner. Yet, since then, Musk has also culled 80% of the platform's staff, including many from its moderation and safety teams, so it seems unlikely that he's actually been able to improve this, at a much lower headcount.\n\nBut that may also be changing.\n\nBack in January, X announced a plan to build a new \"Trust and Safety center of excellence\" in Texas, in order to improve its responsiveness in addressing child exploitation specifically.\n\nMaybe, with that in place, X could be in a better position to address such, and that could, at least in theory, enable it to re-examine its adult content monetization plan once again.\n\nAnd definitely, X needs the money right now, given that its ad revenue remains down by an estimated 50% on pre-Elon levels, while X Premium take-up is nowhere close to picking up the slack.\n\nAdd to this the fact that adult content has reportedly increased significantly in the app since Musk's staff cuts, and there are quite a few indicators that this could be where X is heading.\n\nAt this stage, however, X does still have definitive rules in place that restrict adult content monetization, with a note in its Ad Policy stating that:\n\n\"X prohibits the promotion of adult sexual content globally.\"\n\nBut that, technically, only applies to ads for such, not creators making money from subscriptions.", "source": {"uri": "socialmediatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Social Media Today | A business community for the web's best thinkers on Social Media"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_hutchinson@socialmediatoday.com", "name": "Andrew Hutchinson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consent", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Consent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornography", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pornography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectification", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Objectification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Autonomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexualization", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sexualization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obscenity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Obscenity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minor (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexual_activity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human sexual activity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human sexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nudity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnlyFans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OnlyFans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Noise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Child sexual abuse"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sex_Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sex Education", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexual_Dysfunctions", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexual Dysfunctions", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Advice", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Men's_Health/Sexuality", "label": "dmoz/Health/Men's Health/Sexuality", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://www.socialmediatoday.com/imgproxy/SSqt9ZSYL8tdGxSRxUMGV5XdPsieVWmOzTb1EnZhdJo/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/bG9jYWw6Ly8vZGl2ZWltYWdlL3hfbG9nbzMucG5n.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619555", "eventUri": "eng-9619555", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

But now the social media platform is making it more official by introducing a new adult content policy.\n\nThe move is intended to \"bring more clarity\" to Twitter's approach to adult content. Previously, Twitter classified it under its \"sensitive media\" policy, which permitted consensually produced porn. But the content had to be marked as \"sensitive,\" allowing Twitter's algorithms to filter it out for users who didn't wish to see it.\n\nTwitter/X -- which is now owned by Elon Musk -- has decided to continue with the policy, and will require users to place a content warning on the shared media. But now, the company is explicitly endorsing adult content as a legitimate form of expression.\n\n\"We believe in the autonomy of adults to engage with and create content that reflects their own beliefs, desires, and experiences, including those related to sexuality,\" the company wrote in the new guidelines. \"This also applies to AI-generated, photographic or animated content such as cartoons, hentai, or anime.\"\n\nOn the flip side, Twitter will restrict porn for users who elect to \"hide sensitive\" content within their search or content settings. Like before, users must also refrain from posting adult content in their profile or banner.

As the social media platform recently tweaked its rules that allow for porn and other adult-themed content to be shared on X/Twitter.\n\nSpotted first by TechCrunch, X/Twitter's guidelines have been updated to reflect the new policy that will allow users to \"share consensually produced and distributed adult nudity or sexual behavior.\" Under these new guidelines, users can share porn and other adult-typed content, but not in \"obvious places,\" like profile pictures or banners, according to X/Twitter's Adult Content section on its guidelines page.\n\nX/Twitter advises those who will \"regularly post adult content\" on its platform to adjust their media settings to allow content warnings to be placed on images and videos before other users can view them. Adding this disclaimer will also help prevent minors or those who did not include a birth date on their profile from viewing the marked content.\n\n\"We believe that users should be able to create, distribute, and consume material related to sexual themes as long as it is consensually produced and distributed,\" X/Twitter's new guidelines on Adult Content reads, \"Sexual expression, whether visual or written, can be a legitimate form of artistic expression. We believe in the autonomy of adults to engage with and create content that reflects their own beliefs, desires, and experiences, including those related to sexuality.\"\n\nX/Twitter embracing NSFW on its platform is a long time coming. In addition to the growing number of sex workers who began to congregate on X/Twitter after the relaunch of Twitter Blue, TechCrunch reported in March that X/Twitter was planning to allow NSFW communities to apply for an \"Adult Content\" label on its platform to prevent those communities from getting filled.\n\nThe move is reminiscent of Tumblr, which was once a popular website for people to post adult content before banning the content in 2018. However, its community guidelines were somewhat tweaked in 2022 to allow nudity but no imagery that was considered sexually explicit.\n\nIn any case, NSFW content on X/Twitter comes at a time as owner Elon Musk looks to find additional revenue streams to make X/Twitter profitable as the platform has seen a ton of advertisers leaving, with The New York Times reported late last year that the social media site may lose up to $75 million in 2023 revenue as a result of advertisers departing.", "source": {"uri": "ign.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "IGN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consent", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Consent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_safe_for_work", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Not safe for work"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TechCrunch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TechCrunch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexual_activity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human sexual activity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nudity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Autonomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Minor (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornography", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pornography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_worker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sex worker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumblr", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tumblr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human sexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sex_Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sex Education", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Politics_of_Sexuality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Politics of Sexuality", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Advice", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/03/elon-musk-rebrands-twitter-with-new-x-logo-xa8p-1717437694430.jpg?width=1280", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619555", "eventUri": "eng-9619555", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

The platform remains committed to prohibiting content that explicitly promotes violence or threats.\n\nBy allowing graphic content, X aims to facilitate meaningful conversations and inclusivity by enabling users to share images and videos relevant to ongoing discussions.\n\nWhile X has never explicitly banned adult content, these updated clauses open up possibilities for the platform to explore services catering to adult audiences, potentially expanding its revenue streams.\n\nRecent reports indicate a significant presence of adult content on X, with approximately 13% of posts containing such material in 2022.

With Google's new AI Overviews feature producing inaccurate information and users worried about false outputs resulting from AI models, society is once again reminded that correctness reigns supreme when it comes to AI-generated content. Consequently, many enterprises rank correctness as the most important quality of their content.\n\nWith the rise of AI-generated content and the increase in the amount of content, how clear is the content being produced? While the correctness of AI-generated content may be top of mind, issues related to clarity, the degree to which readers understand words and ideas, cannot be ignored.\n\nThe importance of clarity in enterprise content... and the risks of unclear content\n\nIn a new survey of Fortune 500 companies including Amazon, AT&T, Cisco, Ford, Philips, Siemens Energy, and ServiceNow, Acrolinx, the AI-powered content governance software, has dug into how its customers prioritize clarity, rank it in comparison to other writing qualities, and practice clarity in their writing. The output has been shared with Digital Journal.\n\nThe research reveals that 61.2 percent of enterprises said clarity was the most important factor to their enterprise. An additional 30.9 percent still considered clarity important, while only 6.7 percent said clarity is only somewhat important.\n\nFrom a business perspective, writing with clarity has a number of benefits. Not only is the customer experience improved as a result of easy-to-understand writing, but translation to other languages also becomes streamlined when content is more straightforward. In addition, the use of plain language has made information more accessible to others, especially neurodiverse readers.\n\nWhen readers are not aligned with what content means, enterprises face detrimental risks. The negative consequences of unclear or ambiguous content on enterprises that were most cited were ineffective knowledge transfer (43 percent), and product misuse or regulatory risk (22.4 percent). However, 17.6 percent of enterprises suffered from longer editorial cycles and 17 percent cited missed sales opportunities due to lack of clarity in content.\n\nEnterprise strategies to maintain clear content\n\nKnowing the critical importance of clarity, how can enterprises achieve it when developing content? Here nearly 75 percent of enterprises utilize a corporate style guide with clear rules on grammar, tone, terminology, and more. Regular content audits were deemed as important by 46.7 percent of enterprises surveyed to identify inconsistencies in content and correct them 42.4 percent said a centralized content management system for easy collaboration helped to achieve clarity, while 31.5 percent relied on free tools to check for clarity and readability.\n\nFrom improving readability and sentence structure to leveraging more plain language and consistent terminology, these qualities of clear content are the cornerstone for inclusivity and comprehension in workplaces. When companies achieve clarity in content, the benefits are significant - streamlining processes, enhancing collaboration, and allowing for faster communication and decision-making.\n\nThe future of generative AI in creating content\n\nWith generative AI playing a more significant role in tasks across organizations, enterprises need schooling on how to create content that audiences actually understand. In fact, today's content writers are benefiting immensely from AI flagging their content as ineffective or high risk. Despite the accuracy of information being of utmost priority, enterprises must ensure that the clarity of the content they are publishing is just as important.", "source": {"uri": "digitaljournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Digital Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri": "dr_tim_sandle@digitaljournal.com", "name": "Dr. Tim Sandle", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_500", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fortune 500"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbocharger", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Turbocharger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cisco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ServiceNow", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ServiceNow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philips", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT&T", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AT&T"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siemens", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Siemens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_transfer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Knowledge transfer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ford Motor Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Decision-making"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_guide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Style guide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Content management system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grammar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Syntax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_France-Presse", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Agence France-Presse"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Math/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Science/Math/Publications", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Social_Enterprise", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Social Enterprise", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Publications", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Publications", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://www.digitaljournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/50adb90db801c6bc7ebe8ce9dd0a082bb22d9c8b.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619555", "eventUri": "eng-9619555", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5137254901960784, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

The social media platform has, until now, never said adult-oriented content is forbidden or allowed.\n\nThe social media juggernaut added a clause to its rules, confirming that NSFW (Not Safe For Work) content will be allowed on the platform so long as it is consensual and legal. The content will also need to be labeled as NSFW content.\n\nMost alarming is that AI-generated videos that include explicit content will also be allowed on the platform.\n\n'We believe in the autonomy of adults to engage with and create content that reflects their own beliefs, desires, and experiences, including those related to sexuality.'\n\nBut the addition of the clause should not come as a surprise. Musk has already experimented with hosting adult-oriented content on the platform. In a previous report by the Verge, Musk said he was seeing significant growth with the Communities feature but noted that \"there's a lot of work to do to make Communities compelling.\"\n\n\"We're rapidly transforming the company from what it was, Twitter 1.0, to the everything app. [An] all-inclusive feature set that you can basically do anything you want on our system,\" Musk said. \"Obviously, that's not to the exclusion of other apps, but I think the fundamental thing that's missing that would be incredibly useful is a single application that encompasses everything. You can do payments, messages, video, calling, whatever you'd like, from one single, convenient place.\"\n\nThe company claimed that they are moving in this direction because they want to allow users to have conversations about what is happening around them. Those under the age of 18 will not be able to see such posts on the platform, according to the rule change.\n\nWhile X has never officially banned adult-oriented material, it has never come out in support of it, either. But now, it could become a competitor to OnlyFans by coming up with services centered around explicit material, according to the report.\n\nThe following is X's statement on the matter:\n\nWe believe that users should be able to create, distribute, and consume material related to sexual themes as long as it is consensually produced and distributed. Sexual expression, visual or written, can be a legitimate form of artistic expression.\n\nWe believe in the autonomy of adults to engage with and create content that reflects their own beliefs, desires, and experiences, including those related to sexuality. We balance this freedom by restricting exposure to Adult Content for children or adult users who choose not to see it.\n\nX also mentioned that the adult content should not \"depict sexual violence.\" The platform will continue to bar content that threatens or incites violence. Users will also be allowed to opt out of having explicit material pushed to their timeline.\n\nWhen Blaze News prompted Grok -- X's AI chatbot -- about the new rule, it replied somewhat humorously: \"It's not a free-for-all. X has also made it clear that it won't allow non-consensual nudity or sexually explicit content featuring minors.\"\n\n\"So, if you're planning to share your vacation photos from the nudist beach, make sure to mark them as sensitive content. And remember, no matter how much you might want to share that intimate video of your ex, it's a big no-no if it's not consensual,\" Grok added.", "source": {"uri": "theblaze.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheBlaze"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_safe_for_work", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Not safe for work"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Autonomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Consent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TechCrunch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TechCrunch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Human sexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornography", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pornography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnlyFans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OnlyFans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minor (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_violence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexual violence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nudity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Naturism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sex_Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sex Education", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Advice", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://www.theblaze.com/media-library/x-announces-pornographic-content-will-officially-be-allowed-on-the-platform.jpg?id=52368508&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C171", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619555", "eventUri": "eng-9619555", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 157, "relevance": 1}

We do the same. We do this because what we produce every day and every week is hard work and it's important. We deliver high-quality journalism that informs and, hopefully, provides a mirror for readers to look at their community.\n\nNo business -- whether it's selling tires or beef or wheat -- can sustain itself by giving away its product. Seeking payment for our content allows us the financial freedom to pursue high-quality journalism on a regular basis.\n\nWhat that means for you, the reader, is that some of our award-winning journalism -- including investigations and feature articles -- will now be accessible only to our most valued subscribers.\n\nThe change will mostly impact those who access our articles on our website or apps or other digital mechanisms.\n\nThe change may be a surprise for some. That's OK. Change is often difficult but for us it means we can keep our talented corps of journalists and pay them a suitable wage for the great content they furnish Eastern Oregon.\n\nA subscription by a reader allows us the flexibility to do the kind of work you've come to know and trust. Switching to subscriber-exclusive content allows us to sustain ourselves and to build on a solid foundation for the future.\n\nSome elements of our news coverage -- such as public safety issues - will not be restricted.\n\nI think it is important that I convey we remain dedicated to furnishing content you, the reader, can use. Our subscriber-exclusive content blueprint rewards our loyal readers and, we hope, will attract others to subscribe.\n\nIf you have not already, I urge you to consider subscribing today to unlock access to our exclusive content that I believe is not only useful but thought-provoking and, at times, entertaining. Readers should remember there is a lot of content on our website that doesn't make it into the print edition because of a lack of space. That includes an array of puzzles, articles from various content partners, along with other web-only content our newsrooms produce.

Since then, it appears the figures have spiraled even further, with loads of porn bots infiltrating the site.", "source": {"uri": "tmz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TMZ"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_rating", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "X rating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_safe_for_work", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Not safe for work"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudity", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nudity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Consent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexual_activity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Human sexual activity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectification", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Objectification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Autonomy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexualization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexualization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obscenity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Obscenity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Minor (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human sexuality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pornography", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pornography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related_Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related Organizations", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sex_Education", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Sex Education", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive_Health/Sexual_Dysfunctions", "label": "dmoz/Health/Reproductive Health/Sexual Dysfunctions", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality/Advice", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/68/16by9/2024/06/03/68995c20de6141969837a8206a7e2664_xl.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9619555", "eventUri": "eng-9619555", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

There were about 500 people competing, each issue we faced during the campaign made me think deeply about how to connect with the audience. One difficult task was filming Voxpop content in Ahmedabad's burning weather. It was difficult to talk to people and capture their comments on camera on such short notice, as the temperature rose by the hour. However, going through these challenges taught me to be determined even when things were difficult. And it was a pleasure to collaborate with and learn from other talented participants. Overall, the campaign was an amazing experience that fueled my passion for sports anchoring and content creation.\n\nOn developing your unique style and persona, often being referred to as the \"Majnu Bhai of cricket\"\n\nDeveloping a unique niche has been a journey of self-discovery and experimentation. I've always been passionate about both cricket and Bollywood, so naturally, I was always inclined towards blending the two in my content. The idea of infusing cricket with humor and also the most beloved Bollywood characters like Majnu Bhai resonated with me, and I decided to incorporate that into my videos. Through mimicry and comedic elements, I found a way to entertain and engage in a way that felt authentic to me. Over time, as I continued to refine my content and explore different avenues of creativity, the persona of the \"Majnu Bhai of cricket\" began to take shape. It's a fusion of my love for both cricket and Bollywood, and it's something that has resonated with my audience, earning me that endearing nickname.\n\nOn ensuring your content stands out in a crowded space\n\nIn a space full of talented content creators, standing out requires a combination of authenticity, consistency, and innovation. Firstly, I stay true to myself and my passion for cricket, which resonates with my audience on a personal level. This authenticity helps me build a genuine connection with my viewers, fostering loyalty and engagement. Secondly, consistency is key. I strive to maintain a regular posting schedule, ensuring that my audience knows when to expect new content from me. This helps me stay relevant and top-of-mind amidst the noise of social media. Finally, innovation is crucial for staying ahead of the curve. I'm always experimenting with different formats, collaborating with other creators, and staying abreast of emerging trends in content creation. By constantly evolving and pushing the boundaries of creativity, I ensure that my content remains fresh, engaging, and distinctive in a crowded space.\n\nOn any tips or advice for aspiring content creators who want to focus on cricket or sports in general\n\nGet right into the game. Watch matches, study players, and really get to know the sport inside out. The more you love it, the more your passion will shine through in your content. And don't be afraid to be yourself.

In case there was any confusion as to whether or not porn content is permitted on the massive Elon Musk-owned social media platform, the aptly-named X/formerly Twitter has announced that anything goes on that frontier.\n\nHere's part of X's official statement:\n\n\"You may share consensually produced and distributed adult nudity or sexual behavior, provided it's properly labeled and not prominently displayed. We believe that users should be able to create, distribute, and consume material related to sexual themes as long as it is consensually produced and distributed.\n\nSexual expression, whether visual or written, can be a legitimate form of artistic expression. We believe in the autonomy of adults to engage with and create content that reflects their own beliefs, desires, and experiences, including those related to sexuality. We balance this freedom by restricting exposure to Adult Content for children or adult users who choose not to see it.\"\n\nFirst of all, Elon, think of the children! How on Earth is it possible to police any and all stray pornos that happen to fly into the wholesome X feeds of our youth? For goodness' sake. Secondly, I can't help but send thoughts and prayers to the prude who sued Madonna for \"pornography without warning\" at live shows.\n\nSince I haven't seen this anywhere else just yet, I can't help but notice that the admin for the main X account might've been trolling us in advance of this landmark porn announcement. Lubing up the general pubic -- pardon me, the general public -- if you will.\n\nYou tell me if there aren't innuendos out the wazoo in this string of tweets/X posts. It all began with this from May 25:\n\nDon't pretend like that isn't a hint about X's eventual \"sexual expression as artistic expression\" rationalization for Fifty Shades Freeing porn all over their platform.\n\nThen it started to get even more on the nose (on the screws?)...\n\nDrafting the next banger, eh?\n\nOne step closer to the \"everything app\" mere days ago with brand-new job boards, one giant leap for mankind with no holds barred porn.\n\nWe've got job postings, we've got confusingly-worded posts about being posted, and we've got another tweet with steamy undertones (See: Entry No. 3 on Urban Dictionary).\n\nDefinition of post, via Google d*c(k)-tionary: \"A long, sturdy piece of timber or metal set upright in the ground and used to support something or as a marker.\"\n\nYeah, I'm calling phallus on that one. Look at this X admin trying to dismiss a befuddled, innocent user:\n\nFinally, X was trying to prepare everyone by reminding them that, despite how challenging it might be to be (golden) showered with all this porn content to the point of mass desensitization, this storm too shall pass.\n\nThis is akin to when Michael Keaton denied knowing who TLC was in The Other Guys.\n\nWith every passing tweet, in retrospective reflection, I feel like the characters played by Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg. It's too much of a coincidence to be a coincidence.\n\nWe may never know for sure if the sultry subtext of the based X/Twitter main account holder was intentional. However, you can't tell me to get my mind out of the gutter when I'm trying to process the widespread ramifications of the company's bombshell revelation.\n\nCongratulations to Elon Musk on this momentous occasion. Maybe he'll become personally involved as a tone-setting pioneer of sexual expression.

{"id": 225062854, "title": "Camila Cabello Dialed Up \u2018Big Baddie Energy\u2019 (And DM\u2019d Drake) for Her Miami-Inspired New Album", "text": "It\u2019s a sunny May afternoon in Miami\u2019s lush Coral Gables neighborhood, and Camila Cabello greets me at her family\u2019s one-story home accompanied by a small menagerie: four dogs \u2014 including her golden retriever, Tarzan, and German shepherd, Thunder \u2014 along with her rescued cockatoo, Percy. Cabello is home \u201cto recharge\u201d amid a hectic few days that included time in California and will soon take her to New York for the Met Gala. But today, with her messy pigtails, Daisy Duke shorts and silver flip-flops, Cabello looks more like a college girl on break than a major pop star about to release her fourth solo album \u2014 a fearless artistic statement coming June 28 titled C,XOXO. Her father washes the driveway, her mother offers me cafecito, and her aunt plays with the dogs. Cabello will receive the Global Impact award at Billboard\u2019s Latin Women in Music, produced by and airing on Telemundo on June 9. \u201cLet\u2019s go to lunch \u2014 I\u2019ll drive!\u201d Cabello exclaims as she grabs her tote. The 27-year-old got her license just two years ago and learned to drive during the pandemic; as we hop into her white Tesla \u2014 nicknamed \u201cTessie\u201d \u2014 she admits that getting behind the wheel (with a good album or podcast on the stereo) is her favorite form of stress relief. She takes us to Pura Vida, one of her favorite local health spots, where we sit down outside with summer chicken bowls. \u201cGirl, it\u2019s this Met Gala coming up\u2026 I can\u2019t wait to stuff my face after,\u201d she jokes. With her still fairly new platinum blonde tresses (a fresh \u2019do she debuted on social media in February), Cabello largely goes incognito; some passersby seem to recognize her but are perhaps too shy to approach. Just one screams, \u201cCamila, I love you!\u201d \u2014 a reminder that while Cabello might periodically crash at her parents\u2019 house, she\u2019s still a global superstar. But while she jokes that her new look has the side benefit of granting her some anonymity in public, she explains that it has a deeper meaning. \u201cThe voice that I found with my new album has this big baddie energy vibe,\u201d she explains animatedly. \u201cPart of that spirit is taking risks, not giving a f\u2013k and doing whatever you want. I think the blonde was me staying true to that feeling. With the hair, it was like, \u2018How do I tell people, visually, that this is my new era?\u2019 Sometimes you need the physicality to let them know, \u2018Oh, this is a new thing, a new character.\u2019 \u201d On March 27, Cabello unleashed the first taste of what C,XOXO might bring: the Playboi Carti-featuring \u201cI Luv It,\u201d co-produced by Spanish hit-maker El Guincho (Rosal\u00eda) and Jasper Harris (Jack Harlow, Doja Cat). \u201cI Luv It\u201d samples Gucci Mane (\u201cLemonade\u201d), interpolates a 2011 Rihanna loosie (\u201cCockiness [Love It]\u201d) \u2014 and has a hyperpop aesthetic that marked a significant departure from the more conventional pop (and more recently Latin-influenced) sound that made Cabello a household name, first as a member of Fifth Harmony, then as a solo artist. The unexpected track was also significant for another reason: It was Cabello\u2019s first Interscope Records release after leaving Epic Records, her label home of nearly a decade where she had been since Fifth Harmony\u2019s debut and released her first three solo albums \u2014 Camila, Romance and Familia \u2014 between 2018 and 2022. Reactions to \u201cI Luv It\u201d on social media were mixed, and the song debuted and peaked at No. 81 on the Billboard Hot 100. Still, the song (and its somewhat unhinged vibes) piqued interest in Cabello\u2019s next musical chapter. \u201cThe unpredictability of it is so different for me,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s such a kick-the-door-down moment, sonically, that it makes me feel strong and powerful. At least for me, in this stage of my life, it would feel so unfulfilling to just have a song that was big but felt like something that I\u2019ve already done before. That brings me no joy. I would rather have a song that\u2019s weird and be new territory to me.\u201d While the strangeness of \u201cI Luv It\u201d encapsulates Cabello\u2019s new era, it was a different track that truly set the tone for the C,XOXO sessions. \u201cAt first, we played around with different genres, trying to find the sonic world the album lives in,\u201d she explains. \u201c \u2018Chanel No. 5\u2019 really cracked open the album. For me, as a writer, that was the voice I wanted for the album: coy, cheeky and kind of devious.\u201d On \u201cChanel No. 5,\u201d Cabello sings between trippy piano interludes, her falsetto distorted, about being a \u201ccute girl with a sick mind.\u201d At one point she even raps \u2014 she has recently taken inspiration from \u201cc\u2013ty, cocky girl rap\u201d like Flo Milli and Baby Tate, she explains. \u201cWe realized we hit this key transition in the process,\u201d says Harris, who co-produced the album, of the track. \u201cThat\u2019s the first song we knew was very C,XOXO, and creating every song forward, we would ask if it felt as true as \u2018Chanel.\u2019 It was our north star.\u201d (\u201cChanel No. 5\u201d will be released pre-album drop as a fan track.) Cabello, El Guincho and Harris devoted most of 2023 to working on the album \u2014 in New York, Los Angeles and the Bahamas but primarily Miami \u2014 and along the way, she had another creative epiphany: Her previous sets all had a why, a when and a who at their center, but never a where. C,XOXO would: It\u2019s a love letter to Miami. Cabello wasn\u2019t always a Miami girl, but her journey here \u2014 a city full of sounds and culture enriched by immigrants \u2014 was a big part of what ultimately made her one. Born in Havana, Cuba, she moved to Mexico City with her parents at age 6 and ultimately arrived in Miami with her mother (her father joined almost two years later). Her mom, who had been an architect in Cuba, worked in the shoe department at Marshalls; her dad washed cars at Dolphin Mall. Today, they run a successful contracting company called Soka Construction (named after Camila and her younger sister, Sofia). In ninth grade, Cabello auditioned for The X Factor, where she eventually joined contestants Ally Brooke, Normani, Lauren Jauregui and Dinah Jane to form Fifth Harmony. With Cabello in the fold, the girl group \u2014 one of the most commercially successful ever \u2014 went platinum with its first two albums, in 2015 and 2016, and notched a top five Hot 100 hit with the Ty Dolla $ign-featuring \u201cWork From Home.\u201d Amid Fifth Harmony\u2019s success, Cabello started exploring opportunities outside the group. In 2015, she teamed with Shawn Mendes for \u201cI Know What You Did Last Summer,\u201d which cracked the top 20 of the Hot 100; the following year, she released \u201cBad Things\u201d with Machine Gun Kelly, which went to No. 4. In December 2016, Fifth Harmony announced Cabello\u2019s departure from the group on social media. \u201cAfter 4 and a half years of being together, we have been informed via her representatives that Camila has decided to leave Fifth Harmony,\u201d the other four members stated. \u201cWe wish her well.\u201d Cabello quickly flourished on her own: Her first three solo albums all reached the top 10 of the Billboard 200, and she has logged 21 Hot 100 entries as a solo artist, plus picked up two Latin Grammys. All the while, she continued notching star collaborations, like \u201cHey Ma,\u201d an early-2017 teamup with Pitbull and J Balvin from the Fate of the Furious soundtrack. But her solo career really took off in August of that year with the Young Thug-featuring \u201cHavana,\u201d which climbed to No. 1 on the Hot 100 the following January. Her second Hot 100 chart-topper followed two years later: the steamy duet \u201cSe\u00f1orita\u201d alongside Mendes, with whom she was in a much-photographed, two-year relationship. Still, Cabello hasn\u2019t yet delivered her lasting, full-length statement \u2014 the one that strongly defines her creative ethos and is entirely her own. Her latest album, 2022\u2019s Familia, scored a top 40 hit with the Ed Sheeran-featuring \u201cBam Bam,\u201d but it was Cabello\u2019s lowest-charting solo project. (Her feature film Cinderella the previous year \u2014 a splashy starring role that could\u2019ve further boosted her profile \u2014 received, at best, middling reviews.) In September 2022, Cabello left Epic to sign with Interscope \u2014 home to young stars like Billie Eilish and Olivia Rodrigo, who have become some of the biggest names in pop music by unapologetically establishing strong musical identities. With C,XOXO, Cabello is poised to potentially do the same. \u201cThis was the first time she had the chance to decide on her own record label,\u201d says Cabello\u2019s longtime manager, Roger Gold of Gold Music Management. \u201c[Epic was] wonderful and super supportive, but there\u2019s a difference between being signed to a label without your own selection process and making decisions and then really getting to do that for the first time. It was a big deal for her to find people who deeply wanted to work with her, respected her and understood her. [Interscope] truly makes us feel like we\u2019re the only artist on the label sometimes.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s the kind of artist who doesn\u2019t compromise,\u201d says Michelle An, Interscope Geffen A&M president and head of creative strategy. \u201cIt sounded like Camila wanted a label team that really gets into the weeds of everything. What are the big looks with the [digital service provider] partners? What is the strategy with radio? How are we implementing it internationally? She\u2019s the boss of the boardroom, and she can tell us how she feels and how she wants to market. She\u2019s really embracing the fact that she has a big team that operates like a boutique.\u201d That level of label support, Gold says, allowed Cabello to treat C,XOXO as the kind of creative departure she had never explored before. \u201cShe\u2019s feeling very confident in her womanhood, owning her own power,\u201d he says, \u201cand feeling like this is her time to bravely say the things she wants to say.\u201d It may have been a sonic jolt and, to some fans, an outlier, but \u201cI Luv It\u201d was no red herring. On C,XOXO, Cabello\u2019s musical hallmarks remain \u2014 her hypnotic falsetto, her vulnerable ballads, her heartfelt songwriting \u2014 but in an entirely different sonic context that now blends hip-hop, Afrobeats, R&B, reggaet\u00f3n and electronic music. They\u2019re the sounds of Miami itself, vividly evoking the scenes of the city: driving past the clubs on Collins Avenue in Miami Beach or through bustling, artsy Wynwood on a busy weekend. \u201cSo much of the inspiration for this album was driving, listening to music, rolling the windows down and hearing what people in the city are listening to,\u201d Cabello says. \u201cThe voice she was using as a writer felt very much like the city itself,\u201d El Guincho adds. \u201cI thought it was a very interesting angle to have Camila represent her city strongly in a pop album context, which are usually very displaced and decentralized.\u201d Because the album was made almost entirely in Miami, Cabello says she looked at the city \u201cwith binoculars and extra-close attention. Sonically, it feels like it\u2019s a Miami art piece.\u201d For her palette, Cabello drew on a diverse group of collaborators to add unique colors, including Carti, Lil Nas X, The-Dream, fellow Floridians City Girls and BLP Kosher -\u2014 and, most notably, Drake. That much-discussed (and paparazzi-snapped) jet ski adventure Drake and Cabello took in the Turks and Caicos Islands last year? They were finishing up a track together. \u201cHe\u2019s the f\u2013king GOAT, so it felt like shooting for the stars,\u201d Cabello recalls of initially approaching the Canadian rapper by sliding into his Instagram DMs. \u201cI showed him the album when I felt comfortable enough and he really liked it. [The feature] came out of a nontransactional place. He had this idea of a song called \u2018Hot Uptown,\u2019 and it just felt like I was in the city. I was in Miami.\u201d The flirtatious, Caribbean-infused track (which until their Turks meetup was, according to Harris, the only album cut created with a remote collaborator) isn\u2019t Drake\u2019s only C,XOXO appearance. On the nearly two-minute-long interlude \u201cUuugly,\u201d sequenced immediately after \u201cHot Uptown,\u201d he sings over soft synth beats and Cabello\u2019s ghostly backing vocals. According to Harris, the interlude was Drake\u2019s idea: \u201cHe wanted to do one more thing for the album.\u201d \u201cWhy does he have his own song? Because selfishly, I just want to hear Drake on my own album,\u201d Cabello says with a laugh. \u201cI love that for me \u2014 it\u2019s like that rebellious mood. Who says I can\u2019t do that? It\u2019s Drake talking his sh-t.\u201d Another ballsy move for Cabello: This is the first time she has written all her lyrics and lyrical melodies for an album, taking full responsibility for the ideas and concepts behind them. \u201cShe\u2019s fast, curious, has great instincts for melody, is strong with her opinions but also open for them to be challenged. She\u2019s pretty much a freestyler with great first takes,\u201d El Guincho says. The producer \u201creally believed in me to take on the writing,\u201d Cabello says. \u201cThat felt good and important to me. It makes me feel different when the whole body of work is purer, my thoughts and my taste in words. I think that\u2019s why it sounds so cohesive, because it really feels like me.\u201d Today, at Pura Vida, Cabello pulls out her phone and opens a Pinterest board she created last fall. It has movie stills from Spring Breakers, girls wearing balaclava masks, long manicured nails, BMX bikes, photos of the city at night \u2014 all conjuring the quintessential DGAF Miami girl energy that Cabello telegraphs on the cover of C,XOXO, which features the sweaty-haired star with heavily mascaraed, just-out-the-club lashes, licking an electric blue lollipop, her tongue stained with its fluorescent color. \u201cShe had specific memories of Miami and growing up there,\u201d An says. \u201cShe described driving through the tunnels, with [their] very specific yellow lighting that you don\u2019t see anywhere else. She described a specific hue of blue at the beaches and was focused on blue hour. The blonde hair was also a big deal. The party culture. She spent a lot of time trying to get us to understand the visual world of Miami.\u201d As she honed the album\u2019s voice and vision, Cabello started dressing differently, always wearing lip gloss, fully embracing her bold new persona. \u201cIt was important for me on this album to feel that way,\u201d she explains. \u201cPop music is so uncomplicated \u2014 it\u2019s very one-toned. In a weird way, this album shows these chaotic, sometimes toxic scenarios, and I think we as humans are like that \u2014 we\u2019re messy, complicated, super twisted.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people that want you to be formulaic in this business,\u201d Gold says. \u201cThere\u2019s pressure in general to not rock the boat too much: If something isn\u2019t broken, don\u2019t fix it. Camila is not that type of artist.\u201d With C,XOXO finished, Cabello has some time to unwind and focus on herself. She finally started watching Breaking Bad; she\u2019s currently into cold plunges; and she\u2019s maximizing the time that she spends in chancletas (flip-flops). \u201cIt\u2019s when I feel the freest. I just want my toes to be free,\u201d she confesses with a smirk. \u201cI hate heels, I hate sneakers, I just want to be in chancletas all the time. This is actually the first time that I\u2019ve gone to an interview in chancletas, and I feel that this album has given me the permission to do that.\u201d C,XOXO also allowed her to embrace her personal relationships. Simply being able to hang out with her friends at home enriched the creative process, she says: \u201cThat energy of being with your friends and that girl gang vibe felt so sick to me.\u201d That vibe particularly comes through on \u201cDade County Dreaming,\u201d the final track she recorded for C,XOXO. Inspired by its namesake county, the collaboration with Miami hip-hop duo City Girls (who Cabello connected with through her sound engineer) captures the essence of both the album and who Cabello is today: a city girl herself, having fun and living life. The hard-hitting track \u2014 with its \u201990s freestyle undertones, haunting piano lines and geographic name drops \u2014 was, Cabello says, \u201cthe missing piece on the album [because] City Girls represent Miami so hard.\u201d Just weeks ahead of releasing C,XOXO, Cabello tells me she doesn\u2019t have any expectations. \u201cMany things can happen, and they are out of my control,\u201d she says. But she\u2019s ready to face the feedback with the clarity and maturity she has cultivated in the 12 years since her Fifth Harmony debut. \u201c[When I was starting out], I wish I knew that not everybody is going to like me, and it has nothing to do with me,\u201d she admits. \u201cThat affected me a lot in the beginning. When you\u2019re that young all you want is acceptance and love, and you can\u2019t understand when people don\u2019t like you. You take it so personally, and it makes you feel like you\u2019re doing something wrong. Once you get older, you realize that people\u2019s reactions have nothing to do with you, and you don\u2019t have to take it so personally and be affected by it. I\u2019m way more at peace with it today.\u201d On an ordinary day, she\u2019ll go to the beach, read a book, invite her friends to her condo in Sunny Isles for dinner, sip a Bacardi and sparkling water, put on a cute outfit and go dancing at Swan, a chic Euro-style spot in the luxurious Miami Design District, or Dirty Rabbit, an edgy Wynwood dance club. After a night out, she\u2019ll make a mandatory stop at the 24-hour Pinecrest Bakery for some croquetas. Even if she\u2019s tired, she pushes herself to go out and won\u2019t hold back from dancing with a cute guy if she feels a vibe. \u201cI\u2019m living the Sex and the City life, but Miami,\u201d she says with a laugh. But really, it\u2019s the C,XOXO life. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s about going out more, going to more parties and just being a bit more fearless and rebellious,\u201d she muses. \u201cBefore, I would go out and not care about what I looked like. If I felt kind of ugly, it was whatever \u2014 but now, I always want to feel pretty for myself. It\u2019s about really enjoying life, and I always think to myself, that\u2019s what sensuality is all about. It\u2019s a sensory thing: enjoying the food you eat, enjoying putting on a few outfits in the mirror, enjoying the senses of being alive. It\u2019s about taking in that baddie energy.\u201d This story will appear in the June 1, 2024, issue of Billboard.", "summary": "Inspired by the city she calls home, she's making a fearless, full-length creative statement on <em>C,XOXO</em>.", "url": "https://www.billboard.com/music/pop/camila-cabello-new-album-cover-story-1235693907/", "image": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/cover-camila-cabello-billboard-2024-bb8-erica-hernandez-3-1260.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 14:01:11", "author": "Jessica Roiz,Josh Glicksman", "authors": ["Jessica Roiz", "Josh Glicksman"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": 0.542}

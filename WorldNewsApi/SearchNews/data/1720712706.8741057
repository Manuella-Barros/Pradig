Ticket sales are down 26% from last year and more than 40% below pre-pandemic totals, according to Comscore. A big test comes next weekend with the release of Pixar\u2019s \u201cInside Out 2.\u201d After sending several Pixar releases straight to Disney+, the studio has vowed a lengthy, traditional theatrical rollout this time. Last weekend\u2019s top film \u201cThe Garfield Movie,\u201d slid to second place. Also from Sony, the family animated comedy collected $10 million in ticket sales over its third weekend, bringing its domestic gross to $68.6 million. The weekend\u2019s other new wide release, \u201cThe Watchers,\u201d failed to click with moviegoers. The horror film, directed by Ishana Night Shyamalan, daughter of M. Night Shyamalan, is about a stranded 28-year-old artist in Ireland. Following poor reviews, the Warner Bros. release grossed $7 million in 3,351 theaters. That allowed \u201cIf,\u201d the Ryan Reynolds imaginary friend fantasy, to grab third place in its fourth weekend of release, bringing the Paramount Pictures cumulative domestic total to $93.5 million. Rounding out the top five was \u201cKingdom of the Planet of the Apes,\u201d which added $5.4 million in its fifth weekend of release. It has grossed $150 million domestically and $360 million worldwide.", "summary": "NEW YORK (AP) &#8212; &#8220;Bad Boys: Ride or Die,&#8221; the fourth installment in the Will Smith-Martin Lawrence action comedy series, opened with an estimated $56 million in theaters over the weekend, handing Hollywood a much-needed summer hit and Smith his biggest success since he slapped Chris Rock at the Academy Awards.

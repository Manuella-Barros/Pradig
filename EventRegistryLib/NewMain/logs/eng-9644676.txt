Circuit to review their client's appeal and that Bannon should not be required to report to prison until all avenues of appeal have been exhausted.\n\nA prosecutor from the U.S. Attorney's Office for D.C., which sought to lift a stay of Bannon's sentence pending appeal, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday night.\n\nBannon was sentenced to four months in prison, the same sentence currently being served by former Trump adviser Peter Navarro.\n\nNavarro also battled to stay out of prison following his conviction on contempt of Congress charges.\n\nThe former Trump aide took his emergency appeal to the Supreme Court where it was rejected first by Chief Justice John Roberts and a second time by the full court.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rejected Bannon's appeal of those convictions in May.\n\nBannon's emergency filing Tuesday, to that same appeals court, preludes a likely Supreme Court filing over a rare contempt of Congress conviction. Bannon asked the appeals court to give an answer by June 18, and said he \"has retained experienced Supreme Court counsel.\"\n\nThe filing referred to Bannon's conviction as a \"landmark case\" for contempt of Congress, while also pointing out the \"political realities\" of him serving a prison sentence in the lead-up to the 2024 election.\n\n\"The government seeks to imprison Mr. Bannon for the four-month period leading up to the November election, when millions of Americans look to him for information on important campaign issues,\" the filing said.\n\nThe argument in the motion resembled some of former President Donald Trump's claims of \"election interference\" in the criminal probes against him.\n\nA federal jury convicted Bannon on two counts of contempt of Congress in 2022, following a weeklong trial.

Executive privilege is a legal doctrine that allows the president to keep secret certain information about his communications with close advisers.\n\nBannon argued in Tuesday's filing that unless he is allowed to remain free and pursue his appeal, \"future disagreements about subpoena compliance will be met not with negotiation -- but with indictments, especially when the White House changes political parties.\"\n\nIn May, a three-judge panel unanimously upheld Bannon's conviction, ruling that he could not rely on his then-attorney's advice that executive privilege allowed him to ignore the subpoena.\n\n...continued", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Contempt of Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Bannon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Bannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_District_of_Columbia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States District Court for the District of Columbia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_courts_of_appeals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States courts of appeals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_District_of_Columbia_Circuit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpoena", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Subpoena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "January 6 United States Capitol attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_privilege", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Executive privilege"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Racquetball/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Racquetball/Courts", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Life/Iterated_Prisoner_Dilemma", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Life/Iterated Prisoner Dilemma", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://resources.arcamax.com/newspics/293/29325/2932537.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9644676", "eventUri": "eng-9644676", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 354, "textEnd": 360}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 712, "textEnd": 719}], "sentiment": -0.3803921568627451, "wgt": 226, "relevance": 1}

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rejected Bannon's appeal of those convictions in May.\n\nBannon's emergency filing Tuesday, to that same appeals court, preludes a likely Supreme Court filing over a rare contempt of Congress conviction. Bannon asked the appeals court to give an answer by June 18, and said he \"has retained experienced Supreme Court counsel.\"\n\nThe filing referred to Bannon's conviction as a \"landmark case\" for contempt of Congress, while also pointing out the \"political realities\" of him serving a prison sentence in the lead-up to the 2024 election.\n\n\"The government seeks to imprison Mr. Bannon for the four-month period leading up to the November election, when millions of Americans look to him for information on important campaign issues,\" the filing said.\n\nThe argument in the motion resembled some of former President Donald Trump's claims of \"election interference\" in the criminal probes against him.\n\nA federal jury convicted Bannon on two counts of contempt of Congress in 2022, following a weeklong trial. Bannon had refused to cooperate with the House select panel investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, and ignored subpoenas seeking testimony and documents related to the attack.\n\nBannon argued at the time and with the appeals court that he had been advised by his attorney that the subpoena sought information that was protected by executive privilege. Executive privilege is a legal doctrine that allows the president to keep secret certain information about his communications with close advisers.\n\nBannon argued in Tuesday's filing that unless he is allowed to remain free and pursue his appeal, \"future disagreements about subpoena compliance will be met not with negotiation -- but with indictments, especially when the White House changes political parties.\"\n\nIn May, a three-judge panel unanimously upheld Bannon's conviction, ruling that he could not rely on his then-attorney's advice that executive privilege allowed him to ignore the subpoena.\n\nBannon, who co-founded Breitbart News and served as CEO of Trump's 2016 election campaign, last served in the White House in 2017.\n\nAfter receiving a subpoena from the House panel, Bannon did not produce any documents or appear for a deposition, claiming the information they sought was subject to executive privilege.\n\nNichols had allowed Bannon to remain free while the D.C. Circuit appeal was pending but ordered him to report to prison at a hearing last week.\n\nBannon was one of two witnesses who defied subpoenas from that panel who faced prosecutions for contempt of Congress.\n\nFormer Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro is currently serving a four-month prison term for his two convictions for contempt of Congress.\n\nEarlier this year, a different panel of the D.C. Circuit, as well as the Supreme Court, denied Navarro's effort to stay out of prison pending an appeal of his contempt of Congress convictions.\n\nThe trial judge in Navarro's case did not give Navarro a reprieve while he appealed to the D.C. Circuit, and Navarro's appeal is still pending before the appeals court.\n\n\u00a92024 CQ-Roll Call, Inc., All Rights Reserved. Visit cqrollcall.com.

Circuit, as well as the Supreme Court, denied Navarro's effort to stay out of prison pending an appeal of his contempt of Congress convictions.\n\nThe trial judge in Navarro's case did not give Navarro a reprieve while he appealed to the D.C.

But in a request for emergency relief to the U.S. court of appeals in Washington, the one-time White House chief strategist argued that he should be allowed to remain free as he mounts further appeals, including to the Supreme Court.\n\nBannon's conviction in 2022 stemmed from his refusal to comply with a subpoena from the then-House select committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. House investigators sought documents and testimony from Bannon about numerous issues, including his communications with Trump about efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nBannon argued at the time that he couldn't respond to the subpoena because of potential claims of executive privilege raised by Trump and said a lawyer for the former president indicated Trump had invoked executive privilege. Bannon was fired from his post as White House chief strategist in 2017 and was a private citizen at the time of the efforts to subvert the transfer of presidential power after the 2020 election.\n\nBefore the start of his trial, U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols, who presided over the proceedings, barred Bannon from presenting evidence or arguing he relied on advice of his one-time attorney when he refused to comply with the subpoena. A jury later found Bannon guilty on the two counts of contempt of Congress and Nichols sentenced him to four months in prison. The judge allowed Bannon to remain free while he pursued an appeal of his conviction.\n\nA three-judge panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld Bannon's conviction last month, finding in part that the advice-of-counsel defense Bannon sought to raise \"is no defense at all.\"\n\nThe judges said that Bannon didn't dispute that he deliberately refused to comply with the House select committee's subpoena, \"in that he knew what the subpoena required and intentionally did not respond; his nonresponse, in other words, was no accident.\"\n\nThe D.C. Circuit panel also rejected Bannon's claims that the subpoena was invalid.\n\nIn light of the panel's decision, Nichols revoked Bannon's bail and ordered him to surrender by July 1 to begin serving his prison sentence. The conservative commentator plans to ask the full slate of judges on the D.C. Circuit to rehear his case and could seek further relief from the Supreme Court.\n\nIn his request to remain free while he continues the appeals process, Bannon's lawyers wrote there are \"good reasons to believe\" the Supreme Court would be interested in reviewing his conviction.\n\n\"Further, the issue is important because under this court's caselaw, future disagreements about subpoena compliance will be met not with negotiation -- but with indictments, especially when the White House changes political parties,\" they told the D.C. Circuit in their emergency motion for release.\n\nBannon's legal team said that if their client is denied release, he will serve his prison sentence before the Supreme Court has a chance to consider a request to take up his appeal. The court's term is set to end by the end of June or early July, and its next term begins Oct. 7.\n\n\"There is also no denying the political realities here,\" Bannon's lawyers wrote, noting that he is a political commentator and campaign strategist who was prosecuted by the Biden administration. \"The government seeks to imprison Mr. Bannon for the four-month period leading up to the November election, when millions of Americans look to him for information on important campaign issues. This would also effectively bar Mr. Bannon from serving as a meaningful advisor in the ongoing national campaign.\"\n\nBannon's lawyers asked the D.C. Circuit to issue a ruling on his request to remain out of prison by June 18, which would allow them time to seek additional emergency relief from the Supreme Court if needed.\n\nBannon is the second former official from the Trump White House who was found guilty by a jury for contempt of Congress after defying a subpoena from the House select committee. Peter Navarro, who served as a top trade adviser to Trump, is serving a four-month prison sentence at a correctional facility in Miami after he was convicted on two counts of criminal contempt last year.\n\nNavarro is also appealing his conviction and asked the Supreme Court to allow him to remain free during the additional proceedings. But his bid was rejected first by Chief Justice John Roberts and then by the full court.", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Earlier this month, U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols in Washington agreed to the Justice Department's request to require that Bannon report to prison on July 1 after a federal appeals court panel in May upheld his contempt of Congress conviction.\n\n\"There is also no denying the political realities here. Mr. Bannon is a high-profile political commentator and campaign strategist. He was prosecuted by an administration whose policies are a frequent target of Mr. Bannon's public statements,\" the motion says. \"The government seeks to imprison Mr. Bannon for the four-month period leading up to the November election, when millions of Americans look to him for information on important campaign issues. This would also effectively bar Mr. Bannon from serving as a meaningful advisor in the ongoing national campaign.\"\n\n\"This is a landmark case. The prosecution pursued a novel and aggressive theory of liability, and the case garnered international attention,\" Bannon's lawyer, R. Trent McCotter, wrote. \"If the panel decision stands, there will be far-reaching consequences, including separation-of-powers concerns. Before the prosecution of Mr. Bannon, it had been 50 years since the government convinced a jury to convict someone for not adequately responding to a congressional subpoena -- and there has certainly been no shortage of disputes over congressional subpoenas during that time.\"\n\nJUDGE ORDERS STEVE BANNON TO REPORT TO PRISON\n\nBannon was convicted nearly two years ago of two counts of contempt of Congress: one for refusing to sit for a deposition with the Jan. 6 House Committee and the other for refusing to provide documents related to his involvement in Trump's efforts to have the 2020 presidential election results showing a victory for President Biden overturned.\n\nNichols, nominated by Trump to the bench in 2018, had initially allowed Bannon to remain free while he fought his conviction because the judge believed the case raised substantial legal questions. However, during a hearing in Washington's federal court, Nichols said the calculus changed after a three-judge District of Columbia appeals court panel said all of Bannon's challenges lack merit.\n\nThe motion Tuesday comes after Trump was convicted on 34 felony charges in his New York City hush money trial and faces a sentencing hearing next month just four days before the Republican National Convention, where the GOP will likely declare him their official 2024 presidential nominee.\n\nBannon \"intends to vigorously pursue his remaining appeals in this case and has retained experienced Supreme Court counsel,\" his lawyers wrote Tuesday, asking the court to allow him to remain on release given there is \"no dispute that Mr. Bannon 'is not likely to flee or pose a danger to the safety of any other person or the community if released' -- indeed, he has been out on release for years now without incident, and his 'crime' was non-violent.\"\n\nHOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE INVESTIGATES 'MANIPULATED' EVIDENCE SEIZED BY FBI IN TRUMP CLASSIFIED RECORDS PROBE\n\n\"Mr. Bannon faced what the Court has described as a novel scenario: Congress was pursuing documents and testimony from a former executive branch official, yet counsel for the former President himself required Mr. Bannon to protect executive privilege in responding to the subpoena,\" the motion says. \"Mr. Bannon followed the advice of his counsel and requested that the Committee resolve the privilege issues with the holder of that privilege, or have the matter resolved in a civil suit.\"\n\nBannon's lawyer at trial argued that the former adviser did not ignore the subpoena, but was still engaged in good-faith negotiations with the congressional committee when he was charged.\n\nThe defense has said Bannon had been acting on the advice of his attorney at the time, who told him that the subpoena was invalid because the committee would not allow a Trump lawyer in the room and that Bannon could not determine what documents or testimony he could provide because Trump asserted executive privilege.\n\nDefense lawyer David Schoen told the judge it would be unfair to send Bannon to prison now because he would complete his entire sentence before he exhausted his appeals. Schoen said the case raises \"serious constitutional issues\" that need to be examined by the Supreme Court.\n\n\"In this country, we don't send anyone to prison if they believe that they were doing something that complied with the law,\" he told reporters.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nA second Trump aide, trade adviser Peter Navarro, was also convicted of contempt of Congress. He reported to prison in March to serve his four-month sentence.\n\nBannon is also facing criminal charges in New York state court alleging he duped donors who gave money to build a wall along the U.S. southern border. Bannon has pleaded not guilty to money laundering, conspiracy, fraud and other charges, and that trial has been postponed until at least the end of September.", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com",

But a three-judge panel of the D.C. Circuit last month upheld Bannon's conviction, prompting the trial judge who presided over his case, Trump-appointee Carl Nichols, to set a date for him to begin serving his sentence. Nichols said the \"original basis\" for his stay of Bannon's sentence no longer applied after the court declined to overturn his conviction.\n\nIn the 36-page filing, obtained by NBC News, Bannon's legal team warned of \"far-reaching consequences\" if their client is not allowed to remain free.\n\n\"The government seeks to imprison Mr. Bannon for the four-month period leading up to the November election, when millions of Americans look to him for information on important campaign issues,\" attorney Trent McCotter wrote. \"This would also effectively bar Mr. Bannon from serving as a meaningful advisor in the ongoing national campaign.\"\n\nBannon is seeking a ruling on this request by June 18, just two weeks before his prison sentence is set to begin, emphasizing that his team is ready to take the ruling all the way to the Supreme Court.\n\nIn a recent interview with Tucker Carlson, the staunch Trump ally said serving time in prison would be just yet another way he has served his country.\n\n\"In my 20s I served my country on a Navy destroyer, and in my 70s I'll serve my country in a federal prison,\" he said. \"It doesn't make any difference to me. It won't change my life in one way.\"\n\n\"If I have to be a political prisoner, I'll be a political prisoner,\" Bannon added. \"I don't bat one eye.

Donald Trump's former chief strategist is due to report to prison authorities on July 1, after a ruling in his case last week.\n\nBut he launched an 11th hour attempt to stave off his four-month statement by asking the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to overrule that order. In an emergency 36-page motion, his legal team argues that imprisonment would prevent him working on the election.\n\n'The government seeks to imprison Mr. Bannon for the four-month period leading up to the November election, when millions of Americans look to him for information on important campaign issues,' wrote Trent McCotter, one of Bannon's lawyers. 'This would also effectively bar Mr. Bannon from serving as a meaningful adviser in the ongoing national campaign.'\n\nBannon was sentenced to four months in prison after a jury in 2022 found him guilty on two counts of contempt of Congress for declining to appear before the House investigation into the Jan. 6 attack and for refusing to hand over documents. However trial judge Carl Nichols allowed him to remain free as he appealed the conviction.\n\nThat changed a week ago after a higher court rejected Bannon's appeal. Nichols said he did not believe that the 'original basis' for his stay of the sentence existed any longer. However, that did not exhaust Bannon's avenues for appeal. And his lawyers have asked for a decision by June 18, so that they can take the case to the Supreme Court if necessary. 'This is a landmark case. The prosecution pursued a novel and aggressive theory of liability, and the case garnered international attention,' wrote McCotter.\n\n'If the panel decision stands, there will be far-reaching consequences, including separation-of-powers concerns. 'Before the prosecution of Mr. Bannon, it had been 50 years since the government convinced a jury to convict someone for not adequately responding to a congressional subpoena -- and there has certainly been no shortage of disputes over congressional subpoenas during that time.'\n\nAnother former Trump aide, economic advisor Peter Navarro, is currently serving a four-month sentence in a Florida prison after being convicted of similar charges. Navarro helped promote a plan he dubbed the 'Green Bay Sweep' that became part of Trump's election overturn effort. Bannon has raised a defense of counsel defense saying he relied on a lawyer's advice when failing to comply with a congressional subpoena. Trump also tried to muster such an argument, citing advice by Michael Cohen in the Stormy Daniels payoff.\n\nBannon helped helm meetings at a strategy 'war room' at the Willard Hotel in Washington that brought together key figures in the election overturn effort. 'I've got great lawyers, and we're going to go all the way to the Supreme Court if we have to,' Bannon said outside court last week after being ordered to prison.\n\n'There's nothing that can shut me up and nothing that will shut me up.

The jury took less than three hours to deliberate. Before trial, U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols barred Bannon's anticipated defenses at trial, largely finding them irrelevant to the charges.\n\nThe inability to mount his defense as he saw fit is what Bannon intends to raise before the nation's high court should he get that far.\n\nBannon has long maintained that his defiance of the subpoenas issued by the since-defunct House Select Committee to Investigate the Jan. 6 Attack on the U.S. Capitol was on advice of counsel.\n\nThe defendant says he was instructed by his lawyer to wait for a higher court's ruling on executive privilege issues because the information requested by the committee concerned his work as \"a former executive branch official\" serving under the 45th president.\n\n\"He could not inform the jury about what actually happened -- i.e., that he relied in good faith on his lawyer's advice and believed his actions were in compliance with the law -- even though this allowed the government to argue with impunity to the jury that Mr. Bannon had 'ignore[d]' the subpoena and 'thumb[ed] his nose' at the Select Committee,\" the Tuesday motion argues.\n\nNotably, this line of attack essentially reprises arguments that have squarely and repeatedly found no favor in the court system so far.\n\nBut Bannon thinks the Supreme Court might be different.\n\nIn denying the defendant his preferred defense, Nichols, a Trump appointee, said he was bound by precedent that defined the term \"willfully\" in the contempt of Congress statute as \"intentionally.\"\n\nIn early May, a three-judge panel on the D.C. Court of Appeals endorsed Nichols' understanding of the \"willfully\" precedent -- setting the stage for prosecutors to finally request lifting the stay of Bannon's sentence, which the lower court obliged.\n\nThe appeal of the district court's ruling is fashioned as a motion for release pending appeal -- not a stay of the lower court's order -- because of the lower legal standard required to obtain such relief.\n\n\"Mr. Bannon 'shall' be released if his case 'raises a substantial question of law or fact,' that, if successful, would result in reversal, a shorter sentence, or a new trial,\" the motion argues. \"Critically, this is not the same standard for obtaining a stay. Mr. Bannon is not required to show he is likely to succeed on that issue or that there has been reversible error.\"\n\nBannon telegraphs the heart of his eventual high court appeal:\n\n[This] interpretation of \"willfully\" is in significant tension with recent Supreme Court precedent and canons of construction. As the panel acknowledged, the Supreme Court has now held that the \"'general' rule\" is that \"willfully\" means \"'knowledge that his conduct was unlawful,'\" which strongly favors Mr. Bannon. But the panel felt obliged to disregard the Supreme Court's \"'general' rule\" because [the precedent relied on by the lower court] remained binding in this Circuit. The Supreme Court itself will have no such obstacle, however.\n\nThe motion goes on to argue that the standard does not require a defendant to argue the Supreme Court would be interested. Still, Bannon notes, the nation's highest court has taken up \"no less than nineteen cases\" on the contempt statute \"over the years.\"\n\nBannon ventures some guesses as to why the Supreme Court is so interested in the meaning of the statute: \"likely out of concern about its aggressive use as a political bludgeon\" and \"because under this Court's caselaw, future disagreements about subpoena compliance will be met not with negotiation -- but with indictments, especially when the White House changes political parties.\"\n\nBannon's arguments are clearly keyed toward an audience where mixing the legal and the political is the daily order of business.

Whatever it takes to win this revolution, we got to do.\"\n\nIn May, David Schoen, Bannon's attorney, issued a response to the appeals court upholding the contempt conviction and described the decision as \"wrong\" and reflecting a \"very dangerous view of the threshold for criminal liability for any defendant.\"\n\nAfter joining the Trump administration as a chief strategist, Bannon left in August 2017 and later rejoined Breitbart News until his departure in early 2018.\n\nBannon continued to explain that this was a \"war to the knife,\" adding that he had \"to win this.\"\n\n\"I understand what's going on here, as you do. This is an illegitimate regime of Neo-Marxists -- from the Justice Department to the FBI, the Wall Street Crowd,\" Bannon said. \"You can see this everywhere in our society, the attacks on the family, and they play for keeps.\"\n\nBannon continued:\n\nAnd I'm so glad that the Alex Joneses, and the Tucker Carlsons, and, particularly, since you've had the opportunity to leave Fox, ourselves, and so many others, now understand that this is a war to the knife, right? We have to win this. If we don't win this, this country's going to devolve into some kind of Neo-Marxist totalitarian regime, of which it's pretty far down the road right now.\n\n\"That's why I don't fear going to prison. I know it's going to take my voice off the...the war is still going to go on, and I keep saying, 'It's next man up. You can't lean on Trump. You can't lean on Tucker. You can't lean on Bannon. You can't lean on Alex Jones,'\" he concluded.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "elizabeth_weibel@breitbart.com", "name": "Elizabeth

It doesn't make any difference to me. It won't change my life in one way.\" But apparently, it actually does matter to him, because last night he made a last-ditch attempt to stay out of the big house.\n\nIn an emergency motion filed Tuesday, Bannon, who was sentenced to time behind bars for contempt of Congress, asked a federal appeals court to let him remain free while he appeals his criminal conviction. Why does he think the court should grant him such a reprieve? Because he's trying to help reelect Donald Trump, and also because he has a podcast that his listeners simply cannot be deprived of. \"The government seeks to imprison Mr. Bannon for the four-month period leading up to the November election, when millions of Americans look to him for information on important campaign issues,\" attorney Trent McCotter wrote in the filing. \"This would also effectively bar Mr. Bannon from serving as a meaningful advisor in the ongoing national campaign.\"\n\nBannon hosts a show called War Room, where, among other things, he has called for beheading top government officials and famously told listeners, on January 5, 2021, \"We're on the point of attack\" and \"All hell will break loose tomorrow.\" In a text message to NBC News after a judge ordered him to surrender on July 1, he wrote: \"Who says I'm reporting! WarRoom can not and will not be silenced.\" He added that the show's regular schedule would continue, saying: \"4 hours a day 5 days a week and two on Saturday.... The WarRoom is a military command center for MAGA -- can't stop and won't until we achieve final victory.\"\n\nBannon was actually sentenced to prison all the way back in 2022, but was allowed to remain free pending appeal of his conviction; last month, a three-judge panel of a federal appeals court upheld his guilty conviction.

He told Tucker Carlson that he feels his prison sentence is an opportunity to \"save his country.\"\n\n\"In my twenties I served my country on a Navy destroyer, and in my seventies I'll serve my country in a federal prison. It doesn't make any difference to me. It won't change my life in one way,\" Bannon said in a Tuesday interview with Carlson.\n\nBannon was convicted in federal court in October 2022 on two counts of contempt after refusing to provide testimony or paperwork to the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. Last week, Bannon was ordered by the court to report to prison July 1 for his four-month sentence, following his appeals failing. Bannon said that he remains dedicated to the task of saving his country, no matter the cost.\n\n\"If I have to be a political prisoner, I'll be a political prisoner,\" he told Carlson. \"I don't bat one eye. Whatever it takes to win this revolution, we've got to do.\"\n\nBannon argued in court that Trump exercising executive privilege protected him from disclosing documents and providing testimony for the House committee. Executive privilege is the legal doctrine permitting the president to withhold information from the public under certain circumstances. Bannon took issue with the three-judge panel's unanimous ruling stating that he could not rely on executive privilege, as well as the structure of the House Committee itself.\n\n\"Regardless of what it costs, I'm prepared to go to the Supreme Court on the executive privilege,\" Bannon said, emphasizing that he pays his legal fees completely out of pocket and hasn't sought outside funds. \"The most important [issue] to me still is the structure of this committee -- was it a legitimate committee?\"\n\nIn an emergency filing Tuesday, Bannon and his team requested for his prison start date to be dropped so that he can \"vigorously pursue his remaining appeals.\" Bannon is seeking a ruling on this request by June 18, just two weeks before his prison sentence is set to begin. He again emphasized that his team is ready to take the ruling all the way to the Supreme Court.\n\n\"We're being oppressed by an illegitimate regime that usurped power here, and that's what we have to break,\" Bannon stressed to Carlson. \"Our country are the guys that listen to you and support you.\"\n\nWatch the full interview with Steve Bannon in the video at the top of this story.", "source": {"uri": "thewrap.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TheWrap"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tess_patton@thewrap.com", "name": "Tess Patton", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucker_Carlson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tucker Carlson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpoena", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Subpoena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_privilege", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Executive privilege"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_prisoner", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political prisoner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "January 6 United States Capitol attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Bannon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steve Bannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal judiciary of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legitimacy_(family_law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Legitimacy (family law)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Organizations/Committees", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Organizations/Committees", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Life/Iterated_Prisoner_Dilemma", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Life/Iterated Prisoner Dilemma", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/CleanShot-2024-06-11-at-21.07.53@2x.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9644676", "eventUri": "eng-9644676", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 91, "textEnd": 97, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "-01-06", "textStart": 132, "textEnd": 138, "freq": 3}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 2275, "textEnd": 2282}], "sentiment": -0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

(Gage Skidmore/Flickr)\n\nSteve Bannon, the convicted criminal podcaster and ally of former President Donald Trump, apparently believes that his legal plight is important enough to be taken up by the United States Supreme Court.\n\nAs reported by CBS News' Scott MacFarlane, Bannon filed an emergency appeal asking the courts to halt his prison sentence, and it claimed that Bannon \"has retained experienced Supreme Court counsel\" to argue his case before the nation's highest court.\n\nBannon was convicted back in 2022 on charges of criminal contempt of Congress for completely refusing to comply with subpoenas issued by the House Select Committee investigating the January 6th riots at the United States Capitol building.\n\nIn the emergency appeal, Bannon argued that his prosecution was so unfair that it rose to the level of a constitutional crisis.\n\nALSO READ: Michael Cohen, Red Finch and the fateful moment Trump lost the jury\n\n\"This is a landmark case,\" the appeal states. \"The prosecution pursued a novel and aggressive theory of liability, and the case garnered international attention. If the panel decision stands, there will be far-reaching consequences, including separation-of-powers concerns. Before the prosecution of Mr. Bannon, it had been 50 years since the government convinced a jury to convict someone for not adequately responding to a congressional subpoena -- and there has certainly been no shortage of disputes over congressional subpoenas during that time.\"\n\nIn reality, there was not merely a dispute about Bannon's response to the subpoena, as he flatly refused to cooperate with the committee in any shape or form.\n\nA Trump-appointed judge earlier this month ordered Bannon to report to prison on July 1st, and Bannon responded by going on an angry tirade against the American justice system.\n\n\"There's nothing that can shut me up and nothing that will shut me up,\" he said at the time. \"There's not a prison built or a jail built that will ever shut me up.\"", "source": {"uri": "rawstory.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Raw Story"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Bannon", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Steve Bannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Political_Action_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Conservative Political Action Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Cohen_(lawyer)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Cohen (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpoena", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Subpoena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Constitutional crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Contempt of court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Contempt of Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Separation of powers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Prisons", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Life/Iterated_Prisoner_Dilemma", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Life/Iterated Prisoner Dilemma", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://www.rawstory.com/media-library/steve-bannon.jpg?id=28180056&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C30%2C0%2C31", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9644676", "eventUri": "eng-9644676", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-06", "textStart": 739, "textEnd": 750}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 1800, "textEnd": 1808}], "sentiment": -0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

As he seeks to appeal it, he made an appearance on former Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson's show on X, during which he explained why he is not afraid of doing prison time.\n\n\"In my 20s, I spent almost four years on a Navy destroyer in the North-Arabian Sea, Persian Gulf, Western Pacific, South China Sea,\" Bannon said. \"So in my 20s, I served my country on a Navy destroyer, and in my 70s, I'll serve my country in a federal prison. It doesn't make any difference for me, it won't change my life one way. I don't have a big social agenda. I'm dedicated to this work of saving my country, and if I have to be a political prisoner, I'll be a political prisoner.\n\nWhen asked how he will spend his prison time, Bannon explained he does a variety of \"spiritual exercises\" from the Catholic Church. He also stated that he reads a lot and tries to study everything he can that catches his curiosity.\n\nBannon also said he intends to stay in contact with his team as much as he can within prison regulations stating he will be \"fully occupied\" while doing time.\n\n\"I'm proud to work 18 hours a day, I have nothing else in my life going on except this, so it won't stop, and we'll just continue to press on,\" Bannon said. \"I've told my team there can't be one drop in quality. There can't be one drop in audience participation or impact, so it's on my team to do and I'll hopefully be in communication with those guys, but I'm very confident.

Trent McCotter submitted the filing to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals requesting his client's release before a July 1 deadline to surrender himself and serve a four-month sentence.\n\n\"If the panel decision stands, there will be far-reaching consequences, including separation-of-powers concerns,\" wrote McCotter and other attorneys from DC firm Boyden Gray PLLC representing Bannon, 70.\n\n\"Before the prosecution of Mr. Bannon, it had been 50 years since the government convinced a jury to convict someone for not adequately responding to a congressional subpoena -- and there has certainly been no shortage of disputes over congressional subpoenas during that time,\" they said.\n\nBannon's defense team also claimed prosecutors \"pursued a novel and aggressive theory of liability\" and suggested they may appeal the decision to the US Supreme Court.\n\nThe lawyers asked for a ruling from the DC appeals court by June 18.\n\nLast month, a three-judge panel upheld Bannon's July 2022 conviction on two counts of contempt of Congress for rejecting a subpoena to testify before the House Select January 6th Committee.\n\nDC US District Judge Carl Nichols on Thursday ordered the Trump ally to serve his jail sentence a little more than a week before his former boss will be sentenced after a Manhattan jury convicted him on 34 counts of business fraud for hiding evidence of a hush money payment to a porn star before the 2016 election.\n\nFormer Trump White House trade adviser Peter Navarro filed a similar last-ditch motion to avoid jail in March after he was also convicted of defying a subpoena from the January 6th select committee.\n\nNavarro, 74, surrendered himself at a federal prison in Miami days after the motion, telling reporters he would \"proudly\" serve a four-month sentence.\n\nTrump and Bannon have had a tumultuous relationship -- with the former president having fired the strategist early in August 2017 -- but the two later reconciled and both trumpeted allegations that the 2020 election was stolen.\n\nTrump, 77, pardoned Bannon just before leaving office on Jan. 20, 2021, for federal fraud and money laundering charges related to a private fundraiser his ex-chief strategist held, ostensibly to fund construction of the US-Mexico border wall.\n\nThat case had been slated for trial in May 2021.\n\nAttorneys for Bannon

He shouldn't count on succeeding in the long-shot effort, but one never knows what the Supreme Court will do.\n\nHe's hoping for a different outcome than fellow former Donald Trump adviser Peter Navarro, who recently lost a similar bid that he took all the way up to the high court. Like Bannon, Navarro was convicted of congressional contempt for blowing off the House Jan. 6 committee and received a four-month sentence.\n\nThe justices gave Navarro no relief, and he's currently serving his time. Bannon may soon meet the same fate and have to begin serving his sentence as ordered July 1.\n\nWhen Navarro filed his emergency Supreme Court application in March, it went to Chief Justice John Roberts, who covers such requests from Washington (the country's geographical regions are divided among the justices). Notably, Roberts didn't refer the application to the full court as might usually happen; rather, the chief took the unusual step of writing an opinion himself rejecting Navarro. That effectively ended Navarro's bid, but the defendant tried to shop it to another justice, Neil Gorsuch, who referred it to the full court, which definitively denied it in April without further comment.\n\nIn his emergency motion Tuesday to Washington's federal appeals court, Bannon's lawyers tried to cite Roberts' rejection of Navarro in his own favor to keep him out while his appeal is pending. \"If the underlying merits presented by Dr. Navarro were of no interest or substantiality, presumably Chief Justice Roberts would simply have denied the request without explanation,\" they wrote, adding that Roberts noted procedural issues with Navarro's claim for emergency relief that Bannon's lawyers say aren't present in his.\n\nIt's true that it was unusual for Roberts to write an opinion in Navarro's case, even if it was only to reject him. But whatever distinction Bannon has in his favor, the fact remains that the full court rejected Navarro without comment, and Bannon has a high bar to clear if he wants to stay out pending appeal.\n\nWhat's at issue now isn't the appeal of the conviction itself but rather whether Bannon can remain free while it's resolved. The justices can eventually take up the merits of Bannon's case, just as they can in Navarro's pending appeal. Like Navarro did (to no avail), Bannon points out that he'd finish serving his sentence before his underlying appeal is resolved. That's a logical point, but it's a reality of the system that didn't help Navarro and won't, on its own, save Bannon.\n\nWe'll know soon enough whether the justices will keep Bannon free. His lawyers have asked the appeals court to rule by June 18 so that he can seek relief from the Supreme Court if needed. It probably will be.\n\nBannon also cited the \"political realities,\" including that locking him up now would bar him \"from serving as a meaningful advisor in the ongoing national campaign.\" But politics won't be enough to save him, either. If anything, it reinforces that he'd be rewarded for his chosen pursuits in service of Trump.\n\nOf course, the Supreme Court's handling of Trump's immunity appeal has been a boon to the former president and presumptive GOP nominee, with every day it goes undecided reducing the likelihood of a pre-election trial in the federal election interference case. If the Roberts Court chooses to help Bannon, the political realities will be clear there, too.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Navarro_(Spanish_footballer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fernando Navarro (Spanish footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Roberts", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Roberts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Bannon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Bannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Contempt of Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Navarro", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peter Navarro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Gorsuch", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Neil Gorsuch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_courts_of_appeals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States courts of appeals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_immunity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sovereign immunity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Trials", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Racquetball/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Racquetball/Courts", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/5Dhg79ZHCQA0lHk_idysfQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/msnbc_articles_593/d0381fded07c9e7d744f88f4e70e6de4", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9644676", "eventUri": "eng-9644676", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-06", "textStart": 463, "textEnd": 469}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 676, "textEnd": 682}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 2728, "textEnd": 2735}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

That's binding precedent, right?\n\nSteve Bannon would like to stay out of jail, please.\n\nIn July of 2022, the putrefying podcaster was convicted on two counts of contempt of Congress after he defied subpoenas for documents and testimony from the January 6 Select Committee. Judge Carl Nichols stayed the four-month sentence pending appeal, finding that review was \"not taken for the purpose of delay but rather raises a substantial question of law that is likely to result in a reversal or an order for a new trial.\"\n\nThe trial court expressed skepticism about the prevailing circuit precedent, a 1961 case called Licavoli v. US, excluding advice of counsel as a defense to a contempt of Congress charge. But the DC Circuit declined the invitation to overrule Licavoli.\n\n\"As both this court and the Supreme Court have repeatedly explained, a contrary rule would contravene the text of the contempt statute and hamstring Congress's investigatory authority,\" Judge Brad Garcia wrote for the unanimous panel on May 10. \"Because we have no basis to depart from that binding precedent, and because none of Bannon's other challenges to his convictions have merit, we affirm.\"\n\nJudge Nichols duly ordered Bannon to report to the Bureau of Prisons by July 1. But Ol' Three Shirts isn't giving up just yet.\n\nLast night his attorney, Trent McCotter of Boydon Gray in DC, docketed an emergency motion for release pending appeal. And while it lacks the screeching indignation of Bannon's earlier filings, which were signed by attorneys Evan Corcoran, David Schoen, and Robert Costello, it does stay true to the podcaster's signature brand of confidently stating absolute bullshit as if it were scientific fact.\n\nThe main conceit of this motion is that the DC Circuit must attempt to read the minds of Supreme Court justices, and guide itself accordingly. Bannon insists that SCOTUS is just champing at the bit to kneecap Congress's ability to compel witnesses by changing the meaning of the word \"willfully\" as it is now understood in light of Licavoli.\n\n\"The Supreme Court has demonstrated an exceedingly strong interest in interpreting [2 USC] \u00a7 192. That Court has granted review in no less than nineteen cases involving various aspects of that statute, despite its brevity,\" he writes, dropping to a footnote which includes a list of those cases, the most recent of which is from 1966 -- hardly a sign that the mens rea requirement under \u00a7 192 is top of the justices' minds.\n\nBannon goes on to suggest that the Chief Justice's refusal to hear Peter Navarro's identical request is actually proof that the Court very much does want to hear it.\n\n\"Chief Justice Roberts took the highly unusual step of issuing an in-chambers decision -- the first in many years issued by a Justice -- to explain that he was denying the request only because of procedural concerns specific to Dr. Navarro's case, which were 'distinct from his pending appeal on the merits,\" Bannon writes, \"If the underlying merits presented by Dr. Navarro were of no interest or substantiality, presumably Chief Justice Roberts would simply have denied the request without explanation, as frequently occurs.\"\n\nO RLLY?\n\nJustice Roberts sparing his colleagues the trouble of having to look at Navarro's \"please don't put me in jail\" petition is proof that they're super interested in overruling Licavoli? Even assuming that this were a permissible inference, it would be rather undercut by what happened next.\n\nAside from this selective reading of the SCOTUS tea leaves, Bannon's lawyers also argue that forcing him to go to jail during the election will have national implications:\n\nThere is also no denying the political realities here. Mr. Bannon is a high-profile political commentator and campaign strategist. He was prosecuted by an administration whose policies are a frequent target of Mr. Bannon's public statements. The government seeks to imprison Mr. Bannon for the four-month period leading up to the November election, when millions of Americans look to him for information on important campaign issues. This would also effectively bar Mr. Bannon from serving as a meaningful advisor in the ongoing national campaign.\n\nHowever will the MAGA faithful survive without Steve Bannon's hate mongering podcast? Please, your honors, keep this godly main out of the pokey long enough that Trump can get back to the White House and pardon him again.\n\nBannon exhorts the panel to work with haste, rendering a ruling by June 18 so that he can take a flyer at Chief Justice Roberts if and when he loses. And then maybe at Justice Gorsuch, too, although considering recent revelations, Justice Alito would be a better bet.", "source": {"uri": "abovethelaw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Above the

He shouldn't count on succeeding in the long-shot effort, but one never knows what the Supreme Court will do.\n\nHe's hoping for a different outcome than fellow former Donald Trump adviser Peter Navarro, who recently lost a similar bid that he took all the way up to the high court. Like Bannon, Navarro was convicted of congressional contempt for blowing off the House Jan. 6 committee and received a four-month sentence.\n\nThe justices gave Navarro no relief, and he's currently serving his time. Bannon may soon meet the same fate and have to begin serving his sentence as ordered July 1.\n\nWhen Navarro filed his emergency Supreme Court application in March, it went to Chief Justice John Roberts, who covers such requests from Washington (the country's geographical regions are divided among the justices). Notably, Roberts didn't refer the application to the full court as might usually happen; rather, the chief took the unusual step of writing an opinion himself rejecting Navarro. That effectively ended Navarro's bid, but the defendant tried to shop it to another justice, Neil Gorsuch, who referred it to the full court, which definitively denied it in April without further comment.\n\nIn his emergency motion Tuesday to Washington's federal appeals court, Bannon's lawyers tried to cite Roberts' rejection of Navarro in his own favor to keep him out while his appeal is pending. \"If the underlying merits presented by Dr. Navarro were of no interest or substantiality, presumably Chief Justice Roberts would simply have denied the request without explanation,\" they wrote, adding that Roberts noted procedural issues with Navarro's claim for emergency relief that Bannon's lawyers say aren't present in his.\n\nIt's true that it was unusual for Roberts to write an opinion in Navarro's case, even if it was only to reject him. But whatever distinction Bannon has in his favor, the fact remains that the full court rejected Navarro without comment, and Bannon has a high bar to clear if he wants to stay out pending appeal.\n\nWhat's at issue now isn't the appeal of the conviction itself but rather whether Bannon can remain free while it's resolved. The justices can eventually take up the merits of Bannon's case, just as they can in Navarro's pending appeal. Like Navarro did (to no avail), Bannon points out that he'd finish serving his sentence before his underlying appeal is resolved. That's a logical point, but it's a reality of the system that didn't help Navarro and won't, on its own, save Bannon.\n\nWe'll know soon enough whether the justices will keep Bannon free. His lawyers have asked the appeals court to rule by June 18 so that he can seek relief from the Supreme Court if needed. It probably will be.\n\nBannon also cited the \"political realities,\" including that locking him up now would bar him \"from serving as a meaningful advisor in the ongoing national campaign.\" But politics won't be enough to save him, either. If anything, it reinforces that he'd be rewarded for his chosen pursuits in service of Trump.\n\nOf course, the Supreme Court's handling of Trump's immunity appeal has been a boon to the former president and presumptive GOP nominee, with every day it goes undecided reducing the likelihood of a pre-election trial in the federal election interference case. If the Roberts Court chooses to help Bannon, the political realities will be clear there, too.", "source": {"uri": "msnbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MSNBC.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Navarro_(Spanish_footballer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fernando Navarro (Spanish footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Navarro", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Peter Navarro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Roberts", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Roberts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Bannon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Bannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Contempt of Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Gorsuch", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Neil Gorsuch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_courts_of_appeals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States courts of appeals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Defendant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_immunity", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sovereign immunity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_fraud", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electoral fraud"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Organizations", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Racquetball/Courts", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Racquetball/Courts", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bocce", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-06/240612-Steve-Bannon-al-0911-015835.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9644676", "eventUri": "eng-9644676", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-06", "textStart": 622, "textEnd": 628}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-01", "textStart": 835, "textEnd": 841}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-18", "textStart": 2887, "textEnd": 2894}], "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

That hasn't stopped the media from reporting on Steve Bannon's conviction for refusing to comply with a subpoena issued by the House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack in 2021.\n\nBannon gave the committee the finger and is hardly the first person to do it. Peter Navarro, another Trump official, was also convicted of \"contempt of Congress\" and sentenced to four months in jail; Bannon got slapped with the same amount of time behind bars. Yet, progressive reporter Glenn Greenwald torched the convictions, noting how the Biden Justice Department has gone outside the mainstream with these referrals. He even dredged up past instances where such referrals were submitted and rejected during the Bush years.\n\n\"You'd be hard-pressed to find another case where people explicitly were held in contempt of congressional subpoenas but who were referred to the Justice Department and/or then prosecuted by the Justice Department for it,\" said Greenwald. He detailed the partisan roots of these referrals, which were submitted by the J6 Committee - essentially a Democrat witch hunt. At the time, Speaker Nancy Pelosi rejected the Republicans tapped to serve on the committee, which led to no Republicans sitting on it in protest. Former Reps. Liz Cheney (R-WY) and Adam Kinzinger (R-IL) served, but even Greenwald noted these two were essentially Democrats on this matter. If Democrats wanted to flex their muscles now that the DOJ was back under their control, these referrals presented an opportunity to do so with impunity:\n\nBannon knew this would be a circus and a waste of time. As we know, the last thing this committee was focused on was finding the truth. When Republicans retook the House, lo and behold, nothing was adequately cataloged, and all communications with the Biden White House were erased from the record. It sort of undercuts the Democrats' narrative about how this was the most egregious attack on the republic since 9/11, right? You'd think with such bold statements, all the evidence would be cataloged. It wasn't.\n\nThe media is hoping that the loss of Bannon could help Biden's chances, with NBC News framing it as a loss of a key voice:\n\n...a judge told Bannon he's going to jail.\n\nThe development could silence someone in the final months of the presidential election who has served as an inspiration for much of the MAGA movement and been one of Trump's most aggressive zealots -- thanks in large part to his \"War Room\" show, which he has built to lead the grassroots of the Republican Party to the ballot box in November.\n\nNBC News spent months tracking Bannon's show, which streams on Rumble, attending tapings and speaking with dozens of Republicans -- from the rank and file at rallies to lawmakers in the halls of Congress -- about the influence he wields and how he has built an audience he can leverage to influence party disputes and, he hopes, national elections.\n\nBannon, who vowed to appeal the sentence all the way to the Supreme Court, suggested he may not comply with the order to report to prison when asked if he could broadcast from a penitentiary.\n\n\"Who says I'm reporting!\" he said in a text message. \"WarRoom can not and will not be silenced.\"\n\nHe'll find a way to remain active. It goes without saying -- what an absolute crock all of this is, especially when Hunter Biden did the same thing.", "source": {"uri": "townhall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Townhall"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_vespa@townhall.com", "name": "Matt Vespa", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Greenwald", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Glenn Greenwald"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Contempt of Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Select_Committee_on_the_January_6_Attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Bannon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Bannon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hunter Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpoena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Subpoena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Navarro", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Peter Navarro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liz_Cheney", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liz Cheney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Kinzinger", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adam Kinzinger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassroots", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Grassroots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Organizations/Committees", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Organizations/Committees", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2022/217/076edcf1-5e3e-4c26-8431-0ee34178c185.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9644676", "eventUri": "eng-9644676", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-06", "textStart": 267, "textEnd": 276}], "sentiment": -0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 138, "relevance": 1}

Trump's most loyal allies, Bannon was defiant about the \"illegitimate regime\" that's set to jail him, and he predicted that the presumptive GOP nominee Donald J. Trump will suffer the same fate when he goes before Judge Juan Merchan next month.\n\n\"If you're wondering whether you're living in tyranny, ask yourself how many of his political opponents Joe Biden is sending to prison. Steve Bannon is the latest,\" Carlson said in an X post, sharing the video of his interview with the soon-to-be political prisoner.\n\n(Video Credit: Tucker Carlson)\n\nThe \"Honey Badger\" declared that he would serve his country from behind bars just as he did when he was a member of the military onboard a Navy destroyer.\n\n\"July 1st, hey, I served my country on a Navy ship, I'll serve my country as a political prisoner, in a federal prison for a misdemeanor, it doesn't, I don't bat one eye, whatever, whatever it takes to win this revolution, we got to do,\" he said.\n\nCarlson responded, \"You did serve your country in the US Navy. You're now being betrayed and persecuted by your country. There's no fair person could, I don't think, could conclude anything but that.\"\n\n\"Not our country, Tucker. No,\" Bannon replied. \"Our country, our country, the guys that listen to you and support you, we're being... we're being suppressed by and we're being oppressed by an illegitimate regime that usurped power here and that's what we have to break and look I don't need to tell you, they're on you every day as you know. They're on everybody that stands up, that's what they've tried to do.\"\n\n\"This illegitimate regime is trying to persecute not just President Trump. They're going to send him to prison on July 11th,\" he continued.\" They may defer that, but they're going to give him a prison sentence, as they've given Rudy Giuliani either bankruptcy or de-platforming or are taking a law license away or putting people in prison. That's what they're doing,\"\n\n\"And we have to stand up to it. That's why I would never give them. I would never give them, you know, you see McCabe on TV wetting himself every night about, oh, when these people get back in power, they're going to come after us,\" he said, referring to former FBI honcho Andrew McCabe who's now a member of MSNBC's stable of regime propagandists.\n\n\"You damn right we're going to come after you, within the rule of law, because that's how we'll bequeath a constitutional republic to our children and grandchildren,\" Bannon said. \"But no, I don't bat an eye. It's impossible. They will never break me. Ever. And, I, quite frankly, will be just as proud to serve my nation as a political prisoner in a federal prison for a misdemeanor by Nancy Pelosi as I was to serve my nation on that destroyer.\"\n\n\"I mean, this is an illegitimate regime of neo-Marxists, from the Justice Department to the FBI, the Wall Street crowd. You can see this everywhere in our society, the attacks on the family, and they play for keeps,\" Bannon later added.\n\n\"We have to win this. We don't win this. This country is going to devolve into some kind of neo-Marxist, totalitarian regime, of which it's pretty far down the road right now,\" he said. \"That's why I don't fear going to prison. Right? I know it's going to take my voice off the war. I'm still going to go on and I keep saying it's next man up. You can't lean on Trump. You can't lean on Tucker, you can't lean on Bannon. You can't lean on Alex Jones. This is a populist revolt.

Matt Gaetz of Florida spoke on Tim Pool's Timcast on Wednesday about the proposed strategy to keep Bannon out of jail -- which involves the House declaring that the January 6 committee is \"illegitimate.\"\n\nGaetz said on the podcast that there is a plan for Bannon to petition for an en banc review of the decision to revoke his bond, which would mean asking a full panel of judges to review the decision, not just the judge who made the decision.\n\nEn banc reviews are not particularly common and are typically used only for cases that are unusually complex or exceptionally important. The hearings, which involve all active judges in a circuit, can be reserved for cases requiring uniformity in court decisions, where rulings in the same district have diverged.\n\nIt is not clear which criteria Bannon would cite in any petition for a review.\n\nNewsweek reached out to Bannon's podcast PR team via email and Gaetz's communications director via X, formerly Twitter.\n\nGaetz explained that after Bannon's en banc review, the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group (BLAG) should vote on whether it is the official House view that the January 6 committee is \"illegitimate.\" \"It was illegitimately formed, it was a runaway committee, it did not have a proper minority member,\" Gaetz said.\n\n\"Nobody should be sitting in a jail cell because they would not comply with the absurd musings of a committee unlike any before in our nation's history.\"\n\nThe BLAG directs the House Office of General Counsel, which is the office that represents the House's interests in legal matters.\n\nGaetz said that the vote should pass, as Republicans have a 3-2 majority in the group, which is composed of the Speaker of the House, the Majority Leader, the Majority Whip, the Minority Leader and the Minority Whip.\n\nGaetz said that the BLAG vote would allow Bannon's lawyers to ask the court to allow his bail to stay in effect.\n\n\"The Republicans can do this without even taking a floor vote. Mike Johnson [House Speaker], Steve Scalise [House Majority Leader] and Tom Emmer [Majority Whip] can do it, and it is my belief that they are working toward that end as we speak,\" Gaetz said.\n\nJudge Carl Nichols, a Trump appointee, initially paused Bannon's prison sentence while he appealed his conviction.\n\nHowever, the judge decided to lift the stay on his sentence after a federal appeals court unanimously upheld the decision, with Nichols explaining that the original basis for his stay no longer existed.\n\nIn response to Nichols' decision on June 6, Bannon's lawyer David Schoen reacted strongly in the courtroom, leading to a rebuke from the judge.\n\n\"One thing you have to learn as a lawyer is that when the judge has made his decision, you don't stand up and start yelling,\" Nichols told him, according to NBC News.\n\nNewsweek has reached out to Schoen's law firm via email outside of regular working hours.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType":

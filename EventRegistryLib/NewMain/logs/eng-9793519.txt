The V40 starts at Rs 34,999. The V40 Pro starts at Rs 49,999.\n\nThe V30 series was launched about six months ago. And while the V30 and V30 Pro mostly lived up to the Vivo V-series reputation, there were some major downsides. The V30 Pro in particular got a lot of heat for its aging Dimensity 8200 processor, which Vivo had used three years in a row straight. The lack of stereo speakers and proper IP rating were other caveats. Vivo has fixed those shortcomings in the V40 Pro while bringing ZEISS branding to the relatively lower-end V40. There's a lot to like about these new phones.\n\nVivo V40 series: Specs, top features\n\nThe V40 and V40 Pro have the same design and the same display. The battery capacity and charging speeds, too, are similar. So is the front camera. Where the two differ majorly is in processing power and back cameras. The V40 Pro has three cameras -- 50-megapixel wide, 50-megapixel ultrawide, and 50-megapixel 2x telephoto. The V40 only has a two cameras, two 50MPs, one wide and another ultrawide.\n\nThe V40 Pro is powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 9200 Plus while the V40 has the Qualcomm Snapdragon 7 Gen 3 inside.\n\nRest of the specs include -- 6.78-inch 1.5K AMOLED display with 120Hz refresh rate, up to 4,500 nits of peak brightness, and HD support, 50-megapixel front camera with autofocus, and 5,500mAh battery with 80W fast charging.

We get the same 6.79-inch screen size and the resolution is FHD+. So the screen viewing experience should remain the same. The vanilla Vivo V40 retains the same Snapdragon 7 Gen 3 chipset as the Vivo V30. However, the Vivo V40 Pro gets a powerful MediaTek Dimensity 9200+ compared to MediaTek Dimensity 8200 on the Vivo V30 Pro.\n\nThe battery department sees a sizeable upgrade as there is a 5,500mAh battery on both Vivo V40 and V40 Pro compared to 5,000mAh capacity.

The company has launched its first mid-range premium or entry-level premium devices with Zeiss-tuned cameras. Should you pay attention to this phone series, or do you have better options out there? Let's talk about this here. Vivo has launched two new devices under this series - Vivo V40 and Vivo V40 Pro. Both are 5G devices, but both sport a different chipset to differentiate in performance. However, both devices have a Zeiss-tuned camera system.\n\nSo who is this device series targeted for? From the initial impressions looking at the specs sheet, it is a device series that you can potentially get the best performance out of, but instead, it is more geared for people who want a better camera experience at this price range. So let's quickly get over the price.\n\nRead More - iPhone 16 Pro Models to Get this Improvement over the iPhone 15 Devices\n\nThe Vivo V40 5G series has the Vivo V40 Pro available in two variants - 8GB+256GB for Rs 49,999 and 12GB+512GB for Rs 55,999. It is available in two colours - Ganges Blue and Titanium Grey. It is confirmed to go on sale on August 13, 2024.\n\nThen there's the Vivo V40 starting at Rs 34,999 for the 8GB+12GB. There are two more variants priced at Rs 36,999 and Rs 41,999 with 8GB+256GB and 12GB+512GB. This series is available in Ganges Blue, Lotus Purple, and Titanium Grey. This is confirmed to go on sale from August 19, 2024.\n\nNow let's see the specs to determine whether it is a good enough device or not!\n\nRead More - Apple Registers Record Revenue in India for June Quarter: Report\n\nAlright, so you get the devices running on FunTouch OS 14 based on Android 14 out of the box. Both devices come with a 6.78-inch FHD+ AMOLED display with 120Hz refresh rate supporting 4500nits of peak brightness. The Vivo V40 has the Qualcomm Snapdragon 7 Gen 3 SoC while the Vivo V40 Pro has MediaTek Dimensity 9200+ SoC. The Vivo V40 seems a bit overpriced with respect to the chipset Vivo went with. But I believe they are selling the \"camera\" at this point.\n\nThe Vivo V40 Pro onn the other hand comes with the Dimensity 9200+ SoC. Now this is a chip that's comparable with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2. Sure, there's the OnePlus 12R that can be a huge competition to this device both in the aspect of performance as well as pricing. However, the OnePlus 12R is not as camera focused as the Vivo V4o Pro is! So there's that differentiation between the two devices.\n\nThe Vivo V40 Pro has a triple camera setup comprising of 50MP Sony IMX921 primary sensor with OIS, 50MP wide-angle-sensor, and another 50MP Sony IMX816 telephoto sensor with 2x optical zoom and 50x digital zoom.\n\nThe Vivo V40 has a dual-camera setup with a 50MP primary sensor with OIS and a 50MP wide-angle-sensor, so no telephoto here. For selfies both come with a 50MP sensor. Yes, there's a 5500mAh battery on both with 80W charging support. There's also IP68 certification, which is a great addition.\n\nDo the specs make sense? Well, sure, why not! If the camera is as good as Vivo claims it to be, then why not! But I would still hope that people wait before purhasing this device, and compare the value, camera experience, and OS experience with other devices in the same price range before making the final decision.", "source": {"uri": "telecomtalk.info", "dataType": "news", "title": "TelecomTalk"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tanay_singh_thakur@telecomtalk.info", "name": "Tanay Singh Thakur", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivo_(technology_company)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vivo (technology company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "5G"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipset", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chipset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "System on a chip"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_MediaTek_systems_on_chips", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "List of MediaTek systems on chips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnePlus", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "OnePlus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refresh_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Refresh rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMOLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AMOLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1080p", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "1080p"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IP code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephoto_lens", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Telephoto lens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_stabilization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Image stabilization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_zoom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Digital zoom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaTek", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MediaTek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_lens", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zoom lens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Operating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Selfie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sony"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Video", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Video", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://telecomtalk.info/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/vivo-v40-5g-series-launched-in-india-1024x683.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793519", "eventUri": "eng-9793519", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2013-08-", "textStart": 1126, "textEnd": 1135}, {"amb": false, "date": "2019-08-", "textStart": 1414, "textEnd": 1423}], "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 228, "relevance": 1}

These phones are ZEISS-boosted, and the company says that they are designed to \"elevate the mobile portrait photography experience\".\n\nThese two smartphones look almost the same. The difference is visible on the back, though, as their camera islands are slightly different due to different placement of some sensors (the Vivo V40 Pro also has one extra camera on the back). Other than that, they look the same on the outside.\n\nBoth smartphones are made out of metal and glass. They come in a range of colors and feature curved displays. A centered display camera hole is placed on the top of the displays on both phones, while the bezels are quite thin.\n\nThe camera islands on the back are quite odd. There are basically two levels to it. The cameras themselves and additional sensors are split into two separate islands, which are placed on a pill-shaped protrusion in the top-left corner. This doesn't exactly look like eye candy, but at least it's in the same color as the back side of the phone. We'll talk more about the cameras soon.\n\nThe two phones have the same display on the front. It's a 6.78-inch AMOLED panel with a resolution of 2800 x 1260. This display has a refresh rate of 120Hz and a peak brightness of 4,500 nits, on paper at least. This display also has SGS Certification for Low Blue Light, Low Flicker, and Low Motion Blur. HDR10+ content is also supported.\n\nThe chipsets are different. The Vivo V40 is fueled by the Snapdragon 7 Gen 3, while the 'Pro' model comes with the MediaTek Dimensity 9200+. Both devices are available with RAM configurations of 8GB and 12GB of RAM, and both offer up to 512GB of storage.\n\nYou'll find a 5,500mAh battery inside both smartphones, and both of them support 80W wired charging. Yes, a charger is included in the retail box. Android 14 comes pre-installed on both smartphones, along with Vivo's Funtouch OS 14.\n\nWhat's interesting is that the Vivo V40 supports Bluetooth 5.4, while the Vivo V40 Pro offers support for older Bluetooth 5.3. That sure is odd, but there you go, that's what it says in the official spec sheet.\n\nIn regards to cameras, the Vivo V40 Pro has one extra camera on the back. It has three compared to two on the Vivo V40. The Vivo V40 has a 50-megapixel main camera (OIS) and a 50-megapixel ultrawide camera.\n\nThe Vivo V40 Pro, on the other hand, has a 50-megapixel main camera (Sony's IMX921 sensor, OIS), a 50-megapixel ultrawide unit, and a 50-megapixel telephoto portrait camera (Sony's IMX816 sensor). Both devices include a 50-megapixel 'Group Selfie' camera on the front. The Vivo V series is actually well-known for its great selfie camera experience.\n\nVarious camera features are on offer here, including ZEISS Multifocal Portrait, ZEISS Style Portrait, AI Aura Light Portrait, ZEISS Focus Transition, Vivo Color System, ZEISS Natural Color, and more.\n\nBoth devices measure 164.16 x 74.93 x 7.58mm. The Vivo V40 Pro is 2 grams heavier than the Vivo V40, it weighs 192 grams. The Vivo V40 comes in Meteor Blue, Moonlight White, Nebula Purple, Stellar Silver, and Sunglow Peach colors. The 'Pro' model, on the other hand, comes in Meteor Blue, Moonlight White, and Stellar Silver colors. The price tags are still unknown.", "source": {"uri": "androidheadlines.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Android Headlines"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kristijan_lucic@androidheadlines.com", "name": "Kristijan Lucic", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivo_(technology_company)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vivo (technology company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Sensor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Display device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_MediaTek_systems_on_chips", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "List of MediaTek systems on chips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDR10+", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "HDR10+"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refresh_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Refresh rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipset", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chipset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaTek", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MediaTek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STMicroelectronics", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "STMicroelectronics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMOLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AMOLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bluetooth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_14", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Android 14"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra_wide_angle_lens", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ultra wide angle lens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephoto_lens", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Telephoto lens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_stabilization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Image stabilization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_charger", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Battery charger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Operating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sony"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Used_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Used Equipment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.androidheadlines.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/vivo-V40-image-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793519", "eventUri": "eng-9793519", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 220, "relevance": 1}

They come with many features that were earlier reserved for only ultra high-end phones, and for all practical purposes, they are as good as more expensive phones. They now even look good, if the Vivo V40 Pro, which has launched in India today, is to be taken as an example.\n\nThe Vivo V40 Pro -- I have been using this phone for over a week, and it's impressive. It's sleek, powered by a MediaTek 9200+ processor, and has the Zeiss-powered camera system. Zeiss features were until now part of only the top flagship Vivo phones. But now, some of them are in the Vivo V40 Pro, and while the camera hardware means that the V40 Pro is not going to match a Rs 90,000 phone like the X100 Pro, it is still nice to see these features arriving at a more affordable price point.\n\nWhen I first laid eyes on the Vivo V40 Pro, its camera module reminded me of a pendulum clock. I know you're thinking, \"It looks like any other phone,\" but wait until you see the back panel. The camera island oddly resembles a pendulum clock, with a round dial at the top and a little tail hanging below. No ticking hands or swinging parts, of course, but that's the vibe you get at first glance. Inside the round dial, you will find two camera sensors, along with a third sensor and a small aura light sitting in the oval-shaped island module.\n\nThe rear panel has a soothing texture that gives it a liquid look, making it seem like water is flowing from one direction to another. That's why this variant is called Ganges Blue. There is another option -- the midnight grey. While the hue looks good, the back panel is prone to smudges. You see, all the slickness and sleekness has a cost, although given that we all use phones with a cover this wouldn't be a bother to users.\n\nThe Vivo V40 Pro is a sleek device with a screen that feels bigger than most. When I was using the Motorola Edge 50 alongside it, the Edge felt almost tiny and compact in comparison. If you love larger phones, the V40 Pro is your pick. Despite its size, it's surprisingly easy to use with one hand. The power button and volume rockers are conveniently placed in the middle, not awkwardly at the top right like some other phones. Plus, the ultra-slim 3D curved display not only looks stylish but also feels amazing in hand. That said, the device doesn't offer a very secure grip -- that sleekness and slickness strikes again -- so, like noted earlier, use a cover.\n\nOverall, the Vivo V40 Pro lives up to its hype. Vivo hasn't gone overboard with the design but has managed to create a unique camera module while maintaining a minimalist theme.\n\nThe display on the Vivo V40 Pro is stunning. The phone uses a 6.78-inch AMOLED screen with a crisp 1.5K resolution 2800x1260 pixels. The 120Hz refresh rate makes everything feel super smooth, whether I am scrolling through social media or playing games. The punch-hole cutout is small and unobtrusive, maintaining an impressive 89.9 per cent screen-to-body ratio.\n\nWith 452 ppi, the level of detail in this display is sharp, and the colours are vibrant, thanks to the 100 per cent DCI-P3 colour gamut. The peak brightness of 4,500 nits ensures that the display is perfectly visible even in bright sunlight. The 20:9 aspect ratio makes it ideal for watching videos and playing games.\n\nWatching movies on the Vivo V40 Pro is a treat. The vibrant colours and sharp details make every scene pop, whether it's a bright, action-packed sequence or a dark, moody drama. Gaming is equally impressive. The high refresh rate and responsive touch make gameplay smooth and immersive. Whether I'm binge-watching a series or playing the latest game, the V40 Pro's display never disappoints.\n\nThe phone is equipped with dual speakers so if you like watching movies on TV, you will love the overall experience.\n\nAll good under its hood\n\nWhen it comes to smartphones, aesthetics matter, but performance is the real game-changer. I've been rigorously using the Vivo V40 Pro as my daily driver for over a week now, and my experience has been satisfactory. My routine involves fairly heavy social media usage -- constantly checking notifications, playing games, using the camera extensively, and performing mundane tasks like listening to music and making calls. I didn't encounter any lag during my usage, which is something I expect from most modern phones, and the Vivo V40 Pro didn't disappoint.\n\nOne standout feature was that the phone never got hot, even during heavy tasks. For instance, while downloading resources for the demanding game Genshin Impact, the phone remained cool. However, this did cause a noticeable drop in battery life.\n\nTo get some numbers, I ran the Geekbench 6 benchmark. The Vivo V40 Pro scored 1759 on the single-core test and 4896 on the multi-core test, which is decent. In real-world usage, the phone's performance mirrored these results.\n\nI put the Vivo V40 Pro through its paces to see how it handles some demanding titles. I started with Asphalt 9, a graphically intensive racing game. I played for 30 minutes straight and was impressed by the phone's performance. There were no heating issues, and the game ran smoothly without any lag. The vibrant OLED display and powerful stereo speakers enhanced the gaming experience.\n\nNext, I moved on to Genshin Impact, known for being demanding on phone hardware. I played for 20-25 minutes, and the Vivo V40 Pro held up remarkably well. There was no noticeable lag, and the phone only got slightly warm, which is impressive for a game of this calibre. The device's cooling system clearly does a good job. However, I did notice a slight drop in battery percentage after playing, which is expected given the game's intensity.\n\nThe Vivo V40 Pro offers three gaming modes: Balanced, Performance (or Boost), and Battery Saver. Each mode is tailored to different needs.\n\nI switched between the Balanced and the Boost mode. The Balanced mode strikes a perfect balance between performance and battery life, it doesn't drain the battery too quickly. Whereas the Boost mode optimised the CPU and GPU to deliver maximum performance, perfect for demanding games like Genshin Impact or when you're participating in competitive gaming sessions where every frame counts. However, be prepared for increased battery consumption in this mode.\n\nBattery at its best\n\nThe Vivo V40 Pro is sleek yet packs a hefty 5,500mAh battery. I tested it with the PCMark for Android battery benchmark, and to my surprise, it lasted an impressive 17 hours and 55 minutes. This is one of the longest durations I've seen on a smartphone recently. Even after the test ended, the battery still had 20 per cent remaining.\n\nIn real-life usage, the phone easily lasted more than a day on a single charge, which really impressed me. The combination of a large battery and efficient power management makes the Vivo V40 Pro a reliable choice for those who need a long-lasting device.\n\nA camera-focused smartphone\n\nWith Zeiss-branding camera, I expected a good show from the Vivo V40 Pro. Reason? I earlier reviewed the Zeiss-engineered phones in the past by Vivo, namely the X90 Pro, X100, and loved them.\n\nThe Vivo V40 Pro boasts a 50-megapixel OIS main camera, a 50-megapixel telephoto portrait camera, a 50MP-megapixel group selfie camera, and an ultra-wide-angle camera.\n\nThe main camera features a Sony IMX921 sensor and a lens with F2.0 aperture. I took a picture of a stadium at night, which was lit up in vibrant, multicoloured lights. The Vivo V40 Pro's main camera handled the scene beautifully. The colours of the lights were vivid and distinct, and the details of the stadium's structure were quite clear despite the low light. Thanks to the Sony IMX921 sensor and the optical image stabilisation (OIS), the photo came out sharp and well-defined even though it was from a great distance.\n\nOne of the standout features of the Vivo V40 Pro is the ZEISS multifocal portrait photography. I used this feature to take different portraits of my dog and my colleagues both at home and in the office, and the results were fantastic. I mostly used the 35mm lens for some candid shots of my colleagues while they were busy doing their work. The pictures had a nice depth and brought out the details in the background while keeping the focus on the people.\n\nThe skin tones in the photos appear natural, meaning they resemble real-life skin colours without looking overly altered. Although in lower light there is clear smoothening, which is what stops the Vivo V40 Pro camera from being great. This smoothening and lack and details in texture is also otherwise evident in regular photos clicked in lower light. So, yes Zeiss-branded camera but the Vivo V40 Pro is clearly has a camera that matches its price and not really the high mark set by other Zeiss-branded Vivo phones.\n\nI also tried the 50mm Biotar mode for close-up portraits of my dog. It took a few shots to get the perfect one where all her fur strands were visible. The camera is impressively fast at capturing images and processing them. I like to capture images on the go, and I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly the results were delivered.\n\nThe Vivo V40 Pro is a great choice if you're looking for a stylish, mid-range phone with excellent features. Its design is unique, with a cool pendulum clock-like camera module. The display is vibrant and sharp, perfect for watching movies and playing games.\n\nPerformance-wise, it handles daily tasks and even demanding games without any lag. The battery life is impressive, lasting more than a day on a single charge. The camera, equipped with Zeiss lenses, takes fantastic photos in good light, and mostly good photos in lower light.\n\nOverall, the Vivo V40 Pro offers good performance, a stunning display, and solid camera capabilities, making it worth considering if you want a well-rounded phone under Rs 50,000.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V40", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "V40"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivo_(technology_company)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vivo (technology company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pendulum_clock", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pendulum clock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rupee", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indian rupee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_Edge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motorola Edge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genshin_Impact", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Genshin Impact"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_camera_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Virtual camera system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refresh_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Refresh rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_sensor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Image sensor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edge (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "3D computer graphics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaTek", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MediaTek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hue", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hue"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racing_game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Racing game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DCI-P3", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "DCI-P3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_aspect_ratio", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Display aspect ratio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrolling", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Scrolling"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamut", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gamut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_stabilization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Image stabilization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lens"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sony"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Used_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Used Equipment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 47}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202408/vivo-v40-073303214-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=SvgALfRD.G3w3RUV0UhdZimtOggeIdag", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793519", "eventUri": "eng-9793519", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 212, "relevance": 1}

The Vivo V40 and Vivo V40 Pro are the latest, and the concentration this time is on Zeiss's portrait mode enhancements, a feature that has impressed us recently on the top Vivo X Fold3 Pro.\n\nThe Vivo V40 Pro is the most interesting of the two, and the camera spec starts with a 50-megapixel main camera with optical image stabilization (OIS), a 50MP wide-angle camera, and a 50MP telephoto camera with 2x optical zoom and up to 50x digital zoom. This camera makes the most of the Zeiss Multifocal Portrait mode and the camera's five different focal length settings to create great-looking portrait shots.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nPortrait mode works with video on the V40 series too, with a Cinematic Bokeh Video mode shooting at 4K even with the bokeh portrait effect. Another mode, called Focus Transition, automatically switches focus between two people, depending on which direction they are facing, so you can give your videos a more professional look. The V40 Pro also has a set of different fill lights for portrait shots in lowlight, including the special Aura Light which we really liked on the Vivo V30 Pro.\n\nAll this is driven by a MediaTek Dimensity 9200+ processor with 12GB of RAM, plus a 5,500mAh battery with 80W fast charging. The screen size is unknown at the time of writing, but it does have a 120Hz refresh rate, and is wrapped in a body that's just 7.58mm thick. There are three colors available -- Meteor Blue, Moonlight White, and Stellar Silver -- but the V40 gets a pair of special colors -- Nebula Purple and Sunglow Peach -- all to itself.\n\nThe Vivo V40 doesn't have quite such a high specification, coming with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 7 Gen 3 processor, and missing out on the 50MP telephoto camera, so if you really want to get the best portrait shots the V40 Pro is the one to get. Vivo hasn't announced price details for either phone, but the V series sits in its mid-range and the V30 Pro could be found for less than $550, so the costs should be competitive. Both have been released in India today, with other Vivo regions to follow.", "source": {"uri": "digitaltrends.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Digital Trends"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andy_boxall@digitaltrends.com", "name": "Andy Boxall", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivo_(technology_company)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vivo (technology company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_stabilization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Image stabilization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokeh", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bokeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide-angle_lens", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wide-angle lens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephoto_lens", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Telephoto lens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_zoom", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Digital zoom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_lens", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zoom lens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_length", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Focal length"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4K_resolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "4K resolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_MediaTek_systems_on_chips", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "List of MediaTek systems on chips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LG_V30", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LG V30"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refresh_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Refresh rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaTek", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MediaTek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Used_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Used Equipment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://www.digitaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/vivo-v40-pro-colors.jpg?resize=800%2C418&p=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793519", "eventUri": "eng-9793519", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

It comes with considerable upgrades in the hardware configurations department over its predecessor. In this post, we'll compare the specifications of the Vivo V40 Pro with the Vivo V30 Pro to check what upgrades the new V-series Pro model has to offer.\n\nThe Vivo V40 Pro comes with a glass body with a matte finish. The rear panel has the brand logo at the bottom left corner and a pill-like camera island housing a triple camera setup with an Aura flashlight. At the front, it has a curved display with a punch-hole cutout. The device comes with an IP68 rating, making it suitable for use in rain.\n\nThe Vivo V30 Pro also features a glass rear with a matte finish. The camera module is split into two sections: the triple cameras in the upper part and the other portion has an Aura flashlight. It features IP54 protection against dust and water splashes, but you shouldn't use it in the rain.\n\nBoth Vivo V-series Pro models have identical display specifications. Even the size of both phones' screens is the same-6.78-inch. Moreover, they both come with Schott \u03b1 glass protection for better display durability against scratches.\n\nHowever, the Vivo V40 Pro has a higher peak brightness (4,500 nits) than the Vivo V30 Pro (2,800 nits). But it's worth noting that it only triggers this high brightness while watching HDR content. Still, it might make it easier to see the screen in sunny conditions.\n\nThe Vivo V40 Pro has a more powerful SoC at the helm than the Vivo V30 Pro. You get similar RAM and storage options with both devices. However, the difference in their performance is pretty evident in their benchmark scores across multiple platforms.\n\nWith the MediaTek Dimensity 9200+ chip under its hood, the Vivo V40 Pro scored 15,24,110 points on AnTuTu, and on Geekbench, it got 1,811 points in the single-core test and 5,299 points in the multi-core test.\n\nOn the other hand, the Vivo V30 Pro with the MediaTek Dimesnity 8200 processor bagged 835 points in the single-core test with points in the 2,984 multi-core test on Geekbench and points on 9,48,361 AnTuTu.\n\nWhile both phones have an identical Zeiss-powered camera setup for both the front and rear, the Vivo V40 Pro comes with new sensors.\n\nDuring our time with the Vivo V30 Pro, we were pretty impressed with the camera performance of the Vivo V30 Pro in both daylight and low-light conditions. However, you will have to wait for our detailed review of the Vivo V40 Pro to learn more about its camera performance and what updates the new camera sensors bring.\n\nThe Vivo V40 Pro comes with a larger 5,500mAh battery capacity than the Vivo V30 Pro's 5,000mAh cell. Both phones support 80W fast charging which can fully charge these phones in roughly 45 minutes.\n\nDespite the bigger battery capacity, the Vivo V40 Pro falls behind the Vivo V30 Pro in the PCMark battery test. During our testing, the Vivo V40 Pro lasted 14 hours and 36 minutes, while the Vivo V30 Pro ran for 16 hours and 12 minutes.\n\nBoth phones run on the latest version of Android out of the box and will get two years of major OS releases and three years of security patches. Both come pre-loaded with a slew of third-party apps, which you can remove if unnecessary.\n\nHowever, you don't get any AI tools with the Vivo V30 Pro, whereas the Vivo V40 Pro offers some camera and photo editing-related AI features.\n\nBoth phones pack remarkable specifications under the hood. However, after taking a detailed look at every aspect of both devices, it's pretty clear that the Vivo V40 Pro offers few upgrades over its predecessor.\n\nWith the Vivo V40 Pro, you get a more powerful SoC, a slightly bigger battery, and new Zeiss-powered camera sensors. Besides this, the Vivo V30 Pro offers identical specifications to the Vivo V40 Pro in all other departments.", "source": {"uri": "91mobiles.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "91mobiles.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivo_(technology_company)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vivo (technology company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LG_V30", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LG V30"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "IP code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashlight", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Flashlight"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaTek", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MediaTek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_MediaTek_systems_on_chips", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "List of MediaTek systems on chips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AnTuTu", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AnTuTu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "High dynamic range"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmark_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benchmark (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-core_processor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Multi-core processor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "System on a chip"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geekbench", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Geekbench"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCMark", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "PCMark"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_sensor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Image sensor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Operating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patch (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sensor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.91-cdn.com/hub/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Vivo-V40-Pro-vs-Vivo-V30-Pro.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793519", "eventUri": "eng-9793519", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.03529411764705892, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

The telephoto camera of the smartphone will support 2x optical and 50X digital zoom.\n\nThe Vivo V40 series has already been launched in select markets. Some specifications of the global variant can be seen below.\n\nVivo's new phones are going to enter as the world's thinnest phones. The company says that Vivo phones with 5500mAh battery capacity will be the world's thinnest phones. The phone will have 80W fast charge feature for fast charging.", "source": {"uri": "stackumbrella.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Stackumbrella.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivo_(technology_company)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vivo (technology company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide-angle_lens", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wide-angle lens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipkart", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Flipkart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra_wide_angle_lens", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ultra wide angle lens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephoto_lens", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Telephoto lens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_stabilization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Image stabilization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selfie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Selfie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_sensor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Image sensor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_zoom", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Digital zoom"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Video", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Video", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras_and_Camcorders", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Cameras and Camcorders", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Used_Equipment", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Used Equipment", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 54}], "image": "https://www.stackumbrella.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Vivo-V40-Series-_11zon.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793519", "eventUri": "eng-9793519", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

Vivo is looking to change that, by bringing Zeiss imaging to both versions of its affordable V-series for the first time. The Vivo V40 and Vivo V40 Pro also manage to squeeze in absolutely huge batteries into impressively svelte bodies.\n\nThe V40 was officially revealed back in June, but now the closely related V40 Pro completes the line-up. Both phones bring back Vivo's trademark fill flash for their rear cameras, which promise more flattering photos than last year's V30 Pro. That's because despite being smaller, the LEDs shine significantly brighter here.\n\nThere are 50MP sensors all round, with the V40 getting a Samsung-supplied, optically-stabilised main snapper and ultrawide secondary. The V40 Pro gets its lead lens from Sony, and adds a dedicated telephoto good for 3.5x optical zoom, along with an ultrawide. Both phones get 50MP selfie cams with wide fields-of-view, too.\n\nZeiss has again supplied its lens knowhow, with bokeh blur effects meant to mimic expensive DSLR glass, plus colour grading and contrast handling that should make your portrait shots truly pop. That should put them in good stead to compete with the likes of the Google Pixel 8a and Honor 200 Pro for class honours.\n\nThere's little to separate the two phones on the design front, with 6.78in AMOLED screens up front (complete with 3D curved glass) and a selection of glass rear panels, each with their own distinct texture-effect finish. You can pick up up either in Meteor Blue, Moonlight White and Stellar Silver colours, while the jazzier Nebula Purple and Sunglow Peach are exclusive to the V40.\n\nAt 7.58mm they are ever-so-slightly thicker than last year's efforts, but only by a few tenths of a millimetre. These are still size zero smartphones, yet still pack in 5500mAh batteries. That's comfortably 10% more than you'll find in most mid-range rivals, and you can top up at a speedy 80W over USB-C, too.\n\nBoth phones get a 6.78in AMOLED screen with 2800\u00d71260 resolution, 120Hz refresh rate and whopping 4500nits peak brightness, along with HDR10+ support and dual stereo speakers - a first for the V-series.\n\nVivo has hedged its bets on performance. The regular V40 gets a Qualcomm Snapdragon 7 Gen 3 chipset, 8 or 12GB of RAM, and 128, 256 or 512GB of storage. The V40 Pro goes for MediaTek power instead, with a Dimensity 9200+ CPU, 8 or 12GB of RAM, and 256GB or 512GB of internal memory. Both should be perfectly punchy mid-range handsets, based on my experiences with the same chips in other phones.\n\nVivo has been knocking it out of the park recently, with the X100 Pro delivering some of the best cameras on any phone I've used in 2024, and the X Fold3 Pro proving the firm can compete with foldable class leaders on high-end hardware. There's even rumours that the upcoming Vivo X200 series will make its way to more European countries. If the V40 duo can impress for less, it'll definitely be a brand to watch - even if regional availability is still a mixed bag. So far only India has been confirmed, with exact pricing still TBC.\n\nI've got both the Vivo V40 and V40 Pro in for testing.

The new phones are called the Vivo V40 and the V40 Pro, respectively and are priced between the mid-range and the premium smartphone segments. We have the Vivo V40 Pro with us, which packs top-end hardware and also looks the part when it comes to premium design. The phone is priced at Rs. 49,999 for the base 8GB RAM + 256GB storage variant and Rs. 55,999 for the 12GB RAM + 512GB storage variant. While the typical V series smartphone has always been about slim designs and aesthetics, Vivo took a slightly different approach with its V30 series, focussing on better camera hardware. With the V40, it now appears that it's aiming to be an all-rounder, with a focus on performance and battery life as well. So, let's take a closer look at what's new.\n\nThe Vivo V40 Pro has a slim and curved design with an official IP68 rating for dust and water resistance\n\nWe don't expect much from mid-year upgrades, but Vivo has gone with a refreshed design. Like recent models, the phone continues to have curved edges on the sides with a flattened top and bottom. The phone's durability has improved and now comes with an official IP68 rating versus the official IP54 rating of the V30 Pro.\n\nThe curved design also means that your typical 3D curved edge display is included. This one is a 6.78-inch, full-HD+ 120Hz curved edge AMOLED panel protected by Schott's Xensation Alpha glass. The curved edge rear panel is also made of glass, and our Ganges Blue review unit sure looks unique with its iridescent wave-like pattern, even though it does appear a bit similar to the V30 Pro's Andaman Blue finish. The phone is also available in a Titanium Grey finish.\n\nThe keyhole-like camera module looks a bit odd but has a familiar camera setup\n\nWhat does stand out is the odd-looking keyhole-shaped camera module. Given that the rest of the phone is quite slim, the camera module protrudes quite a bit and consists of one circular module (housing the 50-megapixel ultra-wide and primary cameras), while the capsule-shaped bottom assembly holds the 50-megapixel (2X optical) telephoto camera and the aura light LED ring. As you can tell from the photos, the Aura ring light has been shrunk in size compared to the one on the V30 Pro. The selfie camera, just like the previous model, also has a 50-megapixel selfie camera with autofocus capability. In short, the camera setup is similar to its predecessor.\n\nThe phone runs Vivo's Funtouch 14 OS, which is based on Android 14 and also comes with some AI image editing features. The V40 Pro is powered by a 4nm MediaTek Dimensity 9200+ SoC, which is a good upgrade and comes with several improvements over the V30 Pro's Dimensity 8200 SoC.\n\nThe battery has been upgraded as well. The Vivo V40 Pro now gets a 5,500mAh battery that can be charged using the same 80W charger as before. Vivo has not included any wireless charging functionality with the new model.\n\nThe Vivo V40 Pro runs Funtouch OS 14 and has a few AI-enabled features\n\nWith solid upgrades mainly in the performance and battery departments, we expect Vivo's V40 Pro to get the much-needed push to make it stand out from the crowd of premium devices from Samsung and Google this year. These devices also come packed with AI features, which Vivo as a brand has yet to delve into with its premium offerings and currently seems reserved for its ultra-premium (Vivo X Fold 3 Pro) offerings only.

Talking of specs, the Vivo V40 5G packs a dual camera setup on the back, consisting of an OIS-assisted 50-megapixel f/1.88 primary camera, and a 50-megapixel f/2.0 ultra-wide lens. There's a 50-megapixel selfie camera with f/2.0 aperture. As a camera-centric smartphone, we rigorously tested the sensors on the Vivo V40 and here's a detailed review of their performance.\n\nThe Vivo V40 packs a good amount of camera features, which those who are into photography would admire a lot. On the hardware level, there's the aura light on the back that can be used as fill light in portraits. Because it supports dual temperature, you can even change it to a warmer tone or a cooler one. There's also an option to change its brightness.\n\nOn the software level, Vivo offers features like various types of bokeh effects you can use. Next, you can change the focal length to four types in Portrait mode which are attributed to various styles, such as 24mm landscape portrait, 50mm natural portrait, and more. Each one of them has a different colour tone, accounting for a different look in every style. The device can shoot videos in up to 4K resolution at 30 FPS from both front and rear cameras.\n\nPortrait shots from the Vivo V40 turn out to be excellent. These shots pack a punch when it comes to colours and according to the environment and overall mood of the shot, you can change the style. We can assure you that in each style, you'd get a unique shot that's not only filled with details, but also gets vivid colours. The bokeh effect in each style looks good, and also feels natural with average EDGE detection around a human subject, but accurate edge detection around an object.\n\nIn regular photos, you can choose from Vivid, textured, and Zeiss-tuned natural mode. Again, the Vivid one has enhanced colours while the textured one boosts them further. The Zeiss-tuned natural mode captures colours as they look in real life. All these have different attributes, and each one of them can be used for various purposes. While we liked the Vivid one best, all three modes capture amazing photos. These shots not only have plenty of details but also show how well the dynamic range is handled by the device. The Vivo V40 left no stone unturned in giving a great shot and it very well succeeded every time. The focusing speed is high and the shutter lag is also well contained.\n\nAs you begin zooming in, starting from 2x crop, the details begin to shatter, unfortunately. While 2x photos are still acceptable, 5x zoomed photos look like they are painted and shots zoomed in at 20x, which is the maximum you can zoom, are worse.\n\nThe ultra-wide angle shots from the dedicated sensor won't disappoint you either. These shots maintain the colour profile seen in regular photos, while being sharp and vivid. However, even though I had enabled the ultra-wide angle correction option in the camera settings, there was still a good amount of distortion at the edges in such photos (can be observed in the shot above). I feel this aspect in particular could have been handled better.\n\nIn low-light conditions, the Vivo V40's aura light illuminates the subject, enabling the camera to capture even the smallest details. Even the colours are picked up well by the sensor in such conditions. Even without the aura light, there's not a lot of loss in details, but the colours begin to fade slightly.\n\nFor selfies, the sensor picks up accurate skin tones paired with vivid colours and a high amount of detailing. Same as the rear sensor, you can apply different types of bokeh effects in portrait selfies too. However, the edge detection can be messy at times. Despite that, the Vivo V40 will easily take selfies worth sharing on social media.\n\nShots clicked under artificial lighting also exhibit positive traits. There's no noise in the shots while colours impressively maintained. The smallest details and elements in the photo are visible when you zoom into the photo after it's clicked.\n\nThe Vivo V40 once again beautifully captures night shots. The device cranks up the exposure to just the right amount so everything's visible in the shot, even when it's pitch black. The details are retained without any issues, and there's no noise in the photos either.\n\nTo sum up, it's difficult to find a flaw with Vivo V40 5G cameras. Except for zoomed-in shots that lack clarity, which is reasonable as the device doesn't have a dedicated telephoto sensor, the Vivo V40 5G clicks excellent shots in most of the lighting conditions. Even though the Vivo V40 5G is a mid-ranger, its camera sensors perform like that of a flagship.

Not only do its high-end flagships offer bleeding-edge hardware, but the recent AI software features have made them some of the most advanced mobile shooters. Now, previously with the Vivo V30 Pro and now with the V40 series, Vivo has brought some of this magic to mid-range devices as well.\n\nVivo V40 sports a triple camera setup with a wide 50MP Zeiss camera with OIS, a 50MP Zeiss ultra-wide shooter with a 112-degree field of view, and a 50MP 2X telephoto shooter. OnePlus Nord 4, on the other hand, gets a dual camera setup, with a main 50MP Sony LYTIA sensor with OIS, and a secondary 8MP ultra-wide shooter. Right off the bat, on paper, you can tell that the Vivo is more focused on delivering a solid camera experience.\n\nIt also packs a more feature-rich portrait mode, with Zeiss-style portraits on offer. It includes Zeiss Distagon-style bokeh, B-speed-style bokeh, Biotar-style bokeh, etc. Plus, based on our testing at HT Tech, the OnePlus Nord 4 could certainly have been better, and it is not the best camera performance you can get in this segment. So, if you are looking for a camera-centric device, the Vivo V40 will certainly be a better option.\n\nAlso Read: Vivo V40 and Vivo V40 Pro launched in India with 50MP Zeiss camera, Snapdragon 7 Gen 3 chipset: Check specs and more\n\nPerformance is where the OnePlus Nord 4 shines. It gets the latest Snapdragon 7 Gen 3 SoC based on the 4nm architecture, and that makes it ideal for performance-oriented tasks such as gaming and editing content. Plus, with up to 12GB RAM and 8GB in the base model, you get consistent performance. It also does well at multitasking based on our testing, and it does so without heating.\n\nVivo V40, too, gets the Snapdragon 7 Gen 3, and that means it is equally competent in most tasks where performance is a priority. On paper, there isn't going to be a major difference when it comes to performance, but it is too early to predict if the Vivo V40 would be better than the OnePlus Nord 4. Stay tuned to our review in HT Tech coming soon.\n\nComing to the battery, both the OnePlus Nord 4, and the Vivo V40 have a 5,500 mAh battery, but differ in terms of charging speed. OnePlus Nord 4 has 100W fast charging, while the Vivo V40 gets 80W fast charging support.\n\nAlso Read: Indian government issues 'high risk' warning for these Microsoft users, private data can be leaked - Details here\n\nOnePlus Nord 4 features a return to a metallic unibody design and it stands out in a sea of glass slab smartphones, and that makes it more durable compared to other smartphones. It is a different design, and certainly differs from most smartphones in the price range, including the Vivo V40. For the display, the OnePlus Nord 4 features a flat 6.7-inch 120Hz ProXDR AMOLED panel.\n\nVivo V40 gets a curved 6.78-inch AMOLED panel that also sports a 120Hz refresh rate, and it supports a peak brightness of 4500 nits which happens to be more than OnePlus Nord 4's 2150 nits. It does feature glass for the back panel, and that means it is a more traditional design approach, unlike the metallic OnePlus Nord 4. That being said, design is subjective, so you can't go wrong with either. If you prefer a curved display with a glass back, the Vivo V40 is the ideal pick. However, if you want to try a metal phone again, and reminiscence about the phones launched in the last decade, such as the OnePlus 3, the OnePlus Nord 4 is good choice.\n\nAlso Read: AI-powered textbooks for students? This country is taking a major step to improve learning\n\nVivo V40 starts at \u20b934,999 for the base 8GB+128GB model, and goes up to \u20b941,999 for the top-end 12GB+512GB model. What this means is it is more expensive than the OnePlus Nord 4, as it starts lower at \u20b929,999 for the 8GB+128GB model, and goes up to 12GB+256GB for \u20b935,999.\n\nWith that said, there is no clear winner at this point. Your choice should be based on what you want from a phone. If you're looking for a camera-centric device under \u20b940,000, the Vivo V40 is a solid option. However, if you prefer a metallic design, a flat display, strong performance, and arguably a cleaner software experience with OxygenOS, the OnePlus Nord 4 might be the better choice for you.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnePlus_Nord", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OnePlus Nord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivo_(technology_company)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vivo (technology company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokeh", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bokeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_stabilization", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Image stabilization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LG_V30", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LG V30"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephoto_lens", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Telephoto lens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindustan_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hindustan Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Camera phone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_of_view", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Field of view"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Android (operating system)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipset", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chipset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "System on a chip"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMOLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AMOLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnePlus_3", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OnePlus 3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OxygenOS", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OxygenOS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refresh_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Refresh rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2024/08/07/1600x900/vivo_v40_india_price_1723016585054_1723016605882.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793519", "eventUri": "eng-9793519", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

In the V40 series, Vivo has clearly emphasised the camera features, as both phones come with ZEISS-integrated cameras. However, with the Vivo V40 Pro, the phone excels in every area -- a MediaTek Dimensity 9200+ SoC, an AMOLED display, a sophisticated design, and a battery that offers impressive longevity.\n\nBut with competitors like the Xiaomi 14 CIVI, iQOO 12, and Honor 200 Pro, can it truly provide the best of everything at Rs 49,999? Find out in my review.\n\nThe Vivo V40 Pro will be available on Vivo eStore in two variants.\n\nThe Vivo V40 Pro reminds me of the Vivo X100. There, I said it. This phone exudes a premium feel with its colour, grip, and overall comfort. Plus, despite having a 5500mAh battery, it's incredibly slim.\n\nI got the Titanium Grey colourway, and the back panel is truly impressive. It has some weight to it, but not so much that it becomes uncomfortable to hold.\n\nThe pill-shaped camera module on the back is a departure from the usual Vivo design, and it actually looks good. I appreciate how Vivo changes its design language with each new phone they release. It shows they understand their customers, as design is often the first thing that catches the eye.\n\nThe Vivo V40 Pro features an in-display fingerprint sensor that consistently worked within seconds every time I unlocked my phone. I encountered no issues, allowing me to use my phone immediately after unlocking it.\n\nThis smartphone features an AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, similar to the Vivo X100. Additionally, the V40 Pro offers a peak brightness of 4500 nits, which is 1500 nits more than the X100. So, you get a lot of value at a mid-range premium price. As for indoor and outdoor brightness levels, the phone is very bright in both conditions, which is quite good.\n\nI watched A Good Girl's Guide to Murder on Netflix and had a great experience. The colours, brightness, and black levels are excellent. With Widevine L1 and HDR 10 support, multimedia consumption on this device is top-notch.\n\nUnfortunately, I'm not as impressed with the sound. The primary speaker performs well, but the secondary speaker sounds distorted and strained at volumes above 70 per cent.\n\nThe MediaTek Dimensity 9200+ SoC is featured in the Vivo S19 Pro and Xiaomi 13T Pro -- neither of which has been launched in India. Hence, this is the first device with this chipset in India.\n\nIn synthetic benchmarks, the phone performed impressively. This AnTuTu score surpasses that of the OPPO Reno 12 Pro, OnePlus Nord 4, and Honor 200 Pro. However, it does fall short compared to the Motorola Edge 50 Ultra and the iQOO 12, both of which fall under the same price range.\n\nCasual tasks run smoothly on this phone, as expected. Most devices handle basic functions well, so this shouldn't be a concern here.\n\nNow, let's look at the table below to see how it fared in gaming. I tested it with Call of Duty: Mobile, and the results are quite surprising!\n\nOverall, the gaming experience was quite smooth. However, I want to mention that I tested the phone twice -- once before the software update and once after. Before the update, the performance was problematic due to significant heating. Fortunately, Vivo released an update that resolved this issue. After the update, the performance was exceptionally smooth.\n\nThe phone comes with Funtouch OS 14, based on Android 14, out of the box. With the V40 series, Vivo has introduced AI features such as AI Group Portrait, AI Eraser, and AI Photo Enhancer. I tested the AI Eraser, and it performed rather average. It might improve with a software update, as the current performance struggled with removing unwanted objects and even added something that looked odd.\n\nThe AI Group Portrait feature is impressive, managing to capture up to 30 people without blurring. For the AI Photo Enhancer, I tried enhancing the pictures but I found little to no changes in the pictures.\n\nOverall, the UI is interactive and free of excessive notifications, though the phone does come with its fair share of bloatware and pre-installed Vivo apps.\n\nFor longevity, the brand provides three years of OS updates and four years of security updates. While this is decent, it could be better, as other manufacturers are now offering updates for six to seven years.\n\nNow, let's delve into the crucial part of this review -- the Vivo V40 Pro features a triple 50-megapixel rear camera setup with ZEISS integration and a 50-megapixel front camera for selfies.\n\nThe primary camera captures sharp images with precise details. I observed that the pictures are slightly enhanced after a second or two of processing. The shadows, highlights, and white balance are all excellent.\n\nHowever, daylight shots taken with the ultra-wide camera exhibit distortion at the edges. This is not an issue as such, but how the ultra-wide camera is in nature. For example, in one photo, the car at the edge appears stretched, which looks quite strange.\n\nThe portrait shots are exceptional, with precise edge detection, natural skin tones, and a beautifully blurred background. It reminds me of the impressive performance of the Xiaomi 14 CIVI and Honor 200 Pro in this area.\n\nPhotos taken with the telephoto camera at 3x and 4x are generally good, but this quality doesn't extend to portraits. Skin tones appear reddish, especially on the cheeks and lips, giving a tinted look. When capturing buildings or landscapes at 4x, the images are quite good in daylight. Unfortunately, in low light conditions, they tend to become slightly grainy.\n\nThe Vivo V40 Pro offers seven ZEISS style Bokeh effects: Cine-Flare, Cinematic, Planar, Biotar, Distagon, Sonnar, and B-Speed. Each effect is designed for different photography conditions. For example, the Distagon effect is perfect for travel photography, while the Biotar effect is best for mid-close-up portraits. So, if you're a portrait photography enthusiast, you'll definitely appreciate the capabilities of this phone.\n\nThe rear Smart Aura light is very useful for taking pictures in dim light conditions, offering a light source comparable to studio lighting. The pictures taken with it appear vibrant and flashy, which is exactly what you want.\n\nIn low light conditions, the camera provides an additional light source to capture as much detail as possible. The pictures turn out well in most conditions without any noise. However, lens flare can be an issue when photographing lamps, especially in portrait photos -- there's often a lot of noise in the background instead of a smooth blur.\n\nRegarding selfies, the selfie camera is set to a filter by default, making pictures immediately ready for social media. However, when you select 'None' as the filter, pores and blemishes become visible in the selfies, providing a natural look.\n\nAs for battery life, the recent software update has addressed all previous issues. The battery performance is excellent. I charged the phone on August 4th and used it extensively, including playing heavy games for two hours, taking photos, and testing AI features. On August 5th, I did not use the phone at all. As of today, while writing this review, the phone is still at 62 per cent. Thus, battery life should be more than adequate for both casual and heavy users.\n\nThe Vivo V40 Pro excels in many areas like the cameras, performance, battery, display, and design. It's an all-in-one package for those who want the best of everything. Moreover, it includes a variety of AI features, which are in line with the tech trends of 2024.\n\nHowever, you might need to compromise on the pre-installed Vivo apps, bloatware, and sound quality. But let's be honest -- no phone is perfect. If I could get a package with minimal drawbacks, I'd definitely choose it. The question is: are you willing to overlook a few minor issues to enjoy the best of almost all worlds?\n\nThat said, at its price range, the V40 Pro also faces competition from the iQOO 12 and the Motorola Edge 50 Ultra. Keeping in mind the upper variant of the phone, it also invites the OnePlus 12 into the arena. All of these phones serve different purposes. So, the choice is yours.", "source": {"uri": "mysmartprice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MySmartPrice.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "shimul_sood@mysmartprice.com", "name": "Shimul Sood", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivo_(technology_company)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vivo (technology company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiaomi", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Xiaomi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMOLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "AMOLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_MediaTek_systems_on_chips", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "List of MediaTek systems on chips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IQOO", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "IQOO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaTek", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "MediaTek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "System on a chip"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widevine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Widevine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_dynamic_range", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "High dynamic range"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_cache", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CPU cache"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Design language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refresh_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Refresh rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titanium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Titanium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fingerprint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimedia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Multimedia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Operating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patch (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone_12_Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "IPhone 12 Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_Edge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Motorola Edge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oppo", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oppo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnePlus", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "OnePlus"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment_and_Services", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Photography/Equipment and Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://assets.mspimages.in/gear/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2-1.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793519", "eventUri": "eng-9793519", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-04", "textStart": 6979, "textEnd": 6989}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-05", "textStart": 7103, "textEnd": 7113}], "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

The Vivo V40 tries to replicate the same formula as the Vivo V30 last year, with largely the same specs, but a new starting price tag of Rs 34,999. Here's a detailed review of the Vivo V40, where you'll know whether you should purchase it or consider other options in the segment.\n\nThe Vivo V40 distinguishes itself from its predecessor with a revamped design. The blue model we have gets a wavy pattern underneath the glass, which shines uniquely when light falls on it.\n\nWhile the frame is plastic, the glass on the back and the front curve on the sides, accounting for a comfortable grip in the hand. It also feels quite premium in the hand, and because it's lightweight and narrow, one-handed use doesn't cause hand fatigue.\n\nThe camera module on the back also plays a major role in the design because it creates an identity for the device, as it has been given a unique shape. There's a metallic ring around the module, while the camera island itself has a dual-tone design, including elements such as glass and metal.\n\nThe right buttons feel tactile when clicked. The device is also IP69 rated, meaning submersion in water or exposure to dirt shouldn't adversely affect it.\n\nOverall, I'd say Vivo V40 is definitely one of the most beautifully crafted smartphones in its segment.\n\nAnother aspect of design and in-hand feel is haptics, which are subpar on this Vivo device. Like the Honor 200 5G, they are rattly and not tight at all because the motor used in budget smartphones is the same.\n\nAs for the speaker setup, there are dual speakers on the Vivo V40 which sound quite decent. While they lack bass, they are loud enough with good instrument separation, making the whole listening experience a pleasant one.\n\nAs for the display on the front, it's a 6.78-inch AMOLED Display with a 1.5K 2800\u00d71260 Pixels resolution, 120Hz refresh rate, punch-hole cutout, 20:9 aspect ratio, 89.9% screen-to-body ratio, 452 ppi, 4500 nits peak brightness and 100% DCI-P3 colour gamut.\n\nAs the specs show, this panel is impressive, similar to previous Vivo AMOLED panels we tested. It's bright, vivid, and sharp. The curves on each side look appealing, and the viewing angles are impressive, too. It also supports eye protection mode, where the screen colour automatically adjusts according to your environment for the best viewing experience.\n\nThe display is also quite responsive to the touch. However, even with a 120Hz refresh rate, I cannot say it's the smoothest because the Refresh Rate mostly stays at 90Hz even when it's set to \"Smart Switch.\" Even when set to 120Hz at all times, it still switches to 90Hz during some animations, such as opening or closing apps. We haven't faced this issue before on Vivo and iQOO devices, so we hope Vivo fixes it with an update soon.\n\nThe in-display optical fingerprint sensor works without any issues. It's quick to read the print and is accurate as well.\n\nRead More: Vivo Y28s, Vivo Y28e Launched in India: Price, Specs, Availability\n\nThe Vivo V40 is powered by the Snapdragon 7 Gen 3 Processor paired with up to 12GB of LPDDR4x RAM and 256GB of UFS 2.2 storage. Vivo sent us the 8GB + 128GB model, and for the price, we feel that 128GB of storage is quite low, while the base storage should have been 256GB.\n\nNonetheless, the device actually holds up well in most scenarios, except for demanding tasks where the phone slightly struggles. However, for day-to-day use, I didn't face any major issues at all.\n\nThe device reacted smoothly to my commands, such as switching apps, and was efficient in other operations, including RAM management. Apps like Instagram, Snapchat, WhatsApp, Chrome, and more worked without any glitches.\n\nThe Vivo V40 runs on FunTouch OS 14 and will get 3 years of major OS upgrades with 4 years of security patches. FunTouch OS 14 has been good with features for a while now, and it doesn't really lack behind except in one area: basic animations.\n\nWhile the performance is surely decent, the smoothness of the animations isn't. I noticed some animations, stuttering, and inconsistencies across the whole user interface. For instance, the App opening and closing animations do not always originate from the app icon and fly in or out from/to anywhere on the screen.\n\nAgain, as I said, FunTouch OS may lag behind in animations, but it doesn't in terms of features. You get plenty of dynamic effects to choose various types of elements of System UI such as fingerprint icon, animation speed, etc.\n\nA bunch of Always-on display styles are available, too, alongside app lock functionality, wallpaper-based theming of system and icons, sliding effects in launcher, and much more. A new option, also found in One UI, allows the Always-on display to turn on as soon as new notifications arrive.\n\nFor those who want to game on the device (even though it won't be the best at it), there's an ultra-game mode with options allowing you to block notifications or mute calls while gaming, a game sidebar, E-sports mode, and more.\n\nVivo also uses the ring flashlight on the back with a feature called dynamic light. With it turned on, the light on the back can softly flash to notify you of incoming calls and notifications. You can also use it during music playback.\n\nThen there's a new Voice Isolation feature where, during a call, the ambient noises will be dialled down so your voice is prioritized. Additionally, features like double-tap to wake the screen or turn it off, three-finger screenshots, floating windows for multitasking, and more are also available.\n\nThe device is running on the June 2024 security patch out of the box, which we feel should change soon to the August 2024 patch. However, we haven't received any update as of now.\n\nConnectivity performance of the handset, including that of Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and 5G, remained optimum.\n\nThe Vivo V40 is backed up by a 5500mAh battery with 80W fast charging. Vivo now also offers the ability to view the maximum battery health in terms of percentage, similar to how iPhones do. The V40 can also intelligently pause and resume charging based on your nighttime charging patterns if you enable the \"Smart optimisation based on habit\" option.\n\nAs for the battery backup, the device can easily last two days with moderate usage. My usage included a good amount of calling while browsing social media apps like Instagram, watching videos on YouTube, and chatting on WhatsApp.\n\nThe device easily lasted me for about 1.5 days with a screen-on time of slightly over 8 hours which is outstanding. Even with cycles including heavier usage patterns, the device easily lasted a day.\n\nThe Vivo V40 charges from 0% to 100% in under an hour, which is remarkable.\n\nThe Vivo V40 packs a dual camera setup on the back, consisting of an OIS-assisted 50-megapixel f/1.88 primary camera, and a 50-megapixel f/2.0 ultra-wide lens. There's a 50-megapixel selfie camera with f/2.0 aperture.\n\nThe Vivo V40 is packed with camera features that photography enthusiasts will appreciate. On the hardware side, it includes an aura light for portraits, with adjustable temperature and brightness. Software features include various bokeh effects and multiple Portrait mode focal lengths, offering different styles and colour tones.\n\nPortrait shots are vibrant and detailed, with natural-looking bokeh and precise EDGE detection. Regular photos come in Vivid, textured, and Zeiss-tuned natural modes, each enhancing colors and details uniquely. The Vivid mode is particularly striking, though all modes capture excellent photos with high dynamic range, fast focusing, and minimal shutter lag.\n\nZoom quality declines after 2x, with 10x and 20x zoom resulting in poor quality. Ultra-wide shots maintain colour and sharpness but have noticeable edge distortion. In low light, the aura light helps capture details and colours well, though colours fade slightly without it.\n\nSelfies feature accurate skin tones, vivid colours, and great detail, with various bokeh effects available. Shots in artificial lighting are noise-free and detailed. Night shots are well-exposed, detailed, and noise-free, even in very dark conditions. Overall, the Vivo V40 offers a versatile and high-quality camera experience.\n\nCheck out our detailed camera review of the Vivo V40 5 G for a more comprehensive look at the device's cameras.", "source": {"uri": "themobileindian.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Mobile Indian"}, "authors": [{"uri": "abhishek_malhotra@themobileindian.com", "name": "Abhishek Malhotra", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivo_(technology_company)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vivo (technology company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refresh_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Refresh rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Animation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Operating system"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Modular programming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Software bug"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMOLED", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "AMOLED"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icon_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Icon (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haptic_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Haptic technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "5G"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerprint", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fingerprint"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pixel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Random-access memory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Plastic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photography", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Photography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Metal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Always-on_display", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Always-on display"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPDDR", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LPDDR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Switch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nintendo Switch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WhatsApp", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "WhatsApp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snapchat", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Snapchat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lens"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Desktop_Customization", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Desktop Customization", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Graphics", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Graphics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.themobileindian.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Vivo-v40-review.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793519", "eventUri": "eng-9793519", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

We partnered with ZEISS to co-engineer a professional-level portrait system that provides endless opportunities for creativity and self-expression,\" said Yongduan Zhou, General Manager of the Overseas Product Department at vivo. \"The long-lasting battery, effortless performance, immersive display, and intuitive interface ensure that users can stay connected, productive, and entertained throughout their day. We think of each device as more than a smartphone, it is a companion that enhances every aspect of your digital life.\"\n\nAll you Need for Portrait Photography\n\nV40 series is meticulously engineered for professional-level portrait photography. Both V40 and V40 Pro achieve the quality and imaging performance standards jointly defined by vivo and ZEISS. This ensures the exceptional image quality and creative control that ZEISS Optics are known for.\n\nUsers can capture every detail with the 50 MP ZEISS OIS Main Camera2, available on both models. The 50 MP ZEISS OIS Main Camera3 on V40 Pro uses the new 1/1.56-inch Sony IMX921 sensor, while V40 features the 1/1.56-inch Samsung ISOCELL GNJ Sensor. Both models have an f/1.88 aperture that enhances light intake, ensuring clear portraits and landscape photos at night. The powerful Optical Image stabilization (OIS) further reduces blur and achieves a 2.8\u00d74 light intake for consistently sharp and bright images.\n\nFor capturing portraits or distant subjects with remarkable clarity, V40 Pro boasts an exclusive 50 MP ZEISS Telephoto Portrait Camera5. This camera features the Sony IMX816 sensor and allows for 2x optical zoom and up to 50x ZEISS Ultra HD Zoom.\n\nBoth V40 and V40 Pro feature a 50 MP ZEISS Ultra Wide-Angle Camera6 with an f/2.0 aperture and autofocus tracking.

At the front, the 50 MP ZEISS Group Selfie Camera8 is equipped with smart autofocus, helping users take detailed and colorful selfies. The front camera image quality is further improved thanks to the AI Facial Contouring Technology that effectively reduces common facial distortion9 issues, including protruding or enlarged facial features, resulting in more natural-looking portraits.\n\nThe new V40 series goes beyond the ordinary with innovative features that empower creativity.\n\nWith ZEISS Multifocal Portrait, users can integrate professional portrait focal lengths into their mobile photography. V40 Pro offers 24 mm, 35 mm, 50 mm, 85 mm, and 100 mm focal lengths, while V40 supports 24 mm, 35 mm and 50 mm. For a seamless point-and-shoot experience, V40 series offers master-level professional portrait templates tailored to various scenarios. Each focal length offers optimized color tones and is paired with a corresponding ZEISS Style Bokeh, offering a variety of powerful portrait effects.\n\nPortrait captured on V40 Pro using ZEISS Multifocal Portrait with a 50 mm focal length.

It's got Zeiss triple optics and does especially well for portraits. In terms of the camera it's not really an upgrade from the predecessor, but there's some welcome improvements in terms of other aspects of the hardware. Overall, it's a great option - hopefully it will come to more markets around the world in time.\n\nOne of several Chinese brands currently bringing lots of high-quality smartphones to the market, Vivo's point of difference from the others is that it has worked with noted lens manufacturer, Zeiss, for the optics. This is a partnership that has been going for a while now, with the latest V40 Pro offering specific portrait photography functionality, such as an \"aura\" light and a well-featured portrait mode.\n\nVivo V40 Pro at a glance:\n\nThe V40 Pro sits above the standard V40, offering an extra lens compared to that lower priced model. The V40 range comes only a few months after the V30, and there doesn't appear to be a huge amount of difference between it and its predecessor, at least in terms of the camera. The older model was also designed with portrait photography in mind.\n\nThis time around it seems that some added functionality, such as a waterproof body and a redesigned lens array is what Vivo hopes will tempt you away from the likes of the iPhone and the Samsung, and opt for this instead.\n\nIt's also available in different markets from the V30 Pro. At the time of writing, the Vivo V40 Pro was only available in India, with promises that it will be made available in \"other markets\" to follow. The V30 Pro never made it to big markets such as the US and UK, so it'll be interesting to see if the same is true of the V40 Pro.\n\nAs is starting to become the norm now for flagship models, the V40 Pro has a triple lens setup - as mentioned, all three have been made in partnership with Zeiss. What is a little more unusual is for all three to have high resolutions - all three here have 50MP, with two of the sensors (the wide and the portrait) having Sony sensors. This should, in theory at least, give us pretty good image quality.\n\nThe main camera has a 23mm f/1.9 equivalent lens, while the ultrawide is 15mm f/2.0. The third lens is a 50mm f/1.9 equivalent - this makes it quite a bit shorter than many of the telephoto lenses we usually find on smartphones, but perhaps makes sense when portraits is the key selling point of this lens.\n\nSpeaking of which, as we saw in the V30 Pro, we've got an \"Aura light\" here for the V40 Pro - although this time it has been upgraded. It promises to be three times brighter than its predecessor, and 50 times softer when compared to a \"regular\" flash. Vivo doesn't say what it means by regular flash - whether they mean on a smartphone, camera, or external flash. Either way, it should give a softer and more flattering effect. Another new feature is the ability to use different illuminations depending on how close to the subject you are.\n\nMore portrait goodies come in the form of different recreations of Zeiss lenses in the camera app, as well as different smoothing and bokeh effects. Video recording is available up to 4K 60fps, as well as an array of other video modes such as slo-mo and so on.\n\nThe front camera has some great specifications for this price point. It's 50MP, also has Zeiss optics with an f/2.0 lens and AF. This is much better than the selfie cameras you'll find on even top-end flagships such as the iPhone 15 Pro Max.\n\nThe battery has seen an improvement, now coming in at 5500mAh - sadly there's still no wireless charging, although there is quick charging.\n\nFor a phone which has a 5500 mAh battery, the Vivo V40 Pro is impressively slim. It's also got neatly rounded edges and a curved screen giving it a very sleek and attractive appearance. I've been using the \"Moonlight White\" colour way, which has a marble like appearance on the back.\n\nVivo says that the V40 Pro has a \"Comprehensive Cushioning Structure\", which is designed to improve durability. It also has Schott Alpha glass to withstand drops, along with a reinforced frame. Overall it's pretty nice looking and seemingly quite tough, but, the phone is pretty slippy so I'd encourage the use of a case. Luckily, a simple clear one comes in the case so you can protect it right from the get go. The V40 Pro also now has IP68 dust and waterproofing, which is a notable improvement from the V30 Pro, which only had IP54 (essentially making it splashproof, rather than submersible).\n\nThe screen size is 6.78-inches, placing it at the slightly larger end of the scale. Whether you like big smartphones is a matter of personal preference, but it certainly shows off your photos and videos very well. The screen is also nicely detailed and with its 4500 nits maximum brightness (an improvement from the V30 Pro's 2800 nits peak) great to look at - again it's pretty impressive at its mid-range price point.\n\nAlthough the camera specifications appear to be very similar when compared to the predecessor, the housing for the units has changed. They're now found in a circular design, rather than square. It looks a bit more unusual and attractive, compared with the standard or average look of the predecessor. The aura light is also much smaller (albeit more powerful in output) than before.\n\nAnother thing that comes in the box is a fast charger. It's disappointing not to see wireless charging - personally I like to be able to just plonk my phone on a wireless charger, but it's not unusual for mid-range phones not to offer it.\n\nThere's a lot going on in the V40 Pro's native camera app, with both straightforward options that allow you to simply point and shoot, as well as more advanced and complex modes.\n\nThe default shooting mode is Photo, which is what most will probably use for the majority of their shots. You can access any of the three lenses in this mode, as well as pinching to zoom to 50x digital zoom.\n\nThree different colour options are available to shoot in, with the default being \"Vivid\". I used this most of the time as it produced bright and punchy colours. But there's also \"Textured\" and \"Zeiss Natural\" - the latter of which is designed to be a little bit more muted.\n\nAs I found with the V30 Pro, there's no automatic switching on of a macro mode here, which is a shame. You can tap Super Macro if you want to get very close to a subject though - it seems to work by switching to the ultrawide camera and cropping afterwards. Other shooting modes include Pro, for taking control of lots of different parameters and shooting in raw mode.\n\nPortrait mode is very comprehensive, which makes sense considering Portraits is the USP of this device. You can choose between different focal lengths, which are laid out as 24, 35, 50, 85 and 100mm. Alternatively if you press the lens icon, you can access the \"Portrait lens kit\", which is essentially some presets that you can work with, for example \"24mm Landscape portrait\", or \"50mm natural portrait\", \"100mm close-up\" and so on. Some of these have different colour tones so are worth experimenting with. You can also choose the shape and style of bokeh (or switch it off entirely). The bokehs have been designed to recreate Zeiss lenses, so for example you can have \"Planar\" (oval shaped) bokeh, or \"B-speed\" (triangular shaped). You can of course go for simple rounded bokeh too.\n\nThere's \"Beauty\" options which are switched on by default. This goes overboard with smoothing out skin and adding fake make-up, so your portraits tend to come out looking fake/ plastic. I opt to switch this off, but some may like it. Without it, portraits look a lot more natural and realistic. Also interesting is a Posture guide, where you can have overlays of postures on the screen to help a model get into the right pose.\n\nThe Aura Light can be set to be on or off, and you can adjust the brightness, as well as the colour temperature of it. It comes in useful for indoor portraits, but also for outdoor work where a little fill-in light can help balance out shadows.\n\nFor low light, you have two options. You can leave the phone in Photo mode and it will automatically activate a basic night mode, or you can set it directly to Night mode, where it will generally shoot for longer / more exposures than in the basic setup. If it's very dark, you might find it needs to shoot for several seconds, so you'll need to be as still as possible.\n\nAs I expected, image quality is pretty much the same as with the V30 Pro, as the camera setup is virtually identical.\n\nThe three high-resolution sensors perform well, and its impressive the quality you get for a mid-range phone, often these can skimp on performance, but the V40 Pro does very well.\n\nColours are pretty well represented, and there's fairly colour matching between the lenses. Shooting in the Vibrant colour mode is mostly fine, though you might find if there's large expanses of blue and/or green in your shot, then switching to the more muted \"Natural\" represents things a little more accurately. On the whole, detail is pretty good, especially if you're not examining too closely along the edges of the frame for example - which most people won't be doing on their phone.\n\nIf we have a look at the zoom range above, you can see how you can go from ultrawide to 50x zoom. The 4x is also a digital option but actually produces usable results. I wouldn't bother with the 50x digital option unless absolutely desperate, but you can get some good results in between, up to around 10x.\n\nWith low light, you can get some usable results, particularly if there is at least a little bit of light somewhere in the scene. In very dark scenarios, the results are a little less impressive, with the phone sometimes going a bit overboard to produce an unrealistic result - making it look brighter than it is. You get the best results from the 1x lens, as I'd generally expect. The ultrawide and the telephoto lenses do OK, especially again for the price point.\n\nPortrait mode does a great job, and if you're interested mainly in portraits this should be a good contender for your cash. The range of different modes makes it great fun and you get some fantastic results, especially if you turn off the image smoothing. Outlines are in general fairly good, but as we often see with phones, sometimes it can look a bit fake if you examine closely - especially if there's anything complex going on in the background. The aura light comes in useful for filling in light, too.\n\nThe selfie camera does a good job as well. It's quite rare to see such a high-resolution selfie camera, especially at this price point, and especially that has AF too. There are again strange face smoothing effects, which you can choose to leave on if you like, but I much prefer the \"real\" version of my face.\n\nNot having an automatic macro option is a shame, but, for a mid-range phone it's not wholly unexpected - some flagships don't have a macro option at all. The super mcro option gets you pretty close and while the results aren't amazing if you examine them closely, it's again pretty good for using at small sizes and so on.\n\nVideo is available up to 4K 60fps, but at that frame rate you don't get stabilisation. That means that your handheld results can be a little shaky at times. Switching to the 30fps option results in much smoother video. Generally though, detail and quality is good and it's certainly more than good enough for the typical types of clips most phone users will be wanting to record.\n\nAt the time of writing, the V40 Pro was only available in India, with the price yet to be confirmed. However I'd expect it to follow on from the V30 Pro in terms of pricing, being sub $500/\u00a3500 equivalent. That would mean it sits firmly in the mid-range and compares with models such as the Google Pixel 8a, Honor 200 Pro and the Samsung Galaxy S23.\n\nHopefully it will eventually come to other markets, such as the US and Europe, as this is a great phone for the expected price and should represent decent value for money.\n\nThere's a lot to be impressed by with the Vivo V40 Pro, with lots of good specifications in an attractive device that is well-priced.\n\nIn terms of the camera, and therefore image quality, this doesn't represent a big leap in quality from its predecessor, the V30 Pro. Considering that's less than a year old, that's no surprise. The improvements come from elsewhere, such as having a bigger battery and a new IP68 waterproof rating - both of which are welcome improvements.\n\nOn the whole, image quality - albeit not improved from before - is great. It also looks nice and has a great native camera app. I find the Portrait mode to be particularly impressive, and it produces some lovely results too.\n\nThe biggest downside here is that the Vivo V40 Pro is not available widely. For the time being, only India has it. Hopefully it'll come to other markets as it could represent one of the best mid-range phones on the market, and certainly one of the best for portraits. For those that can buy it, it comes highly recommended.", "source": {"uri": "amateurphotographer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Amateur Photographer"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivo_(technology_company)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vivo (technology company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LG_V30", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LG V30"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lens"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portrait_photography", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Portrait photography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Zeiss_AG", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carl Zeiss AG"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Optics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sensor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokeh", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bokeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterproofing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Waterproofing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagship", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Flagship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-number", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "F-number"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "IPhone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_code", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "IP code"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra_wide_angle_lens", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ultra wide angle lens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephoto_lens", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Telephoto lens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_motion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Slow motion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macro_photography", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Macro photography"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_orientation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Page orientation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_charging", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inductive charging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_charger", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Battery charger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Samsung"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "China"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "China"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "India"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Pranks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Accessories", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Photography/Accessories", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://amateurphotographer.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/08/vivo_v40_pro_18.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793519", "eventUri": "eng-9793519", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

The Vivo V40 Pro gets a bigger battery, continues to feature its ZEISS-backed cameras, and comes with the MediaTek Dimensity 9200+ chipset. The device competes with some popular phones in the sub-Rs 50,000 segment, including the recently launched Xiaomi 14 Civi (review) and the Realme GT 6 (review).\n\nBoth the Realme GT 6 and Xiaomi 14 Civi share a few similarities in their processing power as they feature Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 chipset. But is the Dimensity 9200+ a better chipset when it comes to raw performance? Let's find out.\n\nThe Geekbench benchmark test helps us evaluate the CPU's performance capabilities of a smartphone's chipset. Performance output is usually a factor of both the raw power output of a CPU and the available memory at a chipset's disposal. The Vivo V40 Pro registered a score of 1811 in the single-core test and 5299 in the multi-core test. The Realme GT 6 and Xiaomi 14 Civi attained scores of 1852 and 1913, respectively, in the single-core tests and 4761 and 5087, respectively, in the multi-core tests.\n\nFrom the Geekbench scores, we can see that all three phones are more or less on the same playing field when it comes to their single-core performance, with the Xiaomi 14 Civi leading the pack. Single-core performance usually affects tasks like word processing, web browsing, and app loading speeds. The Xiaomi 14 Civi is likely to offer slightly better performance in these tasks. The Vivo V40 Pro takes the lead when it comes to multi-core performance, which dictates tasks like video and photo editing, 3D gaming, etc. So you're more likely to enjoy better gaming performance on the Vivo V40 Pro than the Realme GT 6 and Xiaomi 14 Civi.\n\nWinner: Xiaomi 14 Civi in Single-Core & Vivo V40 Pro in Multi-Core\n\nThe AnTuTu benchmark test is a more comprehensive testing standard compared to the Geekbench benchmark test. It also assesses a smartphone's GPU performance, memory performance, and user experience score, in addition to its CPU performance. The Vivo V40 Pro registered the highest aggregate AnTuTu score among the three at 15,24,110 points. The Realme GT 6 follows closely and logged a score of 15,01,830, and the Xiaomi 14 Civi, trails at the end with a score of 14,43,011.\n\nThe difference comes mainly from the Vivo V40's substantial lead in GPU score (577207) compared to the Realme GT 6 (496134) and Xiaomi 14 Civi (501048). This tells us that the Vivo V40 Pro should deliver better performance in GPU-based tasks like gaming. The Xiaomi 14 Civi was a frontrunner in Geekbench scores, but in AnTuTu's CPU performance, it was at the bottom of the pack with a score of 353184 points. The Realme GT 6 registers a score of 382039, while the Vivo V40 Pro is in the lead with a score of 392576.\n\nWinner: Vivo V40 Pro\n\nWe use the burnout benchmark app to gauge the stability of a processor's performance when put under stress. The test runs for roughly 9 minutes and gives the smartphone a percentage score of its total performance output when throttled. The higher the score, the better a chipset can manage stress and offer more stability under intense loads. All three phones face a lot of issues when it comes to maintaining their performance output under stress.\n\nHowever, the Vivo V40 Pro took the lead with a total output of 46.3 percent, while the Realme GT 6 and Xiaomi 14 Civi both hover around 40 percent. The latter two feature the same chipset, which explains a similar performance throttling score. From the test, the Vivo V40 Pro seems to be the more reliable of the lot if you want to squeeze out better performance under strenuous loads.\n\nWinner: Vivo V40 Pro\n\nFor the gaming test, we played BGMI, COD: Mobile and Real Racing 3 for roughly 30 minutes each to gauge their performance output. The Realme GT 6 took a clear lead when it comes to pure gaming capabilities. It's well-optimised for gaming and consistently delivers the best average FPS in all games between the three phones. You can check out below the gaming resolution for each game and the average FPS they delivered:\n\nBut FPS is not the only thing that's important in gaming. We also noted the thermals of all three phones to find out how they handle heat while gaming. It is important, as phones that can dissipate heat more effectively have a better lifespan compared to phones that do not. The Vivo V40 Pro showcased a total temperature increase of 16.3 (5.4 average) degrees Celsius across all three games.\n\nThe Realme GT 6 showcased a total temperature increase of 19.3 (6.4 average) degrees Celsius, and the Xiaomi 14 Civi registered the highest increase of 23.4 (7.8 average) degrees Celsius. In conclusion, the Vivo V40 Pro offers the best thermal management between the three phones, with just an average temperature increase of 5.4 degrees Celsius for each game.\n\nWinner: Realme GT 6 in Gaming performance & Vivo V40 Pro in thermal management\n\nFrom the comparison above, it is easy to note that all three phones have their strengths. According to us, the Vivo V40 Pro is the winner overall as it leads in benchmark numbers and offers better stability compared to the other two. Its gaming performance is also just marginally behind the Realme GT 6, so the phone offers the best of both worlds.\n\nThe Xiaomi 14 Civi lies comfortably in the middle, with good benchmark scores but the least impressive gaming performance between the three. If you are a general user, all of these phones will deliver snappy day-to-day performance, and you won't face any issues. For heavy users, the Vivo V40 Pro makes more sense as it offers better stability and delivers a well-rounded performance output. Gamers are better off with the Realme GT 6, as it consistently delivers the best gaming numbers among the three.", "source": {"uri": "91mobiles.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "91mobiles.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_MediaTek_systems_on_chips", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "List of MediaTek systems on chips"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realme", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Realme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivo_(technology_company)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vivo (technology company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiaomi", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Xiaomi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmark_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Benchmark (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chipset", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chipset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Central processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-core_processor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Multi-core processor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Smartphone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geekbench", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Geekbench"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AnTuTu", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "AnTuTu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_battery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electric battery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LG_V30", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LG V30"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualcomm_Snapdragon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Qualcomm Snapdragon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_processor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Word processor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaTek", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MediaTek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Graphics processing unit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor_register", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Processor register"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "3D computer graphics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "User experience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Frame rate"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Puzzle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Puzzle", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Adventure", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Adventure", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Slots", "label": "dmoz/Games/Gambling/Slots", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Economy_and_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Economy and Trading", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.91-cdn.com/hub/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Vivo-V40-Pro-vs-Realme-GT-6-vs-Xiaomi-14-Civi-performance.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9793519", "eventUri": "eng-9793519", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

Women of all demographics look forward to a unique, yet stylish selection of apparel, accessories, beauty products and home goods, all meticulously designed and crafted in Kenya.\n\n\"It's a modern take on contemporary African fashion. One of our selling points is to provide affordable and stylish options for ladies who want to look good without breaking their bank,\" Vivo U.S. Business lead Michelle Gatonye said.\n\nIn 2011, Wandia Gichuru and Anne Marie Burugu founded Vivo in Nairobi with intentions of producing all items in Kenya in order to offer local African women quality clothes for affordable prices. A bulk of apparel stores in Kenya frequently import products internationally. Not only do these stores sell for high prices, but the clothes tend to not compliment African skin tones and body sizes.\n\nGichuru practiced yoga and her children pursued ballet, but she faced difficulty in finding appropriate attire. This challenge sparked her business idea of selling dance attire at Vivo. However, the fitness market was not big enough, inspiring her to incorporate everyday yet stretchy and vibrant clothing to the mix. Customers were happy with this young and modern look, so Gichuru decided to further expand.\n\nFast forward 13 years, Vivo has 27 locations: 23 in Kenya, two in Rwanda, one in Uganda and one in Atlanta with about 450 employees total. Taking into consideration the climatic conditions, economic factors and the significant presence of the Black community, establishing a Vivo store in Atlanta proved to be the optimal move for the brand.\n\nThe store's inclusivity not only appeals to the average woman, but it will also likely garner support from nearby HBCU students, including those from Spelman and Clark Atlanta University.\n\nVivo constantly demonstrates their support for other Kenyan women-owned brands by retailing their products in the Atlanta store. Because expanding to another continent is an immense risk, Vivo has allowed lifestyle brands such as Soko, Angriu and Ythera to test the waters in the U.S. economy. These brands sell goods ranging from handcrafted jewelry to skincare products.\n\nWith Kenya's unemployment rate of 40%, Gichuru aims to create jobs for individuals. A handful of Kenya residents study fashion design, but are unable to secure jobs due to the high number of fashion brands importing their clothes. With clothing designs varying on the store location, Vivo has a high demand for fashion designers.\n\n\"This has been so rewarding for me because we've been able to create jobs for so many people. A lot of people in Kenya study fashion design, but can't apply their skills.

This approach attracts numerous interns, aspiring fashion designers and future entrepreneurs to work for Vivo hoping to gain insight.\n\n\"I'm a double major in fashion and finance at Virginia Tech, so I came here with hopes to grow my knowledge in the fashion world and learn about entrepreneurship.

The X100 Pro continues to be one of the strongest camera packages available today, and thanks to Zeiss integration, the V30 Pro is one of the best shooters in the mid-range segment.\n\nWhile Vivo made foldables in the past, they've been limited to its home market -- until now. The X Fold3 Pro is now available in select regions in Southeast Asia, and as a result, it now comes with the global Funtouch OS instead of the China-focused Origin OS.\n\nThere's clearly a lot to like with the device; it has the biggest and brightest panels of any foldable, ultrasonic modules embedded inside the inner and outer display, one of the best cameras in this category, and the largest battery with the best charging tech. I used the X Fold3 Pro for just over a month, and here's why I think it is the foldable to beat.\n\nVivo unveiled the X Fold3 and X Fold3 Pro in China back in Q1 2024, and the Pro variant made its global debut in June. It is now available in India and Indonesia in addition to China. While the X Fold3 Pro is available in three configurations in China -- 12GB/256GB, 16GB/512GB, and 16GB/1TB -- Vivo is just bringing the middle variant to global markets.\n\nThat's understandable, as the 16GB/512GB edition hits the sweet spot in terms of storage, and coming in at \u20b91,59,999 ($1,910), the foldable manages to undercut the Galaxy Z Fold 6, which retails in the country for \u20b91,76,999 ($2,112). I received the Indian variant of the X Fold3 Pro, and while there is a white variant on sale in China, the brand is selling the Celestial Black model as standard in global markets.\n\nThis is the third iteration of Vivo's foldable efforts, and it shows. The X Fold3 Pro is considerably thinner and lighter than its predecessor, and what I like best about the design is that Vivo somehow managed to cram sizeable panels both inside and out while still maintaining a svelte overall profile.\n\nWith an unfolded thickness of 5.2mm and 11.2mm when folded, the X Fold3 Pro handily beats the Galaxy Z Fold 6 in this area (5.6mm and 12.1mm). It is 3g lighter as well while offering a 5700mAh battery -- the largest in this segment yet. Honor's Magic V2 is still the thinnest foldable I used this year, coming in at 4.8mm, but it doesn't have as large a battery.\n\nThe weight savings are down to a redesigned hinge that has much smoother articulation -- and is much more durable. It is rated at 500,000 unlocks, and stays semi-folded at any angle between 30 to 165 degrees, giving you the ability to take interesting photos and videos. What I like most is that you get a feature similar to Standby Mode when the panel is at a semi-folded angle. Oh, and the hinge closes fully flat with no visible gap.\n\nVivo mostly kept things simple with the back design, and the foldable gets the usual glass pane. The only point of differentiation is the oversized camera module that's in line with the designs of the X100 Ultra and Pro. Like other Vivo phones, you get the Xtreme Imagination tagline etched at the back; this time, it's on the aluminum edge and not quite as noticeable.\n\nThe large camera island has a gold accent, and it juts out considerably. While this isn't an issue when the device is folded, it leads to a wobble when using the inner panel against a table. The bundled case mitigates this issue to an extent, but it is still irksome.\n\nThe OnePlus Open has a flashier design at the back thanks to the distinctive camera housing and generous use of leather, but of the two, I'm partial to the X Fold3 Pro; it delivers larger displays inside and out, and that's the whole point of a foldable. Vivo didn't omit the essentials either; the X Fold3 Pro includes IPX8 ingress protection as standard, and that allows it to weather the elements that much better.\n\nRounding out the design, there's a slider on the left that allows you to toggle silent mode. It's not as useful as the alert slider, but it isn't hard to imagine Vivo phones getting the feature in subsequent releases.\n\nThe X Fold3 Pro has a 6.53-inch outer display that folds out to an 8.03-inch inner panel, and that's noticeably bigger than what you get with the Z Fold 6 (7.6 inches). The outer panel has Armor Glass coating, and thanks to a 21:9 ration and resolution of 2748 x 1172, it is similar to using a regular phone.\n\nThe inner panel gets a resolution of 2480 x 2200, and both the inner and outer screens go up to 120Hz. But the defining point is the brightness; the X Fold3 Pro gets noticeably brighter than any other foldable I used, and this is true for both the inner and outer panels. While they go up to 4,500 nits in HDR content, it's in auto mode where I clearly saw the difference next to the Magic V2 and other 2024 releases.\n\nThere is a crease on the inner 8.03-inch panel, but it isn't particularly noticeable, and I ignored it after three days of use. While you can make out the crease, it is shallower than that on the Z Fold 6, and doesn't affect usability in any meaningful way.\n\nThere's Dolby Vision as well, and I didn't see any issues streaming HDR content in Netflix. Vivo absolutely nailed the brief in this regard, and the X Fold3 Pro has the best color accuracy and brightness of any foldable today. The onboard sound is pretty decent, and it holds up well enough in daily use.\n\nMy favorite feature is the inclusion of ultrasonic fingerprint sensors. While I don't usually like ultrasonic modules, Vivo uses Goodix sensors in its devices, and they're just as fast and reliable as optical modules while having a larger recognition area. What's noteworthy is that Vivo used two sensors -- underneath each panel -- and that gives the X Fold3 Pro a distinct edge over most of its rivals. The Z Fold 6 still has a side-mounted sensor, and it looks archaic.\n\nThere's plenty of customizability when it comes to colors and always-on styles, and Vivo's custom lighting effects are intact here, giving you extensive options to tailor the device to your preferences.\n\nLike the best foldables of 2024, the X Fold3 Pro is powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. Vivo is launching a single variant globally, and the unit has 16GB of LPDDR5 RAM and 512GB of UFS 4.0 storage. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 is a known quantity at this point, and having used it on over a dozen devices, I can safely say that it is one of Qualcomm's best chipsets to date. It has noticeable performance gains over last year, and the best part is that it has terrific efficiency.\n\nThe reason I delayed this review is that the device had buggy software out of the box; it was prone to freezing and random glitches, but a subsequent software update rolled out at the start of July sorted out the issues. Following that, I didn't notice any lag or slowdowns in daily use, and it has been just as reliable as other Vivo devices I used this year.\n\nEven though they share the same Qualcomm silicon, most foldables aren't set up for extended gaming sessions, and that's down to thermal management and throttling. Astonishingly, it wasn't an issue on the X Fold3 Pro, and it held up incredibly well even in marathon gaming sessions. There was no overheating, I got consistent framerates, and there wasn't any noticeable jitter.\n\nIn fact, its stability score of 89.9% in 3DMark's latest Steel Nomad Light test is one of the highest of any phones I tested, foldable or otherwise. Similarly impressive is the fact that it didn't cross 40 degrees Celsius; most devices with the 8 Gen 3 hit the 46-degree mark in this test.\n\nThere isn't anything missing elsewhere; the device gets a Wi-Fi 7 modem, Bluetooth 5.4, NFC, dual-band GPS, global Sub-6 5G bands, USB-C 3.2, and the entire suite of AptX codecs. The vibration motor is one of the best on a foldable, and it has exquisite feedback when navigating the interface and using the keyboard.\n\nWhile the rest of the hardware is noteworthy in its own right, where the X Fold3 Pro truly shines is the battery life. Thanks to a massive 5700mAh battery, the foldable manages to easily last a day and a half between charges, and even with heavy use, I didn't feel the need to plug in the device before the end of the day. That's a huge achievement, and no other foldable measures up to the X Fold3 Pro in this regard.\n\nWhen you need to charge the device, there's 100W charging, with Vivo bundling its 120W FlashCharge charger in the box. It takes just over 35 minutes to fully charge the battery on the device, and that's a feat in and of itself. Like Honor, Vivo is using silicon-carbide tech to prolong battery longevity, so there shouldn't be any noticeable degradation even after several years of use.\n\nOf course, you get 50W wireless charging as well, but I wasn't able to test that out as I didn't have the requisite charger. That said, the device went up to 10W over a standard Qi mat, and it has reverse charging -- ideal if you need to charge accessories on the go.\n\nVivo went with what is arguably one of the best camera packages on a foldable yet, with the X Fold3 Pro featuring a 50MP OmniVision OV50H main camera, a 50MP wide-angle lens, and a 64MP zoom camera with 3x optical zoom. There are two 32MP cameras underneath each panel, and just like the X100 Pro, all the modules are tuned by Zeiss.\n\nThe camera interface itself will be familiar if you've used a Vivo phone in the past, with the shooting modes at the bottom and all the requisite toggles and filters scattered around the viewfinder. You can easily change between the lenses, and there are three distinct color modes available: Vivid, Textured, and Zeiss Natural. Vivid is selected by default, and it produces saturated shots that look great. If you want life-like colors, the Zeiss Natural mode is the one to choose.\n\nWhen it comes to video, you get 4K60 on all the cameras at the back, and the Cinematic Portrait mode does a great job when it comes to blurring the background on the go. There's an Ultra Stabilization mode that minimizes motion when shooting handheld, but it's limited to 1080p.\n\nThe X Fold3 Pro is among the best in this category at daylight photos. Resultant shots have plenty of detail and dynamic range, and while colors tend to be overly saturated, they look great. The wide-angle lens is decent enough, but it just isn't as good as the X100 Ultra or even the X100 Pro in this regard. It still measures up to other foldables, but Vivo should have used the same module as the X100 Pro.\n\nThankfully, the telephoto lens has no shortcomings. It takes fantastic photos at 3x and 6x, and I got usable shots up to 10x without any issues. While it's great to be able to shoot at 3x and 6x, what I like about the camera is its ability to take stellar portrait shots. While it isn't on quite on the same level as the Find X7 Ultra or the Magic 6 Pro, the X Fold3 Pro does a better job in this area than any other foldable I used.\n\nThe trio of cameras does a standout job even in low-light situations, and while the wide-angle lens has visible noise, the shots are still usable. I still prefer the X100 Ultra overall, but when it comes to foldables, the X Fold3 Pro has a distinct lead over the Z Fold 6 and Magic V2.\n\nThe X Fold3 Pro runs Funtouch OS 14 based on Android 14 out of the box, and the software itself is nearly identical to what you get on the X100 Pro or V30 series. Vivo polished the interface in the last 12 months, and the UI feels modern and elegant as a result. There is plenty of customizability, and while I like the interface as a whole, there are a few legacy features that are irksome.\n\nMemory management is usually on the aggressive side, so anything running in the background is usually restricted after an hour or two, and you'll need to re-launch it. I didn't see any issues with notifications, and I like that there's a unified notification pane that also includes the quick toggles. Other Chinese brands are switching to a split pane, but Vivo thankfully hasn't followed suit -- yet.\n\nThere are several foldable-focused features on the device that allow you to take advantage of the tablet-sized panel. The dock sits at the bottom of the screen and is great at switching between apps, and you can easily launch split-screen multitasking. The ability to have the device in a semi-folded state and run two utilities side-by-side is great, and it is handy when taking photos.\n\nIn the month I used the X Fold3 Pro, Vivo rolled out two software updates; one was to address system stability issues, and the second was aimed at camera tweaks. Vivo in general is doing a much better job with software updates, and my X100 Pro unit has consistently picked up security patches and camera updates over the course of 2024.\n\nThe biggest issue in this area is that the X Fold3 Pro will receive just three years of Android updates and four years of security patches, and that just isn't enough for a foldable. Samsung offers more than double the number of updates on the Z Fold 6, and most other Chinese manufacturers are now rolling out at least four Android OS updates and six years of security updates, so Vivo needs to change its stance.\n\nSamsung's Galaxy Z Fold 6 is the 800-pound gorilla in this segment, and while the brand has the overwhelming majority of the market share, the device itself isn't quite as good as other foldables. Vivo's offering has much better battery life and cameras, bigger panels that get brighter, and a lighter design. The biggest issue is that Vivo doesn't sell the X Fold3 Pro in the U.S. or most western markets, and as a result, the Z Fold 6 becomes the default choice.\n\nI'm interested in seeing what Honor does with the Magic V3. The Magic V2 is still one of my favorite foldables of 2024, and the V3 is thinner, lighter, and has better cameras at the back.\n\nThe X Fold3 Pro showcases what's possible with foldables; the svelte design means it isn't that much larger than a regular phone, but you still get two usable screens, and the panels are among the best in this segment. The same is true of the cameras, and they manage to take outstanding photos and videos in just about any situation. With most other foldables I've used in 2024, there's the distinct feeling that the cameras aren't quite on par with flagships, but that isn't the case here.\n\nThere isn't anything missing on the hardware front either, and the X Fold3 Pro manages to do a standout job during extended gaming sessions. Battery life is another area where there are no problems, with the device easily lasting over a day even with heavy use -- I can't say the same for any other foldable.\n\nIn fact, the only point of contention is the software update guarantee; with Google and Samsung offering seven years of updates, three years is no longer enough in this category. Vivo has to do better if it wants to measure up against Samsung in this regard, because from a hardware point of view, the X Fold3 Pro has considerable upgrades over just about every foldable available today.\n\nThe software is decent enough in its own right, and the only limitation is the update guarantee -- if Vivo is able to make amends in that area, the X Fold3 Pro has what it takes to beat the best in this segment.", "source": {"uri": "androidcentral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Android Central"}, "authors": [{"uri": "harish_jonnalagadda@androidcentral.com", "name": "Harish

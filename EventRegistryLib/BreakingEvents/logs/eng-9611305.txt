That said, this page is updated frequently so make sure that you click on the link provided so that you're getting the most updated information.\n\nCarroll has three-hit day vs. Rangers\n\nCorbin Carroll went 3-for-5 with a double on Wednesday in the Diamondbacks' loss at the hands of the Rangers. It's been an unexpected struggle this season for Carroll as Wednesday's three-hit effort was his first of the year and just his ninth multi-hit performance through 52 games. To put that in context, he recorded 47 games last year with at least two hits across 155 contests.\n\nThe 23-year-old holds a calamitous .567 OPS with two homers and nine steals so far, and the lack of consistent hard contact across his quality of contact metrics doesn't inspire a ton of confidence that he'll eventually turn things around as the season progresses. It's possible he's been playing through a lingering shoulder issue, because it's difficult to explain what exactly is going on otherwise. We're not concerned long-term given his immense talent, but there are no easy answers at the moment.\n\nLindor has hit, scores run in loss to L.A.\n\nFrancisco Lindor went 1-for-4 with a run scored on Wednesday in the Mets' loss to the Dodgers. Lindor showed zero ill effects, reaching base safely in two of his four plate appearances less than 24 hours after suffering a left index finger contusion during Tuesday's doubleheader. It doesn't appear that he's going to wind up missing any time moving forward.\n\nDiamondbacks vs. Mets MLB Betting Trends\n\nThe total has gone UNDER in 6 of Arizona's last 6 games\n\nOver/under has gone OVER in 8 of NY Mets' last 11 games against an opponent in the National League\n\nThe total has gone UNDER in 6 of Arizona's last 8 games against an opponent in the National League\n\nThe total has gone OVER in 6 of NY Mets' last 7 games played on a Thursday\n\nDiamondbacks vs. Mets MLB BETTING PREDICTION\n\nTake New York.

Whether he did or not doesn't change the fact the Mets have lost eight of their last nine games and now must deal with the Arizona Diamondbacks and ace Zac Gallen on Thursday night.\n\nBut the D-backs have also struggled to score, which makes the Under an obvious target in my Diamondbacks vs. Mets predictions and MLB picks for tonight's matchup.\n\nThe funny thing about Lopez's quote isn't what he potentially said, it's that it had us all asking the question, \"are the New York Mets the worst team in baseball?\"\n\nStatistically, the answer is no, because of the existence of teams like the Chicago White Sox. But after losing eight of their last nine games, the Mets are closer to that dubious distinction than they would like to admit.\n\nTonight, they'll have to put that behind them and focus on the task at hand, and it's a difficult one as Zac Gallen and the Arizona Diamondbacks come to town.\n\nGallen is having another solid season for the D-backs with a 3.90 expected ERA and a 1.13 WHIP with a strikeout rate of 25.9%. Those numbers don't blow you away but they should be plenty in this matchup.\n\nThe 28-year-old right-hander will face off against a Mets team that ranks 24th in batting average, 22nd in OPS, and 17th in wRC+. They have also scored three runs or fewer six times during this ugly nine-game stretch.\n\nPlus, Gallen has also been a problem for the Amazins. Current Mets hitters have a combined .222 expected batting average and a. 350 xSLG vs. Gallen.\n\nNew York counters Gallen with prospect Christian Scott. The 24-year-old right-hander has been impressive in his first four career starts, pitching to a 3.31 xERA.\n\nThe Mets aren't the only team in this matchup with an underperforming offense. The Diamondbacks have not produced the way you would expect this veteran lineup to, particularly against right-handers. Arizona ranks 24th in batting average and OPS, and 25th in wRC+ vs. righties this season. The D-backs have scored just six runs over their last five games combined.\n\nThat has me thinking we will see another low-scoring game in Queens tonight, which means I'm on the Under 7.\n\nFirst, let's start this same-game parlay by bumping the Under up to 7.5 just in case we lose a leg to a push.\n\nSecond, while I think this will be a low-scoring matchup, I'm still going to side with the Diamondbacks here. Both teams are struggling at the dish, but Arizona has a sizeable edge in starting pitching.\n\nBut instead of taking them -125 on the moneyline, let's go with Gallen to record the win at +165. It feels like the morale of this New York team is uber-low at the moment and I like the D-backs to take advantage of that.\n\nAnd let's close this SGP out with Christian Walker to fuel that win by driving in a run.

The host Mets dropped a 10-3 decision to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the finale of a three-game set while the visiting Diamondbacks fell 6-1 to the Texas Rangers to end a two-game rematch of last year's World Series.\n\nThe Mets' loss was overshadowed by the possible injury to Alonso, Lopez's actions and comments following his eighth-inning ejection for arguing with third base umpire Ramon De Jesus, and a team meeting.\n\nAlonso, who has missed just 25 games since debuting with the Mets on Opening Day 2019, crumpled to his knees Wednesday upon being hit on the hand as he tried to check his swing. He was visited by a trainer before heading into the dugout. The Mets said X-rays were negative but that Alonso would undergo further imaging.\n\nDespite the absence of their leading power hitter, the Mets climbed back from a three-run deficit before the Dodgers scored six times in the eighth. Shohei Ohtani capped the outburst with a two-run homer off Lopez, who was ejected four pitches later after arguing with De Jesus.\n\nLopez untucked his jersey and threw his glove into the stands on his way off the field. Following the team meeting, he said he didn't regret tossing the glove even if he looked like \"the worst teammate\" in baseball. Multiple outlets reported the Mets designated Lopez for assignment Wednesday night.\n\nThe Mets were outscored 18-5 in losing three games to the Dodgers. They've won back-to-back games just once this month and have lost 15 of their last 19 games overall.\n\n\"It's no secret that things aren't going the way that we want around here,\" said Brandon Nimmo, the longest-tenured Mets player. \"So we just opened the floor and talked about ways we can turn it around.\"\n\nThe Diamondbacks will need to author their own turnaround if they want to return to the playoffs following last year's Cinderella run. Arizona reached the playoffs with 84 wins and advanced to the World Series for the second time in franchise history.\n\nThe Diamondbacks, who fell a season-high five games under .500 with Wednesday's loss, haven't been at the break-even mark since they were 9-9 on April 16. Arizona has just seven runs in its last five games, a span in which it has left 33 men on base.\n\n\"We continue to build the innings and then we can't get that big two-out hit,\" Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo said. \"Situational hitting, hitting deep in counts, getting that big two-out hit and being stubborn is part of this game. I know it's challenging, but we can be better at it.\"\n\nScott didn't factor into the Mets' decision Friday after allowing two runs over six innings in an 8-7 loss to the San Francisco Giants. He has never opposed the Diamondbacks.\n\nGallen took the defeat Friday after allowing three runs over seven innings in the Diamondbacks' 3-0 loss to the Miami Marlins. He is 0-2 with a 3.77 ERA in six career starts against the Mets.\n\n--Field Level Media", "source": {"uri": "bnd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Belleville News-Democrat"}, "authors": [{"uri": "field_level_media@bnd.com", "name": "Field Level Media", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Diamondbacks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Diamondbacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zac_Gallen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zac Gallen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pete Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Rangers_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Texas Rangers (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minor League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Power hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shohei_Ohtani", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shohei Ohtani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dugout_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dugout (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Third baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opening_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Opening Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umpire_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Umpire (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Nimmo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Nimmo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torey_Lovullo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Torey Lovullo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinderella_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cinderella (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manager_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manager (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Marlins", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami Marlins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/incoming/e2e0b2/picture288872604/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/c8f43152-caee-4624-aaa3-e3ba869a6c81", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9611305", "eventUri": "eng-9611305", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-04-16", "textStart": 2658, "textEnd": 2666}], "sentiment": -0.2235294117647059, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

Our MLB odds series has our Mets-Diamondbacks prediction, odds, and pick for Friday.\n\nThe Diamondbacks make the trip to New York City to face the Mets! Both of these two teams are not playing well. The Diamondbacks have talent but have not been able to put it together, while the Mets have struggled all season and have struggled to get any consistency. Our MLB odds series has our Mets-Diamondbacks prediction, odds, and pick for Friday.\n\nThe Diamondbacks have been inconsistent this season with a 25-30 record. They have also lost four out of their last five games and head into this spot on a three-game losing streak. The Diamondbacks have had a strong season behind the plate and are just outside the top 10 overall. Their pitching has struggled and is in the bottom half of the MLB. Lourdes Gurriel Jr., Ketel Marte, Joc Pederson, Corbin Carroll, Eugenio Suarez, and Christian Walker have been great behind the plate, while Zac Gallen, Brandon Pfaadt, and Merrill Kelly, despite his injury, have been very good on the mound. The Diamondbacks are a more talented team on paper than the team that won the NL last season, but they need to figure things out because they have had issues all season.\n\nThe Mets had a complete makeover from last year to this year. They are 22-33 this season and have lost eight of their last nine games and come into this spot losing three straight. Their bats and pitchers have struggled this season. Pete Alonso, Francisco Lindor, Starling Marte, and Brandon Nimmo have been solid behind the plate despite their struggles across the board. Luis Severino, Sean Manaea, and Jose Butto make up a solid pitching staff. The Mets have struggled this season and it does not seem like much is going to change. They have been one of the worst teams in the MLB this season and they do not have much hope, even against an inconsistent team like the Diamondbacks.\n\nThe Diamondbacks are starting Jordan Montgomery as pitcher where he has a 3-2 record, a 4.69 ERA, and a 1.41 WHIP. Through 40.1 innings, Montgomery has allowed 21 runs on 45 hits with 12 walks and 24 strikeouts. The Diamondbacks are 5-2 in the seven games that he's started in this season. In his last start, he pitched six innings and gave up two runs on nine hits with one walk and four strikeouts in a Diamondbacks win. Montgomery has a favorable matchup in this game against a struggling Mets offense behind the plate, and it should help because he has struggled with his consistency.\n\nThe offense for the Diamondbacks has been a standout so far this season. The Diamondbacks are 11th in the MLB in team batting average at .243 after having a team batting average of .250 last season. Ketel Marte and Christian Walker lead the team in almost every important batting category. Also, at least 13 Diamondbacks have hit one home run up to this point in the season. Walker leads the team in batting average at .266, is tied for the lead in home runs at 10 with Ketel Marte, then in RBI at 33, and in OBP at .360. Marte then leads the way in total hits at 58. The Diamondbacks get an interesting matchup against Luis Severino on the mound because he has been solid, but the Diamondbacks have been very good behind the plate themselves.\n\nWhy The Mets Will Cover The Spread/Win\n\nThe Mets are starting Luis Severino on the mound and have a 2-2 record, a 3.22 ERA, and a 1.16 WHIP. He has allowed 26 runs on 42 hits with 26 walks and 50 strikeouts through 58.2 innings. The Mets have gone 3-7 in the 10 games he started in this season. In his last start, he pitched seven innings and gave up one run on two hits with three walks and six strikeouts in a Mets loss. Severino is playing very well for the Mets despite their struggles as a team.\n\nThe Diamondbacks are the better and more talented team. They have the better offense, but Severino is the better pitcher compared to Montgomery. The Mets should cover this spread and keep it very close thanks to Severino, but the Diamondbacks might still win.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jake_faigus@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Jake Faigus", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Diamondbacks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Diamondbacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joc_Pederson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joc Pederson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lourdes_Gurriel_Jr.", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lourdes Gurriel Jr."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Nimmo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Nimmo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketel_Marte", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ketel Marte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenio_Su\u00e1rez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Eugenio Su\u00e1rez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Corbin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Corbin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zac_Gallen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zac Gallen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pete Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrill_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Merrill Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Severino", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Luis Severino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Montgomery", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Montgomery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Manaea", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sean Manaea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starling_Marte", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Starling Marte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Lindor", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Francisco Lindor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Walks plus hits per inning pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_on_balls", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Base on balls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "On-base percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Food/Seasonings", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Diamondbacks-vs.-Mets-prediction-odds-pick-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9611305", "eventUri": "eng-9611305", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 189, "relevance": 1}

Both runs came on a third-inning RBI double by Ketel Marte.\n\nScott, the Mets' top pitching prospect, boasts a 3.90 ERA through five career starts and has allowed three runs or fewer in four of them.\n\nThe Mets had lost eight of nine games and 15 of 19. Wednesday's 10-3 loss to the Dodgers completed a three-game sweep at home, prompting Lindor to facilitate the nearly 40-minute meeting in which many players spoke.\n\nIt's been a rough season for the Mets, who improved to 23-33, and for Lindor, who entered Thursday with a .211 average, a .279 on-base percentage and a .372 slugging percentage. Lindor's slash line improved to .225/.291/.396 with Thursday's performance.\n\nReed Garrett, who was tagged for seven runs over his previous three appearances, pitched a scoreless ninth to earn his third save.\n\nThe come-from-behind win delivered another chapter in an eventful 24 hours for the Mets, who designated reliever Jorge L\u00f3pez for assignment after he was ejected from Wednesday's loss and tossed his glove into the stands. Afterward, L\u00f3pez raised eyebrows with a profanity-filled media address.\n\nDanny Young, whom the Mets called up to replace L\u00f3pez, picked up the win Thursday after pitching a scoreless eighth inning.\n\nThursday's victory kicked off the Mets' four-game series with Arizona, which continues Friday night with a matchup of former Yankees. Luis Severino (2-2, 3.22 ERA) is set to start for the Mets, while Jordan Montgomery (3-2, 4.69 ERA) is slated to go for Arizona.\n\n____", "source": {"uri": "sacbee.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Sacramento Bee"}, "authors": [{"uri": "peter_sblendorio@sacbee.com", "name": "Peter Sblendorio", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Lindor", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Francisco Lindor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Diamondbacks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Diamondbacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Thompson_(pitcher)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Thompson (pitcher)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Daily_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Daily News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citi_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Citi Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortstop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shortstop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zac_Gallen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zac Gallen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pete Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketel_Marte", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ketel Marte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ace (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_by_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hit by pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamstring", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamstring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinch_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pinch hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cy_Young_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cy Young Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_L\u00f3pez_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jorge L\u00f3pez (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Severino", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luis Severino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Montgomery", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Montgomery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "On-base percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Print_and_Play", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Print and Play", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.sacbee.com/wps/build/images/sacbee/facebook.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9611305", "eventUri": "eng-9611305", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 187, "relevance": 1}

Martinez hit a go-ahead, eighth-inning home run, Francisco Lindor had four hits and drove in the tying run after Pete Alonso doubled as a pinch hitter and the New York Mets kept up their domination of the Arizona Diamondbacks with a 3-2 victory Thursday night.\n\nArizona ace Zac Gallen got hurt on his sixth pitch, forcing the NL champions to use relief pitchers for nearly the entire game. The Diamondbacks (25-31) then wasted a two-run lead and lost their fourth straight, matching their season high of six games under .500. Arizona has scored nine runs in its last six games.\n\nNew York (23-33) stopped a four-game losing streak and won for just the second time in 10 games. The Mets have won 20 of their last 24 games against the Diamondbacks and 16 of their last 18 against Arizona at Citi Field.\n\nKetel Marte had a two-run double in the third off rookie Christian Scott, who allowed four hits in six innings.\n\nLindor hit a third-inning homer against Brandon Hughes and an RBI single in the seventh against Ryan Thompson (2-2) after Alonso doubled in his first pinch-hit appearance since 2021. Alonso left Wednesday's game when hit on the right hand by a pitch; scans were negative.\n\nMartinez homered in the eighth off Thompson, a drive that landed in the black batter's eye beyond center field for his fourth home run this season. Martinez, a 36-year-old, six-time All-Star, played for the Diamondbacks in 2017.\n\nRookie Danny Young (2-0) pitched the eighth as the struggling Mets bullpen threw four hitless innings in relief of Scott. Reed Garrett got three outs for his third save after a leadoff walk in the ninth, finishing a four-hitter.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nDiamondbacks: SS Gerardo Perdomo, sidelined since April 3 by a torn right meniscus, is set to play his first rehab game Friday as a DH in Arizona Complex League. Perdomo and OF Alek Thomas, out since March 31 with a strained left hamstring, each had 10 at-bats during drills Wednesday. ... RHP Merrill Kelly (strained right shoulder) is to start a throwing program next week. ... RHP Miguel Castro (right shoulder inflammation) is throwing from 75 feet. ... Luis Fr\u00edas (right shoulder inflammation) may pitch in an ACL game next week, possibly Tuesday.\n\nMets: C Francisco Alvarez (sprained left thumb) started a rehab assignment with Double-A Binghamton and hit a three-run homer in the second inning. He was 1 for 2 with a walk.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nLHP Jordan Montgomery (3-2, 4.69) starts for the Diamondbacks on Friday and RHP Luis Severino (2-2, 3.22) for the Mets.\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb", "source": {"uri": "register-herald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beckley Register-Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@register-herald.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Lindor", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Francisco Lindor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Martinez", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "J.

Martinez hit a tie-breaking solo homer in the eighth inning of a 3-2 win.\n\nThe victory was only the second in the last 10 games for the Mets, who are 8-19 this month and 23-33 overall. The latter record is the third-worst in the National League, ahead of only the Miami Marlins and Colorado Rockies.\n\nNew York's trying season hit a nadir Wednesday with a 10-3 loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers. The players-only meeting was overshadowed minutes later when reliever Jorge Lopez -- who threw his glove into the stands after he was ejected during a six-run eighth inning -- told reporters he's \"been looking (like) the worst teammate in probably the whole (expletive) MLB.\"\n\nLopez was designated for assignment Thursday, hours before Lindor laced a leadoff single against Zac Gallen. His homer, in the third, began the comeback from a 2-0 deficit for the Mets, who tied the score on Lindor's seventh-inning single.\n\nThe four-hit game was the 10th of Lindor's career, but he said there was no connection between his offensive outburst and his role in the team meeting.\n\n\"It felt good to contribute to a team win,\" he said. \"This is not about being the main character of a whole team meeting. That's not what this is about. Anybody could have a good night tonight and I would have been happy. Just worked out it was me. Tomorrow it's going to be somebody else.\"\n\nNew York also received good news on first baseman Pete Alonso as a CT scan on his right hand showed no broken bones. He was hit by a pitch from James Paxton of the Dodgers on Wednesday.\n\nThough he didn't start Thursday, Alonso delivered a pinch-hit double in the seventh inning and scored the tying run.\n\nMeanwhile, the slumping Diamondbacks, who have lost four games in a row to fall six games under .500 at 25-31, needed a full team effort from their pitching staff to piece together nine innings Thursday night. Six relievers appeared after Gallen recorded no outs and had thrown just six pitches due to a right hamstring strain.\n\nGallen, who left a start against the Seattle Mariners on April 26 with a tight right hamstring, said he felt discomfort while throwing his final pitch to Lindor. The right-hander threw one more pitch, a ball to DJ Stewart, before exiting.\n\nKetel Marte hit a two-run double in the second on Thursday, and the trio of Brandon Hughes, Justin Martinez and Joe Mantiply preserved the narrow lead until Ryan Thompson surrendered Lindor's RBI single and J.D. Martinez's homer.\n\n\"I think we're all heartbroken over Zac,\" Thompson said. \"That's a real tough blow. I'm not sure what's going to happen with that, but we've got to pull together. I mean, this is a team sport, and it's been tough, but we're going to come (Friday) ready to do what it takes.\"\n\nSeverino didn't factor into the decision last Saturday, when he allowed one run and two hits over seven innings as the Mets fell to the San Francisco Giants 7-2 in 10 innings. He has never opposed the Diamondbacks.\n\nMontgomery earned the win Saturday after giving up two runs over six innings in the Diamondbacks' 3-2 victory over the Miami Marlins. He is 0-3 with an 8.40 ERA in four career starts against the Mets.\n\n--Field Level Media", "source": {"uri": "reuters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Reuters"}, "authors": [{"uri": "field_level_media@reuters.com", "name": "Field Level Media", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Lindor", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Francisco Lindor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Diamondbacks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Diamondbacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_League_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National League (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Severino", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luis Severino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Montgomery", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Montgomery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Martinez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

Martinez hit a go-ahead, eighth-inning home run, Francisco Lindor had four hits and drove in the tying run after Pete Alonso doubled as a pinch hitter and the New York Mets kept up their domination of the Arizona Diamondbacks with a 3-2 victory Thursday night.\n\nArizona ace Zac Gallen got hurt and left after his sixth pitch, forcing the NL champions to use relief pitchers for 24 outs. The Diamondbacks (25-31) then wasted a two-run lead and lost their fourth straight, matching their season high of six games under .500. Arizona has scored nine runs in its last six games.\n\n\"We did a great job of breaking the cycle of, obviously, the losing,\" Alonso said. \"And once you get out of that cycle, we can start to build day to day.\"\n\nNew York (23-33) stopped a four-game losing streak and won for just the second time in 10 games. The Mets have won 20 of their last 24 games against the Diamondbacks, outscoring them 138-62, and 16 of their last 18 against Arizona at Citi Field.\n\nKetel Marte had a two-run double in the third off rookie Christian Scott, who allowed four hits in six innings.\n\nLindor hit a third-inning homer against Brandon Hughes and an RBI single in the seventh against Ryan Thompson (2-2) after Alonso doubled off Joe Mantiply in his first pinch-hit appearance since 2021. Alonso left Wednesday's game when he was hit on the right hand by a pitch; scans were negative.\n\nThompson was ahead of Lindor 1-2 in the count.\n\n\"My thought process is I don't throw a lot of sliders to lefties,\" Thompson said. \"I was thinking he's got to know that, that I don't throw sliders to lefties, so I figured it was a good pitch in that situation. ... After throwing I think three straight sinkers to him, I was like, throw a slider here and maybe get back to the sinker, and I just threw a really bad one.\"\n\nMartinez homered in the eighth off Thompson, a drive that landed in the black batter's eye beyond center field for his fourth home run this season. Martinez, a 36-year-old, six-time All-Star, played for the Diamondbacks in 2017.\n\nRookie Danny Young (2-0) pitched the eighth as the struggling Mets bullpen threw four hitless innings in relief of Scott. Reed Garrett got three outs for his third save after a leadoff walk in the ninth, finishing a four-hitter.\n\n\"They're absorbing it right now, and it's painful. It hurts,\" Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo said. \"It hurts a lot because we care, and I'm OK with that. But at some point we got to be able to cycle through and understand why we lost this baseball game. There were some things we did wrong, and we just got to find a way to make them right, and we're going to be just fine.\"\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nDiamondbacks: SS Gerardo Perdomo, sidelined since April 3 by a torn right meniscus, is set to play his first rehab game Friday as a DH in Arizona Complex League. Perdomo and OF Alek Thomas, out since March 31 with a strained left hamstring, each had 10 at-bats during drills Wednesday. ... RHP Merrill Kelly (strained right shoulder) is to start a throwing program next week. ... RHP Miguel Castro (right shoulder inflammation) is throwing from 75 feet. ... Luis Fr\u00edas (right shoulder inflammation) may pitch in an ACL game next week, possibly Tuesday.\n\nMets: C Francisco Alvarez (sprained left thumb) started a rehab assignment with Double-A Binghamton and hit a three-run homer in the second inning. He was 1 for 2 with a walk.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nLHP Jordan Montgomery (3-2, 4.69) starts for the Diamondbacks on Friday and RHP Luis Severino (2-2, 3.22) for the Mets.\n\nAP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb", "source": {"uri": "reformer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brattleboro Reformer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@reformer.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pitch (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Lindor", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Francisco Lindor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Diamondbacks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Diamondbacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinch_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pinch hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Martinez", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "J.

Martinez drilled a go-ahead homer in the bottom of the eighth to lift the New York Mets to a come-from-behind, 3-2 win on Thursday night at Citi Field. It was a brutal loss for a Diamondbacks team that not only lost the game but also starter Zac Gallen.\n\nThe Diamondbacks had a 2-1 lead when the Mets' Francisco Lindor shot a game-tying single into right field with two out in the seventh inning against reliever Ryan Thompson.\n\nThompson was still on the mound an inning later when Martinez blasted a homer to straightaway center on the first pitch he saw with one out in eighth.\n\nGallen suffered a right hamstring strain just six pitches into his outing. After giving up a single to Lindor, he threw a first-pitch fastball to the Mets' D.J. Stewart and immediately summoned the training staff. The club announced the injury as a strain about a half-hour later.\n\nMaking matters worse, the Diamondbacks lost to a Mets team that entered the day in turmoil, having lost eight of nine games. A day earlier, they cut ties with reliever Jorge Lopez after Lopez flung his glove into the stands in frustration. They also held a lengthy postgame team meeting.\n\nThe Diamondbacks grabbed the lead in the top of the third when Ketel Marte snapped an 0-for-22 skid by lining a two-run double to right to make it 2-0.\n\nIt was 2-1 when Mets' pinch-hitter Pete Alonso ripped a double into left field off lefty Joe Mantiply with one out in the seventh. Mantiply had not yet faced the requisite three batters, so when Alonso was announced the Diamondbacks were unable to counter.\n\nThompson entered after Alonso's double, retired pinch-hitter Harrison Bader but gave up the single to Lindor, who had four hits, including a homer, on the night.\n\nThe Diamondbacks put the leadoff man aboard in the ninth, but Mets reliever Reed Garrett retired the next three batters in order to close out the win.\n\nThe loss was the Diamondbacks' fourth in a row and fifth in their past six games.", "source": {"uri": "azcentral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AZ Central"}, "authors": [{"uri": "arizona_republic@azcentral.com", "name": "Arizona Republic", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Diamondbacks", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Diamondbacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Lindor", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Francisco Lindor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Martinez", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "J.

Both runs came on a third-inning RBI double by Ketel Marte.\n\nScott, the Mets' top pitching prospect, boasts a 3.90 ERA through five career starts and has allowed three runs or fewer in four of them.\n\nThe Mets had lost eight of nine games and 15 of 19. Wednesday's 10-3 loss to the Dodgers completed a three-game sweep at home, prompting Lindor to facilitate the nearly 40-minute meeting in which many players spoke.\n\nIt's been a rough season for the Mets, who improved to 23-33, and for Lindor, who entered Thursday with a .211 average, a .279 on-base percentage and a .372 slugging percentage. Lindor's slash line improved to .225/.291/.396 with Thursday's performance.\n\nReed Garrett, who was tagged for seven runs over his previous three appearances, pitched a scoreless ninth to earn his third save.\n\nThe come-from-behind win delivered another chapter in an eventful 24 hours for the Mets, who designated reliever Jorge L\u00f3pez for assignment after he was ejected from Wednesday's loss and tossed his glove into the stands. Afterward, L\u00f3pez raised eyebrows with a profanity-filled media address.\n\nDanny Young, whom the Mets called up to replace L\u00f3pez, picked up the win Thursday after pitching a scoreless eighth inning.\n\nThursday's victory kicked off the Mets' four-game series with Arizona, which continues Friday night with a matchup of former Yankees. Luis Severino (2-2, 3.22 ERA) is set to start for the Mets, while Jordan Montgomery (3-2, 4.69 ERA) is slated to go for Arizona.", "source": {"uri": "nydailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "peter_sblendorio@nydailynews.com", "name": "Peter Sblendorio", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Run batted in"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Diamondbacks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Diamondbacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Thompson_(pitcher)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Thompson (pitcher)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pete Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Daily_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Daily News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citi_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Citi Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_by_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hit by pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortstop", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shortstop"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zac_Gallen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zac Gallen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketel_Marte", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ketel Marte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ace (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamstring", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamstring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinch_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pinch hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strikeout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullpen", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bullpen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cy_Young_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cy Young Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_L\u00f3pez_(baseball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jorge L\u00f3pez (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Severino", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luis Severino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Montgomery", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Montgomery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "On-base percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging_percentage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Slugging percentage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Print_and_Play", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Print and Play", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Running/Training", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AP24152012129648.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9611305", "eventUri": "eng-9611305", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

It isn't that I always autobet them or that I fade them every time. No, instead, there are certain guys that I feel like I have a good feeling for and others that I know I don't. This season, a few guys that I've been looking forward to are Shota Imanaga (before yesterday), Seth Lugo, Paul Skenes, and Zac Gallen. On the other side, if Logan Webb is starting a game, I usually don't even look into it because I can't get a read for him. Well, today we get Gallen on the mound as the Diamondbacks take on the Mets.\n\nArizona needs to be careful or their season will be squandered very quickly. The team currently has a 25-30 record on the year. This isn't a matter of them being good at home and bad on the road. They have a losing record at both sites. Last year they got off to a hot start and weathered the storm as they made it to the postseason as a Wild Card team. A hot ending to the season allowed them to navigate through the playoffs and make it to the World Series before losing to the Texas Rangers. It was a nice story, but if you are a Diamondbacks fan, you have to want more out of the club. This season the pitching just hasn't been as brilliant as last year. They are somewhat wasting a decent start to the year from their offense as well. We've seen about a third of the season from the team, so maybe this is just what they are. Arizona is struggling right now and have lost four of their past five games. They went to Texas hoping for a bit of revenge, but lost both games and allowed 10 runs over the two games while only mustering three of their own. Gallen gives them a bit of reinforcement and hope here so maybe they can make a nice beginning against the Mets. He hasn't been quite the dominant pitcher he was last season, but he has thrown four consecutive quality starts for the club. The biggest issue I have with him is that he's allowed three or more earned runs in five of his ten starts. When he is at his best, he is putting together multiple games in a row of scoreless innings. He struggled on the road a bit last season, and it appears that issue may have followed him this year as his ERA is two runs higher on the road than at home. The good news is that Mets hitters are just 18-for-80 against him.\n\nThe Mets have been in the news lately, and not for a good reason. They are now 22-33 for the season and embarrassing themselves on a daily basis. In New York, they are just 11-19. To make matters a bit worse, they had an ejection from one of their players in yesterday's game that was broadcast everywhere because he threw the glove in the stands. That's really not that big of a deal, I suppose. In a way, it probably made a fan's day that they got a free mitt from a big leaguer. It got worse when they stuck a microphone in Jorge Lopez's (the ejected player) face. Lopez said something along the lines of not regretting throwing the mitt, but also that the Mets were the worst team in the whole f***ing MLB. Not exactly the kind of day you want for your team. Lopez was released this morning. He's a good enough pitcher that he should find his way onto a different club. Now they need to put that behind them and deal with Gallen. Going toe-to-toe with him is Christian Scott. Scott is making his fifth start of the season, and has been fairly strong in most of them, throwing three quality starts. His one poor outing was against Miami, and he allowed four earned runs over four innings. Despite some strong performances from Scott, the Mets have done nothing with them as they are 0-4 in Scott's starts. He has never faced anyone on the Diamondbacks.\n\nFrankly, it is a bit wild to me that we can get Gallen at the price he is listed at. The Mets are a team in shambles, and even though the Diamondbacks aren't that much better, they are still better. Gallen is clearly the superior pitcher, even with some road struggles. Scott is good, don't get me wrong. I like him and do think he can keep the game close. Take Gallen and the Diamondbacks to win this against the dysfunctional New York club at -122.\n\nFor more sports betting information and plays, follow David on X/Twitter: @futureprez2024", "source": {"uri": "outkick.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "OutKick"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_troy@outkick.com", "name": "David Troy", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Diamondbacks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Diamondbacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Webb", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Logan Webb"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zac_Gallen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zac Gallen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sh\u014dta_Imanaga", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sh\u014dta Imanaga"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Lugo", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seth Lugo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_start", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quality start"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Rangers_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas Rangers (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "World Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1717635617.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9611305", "eventUri": "eng-9611305", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

Whether the now former Mets pitcher said it or not doesn't really matter anymore, because now we're all thinking it.\n\nAnd while the Mets may not be the worst team in baseball thanks to the existence of teams like the Chicago White Sox, they aren't too far off that dubious distinction.\n\nThe Mets will have to quickly get that thought out of their heads as they open a four-game set with Arizona Diamondbacks who hand the ball to ace Zac Gallen.\n\nThe 28-year-old has been steady, if unspectacular this season pitching to a 3.90 expected ERA, and a 1.13 WHIP with a strikeout rate of 25.9%. But that should be more than good enough in this matchup.\n\nGallen will face off against a Mets team that ranks 24 in batting average, 22 in OPS, and 17 in wRC+. So, not the worst, but you can definitely say this lineup is underperforming. Gallen has also been a problem for Mets hitters. Current Mets hitters have a combined .222 expected batting average and a.350 expected slugging vs. Gallen.\n\nNew York counters Gallen with prospect Christian Scott. The 24-year-old right-hander has shown flashes of his potential but has a 5.06 ERA over his last three starts.\n\nThe Diamondbacks have also struggled to produce, but I like this matchup for them, Scott uses his fastball more than 50% of the time and will allow an experienced lineup to narrow their approach.\n\nOn top of that, morale in New York is low and I like Gallen and the D-back to take advantage and secure the win for their starter.", "source": {"uri": "covers.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Covers.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Baseball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_White_Sox", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago White Sox"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zac_Gallen", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zac Gallen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strikeouts_per_nine_innings_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Strikeouts per nine innings pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Batting average (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ace (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walks_plus_hits_per_inning_pitched", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Walks plus hits per inning pitched"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Diamondbacks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Diamondbacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_plus_slugging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "On-base plus slugging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_run_average", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Earned run average"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fastball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handedness", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Handedness"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Amateur", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Baseball", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Major League", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/History", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Baseball/Instruction", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 86}], "image": "https://img.covers.com/cms/covers/93a01bcd-cc1c-454c-b95b-c41634e81977.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9611305", "eventUri": "eng-9611305", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

Mandatory Credit: Darren Yamashita-USA TODAY Sports / Darren Yamashita-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Diamondbacks are in the midst of another three-game losing streak. After a disappointing series loss to the struggling Marlins, they then proceeded to be swept in a two-game set against their former World Series foes in the Texas Rangers. Today, they'll begin a four-game series against the Mets at Citi Field. First pitch is at 4:10 PM Arizona time.\n\nUp against a Mets squad that has found little to no success in the prior month, they'll have to find a way to jumpstart their offense, while preventing a potential offensive resurgence from New York.\n\nThe Mets are 22-33, and, despite a somewhat solid looking record to begin the season, they have gone an astounding 10-25 since April 21st. The D-backs have shown bursts of turning it around, going 5-1 against the Reds and taking two of three in Los Angeles, but fell to the last place Marlins before going 0-2 in Texas.\n\nThe Mets have historically been a challenge for the Arizona, and with a four game series coming up, it's crucial to get off to at least a decent start against a struggling opponent. The D-backs will look to their ace Zac Gallen to deliver the start they need.\n\nIt hasn't looked like the most dominant season for Gallen thus far, but he does sport a sturdy 3.12 ERA, and he's pitched through the sixth inning or further six times. He's also continued the trend of striking out hitters while limiting walks, with a 60/15 K/BB on the season, with his WHIP down to 1.13. His last outing saw him give up three earned runs over seven innings, although he was ultimately stuck with the loss despite the QS.\n\nPeripherally, Gallen has been hit pretty hard, although it hasn't been enough to really do much damage against the right-hander. He is susceptible to hard contact, especially if his breaking and off-speed pitches aren't as sharp as they could be, but he has been overall reliable in 2024.\n\nThe Mets will send right-hander Christian Scott to the mound. Scott is only 24, in his first season of MLB action. He's pitched three Quality Starts in four opportunities, has a 1.10 WHIP, and allows only a .235 average against. He features a mid-velocity four-seam, slider, sweeper and occasional splitter.\n\nA comprehensive look at the overall series pitching matchup can be found here, from Jack Sommers.\n\nThe D-backs lineup is generally the same as usual, but with Pavin Smith taking a turn in right field over Jake McCarthy. McCarthy has been hitting well, with a .333 average in his last seven games, but will take a seat for today's matchup.\n\nCorbin Carroll showed a promising performance yesterday, going 3-for-5 with a double. However, despite the D-backs' engine coming to life, they only managed one run. Part of that is due to Ketel Marte's 0-for-20 slide. The stud second baseman was riding a 21-game hit streak, but has cooled off significantly over the last week. Arizona will likely need production from both Carroll and Marte if they want to get off to a better offensive start.\n\nJoc Pederson is only 2-for-12 in his last four games, but he continues to put up quality at-bats, with three walks over that span. His slash is still an impressive .306/.409/.532. Arizona desperately needs production from the entire lineup, but especially the Carroll/Gurriel/Suarez/Moreno group, who have not yet performed up to their potential despite being a crucial part of the offense.\n\nThe Mets will send only three right-handed bats to the plate against Gallen. However, one such righty is a familiar face in JD Martinez. The 36-year-old Martinez hasn't lived up to the power expectations set for him, with only three home runs and seven extra-base hits as a Met, but his overall numbers are still solid, with a .271/.310/.421 slash.\n\nAt this point in the Mets' season, there isn't a particularly \"dangerous\" section of the lineup to watch out for. But, as is the nature of baseball, that could change at any moment. With last night's fiasco regarding reliever Jorge Lopez, and New York's overall struggles both at the plate and defensively, this series could become a prime opportunity to bite the D-backs if they don't quickly and strongly take advantage of the flaws in this Mets squad.\n\nGallen will have to be sharp, and the offense--which has produced just seven runs in their last five games--needs to come out of their slumber quickly, and as a complete unit. Setting the tone for a four-game set, especially at Citi Field, will be of the utmost importance, especially as they sit five games below .500, in desperate need of some consistency.", "source":

Whether or not that meeting will have any lasting impact is unknown, but it appeared to have an immediate effect on the team, as they were able to take the first game of their four-game series with the Diamondbacks, 3-2.\n\nChristian Scott took the mound for the Mets and got off to a strong start, retiring the first three batters in order. D-Backs starter Zac Gallen gave up a leadoff single to Francisco Lindor and, after just six pitches, left the game with a tweaked hamstring. Gallen, the Arizona ace, was clearly the best pitcher the Mets would face tonight, and it seemed like a game that the Mets may take advantage of lesser competition.\n\nHowever, two frustrating consequences came from the injury: one, despite having two men on and no one out, the Mets could not push across a run in the first. The second consequence was that, after sitting for 20+ minutes, Scott was not as sharp when he returned to the mound in subsequent innings.\n\nIn the top of the third, a single, a walk, and a double by Ketel Marte drove in two runs against Scott. He settled down after the double, but his pitch count was up, and he only completed five innings. However, two runs on four hits, one walk, and four strikeouts is not a terrible day at the office for the young Scott.\n\nLindor answered back in the first at-bat in the bottom of the inning, driving a laser-beam line drive into the left field stands to cut the lead in half.\n\nBoth teams would remain quiet until the bottom of the seventh when Pete Alonso, who left yesterday's game after a hit by pitch, drilled a pinch hit double to put the tying run on second base with one out. Lindor drove him in with an RBI single, tying the game at two.\n\nIn the bottom of the eighth, J.D. Martinez hit a laser beam home run of his own to dead center to put the Mets on top.\n\nAdrian Houser, Danny Young, and Reed Garrett combined for four innings of shut-out ball, with Garrett collecting his third save of the year to stop the Mets' most recent string of losses.\n\nLuis Severino and Jordan Montgomery square off in game 2 tomorrow evening.", "source": {"uri": "amazinavenue.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Amazin' Avenue"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brian_salvatore@amazinavenue.com", "name": "Brian Salvatore", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zac_Gallen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Zac Gallen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadoff_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Leadoff hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Lindor", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Francisco Lindor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Diamondbacks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Diamondbacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Dodgers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Dodgers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketel_Marte", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ketel Marte"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_(baseball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ace (baseball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_count", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitch count"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamstring", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hamstring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitcher", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pitcher"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pete Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Houser", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adrian Houser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Severino", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luis Severino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Montgomery", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Montgomery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_by_pitch", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hit by pitch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_baseman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Second baseman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinch_hitter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pinch hitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_fielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Left fielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batted_ball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Batted ball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Martinez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

Martinez hit a game-winning home run off Ryan Thompson in the bottom of the eighth, a laser to straightaway centerfield. Francisco Lindor -- a day after initiating a team meeting -- accounted for the rest of the offense with a 4-for-4 effort, including an early home run and a tying single in the seventh.\n\nThis was just the second win in 10 games for the Mets (23-33). And it was the first time since May 7 that they won a game that wasn't a sweep-avoiding situation.\n\nThe win went to lefthander Danny Young, a 30-year-old rookie who tossed a perfect top of the eighth against the top of the D-backs' lineup. The Mets called him up from Triple-A Syracuse before the game to replace Jorge Lopez, who was designated for assignment following his meltdown -- glove tossed into the stands, no remorse in his postgame interview -- Wednesday.\n\nIt took a while, but the Mets eventually capitalized on a de facto bullpen game for Arizona (25-31). Its top starter, Zac Gallen, strained his right hamstring and exited six pitches and zero outs into the game. The Diamondbacks used six relievers in his place.\n\nRighthander Christian Scott held the Diamondbacks to two runs and navigated five innings despite grinding through most of his outing. This was the fourth time in five starts that he allowed three or fewer runs.\n\nBoth runs scored on Ketel Marte's double in the third inning, Corbin Carroll coming around from first easily after Starling Marte bobbled the ball in rightfield.", "source": {"uri": "newsday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsday"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Diamondbacks", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Diamondbacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_run", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Home run"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Thompson_(pitcher)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Thompson (pitcher)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citi_Field", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Citi Field"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Lindor", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Francisco Lindor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Martinez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

The bullpen was already shorthanded with Edwin Diz landing on the IL with a shoulder impingement, and then Jorge Lopez threw his glove into the stands and made some disparaging comments after the game, reportedly leading to him being DFA'd.\n\nAs has been the case for most of the season, the Mets are going to have to mix and match in the bullpen, calling up relievers from Triple-A who can give them needed outs. Left-hander Danny Young is reportedly being called up to replace Lopez, and other players like Josh Walker (already with the team), Dedniel Nunez, and Grant Hartwig could play a role. The Mets will also need veterans like Adam Ottavino and Jake Diekman to step up in high-leverage spots.\n\nAfter the Dodgers finished up their three-game sweep on Thursday, the Mets held a closed-door team meeting prior to the media entering the clubhouse. Brandon Nimmo said the meeting was Francisco Lindor initiating the meeting, but that many players spoke up.\n\nIt's hard to know how much of man effect these meetings can have, but it's clear that Mets need to do something to turn things around. Having lost 14 of their last 18 games, the Mets are now 11 games under .500 and are in desperate need of something to turn the tide.\n\nInitial X-rays came back clean, but CT scan results are expected on Thursday, which will provide further clarity as to whether or not Alonso has any broken bones in that hand.\n\nThe Mets lineup has struggled to produce runs this season, so not having Alonso in the heart of the order would be a huge blow. The other question is who would step in as the full-time starting first baseman if Alonso is to miss extended time. The obvious answer is Mark Vientos, which could mean that Brett Baty sticks in the majors perhaps longer than originally anticipated. The team could also call up a veteran like Ji Man Choi or Mike Brosseau, who are both at Triple-A Syracuse.\n\nComing off a Cinderella run to the World Series, the Diamondbacks have struggled this season, going 25-30 and finding themselves in fourth place in the NL West.\n\nAmong the D-backs qualifying hitters, Christian Walker leads the team with a .266 batting average and there's not a ton of firepower in the lineup. Over the club's last five games, they've scored a total of seven runs, so this could be a good chance for the Mets' starting pitching to shine, and they've got a good part of the rotation lined up.\n\nChristian Scott, who has been impressive to start his young MLB career goes on Thursday, followed by Luis Severino (3.22 ERA) and Sean Manaea (3.16 ERA). Sunday's starter hasn't officially been set just yet, but Scott, Severino, and Manaea have a chance to set the tone.\n\nOn the flip side, though, the Mets will have to face two of Arizona's top arms in the first two games, with Zac Gallen going Thursday and Jordan Montgomery pitching Friday.\n\nCarroll took the league by storm in 2023, recording 161 hits, 116 runs scored and 54 stolen bases to win NL Rookie of the Year. He even finished fifth in MVP voting as he led the D-backs on an improbable run to the postseason.\n\nBut things have not gone well for Carroll to start this season, as he comes into the series slashing just .194/.276/.291 with two home runs and 18 RBI. He also has been caught stealing four times in 13 attempts after being caught just five times all of last season.\n\nCarroll is the engine that makes the D-backs offense run, and has shown some signs of coming back to life in his last 10 games, recording nine hits, including four triples. He also had three hits in Wednesday's loss to Texas.\n\nThe Mets will need to keep Carroll quiet if they want to get back on track in this series.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType":

Arizona Time, 7:10 P.M. EST. The D-backs are 25-30 and are coming off a two game sweep at the hands of the Texas Rangers. The Mets are 22-33 and were just swept at home three straight against the Dodgers.\n\nThe Mets started off the season 15-14 through the end of April, but have had a disastrous 7-19 month of May. They've lost eight of their last nine games, and yesterday experienced an embarrassing meltdown by reliever Jorge Lopez that resulted in him getting DFA'd shortly after the game.\n\nThe Mets just had to place start closer Edwin Diaz on the injured list with a shoulder impingement and slugger Pete Alonso is day to day after being hit on the hand by a pitch on Wednesday. X-Rays were negative.\n\nBoth teams have been struggling on offense. The D-backs are averaging just 3.6 runs per game in May and have hit just .234 with a .658 OPS for the month. It's been especially dismal over their last five games in which they've scored just seven runs and are batting .203. They haven't homered since May 22nd against the Dodgers.\n\nThe Mets are batting .223 and scoring 3.8 R/G in May and have been held to 11 runs and a .169 B.A. over their last five games.\n\nFor the Diamondbacks there were encouraging signs that Corbin Carroll may be snapping out of a season long slump on Wednesday, following a three-hit game. Ketel Marte had a 21 game hiting streak in which his batting average actually FELL from .309 to .291. Now he's gone 0-20 in his last five games to drop his average all the way to .270\n\nChristian Walker is 7-20, .350 with two doubles over his last five games. But Lourdes Gurriel Jr. is 3-17, Eugenio Suarez is 3-15, and the once hot Kevin Newman has cooled off too, going 2-16 over this stretch.\n\nCiti Field is not exactly the type of place a team typically goes to find their offense. The Mets home ballpark always ranks amongst the most pitcher friendly in the league according to various park factors, and 2024 is no exception. In fact it's more extreme than ever.\n\nBaseball reference multi year park park factor for Citi Field is 94, and single year is 84. 100 = Neutral, with the lower the number, the more it favors the pitcher. Citi Field is the 3rd most pitcher friendly park behind only the parks in Seattle and San Francisco. Statcast Park factors concur, ranking Citi Field with a 95 Park factor, the second lowest in MLB. The single year factor is 87.\n\nAdd to that the D-backs are just 2-8 at Citi Field since 2021, and there is some history to overcome if they are to get on the right track in this series.\n\nGallen has lost each of his last two starts despite pitching 6.2 and 7.0 innings and allowing just three runs in each outing. His road ERA of 4.33 is more than twice as high as his home ERA of 2.05. In four career starts in Citi Field he's 0-2 with a 4.29 ERA. That included a thrashing on September 13th last year in which he gave up 7 runs, 6 earned in 5.0 innings.\n\nChristian Scott RHP, 0-2, 3.97 ERA, 3.79 FIP in 22.2 IP\n\nScott is a 25 year old rookie making his fifth major league start. He's thrown quality starts in three of his four previous outings, including 6 innings of 2-hit, 2-run ball in a no-decision against the Giants May 24th. He has a four seam fastball (94.4 MPH) a slider, a sweeper, and an occasional splitter.\n\nMontgomery got the win against the Marlins in a 3-2 ballgame on May 25th. He allowed just two runs in six innings despite giving up nine hits and a walk\n\nLuis Severino, RHP , 2-2, 3.22 ERA, 3.79 FIP in 58.2 IP\n\nSeverino has been a bright spot for the Mets in 2024. Signed to a one year, $13 million contract he's made 10 starts and gone at least five innings in all of them. He went seven strong innings in a no-decision against the Giants May 25th, giving up just one run on two hits. He hasn't recorded a win since April 17th however and has five no decisions in a row.\n\nWalston is making his second career start and third appearance of his career. He pitched extremely well in his first start, as chronicled by Aaron Hughes.\n\nSean Manaea LHP, 3-1, 3.16 ERA, 3.46 FIP in 51.1 IP\n\nManaea has been another excellent one year signing for the Mets, (with a 2025 player option). While he doesn't typically go deep in games, never pitching past the sixth inning this year, he's only failed to go at least five innings twice in his 10 starts. He's faced the D-backs 11 times, with eight starts, and has a career 4-2 record with 3.42 ERA against Arizona\n\nPfaadt continues to have a FIP (Fielding Independent Pitching) nearly a full run lower than his ERA. That's due to his 63-12 strikeout to walk ratio. He's given up just seven homers, but it was a big three-run blast by Corey Seager in his last start that led to a loss. Pfaadt has only given up 60 hits, or 8.1/9IP and his .280 BABIP (Batting average on balls in play) is lower than the league average.\n\nThe issues has simply been sequencing and making the occasional location mistake at inopportune times, leading to more runs allowed than his peripherals would suggest. Pfaadt is a quality pitcher who is still learning how to pitch at this level, but his poise and determination are already well established.\n\nThe Mets starter is listed as TBA for Sunday's game as of this writing.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_average_(baseball)", "type":

See what betting angle I'm taking with my Diamondbacks vs. Mets predictions for May 31.\n\nMy analysis\n\nThe New York Mets will send Luis Severino to the mound today and he's been their most reliable starter, pitching to a 3.22 ERA with an OBA of .196 across 58 2/3 innings. He's fresh off an impressive outing where he held the Giants to just a pair of hits and one run through seven innings, and he has a sizzling 2.00 ERA in six starts at home.\n\nSeverino was named an All-Star in 2017 and 2018 but he's been plagued by injuries over the last few years. However, he is now four years removed from Tommy John surgery and looks like he has gotten back his spark. He ranks in the Top 20th percentile in hard-hit rate, average exit velocity, and ground-ball rate, and he has a favorable matchup tonight.\n\nThe Arizona Diamondbacks have the third-highest ground-ball rate in the majors, and they rank 16th in the majors in hard-hit rate and exit velocity. They've been even worse against righties like Severino, posting an OPS of just .660.\n\nWith the D-Backs plating only 1.5 runs per game over their last six contests and Severino allowing fewer than 2.5 earned runs in six of his last nine starts, the Under on his earned runs looks like the smart play.\n\nMets shortstop Francisco Lindor began the season in a slump but he's been hitting the ball much better lately and went 4-for-4 at the plate with a dinger last night. The D-Backs are sending struggling starter Jordan Montgomery to the hill tonight and Lindor has gone 6-for-11 with a homer and two doubles against him in his career. The three-time Silver Slugger winner also had an impressive .573 slugging percentage against southpaws like Montgomery last year.\n\nMontgomery has a 4.69 ERA in seven starts this year and his opponent xBA is an ugly .291. With Severino facing off against Montgomery the Mets clearly have the pitching edge in this clash. While the two teams have similar raw batting numbers, statcast analytics give the edge to the Mets there as well. The Mets are seventh in the majors in barrel rate and 11th in average exit velocity while the D-Backs are below the league average in both categories.\n\nWhen you also factor in the Mets home-field advantage along with our bets on Severino and Lindor, backing them on the moneyline makes sense in this SGP.\n\nLearn how to bet a same-game parlay with these helpful tips and strategies.\n\nThe Diamondbacks have hit the Team Total Under in 30 of their last 47 games (+11.30 Units / 21% ROI).

Mandatory Credit: Wendell Cruz-USA TODAY Sports / Wendell Cruz-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Diamondbacks lost to the Mets 3-2 at Citi Field. They are now 1-5 in their last six games.\n\nAfter the D-backs went down in order to begin the game, right-handed ace Zac Gallen left the game after just six pitches in the home half of the inning. The team later relayed that it was a right hamstring strain, the same area that gave Gallen trouble against the Mariners back on April 26th.\n\nAfter Gallen exited, right-hander Bryce Jarvis finished the first scoreless, despite inheriting a runner and allowing a walk. Left-hander Brandon Hughes took over for him in the second inning and issued a walk to Brett Baty, but retired the side without trouble.\n\nThe D-backs then caused some problems for Mets starter Christian Scott. Gabriel Moreno led off the inning with a bloop single, Corbin Carroll walked, and Ketel Marte, who was 0-for-21 prior, laced a double to right field to land a quick 2-0 lead.\n\nHughes quickly allowed a solo home run to Francisco Lindor, who has frequently been a problem for Arizona. He struck out the next two batters faced, and then turned it over to young flame-throwing right-hander Justin Martinez with two outs in the third.\n\nMartinez immediately issued a walk and a single, but ended the inning with a grounder to shortstop. He then became a somewhat surprising long reliever, as his family watched him pitch in the majors from the stands for the first time.\n\nThe right-hander might have struggled a bit with his location, but finished with an impressive three innings of shutout ball, allowing three hits, a walk and two strikeouts. He also forced two double plays--an impressive outing for his onlooking family. He lowers his ERA to 0.48 on the season.\n\nAfter lefty Joe Mantiply gave up a pinch-hit double to Pete Alonso in the seventh, right-hander Ryan Thompson entered with one out. With Lindor up, Thompson allowed a liner that snuck past Christian Walker, scoring an unearned run and knotting the score at 2-2.\n\nHe stranded Lindor at second, but the D-backs became a victim of another blown lead, and the Mets shortstop collected a four-hit night against Arizona.\n\nIn the eighth inning, former Diamondback JD Martinez smashed a solo home run to dead center field off Thompson, as the Mets took a 3-2 lead. This was Thompson's first earned run since April 22nd, which raised his season ERA to 1.14.\n\nWith the exception of a Pavin Smith double in the fourth, and Eugenio Suarez reaching on an error by Lindor, the D-backs offense wasn't able to get anything going after the third inning.\n\nChristian Walker walked to become the tying run, but Lourdes Gurriel Jr and Pavin Smith made outs on back-to-back pitches, popping both up to the infield. Jake McCarthy grounded out to end it as the D-backs drop their fourth straight game.\n\nThey'll be back in action for game two tomorrow at 4:10 PM Arizona time. Lefty Jordan Montgomery will face off against right-hander Luis Severino.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Martinez's blast put the finishing touches on a comeback, 3-2 win over the Diamondbacks in a series-opener in front of 20,926 at Citi Field on Thursday.\n\nThe Mets (23-33) halted a four-game skid and hope they have pulled up from an all-out plummet.\n\nThe win was just their second in the past 10 games and third in their past 13.\n\nThey were trailing, 2-1, before launching their rally beginning in the seventh inning.\n\nAlonso -- whose imaging came back negative a day after he was forced out of the game because his hand was drilled -- pinch-hit and stroked a double down the third-base line.\n\nWith two outs, Lindor roped an RBI single into right field to tie the game.\n\nLindor, who called the team meeting a night earlier so the players could bounce ideas off of one another to try to snap out of this funk, finished 4-for-4 with that clutch single and a third-inning home run.\n\nHe consistently gestured to the dugout with fist-pumps after big hits, trying to spark the club any way he could.\n\nMaybe it worked with the 36-year-old Martinez, who stepped up in a tie game in the eighth inning and blasted his fourth home run of the season that became the game-winner.\n\nThe Mets made three runs stand up because their undermanned bullpen turned in a gem.\n\nAfter five solid, two-run innings from Christian Scott, Adrian Houser, Danny Young and Reed Garrett (third save) pitched four scoreless innings.\n\nThe Mets' bullpen has been a weak spot in the past few weeks, likely because of overuse, and has never appeared more vulnerable than right now.\n\nWithout the injured Edwin Diaz and the formerly reliable Jorge Lopez, whose in-game and postgame outburst led to his exit from the team, the Mets pieced together innings six through nine, in which Arizona did not record a hit.", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "New York Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relief_pitcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Relief pitcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pete Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baseball bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Martinez", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

But can one of the lasting messages -- about accountability -- push them to at least play more respectably?\n\nFinishing strong and improving the clubhouse vibe would at least help them look more appealing to big-time free agents, regardless of where the Mets end up in 2024.\n\nOtherwise, what good is owner Steve Cohen's money if the biggest names turn it down to join a club with a better track record? Money talks. That's been proven under Cohen. But it's not always everything, and the best players -- Juan Soto, anyone? -- sometimes prefer winners.\n\n\"It definitely plays into it,\" Mets outfielder Brandon Nimmo said. \"What it's going to take for us is selling the organization, where it's going, and the people that are running it. I think that's the most important thing. ... Again, it's one of those things you can't change right now but a lot will depend on how we finish, how we do the rest of this year.\"\n\nOn Thursday, the day after a players-only meeting, the Mets beat the Arizona Diamondbacks, 3-2. It wasn't perfect (they made two errors), but they eked out a close win with better at-bats and crisper all-around play. They'll definitely take it.\n\nIt will be important to see how the Mets continue to respond after their most recent fiasco. Even with three wild-card spots up for grabs in a seemingly weak league, it may be too late for New York (23-33) to mount an inspired comeback that revives thoughts of the playoffs. But with four months left in the season, there's plenty of time to improve the conversation about them. Because people around the league -- executives, players, agents -- wondered over the last few weeks how a team with talented players found countless ways to lose games it should win.\n\nTeams go on skids. Teams go through stuff. It's just that the Mets have endured so many embarrassing episodes over the years that it's hard to erase the perception of an ill-fated place. That's not fair to Cohen, who was supposed to be a breath of fresh air after the Wilpons, and he has been; most of the issues predate his tenure as owner and he has done plenty right for the organization. But even people within the club would probably say that perception matters, and winning needs to happen to make those concerns irrelevant.\n\nAgainst Arizona, the Mets deviated from their 2024 norm. For one-third of the season, the Mets have struggled to do the little things and they've often crashed at crunch time. Nimmo, Adam Ottavino and Francisco Lindor mostly attributed late-game struggles to a lack of individual preparation and processes that needed improvement.\n\n\"Yes, this is a team game, but individually you have to hold yourself accountable,\" Nimmo said before the game. \"And, we are going to have to start implementing holding each other accountable in different ways because what we're doing right now isn't working.\"\n\nIt sounds like a promising plan. Also, a necessary one. Last year, former Mets outfielder Tommy Pham said some position players were the least-hard working group he has played with. Pham also said he had respect for the work ethic of Mets leaders including Lindor, Nimmo and Pete Alonso. Pham added that coaches were always accessible and worked hard. This year, the Mets have seen a lot of turnover but their core group remains. Again, players pointed at themselves, not coaches.\n\nThe Mets feature one of the oldest rosters in terms of average age, and for a while that has created a difficult balance for team leaders. It's tough to speak up to a fellow veteran, players said. But that can no longer be an excuse.\n\n\"It's harder to say something when a guy has spent 10 years or 15 years and if they've been doing it for that long,\" Jeff McNeil said. \"But we gotta treat everyone as equals in this clubhouse. If you see something, say something.\"\n\nFrom Nimmo's perspective, it was good for the group to discuss accountability aloud, to put it on people's radars so that they would feel empowered to speak up without coming across as disrespectful.\n\n\"You can say we had a come-to-Jesus meeting,\" Nimmo said. \"Things are going to be brought to people's attention, don't take it the wrong way.\"\n\nSo what does implementation look like? Players said it's a matter of taking someone aside -- not blasting them in front of people -- and giving it to them straight.\n\n\"It's obviously not going to be a thing where it's, 'Hey, you messed up one time, and you gotta go,'\" Nimmo said. \"But it's going to be something like, 'Hey, I noticed this today. ... You're a little lost today ... What's going on?' And I think there's just going to be more accountability from all sides.\"\n\nFor Nimmo and a few others, that was one of the major takeaways from the meeting. From their view, the mentality hasn't been an issue; they've remained positive. It's more a practical matter of preparation and execution.\n\n\"It's more so the little mistakes that are happening on the field,\" Nimmo said. \"We want to try to nip that stuff in the bud. Usually, that mistake has been led up to a series of decisions throughout the day.\"\n\nThe meeting ended with players feeling confident about the situation. J.D. Martinez said it was one of the better meetings he's had in his career. During it, Martinez said he told the group, \"No one thinks we're going to win 100 games this year. Guarantee it. Everyone is going to put all their money that we're not. We have no pressure on us. The pressure is on everyone else right now. If we lose, we lose -- they already think we are the worst in baseball. So let's go out there, do what we do; we know we have a really good roster, we have a legit, competitive team day in and day out.\"\n\nThe next day, the Mets did a better job of showing that. The challenge is continuing to play well. They haven't won back-to-back games in three weeks. The meeting, though, represented an acknowledgment of necessary change -- which, in theory, should help both the present and the future. As long as players follow through.\n\n\"We feel like, OK,\" Nimmo said, \"we're in a much more unified spot moving forward of everybody holding each other accountable.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "will_sammon@nytimes.com", "name": "Will Sammon", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Nimmo", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Nimmo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Mets", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Mets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outfielder", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Outfielder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Cohen_(politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Cohen (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Soto", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Juan Soto"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Lindor", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Francisco Lindor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_card_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wild card (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "At bat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Diamondbacks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Diamondbacks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Alonso", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pete Alonso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Pham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tommy Pham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position_player", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Position player"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Ottavino", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adam Ottavino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_McNeil", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeff McNeil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Martinez", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

A court has heard that when Kenson Noel, 29, arrived at the migrant barge in Portland Port in Dorset he admitted to staff that he had brought a small amount of marijuana with him. After this revelation, the asylum seeker from Trinidad and Tobago was searched and staff found in his possession 6.5g of cannabis, a set of scales, bags and \u00a3800 of cash. Noel was then arrested but as he was placed in handcuffs he turned on the police officer, Christopher Grant, and bit him on the elbow. He has pleaded guilty to possessing a class B drug and assaulting a police officer. Magistrates in Weymouth heard that Noel fled Trinidad and Tobago after being threatened by gangs. Christina Norgan, prosecuting, said: 'The defendant arrived as a new resident of the Bibby Stockholm barge. 'He made staff aware that he had cannabis on him and was told he would not be allowed to take it onto the barge. A staff member called Portland Port Police to assist. 'They took him to a cabin and searched him, they found the cannabis alongside scales, bags and large quantities of cash - \u00a3800 was found. During the search, he was arrested and had to be restrained. 'He bit the victim on his left elbow, broke the skin and caused it to bleed. He was then arrested for assaulting an emergency worker.' Ms Norgan added: 'In interview, he admitted the cannabis was for his own personal use. He has no previous convictions and is of previous good character.' Ian Brazier, mitigating, said his client thought the amount of cannabis he had was legal as it was for his own use to help him sleep. He claims Noel had the scales so he could be sure how much cannabis he had and the cash was from his family in Trinidad and was later given back to him. Mr Brazier said: 'In many Caribbean countries, possession of a limited amount of cannabis is legal, up to 28g. It was not understood by him that this amount of cannabis was illegal in this country. He finds it helps with his anxiety and helps to calm him down. 'He was honest and open about the fact that he had cannabis. However, how can it be that a man who is being fully co-operative ends up biting a police officer? 'The officer conducted a search, the defendant said he had cannabis in his bag. When the officer goes to look in the bag, Noel puts his hand into the bag, his hand is grabbed and he is put in handcuffs. 'He complained about the tightness of the handcuffs and was being restrained. 'This is a man in handcuffs, a warrant for cannabis does not require handcuffs. He was cornered, handcuffed, anxious. It feels a bit like using a sledgehammer to crack a walnut.' The case was adjourned for pre-sentence reports. Noel, who is now staying in a hotel in Bournemouth, was granted unconditional bail and will appear at Poole Magistrates' Court next month. He will be sentenced at a later date. He is the second asylum seeker from the Bibby Stockholm to be convicted of a criminal offence since the controversial barge arrived in Dorset last summer. Ahmed Haffa, 24, punched and bit the two security guards as they tried to stop him for shoplifting in Weymouth in December 2023. He failed to show up for his court case in February and was found guilty of assault and theft in his absence. Although a warrant was immediately issued for his arrest Haffa remains at large to this day.", "summary": "A court has heard that when Kenson Noel, 29, arrived at the migrant barge in Portland Port in Dorset he admitted to staff that he had brought a small amount of marijuana with him.", "url": "https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-13510611/Bibby-Stockholm-asylum-seeker-29-tried-taking-cannabis-set-scales-onboard-bit-police-officer-arrested.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490", "image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/06/09/13/85895063-0-image-m-35_1717934438100.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 12:53:58", "author": "Ed Holt,Editor", "authors": ["Ed Holt", "Editor"], "language": "en", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": -0.382}

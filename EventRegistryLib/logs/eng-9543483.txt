leave eastern Rafah ahead of a ground invasion of the southern Gaza city, amid increasing global alarm about the consequences of such a move.\n\nIn Rafah, where civilians had voiced fear and confusion over the evacuation order, crowds cheered and fired in the air in the streets following Hamas's announcement, an AFP correspondent reported.\n\nPeople were crying tears of happiness, chanting \"Allahu

week-long ceasefire that saw 105 hostages released last November, the Israelis among them in exchange for Palestinians held by Israel.\n\nPrevious negotiation efforts had stalled in part because of Hamas's demand for a lasting ceasefire and Netanyahu's vows to crush its remaining fighters in Rafah.\n\nGaza's bloodiest-ever war began following Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel that resulted in the deaths of more than 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.\n\nIsrael estimates that 128 of the hostages abducted by militants on October 7 remain in Gaza, including 35 who the military says are dead.\n\nVowing to destroy Hamas, Israel has conducted a retaliatory offensive that has killed at least 34,735 people in Gaza, mostly women and

Despite Hamas's reported agreement to a three-stage proposal, Israeli officials have expressed skepticism.\n\nA Hamas source reported that the movement agreed to a three-stage proposal, beginning with a 40-day suspension.\n\nfirst phase includes a ceasefire and Israel's withdrawal from the Gaza Valley, as well as the return of displaced persons and the exchange of prisoners. Subsequent stages involve truces lasting 42 days each.\n\nHowever, Israeli sources have dismissed the proposal, stating it does not meet their criteria for a ceasefire. This development may prolong the conflict in Gaza.", "source": {"uri": "albawaba.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Al Bawaba"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Ismail Haniyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Turkey", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "President of Turkey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoav_Gallant", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yoav Gallant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Defense_(Israel)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ministry of Defense (Israel)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Jazeera", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Al Jazeera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recep_Tayyip_Erdo\u011fan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza\u2013Israel_conflict", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza\u2013Israel conflict"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli-occupied_territories", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israeli-occupied territories"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://www.albawaba.com/sites/default/files/styles/default/public/2024-05/AFP__20240326__34MD632__v1__Preview__UsIsraelDiplomacyDefence.jpg?itok=JRCZxlUp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543483", "eventUri": "eng-9543483", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

There's no end.\"\n\nSome media reports in Israel have suggested the proposal might be rejected by the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nChannel 13 said that Hamas has accepted a watered-down Egyptian proposal, which is not acceptable to the Israelis, while Channel 12 is reporting that the Israeli negotiating team is studying Hamas's acceptance, and will issue an official response.\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian said Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh told him on Monday that the ball is now in Israel's court.\n\nEgyptian President Abdul Fattah El Sisi called on all parties to exert more effort to reach a deal in Gaza.\n\nIn a post on social platform X, he said that he was \"closely following he positive developments taking place in the current negotiations to reach a comprehensive truce in the Gaza Strip.\n\n\"And I call on all parties to make more efforts to reach an agreement that will lead to an end to the humanitarian catastrophe that the Palestinian people are suffering from and to achieve the swap of hostages and prisoners.\"\n\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called on the international community to pressure Israel to accept the proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza mediated by Egypt and Qatar after Hamas had accepted it, Palestinian official news agency Wafa reported.\n\nMeanwhile, Washington confirmed that it has received a response by Hamas to a ceasefire deal.\n\n\"We are reviewing that response now and discussing it with our partners in the region,\" State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said. \"[CIA] Director [William] Burns is in the region working on this in real time.\"\n\nMr Miller declined to go into the details of what Hamas's response was.\n\n\"We will be discussing this response with our partners over the coming hours,\" he said.\n\n\"WSe continue to believe that a hostage deal is in the best interests of the Israeli people. It's in the best interest of the Palestinian people.\n\n\"It would bring an immediate ceasefire, it would allow increased movement of humanitarian assistance and so we're going to continue to work to try to reach one.\"\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan welcomed the decision by Hamas to accept the ceasefire, adding he hopes Israel would do the same.\n\nSpeaking after a cabinet meeting, Mr Erdogan called on western countries to increase pressure on Israel's leadership to accept the ceasefire.\n\n\"We welcome the statement by Hamas that they accepted the ceasefire with our suggestion.

"body": "CAIRO: Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on Monday informed mediators Qatar and Egypt that his Palestinian fighter group had accepted their proposal for a ceasefire in Gaza after nearly seven months of war.\n\nHaniyeh had spoken on the phone with Qatar's Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani and with Egyptian Intelligence Minister Abbas Kamel, \"and informed them of Hamas's approval of their proposal regarding a ceasefire agreement\", the group said in a statement published on its official website.\n\nA senior Hamas official, however, stressed that \"this does not mean that the ceasefire has come into effect yet\", pointing out that \"the Israeli side has not yet communicated its position\".\n\n\"The ball is now in the court of the Israeli occupation, whether it will agree to the ceasefire agreement or obstruct it,\" another senior official told AFP on condition of anonymity, because he was not authorised to speak publicly about the negotiations.\n\nHowever, an Israeli official said that the proposal that Hamas had accepted was a \"softened\" version of an Egyptian proposal, which included \"far-reaching\" conclusions that Israel could not accept.\n\n\"This would appear to be a ruse intended to make Israel look like the side refusing a deal,\" said the Israeli official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe Hamas announcement came after Israel on Monday called on Palestinians to leave eastern Rafah ahead of a ground invasion of the southern Gaza city, amid increasing global alarm about the consequences of such a move.\n\nIn Rafah, where civilians had voiced fear and confusion over the evacuation order, crowds cheered and fired in the air in the streets following Hamas's announcement, an AFP correspondent reported.\n\nPeople were crying tears of happiness, chanting \"Allahu Akbar\" (God is Greatest) and shooting in the air in celebration of the news, the correspondent said.\n\nDespite months of shuttle diplomacy, mediators have failed to broker a new truce like the week-long ceasefire that saw 105 hostages released last November, the Israelis among them in exchange for Palestinians held by Israel.\n\nPrevious negotiation efforts had stalled in part because of Hamas's demand for a lasting ceasefire and Netanyahu's vows to crush its remaining fighters in Rafah.\n\nGaza's bloodiest-ever war began following Hamas's October 7 attack on Israel that resulted in the deaths of more than 1,170 people, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.\n\nIsrael estimates that 128 of the hostages abducted by the fighters on October 7 remain in Gaza, including 35 who the military says are dead.\n\nVowing to destroy Hamas, Israel has conducted a retaliatory offensive that has killed at least 34,735 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.", "source": {"uri": "pakistantoday.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title":

The developments in the seven-month-old war came as Israeli forces struck Rafah on Gaza's southern edge from the air and ground and ordered residents to leave parts of the city, which has been a refuge for more than a million displaced Palestinians.\n\nHamas said in a brief statement that its chief, Ismail Haniyeh, had informed Qatari and Egyptian mediators that the group accepted their proposal for a ceasefire. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said later that Hamas' latest truce proposal falls short of Israel's demands but Israel would send a delegation to meet with negotiators to try to reach an agreement.\n\nIn a statement, Netanyahu's office added that his war cabinet approved continuing an operation in Rafah. \"The war cabinet unanimously decided that Israel continue the operation in Rafah to exert military pressure on Hamas in order to advance the release of our hostages and the other goals of the war,\" the statement said.\n\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged Israel and Hamas \"to go the extra mile needed to make an agreement,\" his spokesman said. An Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity said the proposal that Hamas accepted was a watered-down version of an Egyptian offer and included elements that Israel could not accept.\n\n\"This would appear to be a ruse intended to make Israel look like the side refusing a deal,\" said the Israeli official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. But an official briefed on the peace talks, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said the offer Hamas accepted was effectively the same as one agreed at the end of April by Israel.\n\nA U.S. official familiar with truce negotiations told Reuters that Netanyahu and the war cabinet \"have not appeared to approach the latest phase of negotiations in good faith.\" U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Washington would discuss the Hamas response with its allies in the coming hours, and a deal was \"absolutely achievable\".\n\n\"We want to get these hostages out, we want to get a ceasefire in place for six weeks, we want to increase humanitarian assistance,\" White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said, adding that reaching an agreement would be the \"absolute best outcome\". More than 34,600 Palestinians have been killed in the conflict, according to Gaza health officials. The U.N. has said famine is imminent in the enclave.\n\nThe war began when Hamas militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people and abducting 252 others, of whom 133 are believed to remain in captivity in Gaza, according to Israeli tallies. RAFAH HIT BY STRIKES\n\nAny truce would be the first pause in fighting since a week-long ceasefire in November, during which Hamas freed around half of the hostages. Since then, all efforts to reach a new truce have foundered over Hamas' refusal to free more hostages without a promise of a permanent end to the conflict, and Israel's insistence that it would discuss only a temporary pause.\n\nTaher Al-Nono, a Hamas official and adviser to Haniyeh, told Reuters the proposal met the group's demands for reconstruction efforts in Gaza, return of displaced Palestinians and a swap of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. The Hamas deputy chief in Gaza, Khalil Al-Hayya, told Al Jazeera television the proposal comprised three phases, each of six weeks, with Israel to pull its troops out of Gaza in the second phase.\n\nEarlier on Monday, Israel ordered the evacuation of parts of Rafah, the city on the Egyptian bordered that has served as the last sanctuary for around half of Gaza's 2.3 million residents. Israel's closest ally, the United States, has called on it not to assault Rafah, saying it must not do so without a full plan in place to protect civilians there, which has yet to be presented. Washington is committed to stopping Israel's attack on Rafah, the U.S. official said.\n\nIsrael said on Monday it was conducting limited operations on the eastern part of Rafah. The was being accompanied by massive air strikes, according to Palestinian residents. \"They have been firing since last night and today after the evacuation orders, the bombardment became more intense because they want to frighten us to leave,\" Jaber Abu Nazly, a 40-year-old father of two, told Reuters via a chat app.\n\n\"Others are wondering whether there is any place safe in the whole of Gaza,\" he added. Instructed by Arabic text messages, phone calls, and flyers to move to what the Israeli military called an \"expanded humanitarian zone\" around 20 km (12 miles) away, some Palestinian families began trundling away in chilly spring rain.\n\nSome piled children and possessions onto donkey carts, while others left by pick-up or on foot through muddy streets. As families dismantled tents and folded belongings, Abdullah Al-Najar said this was the fourth time he had been displaced since the fighting began seven months ago.\n\n\"God knows where we will go now. We have not decided yet.\"\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

He confirmed that the military operation in Rafah would continue and there were report that air strikes continued on Monday night. However, Mr Netanyahu said Israel would send a delegation to negotiate the ceasefire deal further.\n\n[ Israel announces strikes in Rafah despite Hamas ceasefire moves ]\n\nA diplomat briefed on the talks said the draft proposal Hamas accepted was broadly similar to the one put forward by mediators about two weeks ago. The plan - brokered by Qatar, Egypt and the United States - includes calls for an initial six-week pause in the war during which Hamas would release 33 hostages, including women, children, older and wounded people.\n\nThis would be followed by what mediators hope would be an extended ceasefire - described as \"restoring a sustainable calm\" - during which the remaining hostages would be freed. Israeli officials say Hamas is holding 132 hostages, and believe 37 of them to be dead.\n\n\"Hamas has called Netanyahu's bluff, and put the ball in his court,\" the diplomat said.\n\nKhalil al-Hayya, a Hamas leader in Gaza, told Al Jazeera that the proposal it had accepted included an assurance that in \"its second phase, [there will be a] direct announcement of a permanent cessation of military and hostile operations\".\n\n\"We made concessions so the door can be opened to stop this crazy war and for there to be a real prisoner exchange,\" he said in televised remarks.\n\nThere was no exact date attached to the proposal for an Israeli approval, he added.\n\nHamas's announcement came hours after Israel ordered the evacuation of eastern Rafah, a border town at Gaza's southern tip that has become the last refuge for more than a million Palestinians who have fled the war between Israel and Hamas.\n\nMr Netanyahu's office said over the weekend that the Israeli military would \"enter Rafah and destroy the remaining Hamas battalions there - whether or not there will be a temporary pause for the release of our hostages\".\n\nHis far-right coalition ally, national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, said on X that Israel should reject Hamas's latest move.\n\n\"Hamas's tricks and games have only one answer: an immediate order to occupy Rafah, increasing military pressure, and continuing the complete pounding of Hamas, until its full defeat,\" he added.\n\nTurkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan said: \"We are pleased that Hamas has agreed to the ceasefire after our calls. Now Israel should take the same step.\"\n\nEgypt, Qatar and the US have been mediating between Israel and Hamas for a second round of hostage-for-prisoner swaps, following one last November that involved more than 100 captives in Gaza freed in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.\n\nThe talks had been stalled for months as Hamas demanded that any agreement end with a permanent ceasefire and the full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza.\n\nMr Netanyahu, under pressure from far-right members of his ruling coalition, has repeatedly rejected Hamas's demands.\n\nMediators were hopeful of a breakthrough a week ago after Israel appeared to soften its stance on some key conditions for a deal. But any optimism over a possible agreement faded after Mr Netanyahu said the offensive on Rafah would still go ahead, with or without a hostage deal, and Hamas continued to insist on a permanent ceasefire.\n\nThe families of Israeli hostages, who were protesting on a central Tel Aviv highway in support of a deal, told reporters that they were cautiously optimistic of a genuine breakthrough.\n\nHamas's move comes after a flurry of diplomacy, during which Central Intelligence Agency director Bill Burns travelled to Cairo and then Qatar, where he has been holding talks with Qatari prime minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani. Qatar hosts Hamas's political office.\n\nMr Burns was expected to travel to Israel this week as the US stepped up the pressure for a hostage deal and to convince Israel not to move ahead with the offensive on Rafah. - Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2024", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

mediators, Qatar and Egypt, that his Palestinian militant group had accepted their Gaza truce proposal after nearly seven months of war.\n\nThe group in a statement published on its official website, said Haniyeh had spoken on the phone with Qatar's Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani and with Egyptian Intelligence Minister Abbas Kamel, informing them of Hamas's approval of their proposal regarding a ceasefire agreement.\n\nAccording to a senior Hamas official, this does not mean that the ceasefire has come into effect yet, pointing out that the Israeli side has not yet communicated its position.\n\nAnother senior official told AFP on condition of anonymity, because he was not authorised to speak publicly about the negotiations that: \"The ball is now in the court of the Israeli occupation, whether it will agree to the ceasefire agreement or obstruct it.\"\n\nThe Hamas announcement came after Israel on Monday called on Palestinians to leave eastern Rafah ahead of a ground invasion of the southern Gaza city, amid increasing global alarm about the consequences of such a move.\n\nAn AFP correspondent reported that in Rafah, where civilians had voiced fear and confusion over the evacuation order, crowds cheered and fired in the air in the streets following Hamas's announcement.\n\nThe correspondent added that people were crying tears of happiness, chanting \"Allahu Akbar\" (God is Greatest) and shooting in the air in celebration of the news.\n\nDespite months of shuttle diplomacy, mediators have failed to broker a new truce like the week-long ceasefire that saw 105 hostages released last November, the Israelis among them in exchange for Palestinians held by Israel.\n\nPrevious negotiation efforts had stalled in part because of Hamas's demand for a lasting ceasefire and Netanyahu's vows to crush its remaining fighters in Rafah.\n\nGaza's bloodiest-ever war began following Hamas's unprecedented October 7 attack on Israel that resulted in the deaths of more than 1,170 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.\n\nIsrael estimates that 128 of the hostages abducted by militants on October 7 remain in Gaza, including 35 who the military says are dead.\n\nAccording to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, vowing to destroy Hamas, Israel has conducted a retaliatory offensive that has killed at least 34,735 people in Gaza, mostly women and children.", "source": {"uri": "dailypost.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Post Nigeria"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matthew_atungwu@dailypost.ng",

on its official website, the Hamas said it has informed Qatari and Egyptian mediators of its decision, the BBC reported.\n\nIt said its leader, Ismail Haniyeh, conducted a telephone call with Qatar's Prime Minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, and Egyptian Intelligence Minister Abbas Kamel, and informed them of Hamas's approval of their proposal regarding a ceasefire agreement.\n\nHamas said that now it was up to Israel to respond.\n\nDetails of the ceasefire deal, especially its duration and the fate of Israeli captives in Gaza are still to be known.\n\nThere were also reports that Israel was not fully on board with the ceasefire deal as hammered out, but no reaction had come from it yet.\n\nIsrael's Channel 12 quoted Israeli officials as saying that their negotiating team has just received Hamas's response from the mediators, and is now carefully evaluating it and will issue comments later this evening.\n\nIt also quoted the officials as saying that \"this is not the same proposal\" for a deal that Israel and Egypt agreed upon 10 days ago, and that served as the basis for the indirect negotiations since then, as \"all kinds of clauses\" have been inserted.\n\nThe developments came soon after US President Joe Biden reiterated \"his clear position on Rafah\" during a phone call with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, that it will not support an invasion of Rafah without a plan to help the civilians sheltering there\n\nOn Sunday, Netanyahu, as negotiations resumed in Egypt to strike a deal for a pause in Israel's Gaza offensive in return for the release of hostages taken by Hamas, asserted that his country will not accept Hamas's demands to end the Gaza war.\n\n\"We are not ready to accept a situation in which the Hamas battalions come out of their bunkers, take control of Gaza again, rebuild their military infrastructure, and return to threatening the citizens of Israel in the surrounding communities, in the cities

The proposal includes a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, the return of displaced people to their homes in the north and the center of the strip, and an exchange of prisoners.\n\nThe proposal includes in its second phase the direct announcement of a permanent cessation of military and hostile operations. The leaders added that US President Joe Biden is clearly committed to ensuring the implementation of the agreement.", "source": {"uri": "egypttoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EgyptToday"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza Strip"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdel_Fattah_el-Sisi", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abdel Fattah el-Sisi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cairo"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cairo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_bin_Abdulrahman_bin_Jassim_Al_Thani", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ismail Haniyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://www.egypttoday.com/siteimages/larg/202404010320402040.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543483", "eventUri": "eng-9543483", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cairo"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.4980392156862745, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

imminent ground invasion of the southernmost city in the strip where 1.5 million residents and displaced Palestinians have been sheltering from Israeli bombing since 7 October.\n\nThe evacuation and bombing sent thousands of panicked Palestinians fleeing for their lives out of eastern Rafah.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement warning against the dangers of a possible Israeli military operation in the Palestinian Rafah area in the south of the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe foreign ministry said any such military operation would pose significant humanitarian risks and threaten more than a million Palestinians in that area.\n\n\"Egypt called on Israel to exercise the utmost restraint and avoid further escalation at this sensitive time during

Qatar and Egypt on Monday, May 6, that his Palestinian militant faction had accepted their proposal for a truce in Gaza, marking the end of nearly seven months of conflict.\n\nIn a statement posted on its official website, Hamas announced that Haniyeh had discussed the ceasefire agreement over the phone with Qatar's Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani and Egyptian Intelligence Minister Abbas Kamel, affirming their proposal's acceptance.\n\nA senior Hamas official cautioned that the ceasefire had not yet been activated, highlighting that Israel had not yet communicated its stance.\n\n\"The ball is now in the court of the Israeli occupation, whether it will agree to the ceasefire agreement or obstruct it,\" another senior official stated.\n\nHamas's announcement followed Israel's call on Monday for Palestinians to evacuate eastern Rafah ahead of a potential ground invasion of the southern Gaza city, prompting global concerns about the ramifications.\n\nUpon hearing the news of Hamas's acceptance, crowds in Rafah erupted in joy, with people expressing relief and chanting \"Allahu Akbar\" (God is Greatest) while firing celebratory shots into the air.\n\nDespite extensive diplomatic efforts, previous attempts to broker a truce had faltered, partly due to Hamas's insistence on a lasting ceasefire and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's commitment to eradicating remaining fighters in Rafah.\n\nThe conflict, which began after Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on October 7, has resulted in a significant loss of life, with over 1,170 casualties, mostly civilians.\n\nIsrael has reported that 128 hostages abducted by militants on October 7 remain in Gaza, including 35 believed to be deceased.\n\nIn retaliation, Israel launched an offensive targeting Hamas, resulting in the deaths of at least 34,735 individuals in Gaza, predominantly women and children, according to the territory's health ministry, which is controlled by Hamas.", "source": {"uri":

More than one million Palestinians who have fled fighting elsewhere in the densely populated territory are estimated to be holed up in Rafah.\n\nNetanyahu has said he would carry out the offensive in Rafah with or without a ceasefire deal and whether Washington backed the move or not.\n\nIn his statement announcing the beginning of evacuations in Rafah on Sunday, IDF spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Nadav Shoshani vowed to conduct the relocations in a \"safe and secure way,\" including the expansion of humanitarian activities and a campaign of alerts being issued via text messages, phone calls, flyers and media broadcasts in Arabic.\n\n\"We are conducting situational assessments and operating according to an orderly and graded plan,\" Shoshani said at the time. \"The IDF is progressing in accordance with the operational plans and the goals of the war -

ceasefire between Hamas and Israel.\n\nThe last round of negotiations was held in Cairo over the weekend.\n\nOn Sunday, the Hamas delegation left the Egyptian capital to consult with the leadership in Doha on the most recent proposals for a truce deal.\n\nEarlier today, Al-Qahera News reported that the Hamas delegation was set to return to Cairo for talks on Tuesday.\n\nThe announcement comes hours after Israel ordered the evacuation of civilians from eastern Rafah before carpet bombing whole residential blocks in the area ahead of an imminent ground invasion of the southernmost city in the strip where 1.5 million residents and displaced Palestinians are sheltering from seven months of Israeli bombing.\n\nThe evacuation and bombing sent thousands of panicked Palestinians fleeing for their lives out of eastern Rafah.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement warning against the dangers of a possible Israeli military operation in the Palestinian Rafah area in the south of the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe foreign ministry said any such military operation would pose significant humanitarian risks and threaten more than a million Palestinians in that area.\n\n\"Egypt called on Israel to exercise the utmost restraint and avoid further escalation at this sensitive time during ceasefire negotiations, and to stop the shedding of Palestinian civilian blood who have been facing an unprecedented humanitarian disaster since the start of the Israeli war on the Gaza Strip,\" added the statement.\n\nThe statement reaffirmed Egypt's continued

The proposal does not use the word \"ceasefire\" but \"the permanent halt to Israeli military operations and hostilities in Gaza.\"\n\n-Each phase encompasses the return of Israeli hostages from eldest, women, sick and finally soldiers.\n\nAlthough it's clear to everyone that Hamas isn't seriously seeking any type of resolution short of destruction of Israel, both Benny Gantz and Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israel would send a delegation to Cairo to participate in further ceasefire negotiations, and the border crossing Hamas bombed Sunday (killing three IDF soldiers) was reopened for humanitarian assistance.\n\nOne has to wonder if there are really any hostages left alive; that would partly describe Hamas' actions.

AFP\n\nEarlier on Monday, Ismail Haniyeh, the head of the Political Bureau of Hamas informed in phone calls to the Head of the Egyptian General Intelligence Service Abbas Kamel and Qatar Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani that the movement has accepted their proposal for a ceasefire in the Gaza war.\n\nThe proposal presented to us by Egyptian and Qatari mediators includes three stages each stage lasting 42 days, Al-Hayya, who is based in Doha, explained to Al Jazeera.\n\nAl-Hayya said the text of the ceasefire proposal includes the interconnectedness of the three stages of implementation.\n\nThe mediators told us that the US President has committed clearly to guaranteeing the agreement's implementation.\n\nShortly after Haniyeh's announcement, US State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller confirmed that the US has received a response from Hamas on ceasefire-for-hostages in Gaza and will be reviewing that response with its partners Egypt and Qatar and discussing it with Israel.\n\nMiller said a deal is in the best interests of Israel, securing the release of hostages and ensuring more humanitarian aid flows into Gaza\n\nIn recent days, security officials from Egypt, Qatar and the US have been mediating round-the-clock to reach a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel to end the seven-month-old Israeli war on Gaza.\n\nThe last round of negotiations was held in Cairo over the weekend.\n\nOn Sunday, the Hamas delegation left the Egyptian capital to consult with the leadership in Doha on the most recent proposals for a truce deal.\n\nEarlier today, Al-Qahera News reported that the Hamas delegation was set to return to Cairo for talks on Tuesday.\n\nHaniyeh's announcement came hours after Israel ordered the evacuation of civilians from eastern Rafah before carpet bombing whole residential blocks in the area ahead of an imminent ground invasion of the southernmost city in the strip where 1.5 million residents and displaced Palestinians have been sheltering from Israeli bombing since 7 October.\n\nThe evacuation and bombing sent thousands of panicked Palestinians fleeing for their lives out of eastern Rafah.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement warning against the dangers of a possible Israeli military operation in the Palestinian Rafah area in the south of the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe foreign ministry said any such military operation would pose significant humanitarian risks and threaten more than a million Palestinians in that area.\n\n\"Egypt called on Israel to exercise the utmost restraint and avoid further escalation at this sensitive time during ceasefire negotiations, and to stop the shedding of Palestinian civilian blood who have been facing an unprecedented humanitarian disaster since the start of the Israeli war on the Gaza Strip,\" added the statement.\n\nThe statement reaffirmed Egypt's continued communication around the clock with all parties to prevent the situation from worsening or spiralling out of control.\n\nOn the first day of the first phase of the agreement, the parties would commit to halting military operations temporarily, Al-Hayya said.\n\nHe added that the proposal includes an announcement of a permanent stop to military and hostile operations in the second phase.\n\nThe proposal includes a text approving a complete lifting of the siege on Gaza and the free entry of aid to the strip in the third stage, added Al-Hayya.\n\nThe proposal includes the complete withdrawal of the occupation from the Netzarim axis in the first phase and allowing the freedom of return of the displaced to their homes.\n\nThe occupation forces will withdraw to areas adjacent to the border inside the Gaza Strip in the first phase of the proposal.\n\nThe occupation forces will withdraw outside the Gaza Strip in the second phase of the proposal.\n\nThe proposal includes an exchange of prisoners in three stages.\n\nThe proposal includes releasing 30 of the same category from the occupation prisons according to seniority for every released Israeli captive.\n\n\"The ball is now in the Israeli occupation court but we have no information on when the Israeli side would respond,\" stressed Al-Hayya to Al Jazeera.\n\n\"In this agreement, we achieved the goals of a ceasefire, the return of the displaced, relief, and a serious prisoner exchange deal.\"\n\n\"There are no restrictions on the return of the displaced and there is a clear text in the agreement.\"", "source": {"uri": "english.ahram.org.eg",

The Israeli prime minister's office has declined to comment at this stage.\n\nIt's unclear whether Hamas has agreed to the most recent ceasefire proposal, as outlined last week, or a revised version of it.\n\nThe most recent framework, which Israel helped craft but has not fully agreed to, calls for the release of between 20 and 33 hostages over several weeks in exchange for a temporary ceasefire and the release of Palestinian prisoners.\n\nAfter the initial exchange, according to that framework, there would follow what sources describe as the \"restoration of sustainable calm\" during which the remaining hostages, captive Israeli soldiers and the bodies of hostages would be exchanged for more Palestinian prisoners.\n\nA diplomatic source familiar with the talks told CNN that after a day-long meeting in Doha, Qatar's capital, between CIA Director William Burns and Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, mediators convinced Hamas to accept a three-part deal.\n\n\"The bill is now firmly in (Israeli Prime Minister) Benjamin Netanyahu's court,\" the source said.\n\nAs news spread in Gaza of Hamas' announcement, Palestinians began to celebrate in the street in Deir al-Balah, in the center of the Strip, and Gaza City in the north.\n\nThe news comes just hours after Israel ordered Palestinians living in Rafah, a city in southern Gaza, to \"evacuate immediately.\"\n\nThe order raised fears that Israel's long-threatened assault on the city could be imminent. More than 1 million Palestinians have fled to Rafah, where Hamas is believed to have regrouped after Israel's destruction of much of the north of Gaza.\n\nA source familiar with Israeli plans told CNN that a limited incursion into Rafah was intended to keep pressure on Hamas to agree a deal that would bring about a ceasefire and a hostage release.\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

The official said that this version of the deal included \"far-reaching\" conclusions that Israel could not accept without going into specifics.\n\nThe official claimed that Hamas' acceptance of the deal appeared to be a ruse intended to make Israel look like the side that refused to reach a deal.\n\nA report by the Times of Israel, quoting Channel 12 coverage, said that Israeli officials are currently evaluating the new deal Hamas has accepted. The officials reportedly said that the deal was not the same proposal Israel had seen 10 days ago and that \"all kinds of clauses\" have been inserted into it.\n\nThese new clauses supposedly relate to how and when the conflict would end and what kind of guarantees are being offered in that regard.\n\nDuring the daily State Department briefing, spokesperson Matthew Miller declined to comment on whether Hamas had been presented with a different deal and said that Washington was reviewing Hamas' response to the Egyptian-Qatari proposal.\n\nEarlier today, Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh had informed Qatar and Egypt that the group had accepted a ceasefire proposal that had been presented to it.\n\nThis announcement came hours after Israel had called on thousands of Gazans to evacuate Rafah and move to a designated safe zone ahead of an expected ground operation. While Israel has insisted that the operation is necessary to wipe out Hamas in Gaza, its closest allies, including the US, have pushed back on its plan, citing the devastating humanitarian cost of such a move.", "source": {"uri": "republicworld.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Republic World"}, "authors": [{"uri": "digital_desk@republicworld.com", "name": "Digital Desk", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Israel Defense Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jerusalem"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Times of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ismail Haniyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homemaking/Frugality", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homemaking/Frugality", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Officiating", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Officiating", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://img.republicworld.com/rimages/ap24127404540669-171501604662916_9.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543483", "eventUri": "eng-9543483", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

The announcement came shortly after Israel mandated evacuations in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, signaling preparations for a possible military offensive.\n\nDespite Hamas's acceptance, an Israeli official described the proposal as a \"softened\" version of a previous Egyptian initiative, containing terms that are reportedly unacceptable to Israel. According to this official, who wished to remain anonymous, the proposal's acceptance by Hamas might be strategically aimed to portray Israel as the obstructing party in peace efforts.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to restrain from escalating military actions in Rafah. The White House emphasized the importance of safeguarding Palestinian civilians in any military strategies executed in the region.\n\nIn a press briefing, U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller confirmed that \"Hamas has issued a response and we are reviewing that response now and discussing it with our partners in the region,\" adding that conversations \"will be ongoing in the next several hours.\"\n\n\"There has been a significant offer on the table. The ball has been in Hamas' court.

It was offered by the mediators without first approving the terms with Israel, and may include conditions that Israel cannot accept. Israeli officials confirmed that they received Hamas's response this...\n\nA day after it seemed that a ceasefire deal between Hamas and Israel was all but dead, the terror group has issued a surprise statement announcing that it has accepted the deal offered by Egypt and Qatar. Optimism, though, would be premature at this point.\n\nThe deal accepted by Hamas is reportedly somewhat different to the one they had been considering in the last few days. It was offered by the mediators without first approving the terms with Israel, and may include conditions that Israel cannot accept. Israeli officials confirmed that they received Hamas's response this evening, and that the terms of the deal are being looked at by the government.\n\nIf Netanyahu rejects this deal, he will have to prove that his reasons were good enough\n\nIsraeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is under considerable public pressure to reach a deal that will secure the release of Israeli hostages. He has therefore agreed to make significant concessions, including in the number and nature of the prisoners Israel would release from prison and the length of a ceasefire. He may be required to make more concessions now. However, there are two issues that, if they are present in the current deal, would kill it dead in the water.\n\nThe first is a demand by Hamas for a permanent ceasefire. Allowing Hamas to keep control of Gaza and rebuild its military strength and influence poses an unacceptable risk for Israel. Nearly seven months into the war, Hamas still presents a major threat, which means that Israel cannot afford to stop fighting.\n\nThe second issue, which Hamas has demanded in the past, is giving the terrorist organization a free hand in choosing which prisoners will be released from prison without giving Israel veto rights. If this happens, Hamas could demand the release of dangerous arch-terrorist who would form the next generation of the group's leadership.\n\nA deal with terms that are more acceptable to Hamas is only one possible reason that the organization agreed to a deal after months of repeated rejections. If Israel rejects the deal, Hamas will point the finger at Israel as the sole reason that the war is continuing. Israel is facing immense global criticism and pressure, and Hamas hopes that Netanyahu rejecting the deal would lead to even greater pressure on Israel to succumb to a permanent truce, throwing Hamas a desperately needed lifeline.\n\nHamas's leaders are possibly also alarmed by Israel's recent move to start an invasion of Rafah. The southern city holds roughly 4,000 Hamas terrorists -- by far the largest concentration of the group's forces in the Strip. It therefore holds major strategic importance to Israel in their fight against them. However, they hope that as Israel considers the deal, an operation might be postponed.\n\nAfter weeks of dithering, the Israeli Defense Forces was given the order to evacuate Palestinian civilians from parts of the city in preparation for a pending offensive. Significant forces have been massing by the border, ready to go.\n\nThe IDF has been moving roughly 100,000 civilians out of Rafah's eastern neighborhoods. At this point Israel doesn't intend to conquer the entire city but is planning to launch a slow and gradual operation, which could be halted at any point in the event a ceasefire deal is reached. This leaves Hamas with the possibility of negotiating while the fighting goes on.\n\nAs part of the offensive, Israel plans to take control of the Rafah crossing, situated on the border with Egypt. This terrifies Hamas. It would allow Israel to stop the smuggling of weapons from Egyptian territory to Hamas. It could also prevent Hamas's leaders from escaping into Egypt.\n\nAll eyes are on Netanyahu. If he rejects this deal, he will have to prove that his reasons were good enough.

It was offered by the mediators without first approving the terms with Israel, and may include conditions that Israel cannot accept. Israeli officials confirmed that they received Hamas's response this...\n\nA day after it seemed that a ceasefire deal between Hamas and Israel was all but dead, the terror group has issued a surprise statement announcing that it has accepted the deal offered by Egypt and Qatar. Optimism, though, would be premature at this point.\n\nThe deal accepted by Hamas is reportedly somewhat different to the one they had been considering in the last few days. It was offered by the mediators without first approving the terms with Israel, and may include conditions that Israel cannot accept. Israeli officials confirmed that they received Hamas's response this evening, and that the terms of the deal are being looked at by the government.\n\nIf Netanyahu rejects this deal, he will have to prove that his reasons were good enough\n\nIsraeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is under considerable public pressure to reach a deal that will secure the release of Israeli hostages. He has therefore agreed to make significant concessions, including in the number and nature of the prisoners Israel would release from prison and the length of a ceasefire. He may be required to make more concessions now. However, there are two issues that, if they are present in the current deal, would kill it dead in the water.\n\nThe first is a demand by Hamas for a permanent ceasefire. Allowing Hamas to keep control of Gaza and rebuild its military strength and influence poses an unacceptable risk for Israel. Nearly seven months into the war, Hamas still presents a major threat, which means that Israel cannot afford to stop fighting.\n\nThe second issue, which Hamas has demanded in the past, is giving the terrorist organization a free hand in choosing which prisoners will be released from prison without giving Israel veto rights. If this happens, Hamas could demand the release of dangerous arch-terrorist who would form the next generation of the group's leadership.\n\nA deal with terms that are more acceptable to Hamas is only one possible reason that the organization agreed to a deal after months of repeated rejections. If Israel rejects the deal, Hamas will point the finger at Israel as the sole reason that the war is continuing. Israel is facing immense global criticism and pressure, and Hamas hopes that Netanyahu rejecting the deal would lead to even greater pressure on Israel to succumb to a permanent truce, throwing Hamas a desperately needed lifeline.\n\nHamas's leaders are possibly also alarmed by Israel's recent move to start an invasion of Rafah. The southern city holds roughly 4,000 Hamas terrorists -- by far the largest concentration of the group's forces in the Strip. It therefore holds major strategic importance to Israel in their fight against them. However, they hope that as Israel considers the deal, an operation might be postponed.\n\nAfter weeks of dithering, the Israeli Defense Forces was given the order to evacuate Palestinian civilians from parts of the city in preparation for a pending offensive. Significant forces have been massing by the border, ready to go.\n\nThe IDF has been moving roughly 100,000 civilians out of Rafah's eastern neighborhoods. At this point Israel doesn't intend to conquer the entire city but is planning to launch a slow and gradual operation, which could be halted at any point in the event a ceasefire deal is reached. This leaves Hamas with the possibility of negotiating while the fighting goes on.\n\nAs part of the offensive, Israel plans to take control of the Rafah crossing, situated on the border with Egypt. This terrifies Hamas. It would allow Israel to stop the smuggling of weapons from Egyptian territory to Hamas. It could also prevent Hamas's leaders from escaping into Egypt.\n\nAll eyes are on Netanyahu. If he rejects this deal, he will have to prove that his reasons were good enough. Otherwise, it would likely trigger widespread condemnation from the Israeli public, the international community and from Israel's allies. Israel's relations with Egypt and Saudi Arabia, both of immense importance, also hang in the balance.\n\nHamas has made its move, and it's a smart one: it has now set the board for Israel to damage its own reputation further.

The announcement came shortly after Israel mandated evacuations in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, signaling preparations for a possible military offensive.\n\nDespite Hamas's acceptance, an Israeli official described the proposal as a \"softened\" version of a previous Egyptian initiative, containing terms that are reportedly unacceptable to Israel. According to this official, who wished to remain anonymous, the proposal's acceptance by Hamas might be strategically aimed to portray Israel as the obstructing party in peace efforts.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to restrain from escalating military actions in Rafah. The White House emphasized the importance of safeguarding Palestinian civilians in any military strategies executed in the region.\n\nIn a press briefing, U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller confirmed that \"Hamas has issued a response and we are reviewing that response now and discussing it with our partners in the region,\" adding that conversations \"will be ongoing in the next several hours.\"\n\n\"There has been a significant offer on the table. The ball has been in Hamas' court. We have made clear that they should accept that offer, that Israel made significant compromises,\" Miller stated.\n\nHe added that \"we cannot support an operation in Rafa as it is currently envisioned,\" as it \"would dramatically increase the suffering of the Palestinian people, would lead to an increase in loss of civilian life.\" This city currently shelters approximately half of Gaza's 2.3 million residents.\n\nAnswering to the closing of Al Jazeera broadcasting in Israel, Miller stated that the U.S. supports media freedom everywhere in the world, including in Israel, and he is \"concerned about this action.\"\n\nThe situation has also stirred significant unrest within Israel itself, where protesters have taken to the streets, blocking roads and demanding that their government agree to the ceasefire. The demonstrations underscore the growing domestic pressure on Netanyahu's administration to seek a peaceful resolution.\n\nMarket Reactions: Israeli stocks, as tracked by the iShares MSCI Israel ETF (NYSE:EIS), rose 0.4% on Monday.\n\nOil prices dropped sharply following the announcement of Hamas's acceptance of a ceasefire. However, they later regained most of those losses after it emerged that Israel considered the proposal to be a diluted version.\n\nThe United States Oil Fund (NYSE:USO), which tracks the performance of the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) light crude, was up 0.8%, snapping a 5-day losing streak.\n\nRead now: Stocks On Track For Third Green Session, Palantir Ignites Rally In Chipmakers, Commodities Rebound: What's Driving Markets Monday?\n\nPhoto: Shutterstock", "source": {"uri": "uk.investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hamas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafah", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Rafah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Egypt"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Turkish_offensive_into_north-eastern_Syria", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2019 Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinians", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Palestinians"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ismail_Haniyeh", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ismail Haniyeh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ceasefire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_City", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Gaza City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Palestine"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islamism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Qatar"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Netanyahu", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benjamin Netanyahu"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Israel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime Minister of Israel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_State", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of State"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_oil", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Price of oil"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Jazeera", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Al Jazeera"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Exchange-traded fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Texas_Intermediate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Texas Intermediate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSCI", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "MSCI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_the_press", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of the press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/LYNXMPEB0508S_L.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543483", "eventUri": "eng-9543483", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 452726416, "relevance": 2}], "totalResults": 106, "page": 1, "count": 1, "pages": 106}}}

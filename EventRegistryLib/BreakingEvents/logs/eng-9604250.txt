Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall has argued yes, but the answer from a federal court is no. \"The attorney general cannot constitutionally prosecute people for acts taken within the state meant to facilitate lawful out of state conduct, including obtaining an abortion,\" writes Judge Myron Thompson.\n\nAlabama has a law punishing any \"conspiracy formed in this state to do an act beyond the state, which, if done in this state, would be a criminal offense.\" The state was sued by the nonprofit Yellowhammer Fund, the Alabama Women's Center and others.

The judge says it goes back at least to the Magna Carta in 1215, which promised \"all merchants may enter or leave England unharmed and without fear.\"\n\nAfter U.S. independence, the Articles of Confederation guaranteed citizens \"free ingress and regress to and from any other state,\" with \"all the privileges of trade and commerce.\" This was the backdrop for the Constitution, which entitles Americans today \"to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states.\"\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh went a similar route in a concurrence to Dobbs, the ruling overturning Roe. \"As I see it,\" he said, \"some of the other abortion-related legal questions raised by today's decision are not especially difficult as a constitutional matter. For example, may a state bar a resident of that state from traveling to another state to obtain an abortion? In my view, the answer is no based on the constitutional right to interstate travel.\"\n\nJudge Thompson's small extension is to say that if a state can't directly stop women from leaving for abortions, \"it cannot accomplish the same end indirectly by prosecuting those who assist them.\" If Alabama held such power, it's hard to see the limiting principle. Other states could try to enforce their values by punishing anyone who helps their citizens fly to Las Vegas to gamble, to Colorado to smoke marijuana or to Alaska to hunt majestic grizzly bears.\n\nTags Dcc Lee-national Lee-opinion Wire Commentary Opinion Abortion In The United States Constitution Of The United States Law Justice Law Of The United States Public Law Government Common Law Federal Government Of The United States Politics Of The United States\n\nCatch the latest in Opinion\n\nGet opinion pieces, letters and editorials sent directly to your inbox weekly!\n\nSign up!\n\n* I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.", "source": {"uri": "journalnow.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Winston-Salem Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myron_Thompson", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Myron Thompson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_General_of_Alabama", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attorney General of Alabama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_(legal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Motion (legal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_State_Legislature", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana State Legislature"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guttmacher_Institute", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Guttmacher Institute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

Wade, some states have moved to limit abortions while others become sanctuaries.

Jon Cryer revealed that he didn\u2019t know Demi Moore was addicted to drugs when they dated in the 1980s. \u201cWe dated for a short time while we were working on \u2018No Small Affair,\u2019 but I guess our particular affair was, in fact, pretty small,\u201d Cryer, 59, told PEOPLE in an interview published Saturday. The \u201cTwo and a Half Men\u201d star continued: \u201cShe was already struggling with a drug problem. One that I was blissfully unaware of until a couple of weeks before the movie ended.\u201d As a member of the \u201cBrat Pack,\u201d Moore, 61, went to rehab for drug and alcohol addiction in the 1980s. She relapsed in 2012 and returned to rehab to get sober again. \u201cWhat would always be great about her was already evident; that incredible combination of vulnerability, toughness and beauty,\u201d Cryer added abut Moore. Cryer, who played Moore\u2019s love interest in 1984\u2019s \u201cNo Small Affair,\u201d said that he learned the ropes of Hollywood with her help. \u201cShe was incredibly charismatic and had a much better grasp of the business than I did,\u201d he told PEOPLE. \u201cShe knew everyone in town, but we were both really nervous about being leads in a movie for the first time.\u201d Moore\u2019s battle with addiction began in her 20s, when she started drinking heavily \u2014 and later using cocaine \u2014 to cope with her ever-increasing stardom. She went to rehab under the advice of \u201cSt. Elmo\u2019s Fire\u201d director Joel Schumacher in 1985 and remained sober for almost 20 years before relapsing in her 40s. In 2019, Moore recalled how she relapsed while on a trip with then-husband Ashton Kutcher. \u201cAshton said, \u2018I don\u2019t know if alcoholism\u2019s a thing. I think it\u2019s about moderation,\u2019 \u201d Moore said on Red Table Talk. \u201cIf I had stayed close to working my program\u2026 I, of course, lived the majority of my adult life sober. I was great sober.\u201d \u201cI made my own story up, that he wanted somebody that he could have wine with that he could do stuff [with],\u201d Moore added. \u201cHe\u2019s not the cause of why I opened that door up. I wanted to be something other than who I am. And I gave my power away.\u201d Moore has been sober since 2012. In her 2019 memoir \u201cInside Out,\u201d Moore wrote that Cryer lost his virginity to her \u2014 which he denied. \u201cWell, the good thing about this is she doesn\u2019t have to feel bad about it anymore, because while I\u2019m sure she was totally justified making that assumption based on my my skill level (and the stunned look on my face at the time), I had actually lost my virginity in high school,\u201d he wrote on Twitter (now X) at the time. \u201cBut she\u2019s right [about] the other part, I was over the moon for her during a very troubled time in her life. I have nothing but affection for her and not a regret in the world,\u201d Cryer added. The \u201cPassion of Mind\u201d actress and Cryer are both featured in the upcoming Hulu doc \u201cBRATS,\u201d directed by Moore\u2019s fellow Brat Pack member Andrew McCarthy. Cryer was always considered an adjacent member to the Brat Pack. \u201cI didn\u2019t perceive myself as part of the Brat Pack because I didn\u2019t think I was one of the cool kids,\u201d he told PEOPLE. \u201cAnd they were definitely the cool kids. I thought the two films that defined the group were \u2018The Breakfast Club\u2019 and \u2018St. Elmo\u2019s Fire,\u2019 neither of which was I in.\u201d Moore and Cryer both supported McCarthy at the \u201cBRATS\u201d world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival in NYC on Friday. Ally Sheedy and Howie Deutch were also there. \u201cBRATS\u201d premieres June 13 on Hulu.", "summary": "Jon Cryer and Demi Moore briefly dated after working together on \"No Small Affair.\"", "url": "https://nypost.com/2024/06/09/entertainment/jon-cryer-didnt-know-demi-moore-was-addicted-to-drugs-when-they-dated/", "image": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/06/jon-cryer-didn-t-know-83529604.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 15:12:52", "author": "Eric Todisco", "authors": ["Eric Todisco"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.06}

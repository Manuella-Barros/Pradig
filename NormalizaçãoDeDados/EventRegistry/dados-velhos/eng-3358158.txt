Their heads bounced off each other like marbles. Surely not again? Well, one of them was done for the day, but it wasn't Brayshaw. Rather than seeing stars, he starred in red and blue.\n\nComeback kid Brayshaw was a revelation, but it was Melbourne's experienced heads who helped haul the side over the line. As was the case three weeks ago against Port Adelaide, Melbourne had this game in the bag, then nearly let it slip, and had to win it again.\n\nJust shy of seven goals down deep into the second quarter, the Saints - knowing the desperation of their situation - worked their way back to trim the gap to just four points when Tim Membrey goaled early in the last quarter. But when cool heads were needed late, the Saints' ball use, which had been their undoing in the first half, let them down once more going forward. Down the other end, Dees forwards Jeff Garlett and Mitch Hannan - both barely sighted for three quarters - got going, with Garlett finishing nicely on the run to steady the ship before a pair of sublime set shots from Hannan sealed the deal, moving the Demons, sans the injured Jesse Hogan and omitted Jack Watts, within touching distance of their first final in 11 often painful years.\n\nJourneyman Cam Pedersen was a tower of strength both in the forward line and pinch-hitting in the ruck, while Jordan Lewis led by example, putting his body on the line in a final quarter contest with Saint Jade Gresham, and co-captain Nathan Jones, probably the most deserving Demon of all, was tireless in the midfield.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe opening major was soft. After seven goalless minutes of ferocious action, Saint Blake Acres ventured too close to Jack Viney, who was taking a free kick, the Demons co-captain gifted a goal from the resultant 50 metre penalty. After that the floodgates opened. Brimming with confidence, Melbourne attacked with purpose and found a tall St Kilda backline unable to withstand the heat.\n\nYou will now receive updates from Realfooty Newsletter Realfooty Newsletter\n\nGet the latest news and updates emailed straight to your inbox.\n\nBy submitting your email you are agreeing to Fairfax Media's terms and conditions and privacy policy .\n\nThe standout for the Demons was James Harmes, who played a quarter of rare brilliance. He kicked three goals, the first after making a stepladder of Jake Carlisle, the second a crisp snap and the third on the run after a neat baulk. Melbourne kicked six goals in total for the term. They had an abundance of impressive performers, but the Saints had too many struggling.

Their heads bounced off each other like marbles. Surely not again? Well, one of them was done for the day, but it wasn't Brayshaw. Rather than seeing stars, he starred in red and blue.\n\nComeback kid Brayshaw was a revelation, but it was Melbourne's experienced heads who helped haul the side over the line. As was the case three weeks ago against Port Adelaide, Melbourne had this game in the bag, then nearly let it slip, and had to win it again.\n\nJust shy of seven goals down deep into the second quarter, the Saints - knowing the desperation of their situation - worked their way back to trim the gap to just four points when Tim Membrey goaled early in the last quarter. But when cool heads were needed late, the Saints' ball use, which had been their undoing in the first half, let them down once more going forward. Down the other end, Dees forwards Jeff Garlett and Mitch Hannan - both barely sighted for three quarters - got going, with Garlett finishing nicely on the run to steady the ship before a pair of sublime set shots from Hannan sealed the deal, moving the Demons, sans the injured Jesse Hogan and omitted Jack Watts, within touching distance of their first final in 11 often painful years.\n\nJourneyman Cam Pedersen was a tower of strength both in the forward line and pinch-hitting in the ruck, while Jordan Lewis led by example, putting his body on the line in a final quarter contest with Saint Jade Gresham, and co-captain Nathan Jones, probably the most deserving Demon of all, was tireless in the midfield.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe opening major was soft. After seven goalless minutes of ferocious action, Saint Blake Acres ventured too close to Jack Viney, who was taking a free kick, the Demons co-captain gifted a goal from the resultant 50 metre penalty. After that the floodgates opened. Brimming with confidence, Melbourne attacked with purpose and found a tall St Kilda backline unable to withstand the heat.\n\nYou will now receive updates from Realfooty Newsletter Realfooty Newsletter\n\nGet the latest news and updates emailed straight to your inbox.\n\nBy submitting your email you are agreeing to Fairfax Media's terms and conditions and privacy policy .\n\nThe standout for the Demons was James Harmes, who played a quarter of rare brilliance. He kicked three goals, the first after making a stepladder of Jake Carlisle, the second a crisp snap and the third on the run after a neat baulk. Melbourne kicked six goals in total for the term. They had an abundance of impressive performers, but the Saints had too many struggling. Without the regular leads of Riewoldt, watching with Montagna from the sidelines, they lacked direction, and their execution was diabolical, with a helicopter from Sam Gilbert, a miscued floater from Luke Dunstan and a hurried Josh Bruce handball to no one among the lowlights.\n\nThe margin was 32 points at quarter-time, extended to 40 at the 22 minute mark of the second quarter, although the Saints had at least managed to get it back to 32 at the long change.\n\nMembrey put through the first goal of the half, but Grehsam missed a regulation set shot, and when Jake Melksham drilled a long-range goal approaching the 13 minute mark of the third term, the break was back beyond five goals, just as many as the Saints had kicked to that point.\n\nHowever Billy Longer wrested control of the ruck duel with Max Gawn, and the Saints were winning the lion's share of contested ball.

time-on of the second term. The Saints hit back, cutting the margin to just four points early in the last quarter, but Melbourne steadied to regain their spot in the top eight.\n\nThe win left the Demons in seventh, ahead of West Coast and the Western Bulldogs on percentage, with games against the last-placed Brisbane Lions and Collingwood - both at the MCG - to come.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet Goodwin was not getting carried away. \"It's certainly not where you sit now, it's where you sit at round 23, and I've said that a lot,\" Goodwin said.\n\nYou will now receive updates from Realfooty Newsletter Realfooty Newsletter\n\nGet the latest news and updates emailed straight to your inbox.\n\nBy submitting your email you are agreeing to Fairfax Media's terms and conditions and privacy policy .\n\n\"We've won today but we know we've got important matches ahead.

I think they'll be judged like every other player on our list.\n\n\"But ultimately it's a pretty simple philosophy from a coaching group about how we pick our team, and we picked players today that we felt were in form. Our best 22 was out there.\"\n\nBrayshaw, who hadn't played at senior level since round two having been plagued by concussion two years in a row, bounced back after a first-quarter clash of heads with Saint Koby Stevens, to be among the Dees' best. Stevens wasn't as lucky, sitting out the rest of the game on the bench with concussion and a burst eardrum.\n\nGoodwin was relieved Brayshaw was able to play out the game. \"I was pretty excited when he popped up. I thought he was terrific,\" Goodwin said.\n\n\"You know how much he's been through, and the family's been through.\"\n\nGoodwin also said the Demons could query a string of ruck free kicks paid against Max Gawn to Saints big man Billy Longer in a bid to gain greater clarity.\n\nThe Saints find themselves a win and more than nine per cent adrift of the eighth-placed Eagles with games against North Melbourne (Etihad Stadium) and Richmond (MCG) to come.\n\nRichardson said execution had been the issue. \"It's as bad as I've seen us use the footy,\" Richardson said.\n\n\"It was a big game for the club, it was a big game for the group, they'd given themselves every opportunity to really keep our season alive...and we weren't able to execute.\"\n\nHowever he remained upbeat about the club's future despite an apparent stagnation this year following a ninth-place finish in 2016. \"What I do know, is I know we've got the personnel. We have high expectations of our players. We've got a lot of blokes moving into that 50, 60, 70 game bracket now, where consistency of performance should be there.\n\n\"We're clearly not quite there yet.\"\n\nRichardson also said he expected retiring champion Nick Riewoldt to face the Kangaroos after missing Sunday's game with concussion, but would not shed any light on the future of out-of-contract veteran Leigh Montagna, who has previously conceded his career may be over after a serious hamstring injury last month.", "timeCrawl": "10:12:00", "sim": 0.686274528503418, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8900524", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "id": 49, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "id": 51, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "id": 52, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "id": 134, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games", "id": 138, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Abstract", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Abstract", "id": 751, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

So when the Demon \"popped up\", the Melbourne coach was excited, a feeling that can only have strengthened as Brayshaw proceeded to \"tear it apart\", to borrow the assessment of Gawn.\n\n\"You know how much he has been through, we have a real empathy for the Brayshaw family, so to see him come through that ... he handled the contest really well,\" Goodwin said after the 14.12 (96) to 10.12 (72) win.\n\nIn his first senior game in almost five months, Brayshaw gathered 26 disposals, 10 of them contested, creating drive for the Demons from half-back. After the match, he said he was \"feeling incredible\".\n\n\"It's been so long and I have been dreaming about this ... playing well in a winning side in front of a big crowd,\" he said.\n\n\"Situations like the (bump) have been weeks in the making where I have built up harder and harder at going at the ball in a critical contest.\n\n\"That was one of those instances where it was my turn to go. Maybe a month ago, when I first started, I wouldn't have gone as hard, but I'm really confident in my preparation and where I'm at with my head.\n\n\"My mum would have been hating it, but I was fine.\"\n\nAnd it gives the Demons something to look forward to as they seek to book their first finals appearance since 2006 with clashes against Brisbane at the MCG next week and Collingwood in the final round.\n\n\"We know he has some extreme talent. He can create off half-back and he has some genuine speed, so he can be an important player for us,\" Goodwin said.\n\nMelbourne have generally been sound on the road but recent losses to the Kangaroos in Hobart and the Giants in Canberra placed them under pressure.\n\nThey responded strongly against the Saints in a match with much at stake, snaring six goals to one in the opening term to open up a 32-point lead at quarter-time.\n\nSt Kilda coach Alan Richardson later said it was \"as bad as I have seen us using the footy\".\n\nAfter halftime, the Saints edged back into the contest and when Tim Membrey snared a goal in the opening minute of the final term, the margin was back to four points.\n\nBut with Jeff Garlett creating space in attack and Cam Pedersen performing strongly, the Demons responded soundly in what was a critical win.\n\nOn paper, the Demons are now well placed to play finals with a fortnight remaining.\n\nMelbourne jumped three spots to seventh, just 0.25 of a percentage point ahead of West Coast, who also moved back into the eight after holding off Carlton at home.\n\nThe Western Bulldogs are level with Melbourne and West Coast on wins but trail by them seven percentage points.

the Melbourne faithful have perched in their MCG seats hoping and waiting but mostly enduring.\n\nSince their last final 240 games ago, they have seen the tanking saga, the Mark Neeld years, the deaths of Jimmy Stynes and Robbie Flower.\n\nFinally, the Victorian team with the longest finals drought is on the precipice.\n\nOn Sunday, Simon Goodwin's Demons unleashed an early MCG blitzkrieg then withstood St Kilda's fierce comeback from 39 points down.\n\nAs a result the Demons have their finals destiny in their own hands.\n\nThose members in their crisp suits in the Long Room and chinos and blazer in the MCC members rose as one to salute them.\n\nInstead of a second half basking in the victory it was a white-knuckle ride as St Kilda drew within four points early in the last term.\n\nBut after a 24-point victory the Demons are in the eight and have a simple equation: win against Brisbane and Collingwood and they play finals.\n\nSunday's win was symbolised in a single contest.\n\nHalfway through the first quarter Angus Brayshaw and Koby Stevens charged into the fray chasing the Sherrin.\n\nBrayshaw, in his first game back from four recent concussions, had every reason to back down.\n\nThey cannoned into each other with such ferocity it seemed inevitable Brayshaw would be jogging to the sidelines, his career in jeopardy.\n\nYet instead he got up and dominated the first half, with Stevens the unfortunate recipient of a game-ending concussion.\n\nSo often on the receiving end, Brayshaw ended up with 26 possessions, two strong saving marks and a hint that he could again be a star.\n\nMelbourne captain Nathan Jones said when everything was on the line Melbourne's contest game reappeared in the last term.\n\n\"I am so proud we were able to execute. It was a big crowd (53,115), a big day and the stakes were big for both clubs. I felt like we had that energy going today.\n\n\"There was a steely focus and we also went back to trying to go out and enjoy the game and have fun and it worked.\"\n\nJones was only metres from Brayshaw when he was floored and could have been forgiven for thinking the worst.\n\n\"I saw it, it flashed into the corner of my eye and I was worried ... but a couple of minutes later I saw him run past me and I was excited.\n\n\"I said to him, 'there is another test for you'. Every time he recovers from something like that it gives him confidence.\n\n\"The way he played, it looked like he didn't miss a beat. I am really close to him and he is like a little brother to me.\n\n\"I drove in with him today and he was ecstatic to be back, he puts a lot of pressure on himself but he has got that much talent.\n\n\"He took a long period away and put the work in and every time he takes a hit like that and bounces back up, it adds another level of confidence.\"\n\nThere were so many unlikely heroes for Simon Goodwin after his demotion of Jack Watts showed he wanted performances over reputation.\n\nFirst it was James Harmes with his three first-term goals, then Cam Pedersen joining the party in Watts' absence.\n\nHe was everywhere, with 26 possessions, two goals, six tackles and a real presence around the ground.\n\nFinally, as St Kilda looked likely to rip away this game, Mitch Hannan's five-minute cameo sealed the contest.\n\nFirst he nailed a difficult long set shot from close to the boundary before a skyscraper goal and mark to end St Kilda's valiant resistance.\n\nIn between the midfield was tougher for longer against their St Kilda counterparts.\n\nThe inside strength of co-captain Nathan Jones and Clayton Oliver, the poise of Jordan Lewis and the under-rated talents of Alex Neal-Bullen combined perfectly.\n\nBilly Longer had the better of Max Gawn and Jake Carlisle was a rock in the back six.\n\nBut too many Saints went in and out of the game or just couldn't finish the deal.\n\nJack Billings played out the contest with a half-shut eye but instead of five goals had 1.3 and a shot out of bounds.\n\nJosh Bruce found new ways to butcher chances, missing everything from point blank then having the ball bounce back over his shoulder as he ran into an open goal.\n\nSt Kilda's third-term fightback might have been rousing, but the 4.7 they put on the scoreboard said everything about their lack of potency.\n\nMELBOURNE: C.Pedersen, N.Jones, A.Brayshaw, C.Oliver, J.Lewis, J.Harmes, A.Neal-Bullen\n\nST KILDA: B.Longer, J.Carlisle, S.Ross, J.Steele, J.Billings, D.Roberton, L.Dunstan", "timeCrawl": "08:22:00", "sim": 0.6235294342041016, "extractedDates": null, "location": null, "originalArticle": null, "date": "2017-08-13", "id": "8889701", "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "id": 49, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "id": 51, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "id": 52, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "id": 134, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "id": 135, "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "id": 641, "wgt": 100}], "details": {}}

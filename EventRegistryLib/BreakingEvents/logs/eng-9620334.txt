(AP) -- NASCAR on Tuesday granted Kyle Larson the waiver he needs to remain eligible to compete in this year's playoffs despite missing the Coca-Cola 600 because he instead ran the Indianapolis 500.\n\nThe decision came after nearly nine days of internal NASCAR debate over whether Larson should be punished for choosing to stay in Indianapolis, where rain delayed the May 26 race by four hours. That meant Larson had zero chance of making it back to Charlotte in time to start the Coca-Cola 600.\n\nBut it was always his intent to race at Charlotte Motor Speedway and Larson did make it to the track, only for the race to be called for rain before he ever turned a lap in his No. 5 Chevrolet. Justin Allgaier started in Larson's place and was credited with a 13th-place finish.\n\n\"This was without a doubt unchartered waters; in the past, those waivers had been given mostly for medical reasons or for drivers suspended from our event, and those waivers were granted fairly quickly,\" said Elton Sawyer, NASCAR senior vice president of competition. \"This one was unprecedented in that we had a driver miss one of our races, one of our Cup championship events, to be at another event. That's why it took as long as it did. The time we took, which was a week, was exactly the right time we needed to make the decision.\"\n\nLarson reacted to the waiver with a meme he posted on social media of him giving the thumbs-up, but it was quickly deleted.\n\nLarson, who has two wins this season that make him automatically eligible for the playoffs, had his Cup Series standings altered after Sunday's race outside St. Louis. Although he was listed as second in the overall standings, all his playoff points had been wiped away.\n\nThe playoff points were restored in Tuesday's standings.\n\n\"To not have Kyle Larson in our playoff and give our fans the opportunity, the chance to him race for a championship, at the end of the day, that didn't feel that was the right decision for us to make,\" Sawyer said.\n\nLarson, who finished 18th at Indianapolis in large part because of a late speeding penalty, had worked out a minute-by-minute plan with Hendrick Motorsports to ensure he'd make the start of the Coke 600. But when rain disrupted the Indy 500, Rick Hendrick decided to keep Larson in Indianapolis.\n\nAll of Hendrick Motorsports was in constant contact with NASCAR and under the impression there was no issue so long as Larson made it back to compete in the 600.\n\nSawyer said no one from Hendrick was ever guaranteed a waiver if Larson did not make the NASCAR race.\n\n\"Under normal circumstances, completing 'The Double' is one of the toughest tests in sports. Despite our best efforts, this year's combination of weather conditions in Indianapolis and Charlotte made it impossible,\" Hendrick said. \"Although losing ground in the standings was hard to swallow, we were especially disappointed for the fans at the Coca-Cola 600 who were not able to see Kyle race.\n\n\"I'm extremely proud of everything he did to prepare and the months of planning by our team and our partners at Arrow McLaren to run these two crown jewel events. We hoped race day would play out differently, but the program was still incredibly positive for everyone involved. Kyle's performance throughout May was a great reflection on the level of talent competing each week in the NASCAR Cup Series. We appreciate NASCAR communicating with us throughout the effort and granting our request for a playoff waiver.\"\n\nLarson was the fifth driver in history to attempt to run the Indianapolis 500 and Coca-Cola 600 in the same day. Only Tony Stewart in 2001 completed all 1,100 miles.\n\nThere is concern now that NASCAR's tough stance will deter drivers from trying the feat in the future. Larson had a two-year deal with Arrow McLaren and Hendrick to run Indy again in 2025, but it is not clear if NASCAR's lengthy deliberations will upend those plans.\n\nWHAT IS A WAIVER\n\nWaivers in NASCAR until now have been handed out like candy.\n\nWhen NASCAR launched the playoff system in which a regular-season victory locked a driver into the playoffs, it wanted to ensure the driver wouldn't start skipping races because their slot in the championship playoffs was guaranteed.\n\nSo NASCAR said the drivers still needed to participate in all the events. But if they got injured? Well, then a waiver was available to excuse the absence from the Cup Series event.\n\nSince then, the issue has become murky at best. NASCAR has granted waivers for physical injuries and illness but also for mental health and a suspension for accusations of domestic violence. Matt Kenseth, who had not driven in the Cup Series since 2018 when Chip Ganassi hired him during Larson's suspension in 2020 for using a racial slur, even got a waiver.\n\nAge waivers have been given in the Truck Series for drivers who missed the start of the season because they weren't old enough to compete full time. Chase Elliott, Larson's teammate at Hendrick Motorsports, last year was given two waivers: one for missing races while injured, the second for missing a race while he was under NASCAR suspension for intentionally wrecking Denny Hamlin.\n\nThe rulebook states that \"Unless otherwise authorized by NASCAR, driver(s) and Team Owner(s) must start all Championship Events of the current season to be eligible for The Playoffs. If a starting position was not earned, then the driver(s) and Team Owner(s) must have attempted to Qualify, at the discretion of the Series Managing Director, for the Race.\"\n\nSawyer conceded that although the rain in Indianapolis meant Larson was not at Charlotte in time for the start of the race, Larson made every attempt to race the 600.\n\n\"Our decision-making was, although we had the inclement weather in Indy as well as Charlotte, Kyle made every attempt to get to Charlotte,\" Sawyer said. \"He was standing in the pit box with his helmet on, ready to go, and unfortunately we had weather in Charlotte, as well, and we weren't fortunate enough to get the race going again.\"", "source": {"uri": "valleycentral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KVEO-TV"}, "authors": [{"uri":

That meant Larson had zero chance of making it back to Charlotte in time to start the Coca-Cola 600.\n\nBut it was always his intent to race at Charlotte Motor Speedway and Larson did make it to the track, only for the race to be called for rain before he ever turned a lap in his No. 5 Chevrolet. Justin Allgaier started in Larson's place and was credited with a 13th-place finish.\n\n\"This was without a doubt unchartered waters; in the past, those waivers had been given mostly for medical reasons or for drivers suspended from our event, and those waivers were granted fairly quickly,\" said Elton Sawyer, NASCAR senior vice president of competition. \"This one was unprecedented in that we had a driver miss one of our races, one of our Cup championship events, to be at another event. That's why it took as long as it did. The time we took, which was a week, was exactly the right time we needed to make the decision.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

Although he was listed as second in the overall standings, all his playoff points had been wiped away.\n\nThe playoff points were restored in Tuesday's standings.\n\n\"To not have Kyle Larson in our playoff and give our fans the opportunity, the chance to him race for a championship, at the end of the day, that didn't feel that was the right decision for us to make,\" Sawyer said.\n\nLarson, who finished 18th at Indianapolis in large part because of a late speeding penalty, had worked out a minute-by-minute plan with Hendrick Motorsports to ensure he'd make the start of the Coke 600. But when rain disrupted the Indy 500, Rick Hendrick decided to keep Larson in Indianapolis.\n\nAll of Hendrick Motorsports was in constant contact with NASCAR and under the impression there was no issue so long as Larson made it back to compete in the 600.\n\nSawyer said no one from Hendrick was ever guaranteed a waiver if Larson did not make the NASCAR race.\n\n\"Under normal circumstances, completing 'The Double' is one of the toughest tests in sports. Despite our best efforts, this year's combination of weather conditions in Indianapolis and Charlotte made it impossible,\" Hendrick said. \"Although losing ground in the standings was hard to swallow, we were especially disappointed for the fans at the Coca-Cola 600 who were not able to see Kyle race.\n\n\"I'm extremely proud of everything he did to prepare and the months of planning by our team and our partners at Arrow McLaren to run these two crown jewel events. We hoped race day would play out differently, but the program was still incredibly positive for everyone involved. Kyle's performance throughout May was a great reflection on the level of talent competing each week in the NASCAR Cup Series. We appreciate NASCAR communicating with us throughout the effort and granting our request for a playoff waiver.\"\n\nLarson was the fifth driver in history to attempt to run the Indianapolis 500 and Coca-Cola 600 in the same day. Only Tony Stewart in 2001 completed all 1,100 miles.\n\nThere is concern now that NASCAR's tough stance will deter drivers from trying the feat in the future. Larson had a two-year deal with Arrow McLaren and Hendrick to run Indy again in 2025, but it is not clear if NASCAR's lengthy deliberations will upend those plans.\n\nWhat is a waiver\n\nWaivers in NASCAR until now have been handed out like candy.\n\nWhen NASCAR launched the playoff system in which a regular-season victory locked a driver into the playoffs, it wanted to ensure the driver wouldn't start skipping races because their slot in the championship playoffs was guaranteed.\n\nSo NASCAR said the drivers still needed to participate in all the events. But if they got injured? Well, then a waiver was available to excuse the absence from the Cup Series event.\n\nSince then, the issue has become murky at best. NASCAR has granted waivers for physical injuries and illness but also for mental health and a suspension for accusations of domestic violence. Matt Kenseth, who had not driven in the Cup Series since 2018 when Chip Ganassi hired him during Larson's suspension in 2020 for using a racial slur, even got a waiver.\n\nAge waivers have been given in the Truck Series for drivers who missed the start of the season because they weren't old enough to compete full time. Chase Elliott, Larson's teammate at Hendrick Motorsports, last year was given two waivers: one for missing races while injured, the second for missing a race while he was under NASCAR suspension for intentionally wrecking Denny Hamlin.\n\nThe rulebook states that \"Unless otherwise authorized by NASCAR, driver(s) and Team Owner(s) must start all Championship Events of the current season to be eligible for The Playoffs. If a starting position was not earned, then the driver(s) and Team Owner(s) must have attempted to Qualify, at the discretion of the Series Managing Director, for the Race.\"\n\nSawyer conceded that although the rain in Indianapolis meant Larson was not at Charlotte in time for the start of the race, Larson made every attempt to race the 600.\n\n\"Our decision-making was, although we had the inclement weather in Indy as well as Charlotte, Kyle made every attempt to get to Charlotte,\" Sawyer said. \"He was standing in the pit box with his helmet on, ready to go, and unfortunately we had weather in Charlotte, as well, and we weren't fortunate enough to get the race going again.\"\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet

NASCAR is expected to announce the decision Tuesday morning.\n\nThe team submitted the request after Larson missed a race at Charlotte Motor Speedway last month to compete in the Indianapolis 500 on the same day. Larson, the 2021 Cup champion, needed the waiver to maintain playoff eligibility because he was attempting the \"Double\" -- racing in both the Indy 500 and Coca-Cola 600 on May 26 -- but missed the start of the NASCAR race.\n\nNASCAR requires drivers to start all 26 regular-season races if they are to earn one of 16 playoff spots.\n\nTypically, there is enough of a gap between the finish of the Indy 500 and the start of the Coca-Cola 600 to allow a driver to travel from Indianapolis to Charlotte. Four drivers have completed the \"Double\" previously, with Larson attempting to become the fifth.\n\nHowever, Larson's plans were complicated when the start of the Indy 500 was delayed four hours due to inclement weather. And instead of forgoing the Indy 500, Larson and Hendrick leadership decided to remain at Indianapolis and skip the start of the Coca-Cola 600.\n\nJustin Allgaier started Larson's car in NASCAR's longest race. Since Larson was not in the car at the start, Allgaier was considered the driver of record, necessitating Larson needing a waiver.\n\nAfter the Indy 500, Larson immediately flew to Charlotte (he finished 18th at Indy) where he was planning to relieve Allgaier, but inclement weather also scuttled that plan. By the time Larson arrived at the track and was prepared to get in his car, NASCAR had stopped the race due to inclement weather.\n\nThe race was not restarted. NASCAR historically has judiciously given waivers out when requests have been made.\n\nOften those requests pertain to drivers missing races due to injury, and even when a driver has been suspended for an on- or off-track incident. But Larson skipping a NASCAR to compete in a race outside its sanction was unique, raising questions about whether Larson should be given a waiver since he chose to prioritize the Indy 500.\n\nMany NASCAR drivers have since publicly voiced support for Larson saying he should be granted a waiver as he was attempting to do something special that raised the profile for motorsports as a whole.\n\n\"Kyle Larson is going to win five or six or seven races this year,\" Michael McDowell said. \"To sit here and say that he's not going to get a waiver because he tried to do the 'Double' and brought a tremendous amount of eyeballs on our sport and a tremendous amount of eyeballs on IndyCar and just helped motorsports all together is crazy. So I know that there's arguments to that, but I mean, come on, we're talking about the best driver that's ever sat in a stock car and we're not going to give him a pass? That's crazy.\"\n\nHad NASCAR not granted Larson a waiver it would've created a controversial storyline that hung over the sport for the remainder of the season -- and potentially beyond.\n\nLarson is considered one of the favorites to win the Cup championship, and before missing the Charlotte race, he was leading the point standings and had already virtually locked up a playoff spot based on winning two races.\n\nEven despite Larson missing a race, he is only 21 points behind championship leader Denny Hamlin with 11 regular-season races remaining.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeff_gluck@nytimes.com", "name": "Jeff Gluck", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "jordan_bianchi@nytimes.com", "name": "Jordan Bianchi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola_600", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coca-Cola 600"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Motor_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte Motor Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_500", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis 500"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Larson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Larson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Allgaier", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Justin Allgaier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_Cup_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR Cup Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrick_Motorsports", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hendrick Motorsports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denny_Hamlin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denny Hamlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_car_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock car racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_McDowell_(racing_driver)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michael McDowell (racing driver)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Auto Racing", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/06/03223145/GettyImages-2150432488-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9620334", "eventUri": "eng-9620334", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-26", "textStart": 545, "textEnd": 551}], "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 222, "relevance": 1}

Larson was attempting to run both the Indianapolis 500 and the 600 in the same day on May 26, but rain delayed the start of the Indianapolis 500 by four hours. Larson flew to Charlotte for the 600 right after the 500 was over, but didn't get in the car because rain halted the race after 249 of 400 scheduled laps. Justin Allgaier, Larson's substitute driver, finished 13th.\n\nNASCAR rules state that drivers must start every race to be eligible for the playoffs. However, the sanctioning body has been very generous with playoff waivers. It seemed that the likelihood of a waiver influenced Larson's decision to stay for the 500, but NASCAR waited over a week to grant it.\n\nNASCAR even listed Larson without any playoff points in its official points report following Sunday's race at Gateway. Larson finished 10th and is second in the points standings behind Denny Hamlin. However, he was listed without any playoff points and was, at least temporarily, shown as ineligible for the title. Larson had accrued 17 playoff points through the first 13 races of the season before missing the 600.\n\nNASCAR's waiver generosity\n\nNASCAR has rarely denied requests for playoff waivers over the past decade. It regularly grants waivers for injuries and has even twice granted playoff waivers to Cup Series drivers who had been suspended by the sanctioning body.\n\nIn 2015, Kyle Busch got a waiver to compete for the playoffs after suffering multiple leg injuries in the season-opening Xfinity Series race at Daytona. When he returned to the Cup Series over the summer, he won multiple races to earn a playoff spot and went on to win his first Cup Series title. A season ago, Alex Bowman received a waiver to be playoff eligible -- he missed the postseason -- when he suffered a back fracture in a sprint car crash.\n\nThe same season Kyle Busch got his waiver, Kurt Busch also got a playoff waiver following a suspension. NASCAR had suspended Kurt Busch at the start of the season following accusations of domestic abuse. After those allegations didn't result in criminal charges, Busch was reinstated and allowed to compete for the championship.\n\nIn 2023, NASCAR suspended Chase Elliott for a race after he hooked Denny Hamlin head-on into the wall during the 600. Elliott's suspension also came with a playoff waiver. It was the second time Elliott had received a playoff waiver that season after he missed early-season races following a leg injury while snowboarding.\n\nWhy did it take so long?\n\nNASCAR's waiver decisions have also typically come quickly. That quickness is a big reason why it didn't make much sense for the sanctioning body to drag out the decision to give Larson a waiver. The possibility of rain affecting both races was known for days, and Larson isn't the first driver to have a double attempt derailed by rain either.\n\nIn a news conference Tuesday morning, NASCAR vice president of competition Elton Sawyer said the Larson situation was \"uncharted waters\" and that it was \"unprecedented\" that Larson had chosen to run the Indianapolis 500 over the Cup Series race. That unique situation, Sawyer said, contributed to the timeline, and he also noted Larson's willingness to get into the car if the race resumed after the rain delay.\n\nAnd while there's no reason to believe Sawyer isn't telling the truth, this shouldn't have been a difficult decision for NASCAR to make either. Denying Larson the waiver would have caused an unnecessary firestorm.\n\nNASCAR is far from the mainstream sports series that it was in the early 2000s. Larson's attempt to run the double was the only significant storyline of the famed Memorial Day race weekend.\n\nBy denying Larson a waiver, NASCAR would have looked petty, even if it could stand by its own rules and simply say that Larson and Hendrick Motorsports broke a rule that they knew was on the books.\n\nNASCAR can't be in the business of losing PR battles, even if it's enforcing its own rules. Denying Larson a waiver after giving drivers waivers following suspensions could have looked quite hypocritical. Larson is arguably the best driver in the United States and one of the most popular. His championship ineligibility would have hung over NASCAR for the rest of the season.\n\nThankfully, NASCAR made the correct decision, even if it took longer than it should have.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nick_bromberg@aol.com", "name": "Nick Bromberg", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_Cup_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR Cup Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola_600", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coca-Cola 600"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_500", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis 500"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Larson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Larson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Allgaier", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justin Allgaier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denny_Hamlin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denny Hamlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Busch", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Busch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Busch", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kurt Busch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_Xfinity_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR Xfinity Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elton_Sawyer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elton Sawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_car_racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sprint car racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Bowman", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alex Bowman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daytona_International_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Daytona International Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chase_Elliott", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chase Elliott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowboarding", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Snowboarding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrick_Motorsports", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hendrick Motorsports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Memorial Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/9HK.QIOIBNDFlXcZLkmADw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MzA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_yahoo_sports_800/1615c6eeb18a8a3f5a7a8c0e83628824", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9620334", "eventUri": "eng-9620334", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-26", "textStart": 408, "textEnd": 414}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 220, "relevance": 1}

(AP) -- NASCAR on Tuesday granted Kyle Larson the waiver he needs to remain eligible to compete in this year's playoffs despite missing the Coca-Cola 600 because he instead ran the Indianapolis 500.\n\nThe decision came after nearly nine days of internal NASCAR debate over whether Larson should be punished for choosing to stay in Indianapolis, where rain delayed the May 26 race by four hours. That meant Larson had zero chance of making it back to Charlotte in time to start the Coca-Cola 600.\n\nBut it was always his intent to race at Charlotte Motor Speedway and Larson did make it to the track, only to have the race called for rain before he ever turned a lap in his No. 5 Chevrolet. Justin Allgaier started in Larson's place and was credited with a 13th-place finish.\n\n\"This one was unprecedented in that we had a driver miss one of our races, our championship races, to be at another event,\" said Elton Sawyer, NASCAR senior vice president of competition. \"The time we took, which was a week, was exactly the right time we needed to make the decision.\"\n\nLarson, who has two wins this season that make him automatically eligible for the playoffs, had his Cup Series standings altered after Sunday's race outside St. Louis. Although he was listed as second in the overall standings, all his playoff points had been wiped away.\n\nThe playoff points were restored in Tuesday's standings.\n\nLarson, who finished 18th at Indianapolis in large part because of a late speeding penalty, had worked out a minute-by-minute plan with Hendrick Motorsports to ensure he'd made the start of the Coke 600. But when rain disrupted the Indy 500, Rick Hendrick made the decision to keep Larson in Indianapolis.\n\nAll of Hendrick Motorsports was in constant contact with NASCAR and under the impression there was no issue so long as Larson made it back to compete in the 600.\n\nSawyer said no one from Hendrick was ever guaranteed a waiver if Larson did not make the NASCAR race.\n\nLarson was the fifth driver in history to attempt to run the Indianapolis 500 and Coca-Cola 600 in the same day. Only Tony Stewart in 2001 completed all 1,100 miles.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

In fact, there are reportedly people in NASCAR who would like to deny Larson the waiver.\n\nKyle Larson is second in points this season, he has two wins, and is probably the favorite to win the championship in 2024. He is seen as the most talented driver in the Cup Series and potentially in North America. But NASCAR is thinking about keeping him from being eligible to race for the championship.\n\nThe Athletic reporters, Jeff Gluck and Jordan Bianchi, talked about the possibility of NASCAR denying Larson a waiver on their podcast, The Teardown.\n\n\"It's a very real issue,\" Gluck said of the Larson waiver decision. \"All week long I've seen so many people speculating. ... I'm sorry to tell you guys, that is not the case. The reason that this has not been announced yet, what they're doing is because they don't know and not only do they not know, but there is serious consideration to not giving Kyle Larson a waiver. Let me say that again, serious consideration, to not giving Kyle Larson the waiver.\n\n\"Now, that doesn't mean that they won't do it. I would view it as cooler heads will prevail, perhaps. But there is factually, unquestionably, people within NASCAR in the competition department that are against the waiver for Kyle Larson and discussions are still going on that is why we do not know. It's not because 'Oh they're just making it dramatic, they're just stringing them along.' That is not the case. They are weighing to actually whether to actually do this or not.\"\n\nJordan Bianchi added:\n\n\"And there is no rush to make a decision. I think you may see a decision sooner rather than later but there isn't a drop dead, we have to have this done within a week or two. You could run this out for honestly the whole summer if you wanted to.\"\n\nUltimately it is up to NASCAR to decide. They can pick one of two routes. One, stick by the rules and ignore the part that says they can do whatever they want. Two, give Larson the waiver and move on from this.\n\nLast season we saw what happened when Chase Elliott wasn't in the NASCAR Playoffs. Ratings took a step back. It felt like one of the stars of the sport was missing. Even though he made it to the Round of 8 in the Owners Championship, that's not the one fans care about.\n\nExcluding Kyle Larson would be worse in many ways. He's more or less taken a 60-point penalty by missing the Coca-Cola 600 and he's still P2 in points. Now imagine Larson ends up the regular season champion and maybe even the wins leader. Then he's not allowed to be in the playoffs.", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jonathan_howard@on3.com", "name": "Jonathan Howard", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Larson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Larson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_Cup_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR Cup Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola_600", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coca-Cola 600"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chase_Elliott", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chase Elliott"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Beauty_Pageants", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Beauty Pageants", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme_Merchandise", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Theme Merchandise", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Rodeo_Queens", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Rodeo/Rodeo Queens", "wgt": 6}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 49}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2023/09/03214141/kyle-larson-southern-500.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9620334", "eventUri": "eng-9620334", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 219, "relevance": 1}

Now, he is not even listed in the points report for the playoffs.\n\nThis could mean nothing, but right now, NASCAR is acting as though Kyle Larson is not eligible for the playoffs. That doesn't mean a decision has been made, necessarily. However, it is something to take notice of after the Enjoy Illinois 300.\n\nJeff Gluck of The Athletic noticed the small omission from the points report after the race. So, at this moment in time, Larson is not eligible for the playoffs. Does that mean it stays this way? Does this mean a decision has been made?\n\nI'm not so sure.\n\nNow, this shouldn't make anyone panic too much. On Monday after the Coca-Cola 600, NASCAR did not have Kyle Larson listed as a playoff driver on their website's standings page. It's just the fact he missed the race and does not have a waiver at this time. So, he cannot be playoff-eligible until it is granted.\n\nThink of this as more procedural than anything. Still, the longer this drags on, the more concerned Larson and his team should be. What everyone thought would be an easy decision has not turned into the debate of the season.\n\nPersonally, it feels like a no-brainer to give him this waiver. If a driver can get a waiver after being suspended for their on-track actions, then Larson deserves one here, plain and simple. I can understand if you are being a letter-of-the-law kind of person who believes it shouldn't be granted, but NASCAR has never operated that way.\n\nNASCAR can make any decision they feel is appropriate. That should be a waiver to Larson.\n\nKyle Larson explains Kyle Busch wreck after race\n\nNow, back to what happened on the track, Kyle Larson was good today. He had a top-5 car at the beginning of the race. However, he didn't get to show it thanks to an incident with Kyle Busch.\n\nThe two drivers got into each other, Larson got loose going into Turn 1, and then they both went up towards the wall. Busch suffered enough damage to end his day. Larson thought he had a flat, but came out unscathed.\n\nAfter the race, Larson broke down what happened to lead up to that incident.\n\n\"Yeah we were coming to the end of that stage and I was a little bit better than him and left four to side-draft him and barely touched his quarter panel and I don't know, I guess it ticked him off and he squeezed into me,\" Larson said. \"I honestly thought I had a flat when I turned into one because it just turned around backwards, but I guess he must have just took the air off of me and [I] spun. I'm not sure what his side of it was, but that was my side, I guess.\"\n\nKyle Larson salvaged a top-10 finish at Gateway. Things just didn't line up today but he made the most of it.

It was the end result everyone expected, but the way we arrived at our destination was anything but a sure thing.\n\nSome have wondered if NASCAR will adjust their policy, in light of the conversation around Larson potentially being denied a waiver. However, it seems NASCAR will remain set in their ways, according to Sawyer.\n\n\"Sawyer says he does not think NASCAR will change its waiver policy after this,\" Jeff Gluck of The Athletic posted on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nRegardless of how NASCAR arrived at this point, the right decision was in fact made, as Larson will now be eligible to race for the 2024 NASCAR Cup Series title. If he was deprived an opportunity after making every effort possible to race in the Coca-Cola 600, it would've set a terrible precedent, especially for future drivers who'd like to attempt to race in both the Indianapolis 500 and fly to Charlotte afterwards.\n\nAlas, Elton Sawyer and the rest of NASCAR's decision-makers hit the nail on the head by approving Kyle Larson's waiver, but don't expect more concrete guidelines in the future, as it's evident these situations will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.\n\nMoreover, it's the second waiver of the season that NASCAR has granted, as Erik Jones received one following his back injury stemming from a wreck at Talladega. Now, Larson will finally be granted one, although his reason for missing the race at Charlotte did not stem from an injury, as we all know.\n\nSome believed Larson may not receive the waiver, as the Hendrick Motorsports star chose to race in the Indianapolis 500 instead of the Coca-Cola 600. While he made it to Charlotte with enough time to finish the race for the No. 5 team, Mother Nature had other plans, and Larson didn't get to run any of the race like he had originally planned.\n\nAdditionally, Hendrick Motorsports is no stranger to the playoff waiver situation, as Chase Elliott received one for his off-track injury that forced him to miss multiple races last season. However, it didn't end up making a difference, as Elliott missed the playoffs anyways.\n\nLarson on the other hand, he has a win already in 2024, which locks in him into the playoffs for this season. He'll still have a shot at the championship after being granted the waiver, and he'll look to lift the trophy at the end of the season after not running the full schedule, like Kyle Busch did in 2015 when he broke his leg earlier in the season.\n\nRegardless, Kyle Larson is one of NASCAR's biggest stars, if not the biggest. The playoffs wouldn't be complete without him, and now we won't have to worry about that possibility, as Larson has been granted the waiver by NASCAR.", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "steve_samra@on3.com", "name": "Steve Samra", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elton_Sawyer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elton Sawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Larson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Larson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola_600", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coca-Cola 600"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_500", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis 500"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_Cup_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR Cup Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Erik Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talladega_Superspeedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Talladega Superspeedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrick_Motorsports", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hendrick Motorsports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chase_Elliott", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chase Elliott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Busch", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Busch"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2024/05/19153134/chad-knaus-on-having-justin-allgaier-race-in-kyle-larson-place-at-all-star-race-would-get-pretty-mes.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9620334", "eventUri": "eng-9620334", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 217, "relevance": 1}

That meant Larson had zero chance of making it back to Charlotte in time to start the Coca-Cola 600.\n\nBut it was always his intent to race at Charlotte Motor Speedway and Larson did make it to the track, only for the race to be called for rain before he ever turned a lap in his No. 5 Chevrolet. Justin Allgaier started in Larson's place and was credited with a 13th-place finish.\n\n\"This was without a doubt unchartered waters; in the past, those waivers had been given mostly for medical reasons or for drivers suspended from our event, and those waivers were granted fairly quickly,\" said Elton Sawyer, NASCAR senior vice president of competition. \"This one was unprecedented in that we had a driver miss one of our races, one of our Cup championship events, to be at another event. That's why it took as long as it did. The time we took, which was a week, was exactly the right time we needed to make the decision.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

Although he was listed as second in the overall standings, all his playoff points had been wiped away.\n\nThe playoff points were restored in Tuesday's standings.\n\n\"To not have Kyle Larson in our playoff and give our fans the opportunity, the chance to him race for a championship, at the end of the day, that didn't feel that was the right decision for us to make,\" Sawyer said.\n\nLarson, who finished 18th at Indianapolis in large part because of a late speeding penalty, had worked out a minute-by-minute plan with Hendrick Motorsports to ensure he'd make the start of the Coke 600. But when rain disrupted the Indy 500, Rick Hendrick decided to keep Larson in Indianapolis.\n\nAll of Hendrick Motorsports was in constant contact with NASCAR and under the impression there was no issue so long as Larson made it back to compete in the 600.\n\nSawyer said no one from Hendrick was ever guaranteed a waiver if Larson did not make the NASCAR race.\n\n\"Under normal circumstances, completing 'The Double' is one of the toughest tests in sports. Despite our best efforts, this year's combination of weather conditions in Indianapolis and Charlotte made it impossible,\" Hendrick said. \"Although losing ground in the standings was hard to swallow, we were especially disappointed for the fans at the Coca-Cola 600 who were not able to see Kyle race.\n\n\"I'm extremely proud of everything he did to prepare and the months of planning by our team and our partners at Arrow McLaren to run these two crown jewel events. We hoped race day would play out differently, but the program was still incredibly positive for everyone involved. Kyle's performance throughout May was a great reflection on the level of talent competing each week in the NASCAR Cup Series. We appreciate NASCAR communicating with us throughout the effort and granting our request for a playoff waiver.\"\n\nLarson was the fifth driver in history to attempt to run the Indianapolis 500 and Coca-Cola 600 in the same day. Only Tony Stewart in 2001 completed all 1,100 miles.\n\nThere is concern now that NASCAR's tough stance will deter drivers from trying the feat in the future. Larson had a two-year deal with Arrow McLaren and Hendrick to run Indy again in 2025, but it is not clear if NASCAR's lengthy deliberations will upend those plans.\n\nWhat is a waiver\n\nWaivers in NASCAR until now have been handed out like candy.\n\nWhen NASCAR launched the playoff system in which a regular-season victory locked a driver into the playoffs, it wanted to ensure the driver wouldn't start skipping races because their slot in the championship playoffs was guaranteed.\n\nSo NASCAR said the drivers still needed to participate in all the events. But if they got injured? Well, then a waiver was available to excuse the absence from the Cup Series event.\n\nSince then, the issue has become murky at best. NASCAR has granted waivers for physical injuries and illness but also for mental health and a suspension for accusations of domestic violence. Matt Kenseth, who had not driven in the Cup Series since 2018 when Chip Ganassi hired him during Larson's suspension in 2020 for using a racial slur, even got a waiver.\n\nAge waivers have been given in the Truck Series for drivers who missed the start of the season because they weren't old enough to compete full time. Chase Elliott, Larson's teammate at Hendrick Motorsports, last year was given two waivers: one for missing races while injured, the second for missing a race while he was under NASCAR suspension for intentionally wrecking Denny Hamlin.\n\nThe rulebook states that \"Unless otherwise authorized by NASCAR, driver(s) and Team Owner(s) must start all Championship Events of the current season to be eligible for The Playoffs. If a starting position was not earned, then the driver(s) and Team Owner(s) must have attempted to Qualify, at the discretion of the Series Managing Director, for the Race.\"\n\nSawyer conceded that although the rain in Indianapolis meant Larson was not at Charlotte in time for the start of the race, Larson made every attempt to race the 600.\n\n\"Our decision-making was, although we had the inclement weather in Indy as well as Charlotte, Kyle made every attempt to get to Charlotte,\" Sawyer said. \"He was standing in the pit box with his helmet on, ready to go, and unfortunately we had weather in Charlotte, as well, and we weren't fortunate enough to get the race going again.\"\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up!

Here's what it means", "body": "NASCAR granted Kyle Larson a waiver to remain playoff eligible, ending an eight-day saga about whether the former series points leader would have a chance to go after a second NASCAR Cup Series title.\n\nLarson required a waiver because he did not start the Coca-Cola 600 on May 26 after he stayed in Indianapolis to compete in the rain-delayed Indianapolis 500. He eventually did arrive in Charlotte, but rains fell as he arrived and the Charlotte race was deemed official after 249 of the scheduled 400 laps, so Larson never got in the car.\n\nNASCAR's rules state: \"Unless otherwise authorized by NASCAR, driver(s) and Team Owner(s) must start all Championship Events of the current season to be eligible for The Playoffs. If a starting position was not earned, then the driver(s) and Team Owner(s) must have attempted to Qualify, at the discretion of the Series Managing Director, for the Race.\"\n\nNASCAR Senior Vice President of Competition Elton Sawyer said Larson's efforts to get to Charlotte were enough, as the rule exists so fans don't buy tickets and their favorite driver doesn't compete.\n\n\"We're looking out, first and foremost, for the fans that buy the ticket and were here in Charlotte,\" Sawyer said. \"We felt like Kyle and the team gave every effort to be able to get here. He was ready to go, had his helmet on and unfortunately, we were not able to get going.\"\n\nNASCAR typically grants waivers for injuries -- whether or not suffered during NASCAR competition -- and in cases where it suspends drivers (except for substance-abuse policy violations).\n\nThe argument not to grant the waiver is simple: He failed to start the race, a race he could have chosen to compete in and instead competed somewhere else.\n\nBut if NASCAR had denied the waiver, it would have had to answer many questions, including:\n\n--How it could grant waivers in so many other circumstances -- Matt Kenseth got a waiver in 2020 when he replaced Larson after Larson was indefinitely suspended for using a racial slur four races into the season -- and not grant this one in a situation where a driver had brought so much attention to NASCAR in trying to do two of the biggest races annually in the United States on the same day (hoping to be the fifth driver to do it).\n\n\"In the past, those waivers had been given mostly for medical reasons or situations where drivers were suspended from our event,\" Sawyer said. \"And those waivers were granted fairly quickly. This one was unprecedented in the fact that we had a driver miss one of our races, one of our Cup races, a championship event to be at another event. So that's why it took as long as it did.\"\n\n--How come this wasn't clear to Hendrick Motorsports? Hendrick obviously felt it would get the waiver and weather is a concern on any race weekend.\n\n\"There wasn't a waiver needed prior to 6:22 p.m. green flag Sunday night in Charlotte,\" Sawyer said. \"So a lot of that is hypotheticals, what if this, what if that -- we had gone through some of them, but you let the process take its course.\n\n\"A lot of things could have happened in between -- weather just happened to be the one that was in front of us in this particular situation. So at no point would we grant any waivers prior to -- that would not have been the process.\"\n\n--How would this impact drivers trying the double in the future? Would drivers still try it if they had to worry about being able to get back to Charlotte in case of rain, travel issues, et cetera?\n\n--What would the impact be of one of its most popular drivers, Larson, not being in the playoffs based on a decision by NASCAR?\n\n\"To not have Kyle Larson in our playoff and give our fans the opportunity to see him race for a championship and compete against some of the best drivers in the world, at the end of the day, didn't feel like that's the right decision for us to make,\" Sawyer said.\n\n--How would it handle what could be a PR nightmare with at least some of the biggest names in NASCAR having come out in support of a waiver even though they would have a better chance of winning the title or making the playoffs if Larson was not eligible?\n\n--What would Larson do going forward? Would he not enter additional races?\n\nNASCAR now won't have to answer those questions in the light of denial. Larson did lose the opportunity to earn eight playoff points (points that can help a driver advance through the playoffs) as well as additional playoff points based on his regular-season points finish. He fell from first to third in the standings after that race.\n\nHendrick Motorsports owner Rick Hendrick, who sponsored both the Larson cars for the Cup and IndyCar races, said he appreciated getting the waiver.\n\n\"Although losing ground in the standings was hard to swallow, we were especially disappointed for the fans at the Coca-Cola 600 who were not able to see Kyle race,\" Hendrick said. \"I'm extremely proud of everything he did to prepare and the months of planning by our team and our partners at Arrow McLaren to run these two crown jewel events.\n\n\"We hoped race day would play out differently, but the program was still incredibly positive for everyone involved. Kyle's performance throughout May was a great reflection on the level of talent competing each week in the NASCAR Cup Series. We appreciate NASCAR communicating with us throughout the effort and granting our request for a playoff waiver.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elton_Sawyer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elton Sawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Larson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Larson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_Cup_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR Cup Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola_600", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coca-Cola 600"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_500", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis 500"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Kenseth", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matt Kenseth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrick_Motorsports", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hendrick Motorsports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Hendrick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rick Hendrick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arrow McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INDYCAR", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "INDYCAR"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Drivers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Drivers", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Device_Drivers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Device Drivers", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://a57.foxsports.com/statics.foxsports.com/www.foxsports.com/content/uploads/2024/06/1408/814/kl6.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9620334", "eventUri": "eng-9620334", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-26", "textStart": 273, "textEnd": 279}], "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

That meant Larson had zero chance of making it back to Charlotte in time to start the Coca-Cola 600.\n\nBut it was always his intent to race at Charlotte Motor Speedway and Larson did make it to the track, only for the race to be called for rain before he ever turned a lap in his No. 5 Chevrolet. Justin Allgaier started in Larson's place and was credited with a 13th-place finish.\n\n\"This was without a doubt unchartered waters; in the past, those waivers had been given mostly for medical reasons or for drivers suspended from our event, and those waivers were granted fairly quickly,\" said Elton Sawyer, NASCAR senior vice president of competition. \"This one was unprecedented in that we had a driver miss one of our races, one of our Cup championship events, to be at another event.

Although he was listed as second in the overall standings, all his playoff points had been wiped away.\n\nThe playoff points were restored in Tuesday's standings.\n\n\"To not have Kyle Larson in our playoff and give our fans the opportunity, the chance to him race for a championship, at the end of the day, that didn't feel that was the right decision for us to make,\" Sawyer said.\n\nLarson, who finished 18th at Indianapolis in large part because of a late speeding penalty, had worked out a minute-by-minute plan with Hendrick Motorsports to ensure he'd make the start of the Coke 600. But when rain disrupted the Indy 500, Rick Hendrick decided to keep Larson in Indianapolis.\n\nAll of Hendrick Motorsports was in constant contact with NASCAR and under the impression there was no issue so long as Larson made it back to compete in the 600.\n\nSawyer said no one from Hendrick was ever guaranteed a waiver if Larson did not make the NASCAR race.\n\n\"Under normal circumstances, completing 'The Double' is one of the toughest tests in sports. Despite our best efforts, this year's combination of weather conditions in Indianapolis and Charlotte made it impossible,\" Hendrick said. \"Although losing ground in the standings was hard to swallow, we were especially disappointed for the fans at the Coca-Cola 600 who were not able to see Kyle race.\n\n\"I'm extremely proud of everything he did to prepare and the months of planning by our team and our partners at Arrow McLaren to run these two crown jewel events. We hoped race day would play out differently, but the program was still incredibly positive for everyone involved. Kyle's performance throughout May was a great reflection on the level of talent competing each week in the NASCAR Cup Series. We appreciate NASCAR communicating with us throughout the effort and granting our request for a playoff waiver.\"\n\nLarson was the fifth driver in history to attempt to run the Indianapolis 500 and Coca-Cola 600 in the same day. Only Tony Stewart in 2001 completed all 1,100 miles.\n\nThere is concern now that NASCAR's tough stance will deter drivers from trying the feat in the future. Larson had a two-year deal with Arrow McLaren and Hendrick to run Indy again in 2025, but it is not clear if NASCAR's lengthy deliberations will upend those plans.\n\nWhat is a waiver\n\nWaivers in NASCAR until now have been handed out like candy.\n\nWhen NASCAR launched the playoff system in which a regular-season victory locked a driver into the playoffs, it wanted to ensure the driver wouldn't start skipping races because their slot in the championship playoffs was guaranteed.\n\nSo NASCAR said the drivers still needed to participate in all the events. But if they got injured? Well, then a waiver was available to excuse the absence from the Cup Series event.\n\nSince then, the issue has become murky at best. NASCAR has granted waivers for physical injuries and illness but also for mental health and a suspension for accusations of domestic violence. Matt Kenseth, who had not driven in the Cup Series since 2018 when Chip Ganassi hired him during Larson's suspension in 2020 for using a racial slur, even got a waiver.\n\nAge waivers have been given in the Truck Series for drivers who missed the start of the season because they weren't old enough to compete full time. Chase Elliott, Larson's teammate at Hendrick Motorsports, last year was given two waivers: one for missing races while injured, the second for missing a race while he was under NASCAR suspension for intentionally wrecking Denny Hamlin.\n\nThe rulebook states that \"Unless otherwise authorized by NASCAR, driver(s) and Team Owner(s) must start all Championship Events of the current season to be eligible for The Playoffs. If a starting position was not earned, then the driver(s) and Team Owner(s) must have attempted to Qualify, at the discretion of the Series Managing Director, for the Race.\"\n\nSawyer conceded that although the rain in Indianapolis meant Larson was not at Charlotte in time for the start of the race, Larson made every attempt to race the 600.\n\n\"Our decision-making was, although we had the inclement weather in Indy as well as Charlotte, Kyle made every attempt to get to Charlotte,\" Sawyer said. \"He was standing in the pit box with his helmet on, ready to go, and unfortunately we had weather in Charlotte, as well, and we weren't fortunate enough to get the race going again.\"\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news

That meant Larson had zero chance of making it back to Charlotte in time to start the Coca-Cola 600.\n\nBut it was always his intent to race at Charlotte Motor Speedway and Larson did make it to the track, only for the race to be called for rain before he ever turned a lap in his No. 5 Chevrolet. Justin Allgaier started in Larson's place and was credited with a 13th-place finish.\n\n\"This was without a doubt unchartered waters; in the past, those waivers had been given mostly for medical reasons or for drivers suspended from our event, and those waivers were granted fairly quickly,\" said Elton Sawyer, NASCAR senior vice president of competition. \"This one was unprecedented in that we had a driver miss one of our races, one of our Cup championship events, to be at another event. That's why it took as long as it did. The time we took, which was a week, was exactly the right time we needed to make the decision.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

Although he was listed as second in the overall standings, all his playoff points had been wiped away.\n\nThe playoff points were restored in Tuesday's standings.\n\n\"To not have Kyle Larson in our playoff and give our fans the opportunity, the chance to him race for a championship, at the end of the day, that didn't feel that was the right decision for us to make,\" Sawyer said.\n\nLarson, who finished 18th at Indianapolis in large part because of a late speeding penalty, had worked out a minute-by-minute plan with Hendrick Motorsports to ensure he'd make the start of the Coke 600. But when rain disrupted the Indy 500, Rick Hendrick decided to keep Larson in Indianapolis.\n\nAll of Hendrick Motorsports was in constant contact with NASCAR and under the impression there was no issue so long as Larson made it back to compete in the 600.\n\nSawyer said no one from Hendrick was ever guaranteed a waiver if Larson did not make the NASCAR race.\n\n\"Under normal circumstances, completing 'The Double' is one of the toughest tests in sports. Despite our best efforts, this year's combination of weather conditions in Indianapolis and Charlotte made it impossible,\" Hendrick said. \"Although losing ground in the standings was hard to swallow, we were especially disappointed for the fans at the Coca-Cola 600 who were not able to see Kyle race.\n\n\"I'm extremely proud of everything he did to prepare and the months of planning by our team and our partners at Arrow McLaren to run these two crown jewel events. We hoped race day would play out differently, but the program was still incredibly positive for everyone involved. Kyle's performance throughout May was a great reflection on the level of talent competing each week in the NASCAR Cup Series. We appreciate NASCAR communicating with us throughout the effort and granting our request for a playoff waiver.\"\n\nLarson was the fifth driver in history to attempt to run the Indianapolis 500 and Coca-Cola 600 in the same day. Only Tony Stewart in 2001 completed all 1,100 miles.\n\nThere is concern now that NASCAR's tough stance will deter drivers from trying the feat in the future. Larson had a two-year deal with Arrow McLaren and Hendrick to run Indy again in 2025, but it is not clear if NASCAR's lengthy deliberations will upend those plans.\n\nWhat is a waiver\n\nWaivers in NASCAR until now have been handed out like candy.\n\nWhen NASCAR launched the playoff system in which a regular-season victory locked a driver into the playoffs, it wanted to ensure the driver wouldn't start skipping races because their slot in the championship playoffs was guaranteed.\n\nSo NASCAR said the drivers still needed to participate in all the events. But if they got injured? Well, then a waiver was available to excuse the absence from the Cup Series event.\n\nSince then, the issue has become murky at best. NASCAR has granted waivers for physical injuries and illness but also for mental health and a suspension for accusations of domestic violence. Matt Kenseth, who had not driven in the Cup Series since 2018 when Chip Ganassi hired him during Larson's suspension in 2020 for using a racial slur, even got a waiver.\n\nAge waivers have been given in the Truck Series for drivers who missed the start of the season because they weren't old enough to compete full time. Chase Elliott, Larson's teammate at Hendrick Motorsports, last year was given two waivers: one for missing races while injured, the second for missing a race while he was under NASCAR suspension for intentionally wrecking Denny Hamlin.\n\nThe rulebook states that \"Unless otherwise authorized by NASCAR, driver(s) and Team Owner(s) must start all Championship Events of the current season to be eligible for The Playoffs. If a starting position was not earned, then the driver(s) and Team Owner(s) must have attempted to Qualify, at the discretion of the Series Managing Director, for the Race.\"\n\nSawyer conceded that although the rain in Indianapolis meant Larson was not at Charlotte in time for the start of the race, Larson made every attempt to race the 600.\n\n\"Our decision-making was, although we had the inclement weather in Indy as well as Charlotte, Kyle made every attempt to get to Charlotte,\" Sawyer said. \"He was standing in the pit box with his helmet on, ready to go, and unfortunately we had weather in Charlotte, as well, and we weren't fortunate enough to get the race going again.\"\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news

Rain delayed the start of the 108th Running of the Indy 500 by four hours, forcing Larson to prioritize racing in Indianapolis or the Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte Motor Speedway. Larson chose the 500 and didn't get a chance to run in the 600 due to NASCAR calling the race due to rain after he arrived from Indianapolis.\n\nPer NASCAR's guidelines, \"Unless otherwise authorized by NASCAR, driver(s) and Team Owner(s) must start all Championship Events of the current season to be eligible for The Playoffs.\" While that is the official rule, Denny Hamlin finds it \"ridiculous\" that the sanctioning body hasn't granted Larson a playoff waiver as they have in previous instances, he said on his \"Actions Detrimental\" podcast.\n\n\"Nobody wants this pandora's box opened for sure,\" Hamlin said. \"I agree with Jordan Bianchi [from The Athletic] that it's seriously being looked at to not give him the waiver. There is a legitimate reason [to not give Larson the waiver] because by the rule, you have to start all the races. ... [If] they tell you you're not going to race because you're suspended or you're physically hurt and not able to. Both of those instances that they've given waivers to is because someone has not been able to do it. Either because they were told not to, or they're physically not able to.\n\n\"He had a choice. That's by the letter of the law, that's what they're saying is he had a choice. ... It's ridiculous. I said this weekend in the media center that I thought the five team made good faith efforts to try to get him to Charlotte to run the double. Unfortunately, Mother Nature had its other plans and so, who knows. Who knows how this is gonna turn out. I think the longer it goes, the worse the news is going to be.\"\n\nPer the latest report from Jeff Gluck of The Athletic, NASCAR is giving \"serious consideration\" to not giving Larson a waiver. Larson addressed the waiver situation ahead of Sunday's Enjoy Illinois 300 at World Wide Technology Raceway.\n\n\"The waiver thing doesn't make any sense as it stands right now. ... I'm sure it's confusing,\" Larson said. \"I think NASCAR's probably trying to figure out what to do.

Evidently, the sport's governing body didn't find enough of a reason to keep arguably their most talented wheelman from participating in the playoffs.\n\nCheck out the official announcement below, as Kyle Larson fans can now rejoice at the fact that their driver won't be denied a chance to race for the championship.\n\n\"NEWS: @KyleLarsonRacin has been granted a waiver and maintains his eligibility for the #NASCARPlayoffs,\" NASCAR's official account posted on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nMoreover, it's the second waiver of the season that NASCAR has granted, as Erik Jones received one following his back injury stemming from a wreck at Talladega. Now, Larson will finally be granted one, although his reason for missing the race at Charlotte did not stem from an injury, as we all know.\n\nSome believed Larson may not receive the waiver, as the Hendrick Motorsports star chose to race in the Indianapolis 500 instead of the Coca-Cola 600. While he made it to Charlotte with enough time to finish the race for the No. 5 team, Mother Nature had other plans, and Larson didn't get to run any of the race like he had originally planned.\n\nAdditionally, Hendrick Motorsports is no stranger to the playoff waiver situation, as Chase Elliott received one for his off-track injury that forced him to miss multiple races last season. However, it didn't end up making a difference, as Elliott missed the playoffs anyways.\n\nLarson on the other hand, he has a win already in 2024, which locks in him into the playoffs for this season. He'll still have a shot at the championship after being granted the waiver, and he'll look to lift the trophy at the end of the season after not running the full schedule, like Kyle Busch did in 2015 when he broke his leg earlier in the season.\n\nRegardless, Kyle Larson is one of NASCAR's biggest stars, if not the biggest. The playoffs wouldn't be complete without him, and now we won't have to worry about that possibility, as Larson has been granted the waiver by NASCAR.\n\nAt the least, Kyle Larson earned the respect of his peers for attempting the double, and he can always try again in 2025. Of course, it's a ton of work and preparation, but the way things worked out in 2024, he may be motivated to give it another shot.\n\nRegardless, nobody was more disappointed than Larson himself, who penned a heartfelt letter to his fans on social media earlier on Monday morning.\n\n\"What I thought could be one of the best days of my life quickly turned into one of the most disappointing ones I've ever experienced. I hate it for Rick Hendrick, Jeff Gordon, HAG, Hendrick Motorsports, everyone a part of the 5 team, everyone on the 17 IndyCar for speeding, my family, my friends, my fans, and the documentary crew that has followed along the journey the past 8 months. So much time, money, and effort went into this experience and it just kills me to have it all end the way it did. I feel like I let so many people down. We knew all along weather could throw a wrench into things but seeing it come to reality is a horrible feeling,\" Larson wrote. \"Up until Sunday it was truly one of the greatest experiences of my life.

That meant Larson had zero chance of making it back to Charlotte in time to start the Coca-Cola 600.\n\nBut it was always his intent to race at Charlotte Motor Speedway and Larson did make it to the track, only for the race to be called for rain before he ever turned a lap in his No. 5 Chevrolet. Justin Allgaier started in Larson's place and was credited with a 13th-place finish.\n\n\"This was without a doubt unchartered waters; in the past, those waivers had been given mostly for medical reasons or for drivers suspended from our event, and those waivers were granted fairly quickly,\" said Elton Sawyer, NASCAR senior vice president of competition. \"This one was unprecedented in that we had a driver miss one of our races, one of our Cup championship events, to be at another event. That's why it took as long as it did. The time we took, which was a week, was exactly the right time we needed to make the decision.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

Although he was listed as second in the overall standings, all his playoff points had been wiped away.\n\nThe playoff points were restored in Tuesday's standings.\n\n\"To not have Kyle Larson in our playoff and give our fans the opportunity, the chance to him race for a championship, at the end of the day, that didn't feel that was the right decision for us to make,\" Sawyer said.\n\nLarson, who finished 18th at Indianapolis in large part because of a late speeding penalty, had worked out a minute-by-minute plan with Hendrick Motorsports to ensure he'd make the start of the Coke 600. But when rain disrupted the Indy 500, Rick Hendrick decided to keep Larson in Indianapolis.\n\nAll of Hendrick Motorsports was in constant contact with NASCAR and under the impression there was no issue so long as Larson made it back to compete in the 600.\n\nSawyer said no one from Hendrick was ever guaranteed a waiver if Larson did not make the NASCAR race.\n\n\"Under normal circumstances, completing 'The Double' is one of the toughest tests in sports. Despite our best efforts, this year's combination of weather conditions in Indianapolis and Charlotte made it impossible,\" Hendrick said. \"Although losing ground in the standings was hard to swallow, we were especially disappointed for the fans at the Coca-Cola 600 who were not able to see Kyle race.\n\n\"I'm extremely proud of everything he did to prepare and the months of planning by our team and our partners at Arrow McLaren to run these two crown jewel events. We hoped race day would play out differently, but the program was still incredibly positive for everyone involved. Kyle's performance throughout May was a great reflection on the level of talent competing each week in the NASCAR Cup Series. We appreciate NASCAR communicating with us throughout the effort and granting our request for a playoff waiver.\"\n\nLarson was the fifth driver in history to attempt to run the Indianapolis 500 and Coca-Cola 600 in the same day. Only Tony Stewart in 2001 completed all 1,100 miles.\n\nThere is concern now that NASCAR's tough stance will deter drivers from trying the feat in the future. Larson had a two-year deal with Arrow McLaren and Hendrick to run Indy again in 2025, but it is not clear if NASCAR's lengthy deliberations will upend those plans.\n\nWhat is a waiver\n\nWaivers in NASCAR until now have been handed out like candy.\n\nWhen NASCAR launched the playoff system in which a regular-season victory locked a driver into the playoffs, it wanted to ensure the driver wouldn't start skipping races because their slot in the championship playoffs was guaranteed.\n\nSo NASCAR said the drivers still needed to participate in all the events. But if they got injured? Well, then a waiver was available to excuse the absence from the Cup Series event.\n\nSince then, the issue has become murky at best. NASCAR has granted waivers for physical injuries and illness but also for mental health and a suspension for accusations of domestic violence. Matt Kenseth, who had not driven in the Cup Series since 2018 when Chip Ganassi hired him during Larson's suspension in 2020 for using a racial slur, even got a waiver.\n\nAge waivers have been given in the Truck Series for drivers who missed the start of the season because they weren't old enough to compete full time. Chase Elliott, Larson's teammate at Hendrick Motorsports, last year was given two waivers: one for missing races while injured, the second for missing a race while he was under NASCAR suspension for intentionally wrecking Denny Hamlin.\n\nThe rulebook states that \"Unless otherwise authorized by NASCAR, driver(s) and Team Owner(s) must start all Championship Events of the current season to be eligible for The Playoffs. If a starting position was not earned, then the driver(s) and Team Owner(s) must have attempted to Qualify, at the discretion of the Series Managing Director, for the Race.\"\n\nSawyer conceded that although the rain in Indianapolis meant Larson was not at Charlotte in time for the start of the race, Larson made every attempt to race the 600.\n\n\"Our decision-making was, although we had the inclement weather in Indy as well as Charlotte, Kyle made every attempt to get to Charlotte,\" Sawyer said. \"He was standing in the pit box with his helmet on, ready to go, and unfortunately we had weather in Charlotte, as well, and we weren't fortunate enough to get the race going again.\"\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet

Now, Larson will finally be granted one, although his reason for missing the race at Charlotte did not stem from an injury, as we all know.\n\nSome believed Larson may not receive the waiver, as the Hendrick Motorsports star chose to race in the Indianapolis 500 instead of the Coca-Cola 600. While he made it to Charlotte with enough time to finish the race for the No. 5 team, Mother Nature had other plans, and Larson didn't get to run any of the race like he had originally planned.\n\nMoreover, Hendrick Motorsports is no stranger to the playoff waiver situation, as Chase Elliott received one for his off-track injury that forced him to miss multiple races last season. However, it didn't end up making a difference, as Elliott missed the playoffs anyways.\n\nLarson on the other hand, he has a win already in 2024, which locks in him into the playoffs for this season. He'll still have a shot at the championship after being granted the waiver, and he'll look to lift the trophy at the end of the season after not running the full schedule, like Kyle Busch did in 2015 when he broke his leg earlier in the season.\n\nRegardless, Kyle Larson is one of NASCAR's biggest stars, if not the biggest. The playoffs wouldn't be complete without him, and now we won't have to worry about that possibility, as Larson will be granted the waiver by NASCAR.\n\nAt the least, Kyle Larson earned the respect of his peers for attempting the double, and he can always try again in 2025. Of course, it's a ton of work and preparation, but the way things worked out in 2024, he may be motivated to give it another shot.\n\nRegardless, nobody was more disappointed than Larson himself, who penned a heartfelt letter to his fans on social media earlier on Monday morning.\n\n\"What I thought could be one of the best days of my life quickly turned into one of the most disappointing ones I've ever experienced. I hate it for Rick Hendrick, Jeff Gordon, HAG, Hendrick Motorsports, everyone a part of the 5 team, everyone on the 17 IndyCar for speeding, my family, my friends, my fans, and the documentary crew that has followed along the journey the past 8 months. So much time, money, and effort went into this experience and it just kills me to have it all end the way it did. I feel like I let so many people down. We knew all along weather could throw a wrench into things but seeing it come to reality is a horrible feeling,\" Larson wrote. \"Up until Sunday it was truly one of the greatest experiences of my life. I can't describe how appreciative I am of everyone's support of me to live out a dream. I hope it's not the last opportunity I have to try the Double but if it is I guess it was memorable.\n\n\"Thank you to everyone at Arrow McLaren, Indianapolis Motor Speedway, and all the competitors there for making me feel welcomed. Ready to get back on track now and get refocused on winning a 2nd championship for our team.\"\n\nMother Nature had other plans for Kyle Larson, but he's still proven he's one of motorsport's greatest talents, and the sky will continue to be the limit for him moving forward.", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "steve_samra@on3.com", "name": "Steve Samra", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Larson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Larson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola_600", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coca-Cola 600"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_500", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis 500"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrick_Motorsports", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hendrick Motorsports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Jones", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Erik Jones"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talladega_Superspeedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Talladega Superspeedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chase_Elliott", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chase Elliott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Gordon", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Gordon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Memorial Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Busch", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Busch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INDYCAR", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "INDYCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Motor_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis Motor Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Hendrick", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rick Hendrick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Automotive/Auto Racing", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle Racing", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2024/05/24132701/kyle-larson-backup-driver-for-coca-cola-600-revealed.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9620334", "eventUri": "eng-9620334", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

It was halted after 249 of the 400 scheduled laps around the four-turn, 1.5-mile (2.414-kilometer) Concord, North Carolina had been run.\n\nThe Coca-Cola 600 ultimately did not get restarted, and Larson did not get to compete in it at all. Justin Allgaier filled in for him and finished in 13th place. Larson finished in 18th in his first ever Indy 500 attempt, driving for Arrow McLaren through a partnership with NASCAR team owner Rick Hendrick.\n\nLarson had already locked up a spot in the 2024 Cup Series playoffs by winning the races at Las Vegas Motor Speedway and Kansas Speedway earlier this year, and he entered the Coca-Cola 600 weekend as the points leader.\n\nBut drivers are required to compete in all 26 regular season races to remain eligible for the playoffs and thus the championship, unless they are granted a playoff waiver.\n\nGiven the fact that the 26-race requirement is designed (a) to prevent drivers from \"resting\" and targeting select races to win and (b) to prevent part-time drivers (i.e. A.J. Allmendinger and Jimmie Johnson) from \"stealing\" a playoff spot with a victory, it was believed that Larson being granted a playoff waiver would be nothing more than a formality.\n\nPlayoff waivers have been granted for a variety of reasons in years past, many times on the same day the requests were made.\n\nThough missing a Cup Series race for a race in another series has never been of those reasons, that was never Larson's intention.\n\nThe fact is that he did show up at Charlotte with more than enough time to spare; it was the weather which ultimately prevented him from having the chance to compete on a day when he promoted motorsport in a way that no driver had done since Kurt Busch in 2014.\n\nThe Indy 500 also isn't just \"another race\", and driving 500 miles before hopping on a plane to Charlotte to drive 600 more is anything but \"load management\". It's not like he sat out one of NASCAR's crown jewel events to run some local go-kart event.\n\nBut more than a week later, that waiver has not yet been granted, a bizarre development considering the fact that another Cup Series race has already been contested at World Wide Technology Raceway at Gateway -- with Larson behind the wheel of the No. 5 Chevrolet.\n\nAs of this moment, Larson is ineligible for the playoffs and the championship, and the only way for that to change is if NASCAR effectively forgives his absence.\n\nEight days later, there is no timetable for that decision.\n\nLarson could very well already be eliminated from postseason contention, or he could still be locked into the playoffs, like everyone believed he was all the way back in March -- and like everyone initially believed he'd be after the events of last Sunday unfolded.\n\nNobody knows.\n\nShould NASCAR not grant Larson a waiver, it would leave one of their top drivers excluded from the championship in a season during which he had already done more than enough to qualify for the playoffs.\n\nSuch a shambolic decision would also effectively create a situation in which the 16th and final driver to lock into this year's playoffs would arguably not be deserving of the spot. Perhaps it would even lead some media outlets to share \"would-be\" playoff pictures including Larson, leading up to and during the four-round, 10-race postseason.", "source": {"uri": "beyondtheflag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Beyond the Flag"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola_600", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Coca-Cola 600"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Motor_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte Motor Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_500", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis 500"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Larson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Larson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrick_Motorsports", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hendrick Motorsports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INDYCAR", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "INDYCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Allgaier", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Justin Allgaier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Motor_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis Motor Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Memorial Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concord,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Concord, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Concord, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedway,_Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speedway, Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Speedway, Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_Cup_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR Cup Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kansas Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmie_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jimmie Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Motor_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas Motor Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._J._Allmendinger", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A.

Larson chose the 500 and didn't get a chance to run in the 600 due to NASCAR calling the race with 151 laps remaining due to rain after he arrived from Indianapolis.\n\nLarson lost his lead in the points standings after missing the Coca-Cola 600, as well as a potential eight playoff points. He now sits second only behind Denny Hamlin after tallying a P10 finish in Sunday's Enjoy Illinois 300 at World Wide Technology Raceway.\n\nSpeaking with the media after making the announcement, NASCAR senior vice president of competition Elton Sawyer explained that Larson doing everything in his power to race at Charlotte played a role in the decision to give him a waiver.\n\n\"Kyle made every attempt to get to Charlotte,\" Sawyer said, via Jeff Gluck of The Athletic. \"He was standing in the pit box with his helmet on, ready to go.\"\n\nAs for why it took nine days for NASCAR to come to a decision on Larson's waiver, Sawyer cited how this particular scenario dipped into \"uncharted waters.\"\n\n\"This was without a doubt uncharted waters for us,\" Sawyer said. \"... This one was unprecedented in that we had a driver miss one of our races, a championship event, to be at another event. That's why it took as long as it did. There were different views from different people. Everyone had a view on it. The ultimate decision we wanted to get to was the right decision, and we feel like we got there.\"", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nick_geddes@on3.com", "name": "Nick Geddes", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Larson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Larson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Pockrass", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bob Pockrass"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola_600", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coca-Cola 600"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_500", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis 500"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enjoy_Illinois_300", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Enjoy Illinois 300"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_Motorsports_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gateway Motorsports Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elton_Sawyer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Elton Sawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denny_Hamlin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denny Hamlin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Motor_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte Motor Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2024/06/04122213/kyle-larson-gets-his-playoff-points-back-after-nascar-approves-playoff-waiver.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9620334", "eventUri": "eng-9620334", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

Could NASCAR potentially lose one of its biggest stars over this controversy?\n\nHad Mother Nature not reared her ugly head on Memorial Day Weekend, this would be a non-issue. However, Larson had to make a choice. Larson and his team decided to stay in Indianapolis and race the Indy 500.\n\nDrivers have missed races and received waivers for actions on track, injury, and other reasons. So, why not give Kyle Larson a waiver now? While NASCAR decides what they plan on doing, the rest of us are left to speculate.\n\nJordan Bianchi and Jeff Gluck of The Athletic talked about potential reactions from Larson should NASCAR deny him a waiver on The Teardown.\n\nThis is purely speculation, but an interesting thought exercise at least.\n\n\"I don't know. I mean, you know, when Kyle Larson was out of racing in 2020 there were questions about, could he make a living running dirt racing, and everything, okay,\" Bianchi said. \"So, at the end of the day is, this is the number one form of racing in North America, or you know, at least in the United States. ... If you're so angry and upset you're like 'I'm done, I'm done with NASCAR. I'm gonna go run IndyCar, I'm gonna go run whatever.' Okay, I get that but I imagine you're probably leaving a lot of money on the table. A lot of money.\"\n\nIf Kyle Larson decided to move on from NASCAR and ran sprint cars and IndyCar full-time, what would happen to his legacy? He has a Cup Series championship. However, Larson is missing quite a few Crown Jewel races from his record.\n\nJordan Bianchi went into detail as he talked about the Larson ordeal. The most compelling argument he made - Larson has more to prove. If he wants to be among the greatest of all time, he has to do more in his primary series.\n\nMario Andretti and AJ Foyt were winners in everything they drove, but they had their main series, for the most part. Larson backing out of NASCAR now could do more harm than good for his legacy.\n\n\"Also, you need to run over here, if you want to be this great all-around, on the same ledger as Andretti and Foyt, you've got some work to do over here, you've got some big races to win still, and maybe you can still do that and run and everything like that and that's fine and you run part-time,\" Bianchi went on.\"\n\n\"But are you going to walk away from all of that money and the opportunity to continue to build your resume as the best all-around driver of all time or one of them? I don't know it would be hard to see that happen The other question is too Hendrick [Motorsports] has got a contract with him and I don't know what that contract says he can and can't do, maybe Hendrick says go, if you don't want to be here, then sorry. I don't know, if it were me I would have a hard time walking away from that.\"\n\nFor what it is worth, Kyle Larson says he plans to race out the season as if everything was normal. Even if the waiver is denied, Larson can win the Owners Championship and score a huge payday for his team.", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jonathan_howard@on3.com", "name": "Jonathan Howard", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Larson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Larson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INDYCAR", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "INDYCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_Grand_Prix", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jordan Grand Prix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_500", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis 500"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Memorial Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_Cup_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR Cup Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._J._Foyt", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A.

He was attempting to complete the Memorial Day Double, first by competing in IndyCar's Indy 500 at Indianapolis Motor Speedway and then by competing in the Coca-Cola 600.\n\nBut rain caused the Indy 500 to be delayed by four hours, and with Larson opting to stay to compete, he missed the start of the Coca-Cola 600. Justin Allgaier was called upon to fill in for him behind the wheel of the No. 5 Chevrolet.\n\nWhen Larson arrived at Charlotte, 249 of the scheduled 400 laps had been run around the four-turn, 1.5-mile (2.414-kilometer) Concord, North Carolina, but the rain had started to fall.\n\nNASCAR later made the decision to call the race, meaning that instead of becoming the fifth individual to attempt the Memorial Day Double, Larson became just the first driver since 1995 to see his Memorial Day Double attempt end with an appearance in only one of the two crown jewel races.\n\nAs a result, Kurt Busch's Memorial Day Double attempt in 2014 remains the most recent, though it is believed that Larson will try again in 2025.\n\nLarson had already presumably locked up his Cup Series playoff spot by winning the races at Las Vegas Motor Speedway and Kansas Speedway earlier in the year.\n\nHowever, unless a waiver is granted following an unexpected absence, drivers must compete in all 26 races on the regular season schedule to remain eligible for the playoffs.\n\nGiven the wide range of reasons for NASCAR granting playoff waivers in the past, it was believed that Larson receiving one was a foregone conclusion. However, as more and more time passed with no decision having been made, it seemed that there was a very real possibility of him not being granted one.\n\nNASCAR even removed his playoff point total from the playoff standings. Larson had already earned 17 playoff points this season, 10 thanks to his two race victories and seven thanks to his series-leading seven stage victories. NASCAR credited him with zero, meaning that he was, at that point, ineligible for the playoffs and thus the championship.\n\nBut now the debate is over, and the speculation has ended. Barring anything unforeseen over the course of the regular season's final 11 races, the 2021 champion is locked into the playoffs for the fourth consecutive season, and he has all 17 of his playoff points back.\n\nLarson, who had led the point standings since the race at Martinsville Speedway in early April before missing the Coca-Cola 600, sits in second place now, trailing only Joe Gibbs Racing's Denny Hamlin.\n\nThe Toyota/Save Mart 350 is the next race on the 2024 NASCAR Cup Series schedule.

That meant Larson had zero chance of making it back to Charlotte in time to start the Coca-Cola 600.\n\nBut it was always his intent to race at Charlotte Motor Speedway and Larson did make it to the track, only for the race to be called for rain before he ever turned a lap in his No. 5 Chevrolet. Justin Allgaier started in Larson's place and was credited with a 13th-place finish.\n\n\"This was without a doubt unchartered waters; in the past, those waivers had been given mostly for medical reasons or for drivers suspended from our event, and those waivers were granted fairly quickly,\" said Elton Sawyer, NASCAR senior vice president of competition. \"This one was unprecedented in that we had a driver miss one of our races, one of our Cup championship events, to be at another event. That's why it took as long as it did. The time we took, which was a week, was exactly the right time we needed to make the decision.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

Although he was listed as second in the overall standings, all his playoff points had been wiped away.\n\nThe playoff points were restored in Tuesday's standings.\n\n\"To not have Kyle Larson in our playoff and give our fans the opportunity, the chance to him race for a championship, at the end of the day, that didn't feel that was the right decision for us to make,\" Sawyer said.\n\nLarson, who finished 18th at Indianapolis in large part because of a late speeding penalty, had worked out a minute-by-minute plan with Hendrick Motorsports to ensure he'd make the start of the Coke 600. But when rain disrupted the Indy 500, Rick Hendrick decided to keep Larson in Indianapolis.\n\nAll of Hendrick Motorsports was in constant contact with NASCAR and under the impression there was no issue so long as Larson made it back to compete in the 600.\n\nSawyer said no one from Hendrick was ever guaranteed a waiver if Larson did not make the NASCAR race.\n\n\"Under normal circumstances, completing 'The Double' is one of the toughest tests in sports. Despite our best efforts, this year's combination of weather conditions in Indianapolis and Charlotte made it impossible,\" Hendrick said. \"Although losing ground in the standings was hard to swallow, we were especially disappointed for the fans at the Coca-Cola 600 who were not able to see Kyle race.\n\n\"I'm extremely proud of everything he did to prepare and the months of planning by our team and our partners at Arrow McLaren to run these two crown jewel events. We hoped race day would play out differently, but the program was still incredibly positive for everyone involved. Kyle's performance throughout May was a great reflection on the level of talent competing each week in the NASCAR Cup Series. We appreciate NASCAR communicating with us throughout the effort and granting our request for a playoff waiver.\"\n\nLarson was the fifth driver in history to attempt to run the Indianapolis 500 and Coca-Cola 600 in the same day. Only Tony Stewart in 2001 completed all 1,100 miles.\n\nThere is concern now that NASCAR's tough stance will deter drivers from trying the feat in the future. Larson had a two-year deal with Arrow McLaren and Hendrick to run Indy again in 2025, but it is not clear if NASCAR's lengthy deliberations will upend those plans.\n\nWhat is a waiver\n\nWaivers in NASCAR until now have been handed out like candy.\n\nWhen NASCAR launched the playoff system in which a regular-season victory locked a driver into the playoffs, it wanted to ensure the driver wouldn't start skipping races because their slot in the championship playoffs was guaranteed.\n\nSo NASCAR said the drivers still needed to participate in all the events. But if they got injured? Well, then a waiver was available to excuse the absence from the Cup Series event.\n\nSince then, the issue has become murky at best. NASCAR has granted waivers for physical injuries and illness but also for mental health and a suspension for accusations of domestic violence. Matt Kenseth, who had not driven in the Cup Series since 2018 when Chip Ganassi hired him during Larson's suspension in 2020 for using a racial slur, even got a waiver.\n\nAge waivers have been given in the Truck Series for drivers who missed the start of the season because they weren't old enough to compete full time. Chase Elliott, Larson's teammate at Hendrick Motorsports, last year was given two waivers: one for missing races while injured, the second for missing a race while he was under NASCAR suspension for intentionally wrecking Denny Hamlin.\n\nThe rulebook states that \"Unless otherwise authorized by NASCAR, driver(s) and Team Owner(s) must start all Championship Events of the current season to be eligible for The Playoffs. If a starting position was not earned, then the driver(s) and Team Owner(s) must have attempted to Qualify, at the discretion of the Series Managing Director, for the Race.\"\n\nSawyer conceded that although the rain in Indianapolis meant Larson was not at Charlotte in time for the start of the race, Larson made every attempt to race the 600.\n\n\"Our decision-making was, although we had the inclement weather in Indy as well as Charlotte, Kyle made every attempt to get to Charlotte,\" Sawyer said. \"He was standing in the pit box with his helmet on, ready to go, and unfortunately we had weather in Charlotte, as well, and we weren't fortunate enough to get the race going again.\"\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up!

The start of the race (May 26) was delayed by 4 hours due to inclement weather.

Millions of dollars were spent on the Indianapolis 500 effort alongside Arrow McLaren Racing and Larson still aimed to make it in time to finish the race in Charlotte.\n\nJustin Allgaier started the race for him in Charlotte and would be the driver of record no matter what happened, but the same storm that delayed the start in Indianapolis ended the race in Charlotte early right as Larson arrived.\n\nLarson never turned a lap.\n\nRegardless, Hendrick and Larson filed the waiver request late last week, and it's a process that has been granted for injuries and behavioral suspensions over the years. In fact, the only time NASCAR denied a request was in 2021 when Grant Enfinger missed a single race due to a lack of funding and completed the season but without playoff eligibility.\n\nBut even in that instance, NASCAR continued to show the playoff points Enfinger had accumulated even if he wasn't added to the playoff field that summer.\n\nAs a result, the unprecedented decision NASCAR made this time was that Larson is currently shown as having earned no playoff points on the updated championship standings after the race on Sunday.\n\nOf course, this is still an active process and NASCAR could simply choose to grant the waiver next week or even issue a penalty of some kind. But for now, NASCAR has subtly made clear through the championship standings report that Larson is currently not in the playoffs unless it decides he is in the days ahead.\n\nNASCAR's Elton Sawyer has called the impending decision 'uncharted waters.'\n\n\"It's a bit unchartered waters because in the past, the waivers have mostly been given for a medical reason so this one is a little bit different from that aspect,\" he told SiriusXM NASCAR Radio last week. \"We have had some preliminary discussions but haven't landed on anything yet.\"", "source": {"uri": "sportsnaut.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportsnaut.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_weaver@sportsnaut.com", "name": "Matt Weaver", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Motor_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte Motor Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Larson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Larson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola_600", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coca-Cola 600"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_500", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis 500"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_Cup_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR Cup Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_Motorsports_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gateway Motorsports Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrick_Motorsports", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hendrick Motorsports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Enfinger", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Grant Enfinger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Allgaier", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Justin Allgaier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McLaren", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "McLaren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirius_XM", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sirius XM"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elton_Sawyer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elton Sawyer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle Racing", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 75}], "image": "https://sportsnaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/NASCAR-Cup-Practice-amp-Qualifying-23386381.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9620334", "eventUri": "eng-9620334", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

That meant Larson had zero chance of making it back to Charlotte in time to start the Coca-Cola 600.\n\nBut it was always his intent to race at Charlotte Motor Speedway and Larson did make it to the track, only for the race to be called for rain before he ever turned a lap in his No. 5 Chevrolet. Justin Allgaier started in Larson's place and was credited with a 13th-place finish.\n\n\"This was without a doubt unchartered waters; in the past, those waivers had been given mostly for medical reasons or for drivers suspended from our event, and those waivers were granted fairly quickly,\" said Elton Sawyer, NASCAR senior vice president of competition. \"This one was unprecedented in that we had a driver miss one of our races, one of our Cup championship events, to be at another event.

Although he was listed as second in the overall standings, all his playoff points had been wiped away.\n\nThe playoff points were restored in Tuesday's standings.\n\n\"To not have Kyle Larson in our playoff and give our fans the opportunity, the chance to him race for a championship, at the end of the day, that didn't feel that was the right decision for us to make,\" Sawyer said.\n\nLarson, who finished 18th at Indianapolis in large part because of a late speeding penalty, had worked out a minute-by-minute plan with Hendrick Motorsports to ensure he'd make the start of the Coke 600. But when rain disrupted the Indy 500, Rick Hendrick decided to keep Larson in Indianapolis.\n\nAll of Hendrick Motorsports was in constant contact with NASCAR and under the impression there was no issue so long as Larson made it back to compete in the 600.\n\nSawyer said no one from Hendrick was ever guaranteed a waiver if Larson did not make the NASCAR race.\n\n\"Under normal circumstances, completing 'The Double' is one of the toughest tests in sports. Despite our best efforts, this year's combination of weather conditions in Indianapolis and Charlotte made it impossible,\" Hendrick said. \"Although losing ground in the standings was hard to swallow, we were especially disappointed for the fans at the Coca-Cola 600 who were not able to see Kyle race.\n\n\"I'm extremely proud of everything he did to prepare and the months of planning by our team and our partners at Arrow McLaren to run these two crown jewel events.

Kyle's performance throughout May was a great reflection on the level of talent competing each week in the NASCAR Cup Series. We appreciate NASCAR communicating with us throughout the effort and granting our request for a playoff waiver.\"\n\nLarson was the fifth driver in history to attempt to run the Indianapolis 500 and Coca-Cola 600 in the same day. Only Tony Stewart in 2001 completed all 1,100 miles.\n\nThere is concern now that NASCAR's tough stance will deter drivers from trying the feat in the future. Larson had a two-year deal with Arrow McLaren and Hendrick to run Indy again in 2025, but it is not clear if NASCAR's lengthy deliberations will upend those plans.\n\nWhat is a waiver\n\nWaivers in NASCAR until now have been handed out like candy.\n\nWhen NASCAR launched the playoff system in which a regular-season victory locked a driver into the playoffs, it wanted to ensure the driver wouldn't start skipping races because their slot in the championship playoffs was guaranteed.\n\nSo NASCAR said the drivers still needed to participate in all the events. But if they got injured? Well, then a waiver was available to excuse the absence from the Cup Series event.\n\nSince then, the issue has become murky at best. NASCAR has granted waivers for physical injuries and illness but also for mental health and a suspension for accusations of domestic violence. Matt Kenseth, who had not driven in the Cup Series since 2018 when Chip Ganassi hired him during Larson's suspension in 2020 for using a racial slur, even got a waiver.\n\nAge waivers have been given in the Truck Series for drivers who missed the start of the season because they weren't old enough to compete full time. Chase Elliott, Larson's teammate at Hendrick Motorsports, last year was given two waivers: one for missing races while injured, the second for missing a race while he was under NASCAR suspension for intentionally wrecking Denny Hamlin.\n\nThe rulebook states that \"Unless otherwise authorized by NASCAR, driver(s) and Team Owner(s) must start all Championship Events of the current season to be eligible for The Playoffs. If a starting position was not earned, then the driver(s) and Team Owner(s) must have attempted to Qualify, at the discretion of the Series Managing Director, for the Race.\"\n\nSawyer conceded that although the rain in Indianapolis meant Larson was not at Charlotte in time for the start of the race, Larson made every attempt to race the 600.\n\n\"Our decision-making was, although we had the inclement weather in Indy as well as Charlotte, Kyle made every attempt to get to Charlotte,\" Sawyer said. \"He was standing in the pit box with his helmet on, ready to go, and unfortunately we had weather in Charlotte, as well, and we weren't fortunate enough to get the race going again.\"\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up!

Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports\n\nKyle Larson's playoff waiver request is not heading in the direction that his team hoped for. Following Sunday's race in Gateway Motorsports Park, NASCAR put out its official points report list with the 17 playoff points that he has secured thus far nulled out. While the sanctioning body said last week that a decision has not yet been made regarding the waiver, this could be a sign of a negative outcome.\n\nHendrick Motorsports formally submitted its request for the waiver last Thursday and the promotion refused to fix a timeline on when its decision can be expected. Larson, however, isn't too worried about how things end up. Even if he doesn't get to race for the driver's championship, he will still have a huge part to play in the owner's championship.\n\nHe said to the press in Illinois, \"Thankfully, I've won a championship. In my eyes, I still get to compete for a championship through the owner's points system. That's how we all get paid. [It] would obviously be weird if I was to win the driver's deal at the end of the year and didn't get to have my name in the record books, but it's already in there once. That's kind of all that matters to me.\"\n\nHe followed his words up with a tenth-place finish in the race and moved up to second on the points table. While several icons and drivers including Brad Keselowski and Kyle Busch have come out in support of Larson to push NASCAR towards granting him the waiver, others aren't very much in favor of him too.\n\nThe key point of contention from those who don't believe Larson ought to get the waiver is that he intentionally chose to run in the Indy 500 ahead of the Coca-Cola 600. Following Joey Logano stressing on this fact last week on SiriusXM, 23XI Racing driver Bubba Wallace has pitched in as well. Before the race on Sunday, former racer Kenny Wallace posed the question of whether Larson ought to get the waiver.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "gowtham_ramalingam@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Gowtham Ramalingam", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Larson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Larson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_Cup_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR Cup Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_Motorsports_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gateway Motorsports Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daytona_500", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daytona 500"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daytona_International_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daytona International Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daytona_Beach,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daytona Beach, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Daytona Beach, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrick_Motorsports", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hendrick Motorsports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/23XI_Racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "23XI Racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubba_Wallace", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bubba Wallace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirius_XM", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sirius XM"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenny_Wallace", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kenny Wallace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola_600", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coca-Cola 600"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_500", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis 500"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joey_Logano", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joey Logano"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Keselowski", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brad Keselowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Busch", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Busch"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Drivers", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Drivers", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Device_Drivers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Device Drivers", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/02/e11a5841-untitled-design-2.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9620334", "eventUri": "eng-9620334", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2014-02-", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 6}], "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

However, NASCAR rules state that drivers must start every race during the regular season to earn a berth in the postseason.\n\nThe decision to remain in Indianapolis, rather than leaving early to make the green flag in Charlotte, initially took Larson out of the playoff running.\n\nBut NASCAR exercised its option in the rule book to grant a waiver to Larson, albeit well over a week after the race was missed, meaning he remains in playoff contention.\n\nHe sits second in driver points, 21 points behind leader Denny Hamlin.

And had it not been for a pesky weather delay, it all would've worked out just fine.\n\nbyCaleb Jacobs| PUBLISHED Jun 3, 2024 4:37 PM EDTNewsShare\n\n0\n\nCaleb JacobsView caleb jacobs's Articles\n\ncalebjacobs0611\n\ncalebjwords\n\nKyle Larson is a racer. He drives anything he can get his hands on, and he drives it well. His main gig is in the NASCAR Cup Series driving the No. 5 Chevy Camaro ZL1 for Hendrick Motorsport, though on Memorial Day Weekend, he raced with Arrow McLaren at the Indianapolis 500. Turns out, it was a move that could come back to bite Larson and cost him a shot at another championship, but I'll argue that it was the right call no matter what NASCAR decides.\n\nIt's become an issue as Larson was apparently never given the all-clear by NASCAR to skip the Coca-Cola 600. The plan was for Larson to drive both races, at Indy and Charlotte, historically called \"The Double.\" Tony Stewart did it multiple times, most successfully in 2001 when he became the first driver to finish on the lead lap of the Indy 500 and Coke 600 on the same day. Larson intended to do the same but weather delays in the Midwest meant he couldn't make it to North Carolina in time.\n\nBecause NASCAR didn't issue a waiver for Larson to skip the Coke 600, he's currently ineligible for the playoffs. Even though Larson already has two Cup Series wins this season, which would otherwise qualify him automatically, a rule would have to be rewritten to allow him back into contention. If that doesn't happen, then that means no chance at a second Cup Series title this year. How could they let this happen? \"They\" being Hendrick, Larson, and yes, even NASCAR.\n\nI'm not sure if there's anyone above NASCAR's rules, but if there is, it's probably Larson. He's been the best driver on the Cup Series' most dominant team all season, and he already has a championship to his name. NASCAR would seemingly shoot itself in the foot by playing hardball and keeping him out of the title chase, especially considering how big Larson's fanbase is. At the same time, you can't blame 'em for wanting him at such a big race in the heart of NASCAR country, even with all the publicity and TV airtime they've enjoyed as part of Larson's Indy crossover.\n\nStill, I can't blame Larson for doing what he did. Indy is a mighty fine jewel that entices the world's greatest racers, and it's arguably the centerpiece of motorsport's Triple Crown. Larson is just as susceptible to its draw as anyone, and even with this drama, it's a net positive to see him take a crack at the big oval in an open-wheel car. Nevermind the fact that he finished P18; can you imagine what it would be like if he won?\n\nThen you have to consider what Larson has already achieved elsewhere. His first Cup Series title was huge, obviously, and while there's no doubt he wants another, \"NASCAR champ\" is already the top item on his resume. Before that, Larson finished the Rolex 24 at Daytona first overall in 2015 with Chip Ganassi Racing, meaning he's a winner in sportscars too. Oh, and don't forget his pair of Chili Bowl victories and countless other dirt car Ws. Other than Indy, he's pretty much done it all.\n\nThat being said, Larson is not indifferent toward NASCAR's decision. He wants to race for another title. He told reporters this past weekend at Gateway Motorsports Park that he's showing up every Sunday with the ultimate goal of winning the 2024 Cup Series championship. The 32-year-old even said he wanted Indy to be pushed back to another day so he could leave in time for the race at Charlotte, but alas, that's not how things shook out.\n\nNASCAR says there's no timetable for its final decision on whether or not to excuse Larson's absence from the Coke 600. I hope they give him a pass, personally, but even if they don't, I still support Larson's decision. When you're given a shot to race a competitive car at the Indy 500, you take it. Simple as that.\n\nGot a tip or question for the author?

We've all experienced hurt, betrayal and seeing someone else get put first when we thought we'd be the priority.\n\nIt stings. It sucks. And sometimes, we can be led down a path of chasing the anger that accompanies those emotions.\n\nBut that path is often a dead end, at best. At worst, we might follow it right off a cliff. And that's what I'm writing to you about today.\n\nWe're talking about the current indecision about what to do with Kyle Larson. He missed the Coca-Cola 600 on May 26 after a rain delay forced him to choose between one of your crown jewel races and the Indianapolis 500, which amounts to a competitor's event for you. Because he failed to start the race, he is no longer eligible to make your playoffs and run for the championship unless you give him a waiver, even though he was the NASCAR Cup Series points leader before that decision.\n\nTo make matters worse, you were led to believe you were the priority over Indy. Although the world views the Indy 500 as perhaps the biggest race on the planet, that is not an acceptable excuse in your mind to miss a NASCAR event. And so you're looking to hold Larson and his Hendrick Motorsports team accountable for their decision.\n\nI get that emotion. I really do. But in reality, the consequences and fallout from punishing Larson would be far more harmful to NASCAR than your star choosing a different race on that day.\n\nYour stance is Larson violated the rules, so denying him a waiver is within your rights. That's true. The problem is waivers have previously not had a strict standard applied to them at all.\n\nAccording to NASCAR journalist Seth Eggert, who tracks waivers, 31 of 35 requests to you have been granted since the rule was introduced in 2014. Waivers have been given for medical reasons, behavioral suspensions, and even for drivers who missed races because the rules said they were too young to compete when the season began.\n\nYou even gave a waiver to Matt Kenseth after he missed the first four races of the 2020 season, with no intention of running for the championship. By coincidence, he was taking Larson's seat at Chip Ganassi Racing after Larson made a racial slur and was suspended that year.\n\nNow, Larson might not get a waiver despite badly wanting to run both races on the same day. That was his entire purpose in attempting the \"Double,\" which lifts all of American motorsports and attracts international attention. It would have worked out gloriously for you had there not been rain; sadly, Larson was put in a no-win situation of having to miss one of the races after a storm swept through Indianapolis.\n\nSo, along with Hendrick, Larson opted to stay in Indy. He had qualified fifth. Millions of dollars had been spent on the effort. The team had no backup driver. And there was a belief from the team he would get a waiver.\n\nAs soon as the race was over, Larson did one quick interview and jumped into an SUV to try and make it to Charlotte for your race -- even though it had already started and he would not get any points. Larson wanted to show a good-faith effort to make it and participate, just as he had done by leaving Indy for the All-Star Race at North Wilkesboro and for qualifying in Charlotte on the night before the 500. Unfortunately, he arrived right as that same weather system did and never got to drive.\n\nUltimately, though, you didn't think he would choose Indy over you. If there was a rain delay, you figured he would come back to Charlotte and skip the Indy 500. So in your eyes, he had every chance to do the right thing. Since that wasn't the choice he made, you now want to send a message it wasn't acceptable.\n\nI would argue there are other ways to do so. The only previous waiver denials have been for drivers who violated your substance abuse policy and those who missed races due to a lack of sponsorship. Respectfully, it feels short-sighted to add Larson to this list out of a desire to make him an example.\n\nIf the purpose of a denial is to protect NASCAR's brand and ensure the Indy 500 doesn't get any bigger, such a decision has the potential to backfire tremendously. In reality, the public would perceive this as a petty move -- and we're not talking about Richard.\n\nMany fans would not only be furious but find themselves led down the same path of anger on which you currently find yourselves. Some would vow to not watch or spend money on tickets; in fact, they're already preemptively declaring this on social media. There's even a chance it could trump Brian France's infamous, legacy-altering decision to add Jeff Gordon as the 13th member of a 12-driver playoff field in 2013.\n\nThat said, I'll acknowledge we disagree on the premise of this conversation. In an era when you've been open about a lack of star power in your ranks, Larson's generational talent is drawing all sorts of attention. He speaks with his ability behind the wheel rather than building his name through personality, which is a rare thing in a sport where many fans choose their favorite drivers based on what they hear in interviews.\n\nIf anything, Larson should have been applauded for trying to elevate all motorsports -- including NASCAR. The Double attempts should be encouraged, not quashed. He made you and your drivers look darn good in how he conducted himself and performed at Indy.\n\nBut even though we don't feel the same way about that, I'd still urge you to grant the waiver for reasons unrelated to the driver himself. This is about all of NASCAR and the health of the series.\n\nIf the waiver is denied, the entire storyline for the rest of the season will be about Larson's ineligibility. Every time he wins, this will be the topic. As long as he's in contention for the regular-season championship, this will be the topic. As long as his No. 5 car is still alive in the owner points championship this fall, this will be the topic.\n\nIt will be exhausting and self-defeating. This wouldn't just be shooting yourself in the foot; it would be shooting yourself in both hands and both feet while the greater sports world looked on with puzzlement.\n\nThis decision simply would not age well. Meanwhile, it's entirely possible you could anger Larson so much that he then leaves NASCAR prematurely. Is one day in May really worth fumbling away a superstar when you truly need one?\n\nThis decision has already dragged on for too long. The drawn-out process has exposed ill feelings to the public when it should have stayed behind closed doors. This is not a good look for anyone.\n\nBut at least if the waiver is granted this week, everyone will move on quickly. If it's denied? I hope you've truly thought through all the consequences that may come from that.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jeff_gluck@nytimes.com", "name": "Jeff Gluck", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_500", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis 500"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Larson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Larson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainout_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Rainout (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_Cup_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR Cup Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola_600", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coca-Cola 600"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrick_Motorsports", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hendrick Motorsports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_All-Star_Race", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR All-Star Race"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_NASCAR_Cup_Series", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2020 NASCAR Cup Series"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Wilkesboro_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Wilkesboro Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Kenseth", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matt Kenseth"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chip_Ganassi_Racing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chip Ganassi Racing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorsport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Motorsport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behind_closed_doors_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Behind closed doors (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Gordon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Gordon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Boat_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Boat Racing", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2024/06/03132239/GettyImages-2154988218-scaled.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9620334", "eventUri": "eng-9620334", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-26", "textStart": 547, "textEnd": 553}], "sentiment": -0.2862745098039216, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

If a starting position was not earned, then the driver(s) and Team Owner(s) must have attempted to Qualify, at the discretion of the Series Managing Director, for the Race.\"\n\nCar owner Rick Hendrick issued a statement Tuesday:\n\n\"Under normal circumstances, completing 'the double' is one of the toughest tests in sports. Despite our best efforts, this year's combination of weather conditions in Indianapolis and Charlotte made it impossible. Although losing ground in the standings was hard to swallow, we were especially disappointed for the fans at the Coca-Cola 600 who were not able to see Kyle (Larson) race. I'm extremely proud of everything he did to prepare and the months of planning by our team and our partners at Arrow McLaren to run these two crown jewel events.\n\n\"We hoped race day would play out differently, but the program was still incredibly positive for everyone involved. Kyle's performance throughout May was a great reflection on the level of talent competing each week in the NASCAR Cup Series. We appreciate NASCAR communicating with us throughout the effort and granting our request for a playoff waiver.\"\n\nAlthough Larson had two victories this season, he needed the waiver since he did not start the Coca-Cola 600.\n\nNASCAR has granted waivers to drivers primarily for injuries suffered on the track, but there have been exceptions.\n\nMatt Kenseth was granted a waiver in 2020 when he replaced Larson at Chip Ganassi Racing. Kenseth had not competed in the series since the 2018 season finale and had missed the first four races before joining Ganassi.\n\nNASCAR gave Chase Elliott a waiver last year after he was injured in a snowboarding accident and missed six races. Elliott also received a waiver after he was suspended one race for wrecking Denny Hamlin in last year's Coca-Cola 600.\n\nNASCAR granted a waiver to Erik Jones this season after he was injured in a crash at Talladega. He missed the following race. A week later, he was medically cleared to race but the team sat him out. Although he had been medically cleared, Jones' waiver was still good even with sitting out the extra race.\n\nLarson sought to become the fifth driver to race in the Indianapolis 500 and Coca-Cola 600 in the same day. Rain thwarted Larson at both tracks.\n\nThe start of the Indianapolis 500 was delayed about four hours because of rain. The field took the green flag about 90 minutes before the Coke 600 began.\n\nLarson, who won rookie of the year honors at Indy, finished 18th.

Kyle Larson's potential absence in this season's upcoming playoffs could prove more contentious, however.\n\nAfter all, the Hendrick Motorsports supernova has already captured two checkered flags this season and sits second on points. Based purely on his on-track performance, Larson has already punched a ticket into the Big Dance.\n\nAnd yet, Larson remains on the outside looking in. He sits somewhere between limbo and abyss in the Cup Series standings this year. And after helping further prop the sport into national consciousness during an impressive run at the Indy 500, the prospect of Larson -- an indisputable championship threat -- falling short of playoff qualification is a confounding sight, even for the biggest NASCAR enthusiasts.\n\nWith that, here's what you need to know about Larson's playoff waiver application.\n\nMORE: Austin Cindric charges ahead on final lap to win 2024 Enjoy Illinois 300\n\nWhen Larson's team, Hendrick Motorsports, issued a postseason waiver for Larson, it appeared to be a foregone conclusion that it would be accepted. NASCAR has been fairly laissez-faire when it comes to giving out playoff vouchers in the past, offering not only to drivers who suffered injuries while in their chariots (Kyle Busch, Alex Bowman) but also to those who have been suspended.\n\nJust last year, Elliott was granted not one, but two waivers: one for injury (he broke his leg while snowboarding), the other after he was handed a one-race ban for intentionally wrecking Denny Hamlin.\n\nNASCAR's official stance on making it to the postseason is as follows:\n\n\"Unless otherwise authorized by NASCAR, driver(s) and team owner(s) must start all championship events of the current season to be eligible for the Playoffs.\"\n\nIt hasn't applied that rule all that consistently over the years, however. And it has some of Larson's competitors wondering what's the hold up for Larson's approval.\n\nNASCAR confirmed that it received Hendrick Motorsports' waiver request on May 30.

And unfortunately, the weather situation threw them a curveball, threw the industry a curveball, something we had to deal with.\n\n\"Ultimately, the effort that they made, without the weather, they're going to be there. We feel confident that was going to happen.\n\n\"To not have Kyle Larson in our playoff and give our fans the opportunity to see him race for a championship and compete against some of the best drivers in the world, at the end of the day didn't feel like that's the right decision for us to make. We didn't. We felt we got to the right spot.\"\n\nA possible option could have been for NASCAR to have granted the waiver but also penalized in some form -- perhaps deducting playoff points -- but NASCAR chose not to do so.\n\n\"Everything was on the table,\" Sawyer said. \"If you look at the rulebook, the two options were to grant it or not to grant it and anything in between that or outside of that would have been us digging deep into the rulebook to do something that just didn't feel right to do that. Every effort was made to, with all good intentions (to get to Charlotte). I go back to this, all of our fans were looking forward to seeing Kyle compete in both the Indy 500 and the Coke 600 and that didn't work out.\"\n\nLarson needed a waiver because the start of the Indianapolis 500 was delayed about four hours because of rain. That race started about 90 minutes before the Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte Motor Speedway.\n\nShortly after finishing 18th in the Indianapolis 500, Larson got in an SUV on pit road and was driven to the helipad outside Turn 2 at Indianapolis Motor Speedway to fly to the airport to board a plane for Concord, North Carolina.\n\nLarson arrived at Charlotte Motor Speedway during the race and was set to relieve Justin Allgaier in the No. 5 car before rain stopped the race. The race was not resumed.\n\nSo, what about the future? The rule is not changing but could be reviewed after the season. Should NASCAR amend the rule to not grant a waiver for a driver competing in another event, even the Indianapolis 500, the idea of a driver in racing in that race and the Coca-Cola 600 would be over. But Sawyer suggested that won't be the case.\n\n\"We embrace the double,\" Sawyer said. \"We think it's great. We want to see other drivers have that opportunity. So, we just have to make sure that we're looking out, first and foremost, for the fans that, again, buying a ticket that we're here in Charlotte and felt like Kyle did and the team gave every effort to be able to get here and he was ready to go and had his helmet on (before the rain).\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elton_Sawyer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elton Sawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Larson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Larson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_postseason", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Major League Baseball postseason"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_500", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis 500"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hendrick_Motorsports", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hendrick Motorsports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Motor_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte Motor Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Allgaier", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Allgaier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola_600", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coca-Cola 600"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis_Motor_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis Motor Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coca-Cola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concord,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Concord, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Concord, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Motorcycle Racing", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://nbcsports.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3c14082/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3736x2102+0+0/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnbc-sports-production-nbc-sports.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F48%2F70%2Fe42f3a6b473c951692a386b9a7ed%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2154805588", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9620334", "eventUri": "eng-9620334", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

He intended to run both, however, rain delayed the start of the Indy 500 by four hours, forcing Larson to prioritize racing in Indianapolis or the Coca-Cola 600. Larson chose the 500 and didn't get a chance to run in the 600 due to NASCAR calling the race due to rain after he arrived from Indianapolis.\n\nHamlin finds it \"ridiculous\" that NASCAR hasn't granted Larson a playoff waiver as they have in previous instances.\n\n\"He had a choice,\" Hamlin said. \"That's by the letter of the law, that's what they're saying is he had a choice. ...

But with the track drying, NASCAR inexplicably decided to call the race.\n\nHendrick Motorsports requested a waiver for Larson, but well over a week later, no official decision has been made by NASCAR.\n\nThe longer the situation drags out, the more concerning it looks for the 31-year-old Elk Grove, California native, given how quickly waivers have been handed out in the past -- and for a wide variety of reasons.\n\nLet's not forget why the 26-race rule is in place. It is used to prevent full-time drivers from picking and choosing which races to run, thus preventing the kind of \"load management\" that other sports deal with.\n\nIt is also used to prevent part-time drivers from \"stealing\" one of the 16 playoff spots with a victory in a limited schedule. For example, A.J. Allmendinger did not get into the 2021 playoffs, despite winning at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway road course.\n\nSure, Larson decided to stay in Indianapolis, and NASCAR may not take too kindly to his late decision to prioritize the Indy 500 over the Coca-Cola 600, even though it's not like the Indy 500 is some random local go-kart race like some are making it out to be.\n\nBut it was bad weather in both locations, plus a bizarre decision from NASCAR, which ultimately kept Larson from running the Coca-Cola 600.\n\nScrewing over the full-time driver and perennial championship favorite who sits in second place in the point standings by using a rule that is in place for reasons which have nothing to do with why he actually missed a race would be a shambolic decision and a black eye on the sport. There is simply no way around that.\n\nOne could even argue that, given the IndyCar vs. NASCAR debate, it is a decision that could be made for no other reason than spite. Yet as more times passes, it becomes more and more possible that that's the decision that will be made.\n\nBased on the exclusion of Larson's playoff points, one thing is clear: the 2021 Cup Series champion is currently ineligible for the playoffs and the championship. Only NASCAR can change that. Will they make the obvious right decision?\n\nWill a decision be made before the next Cup Series race at Sonoma Raceway?

One of reason this waiver process takes place is to give our fans some certainly that if they buy a ticket and come to watch our athletes and stars before, that they're going to see them.\n\n\"So, the prior precedence set with allowing waivers were quick decisions. This was unique in the fact that Kyle raced for another series and wasn't there to start our event.\"\n\nAsked if thought this was a \"close call,\" Sawyer said, \"As far as it being close, I don't know. There were different views from different people. I commend our process, proud of our team. Everyone had a view on it.\n\n\"The ultimate decision we wanted to get to was the right decision.

JR Motorsports Xfinity Series driver Justin Allgaier started the 600 in Larson's No. 5 Chevrolet and planned to turn it over to Larson when he arrived (Allgaier would keep the finish as the driver of record).\n\nLarson finally arrived in Charlotte after 249 of 400 laps were completed, but so did the bad weather. The race never resumed - since it went more than half the distance it was considered official - and Larson never got behind the wheel. Allgaier was credited with the 13th place finish.\n\nSawyer said he did not believe the waiver rule needed to be altered but that the sanctioning body regularly reviews all such issues in the offseason.\n\n\"The rulebook is very clear - you grant the waiver, or you don't,\" he said. \"Anything in between in that would not really be following our rule book. Again, we didn't take this lightly.\n\n\"I do want to commend the team from Hendrick Motorsports, especially Jeff Andrews.

Kenseth had not competed in the series since the 2018 season finale and had missed the first four races before joining Ganassi.\n\nNASCAR gave Chase Elliott a waiver last year after he was injured in a snowboarding accident and missed six races. Elliott also received a waiver after he was suspended one race for wrecking Denny Hamlin in last year's Coca-Cola 600.\n\nNASCAR granted a waiver to Erik Jones this season after he was injured in a crash at Talladega.

They're very sensitive people. They believe that they are the show in the U.S., and if you participate in NASCAR, you shouldn't participate in anything else.\n\n\"I just don't think they like playing second fiddle to anyone. There's someone in headquarters that doesn't take kindly to playing second fiddle and believes that if you're going to be over here, then you have to say here. ...That's just my opinion. That's what I think. I think that when he chose Indy over Coke 600, that person got very offended. And you just never know how they decide what choices they're going to make.\n\nHamlin also said he's not sure when NASCAR will make the ruling on Larson. \"They could make up a whole other rule and say yeah you're in the playoffs but you lost all your playoff points.,\" Hamlin said. \"They're just no governance to keep them from doing whatever they want.\"\n\nLarson missed the Coca-Cola 600 weather cauased NASCAR to call the race with 151 laps remaining. The Indy 500 started late because of weather, causing Larson to miss the start of the Coca-Cola 600.

They said, 'Do you think he should get a waiver?' And I said quickly, 'Yeah, absolutely.' They were like, 'Really? So what if you want to go race Le Mans next year? Should you get a waiver?' I said, 'Hm, that's a good point. I didn't think about it like that.' What defines a major event? There are lots of major events,\" Hamlin said.\n\n\"Now, Kyle wasn't missing this to go to a high-limit race. You know, he was missing this to do the Indy 500.

Larson has qualified for the Cup Series' 16-driver postseason field as a two-time winner this season.\n\nThe NASCAR Rule Book covers eligibility in Section 12.3.2.1.A, which states: \"Unless otherwise authorized by NASCAR, driver(s) and Team Owner(s) must start all Championship Events of the current season to be eligible for The Playoffs.

When storms delayed the Indianapolis event by roughly four hours, Larson stayed to begin the 500-mile race, and standby driver Justin Allgaier suited up to start the 600 in Charlotte for the No. 5 team.\n\nAllgaier, an Xfinity Series regular, dropped to the rear for the green flag but worked his way up in the running order when rain and lightning halted the action at Charlotte with 249 of a scheduled 400 laps complete. Larson flew in from Indianapolis and arrived at the No. 5 team's pit box when the race was stopped. He prepared to enter the car for the remainder of the 600-mile event, but after the progress of the track-drying efforts had slowed, the race did not resume.\n\nAs the official starter of record, Allgaier was credited with 13th place in his first Cup Series start since 2022. Larson did not earn any championship points for the race, and he fell from the lead in the Cup Series standings. After Sunday's Cup race at World Wide Technology Raceway where Larson finished 10th, he was second in the points standings, 21 points behind Denny Hamlin.\n\nLarson has won twice in the Cup Series this season, first with a dominant victory in March at Las Vegas.

When he finally did arrive at Charlotte that race was also under a weather delay and eventually was called due to weather before he even turned a lap.\n\nAccording to NASCAR's rules, for a driver to be eligible for the driver's championship they must at least start every NASCAR race in a season. In the past NASCAR has granted waivers, but normally for drivers who miss a race due to injury. Kyle Busch was granted one in 2015 after he sustained two broken legs in a crash at the end of the Xfinity race at Daytona missing the first 11 races, and last season Chase Elliott after he broke his leg while snowboarding and missed races.\n\nThe same year his younger brother suffered his injuries, older brother Kurt Busch was also granted a waiver after NASCAR had suspended him following domestic abuse charges. Once those charges were dropped, Kurt Busch was reinstated, and the waiver was granted.\n\nShortly after the announcement that the waiver was granted NASCAR's senior vice president of competition Elton Sawyer met with the media and said that they didn't take the decision lightly, and there was a lot of discussions internally.\n\n\"I'm proud of our team and how we took the due diligence to work through this process,\" Sawyer said. \"But ultimately landed at giving Kyle a waiver so he'll be eligible for the playoffs going forward.\"\n\nDuring the delay while waiting on the decision, many speculated that since Larson never got a chance to race the car in Charlotte it was affecting whether NASCAR would grant him a waiver. Sawyer said the team did take that into consideration, but in the end felt Larson had done everything he could to get to the track to race.\n\n\"He was standing in the pit box when his helmet went on ready to go,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, we had weather in Charlotte as well, and we weren't fortunate enough to get the race, going again.\n\n\"That's how we landed at our decision.\"\n\nSawyer acknowledged that waivers in the past seemed to be granted relatively quickly, however, Larson's call was different.\n\n\"This was without a doubt, uncharted waters,\" Sawyer said. \"In the past those waivers have been given mostly for medical reasons or situations where drivers were suspended from our event. And those waivers were granted fairly quickly.\n\n\"This one, again, was unprecedented in the fact that we had a driver miss one of our races, one of our Cup races, a championship event to be at another event. That's why it took as long as it did.\n\n\"I'm proud of our process. I'm proud of the team here at NASCAR and the way we worked through that. And we felt like the time that it took roughly a week, was exactly what we needed to get to the right decision.\"\n\nAs for the consideration of any sort of penalties for missing a Cup race to race somewhere else, Sawyer pointed out that Larson lost out on 23 potential championship points which negates any sort of points penalty that would have come from NASCAR.\n\nAs for changing the rules about waivers, Sawyer said there is nothing concerning that, at least for this season.\n\n\"We're going to look at it, take a deeper dive,\" Sawyer said. \"But as we sit here today, we feel like we have language in the rule book that would support, obviously given the waiver and, and be not given the waiver. So it's in the rule book.\"\n\n\"If there's something we feel like and what we've learned from this process that we need to...add some language or delete some language, you know, we'll do that.\n\n\"But as we sit here today ... we don't feel like we need to do anything at the moment. But... there's a long list of rules that as you go through the season we talk about, we put them on the kind of the agenda for the off season, and we'll do that with this one as well.\"", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elton_Sawyer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Elton Sawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Larson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Larson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NASCAR"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Busch", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kurt Busch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Charlotte, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xfinity", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Xfinity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowboarding", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Snowboarding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daytona_International_Speedway", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Daytona International Speedway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chase_Elliott", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chase Elliott"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Busch", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Busch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indianapolis", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Indianapolis"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Auto Racing", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Snowmobile Racing", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Boat_Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Motorsports/Boat Racing", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/665f3c99c0fc4c680019d823/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9620334", "eventUri": "eng-9620334", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-26", "textStart": 263, "textEnd": 269}], "sentiment": -0.2, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

More than a week after Hendrick Motorsports requested a waiver for the driver of the No. 5 Chevrolet, a decision has not yet been made.\n\nAt first, it was thought that a waiver being granted to the 2021 Cup Series champion was a foregone conclusion, given how many other drivers have been granted waivers in years past. Waivers have been granted for a variety of reasons.\n\nPlus, the whole 26-race rule is in place for two reasons. Most importantly, it is used to prevent part-time drivers (i.e. Jimmie Johnson or A.J. Allmendinger) from \"stealing\" one of the 16 playoff spots with a victory.\n\nFor example, Allmendinger did not qualify for the 2021 playoffs, despite winning at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway road course.\n\nIt is also in place to prevent full-time drivers from picking and choosing which events to run; there is no \"load management\" in NASCAR.\n\nThe rule is not designed to screw over a full-time driver and a perennial championship favorite who dealt with bad weather.\n\nKeeping Larson out of the playoffs would basically amount to exactly that, since he did indeed qualify for the Coca-Cola 600 and he did show up to Charlotte before the race had officially ended; NASCAR simply opted to call it, an inexplicable decision in itself since the track was, in fact, drying.\n\nBut the longer this situation drags on, it is starting to seem like there is a very real possibility that Larson's championship upside for 2024 is 17th place, despite the fact that he sits second in points with two victories.\n\nFox Sports' Bob Pockrass shared the points report following this past Sunday's race at World Wide Technology Raceway at Gateway, and despite Larson's two wins and series-leading seven stage wins this season, he is listed with zero playoff points.\n\nHe has actually earned 17.\n\nWhile the following statement could change if Larson is finally granted a playoff waiver, the fact is that Larson is not currently eligible for the playoffs or the championship.\n\nWill NASCAR make the right decision? Will they make any decision, one way or another, without allowing this situation to needlessly drag on, week after week?\n\nThe next Cup Series race is scheduled to take place at Sonoma Raceway this Sunday, June 9.

Opting to remain at Indianapolis to compete in the 500 for Arrow McLaren, the Elk Grove, California, native missed the start of the Coke 600 as Xfinity Series veteran Justin Allgaier piloted Larson's No. 5 HendrickCars.com Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 entry in the event.\n\nAfter finishing 18th in his first Indy 500 attempt, Larson, who would be named the 2024 Indy 500 Rookie of the Year, then hopped on a plane, flew to Charlotte Motor Speedway and arrived just as the event was placed in a red flag period due to on-track precipitation. Despite getting suited for the event, the event was made official on Lap 249 of 400 and Allgaier was credited with a 13th-place result despite starting at the rear of the field due to the driver change made to Hendrick Motorsports' No. 5 team. As a result, Larson was unable to turn in laps to complete his double duty task, which also made his status of being eligible to make the 2024 Cup Series Playoffs in jeopardy since he did not take the green flag for the 600-mile event.\n\nFollowing the event, Hendrick Motorsports filed in a waiver request for Larson, who had notched two victories through 13-scheduled events that made him eligible for the Playoffs prior to \"The Double\". The first victory of the 2024 season occurred at Las Vegas Motor Speedway in March while the second occurred at Kansas Speedway in May, where he established the closest-recorded finish in the history of the Cup Series after edging Chris Buescher by 0.001 seconds.\n\nPer the NASCAR Rule Book, every competitor is to start in all scheduled events in a season to be eligible for the Playoffs unless circumstantial situations would be approved or authorized by NASCAR. Ultimately, the decision to grant Larson a waiver from NASCAR was due to his efforts to travel to Charlotte Motor Speedway and compete in the Coke 600 following his run at Indianapolis, per Elton Sawyer, NASCAR's senior vice president of competition.\n\nLarson, who has 25 Cup career victories to his current resume, has accumulated three poles, six top-five results, seven top-10 results and an average-finishing result of 12.4 to go alongside his two regular-season victories through 14 starts.

I'm kidding. I know there are at least a few happy NASCAR fans today ... right? I like Austin Cindric - anyone who rocks spectacles in the cockpit and wins a race is good in my book - but I also like needle-movers.\n\nAnd Austin just wasn't the needle-mover I was hoping to come back to from a week-long vacation. I see the numbers. I speak to the analytics fellas. Ryan Blaney running out of fuel with a few miles to go ain't what we needed today. Frankly, it made my Monday morning a little tougher.\n\nBut ... he did get kicked in the balls, so we have that going for us. You'll see.\n\nWhat else should we talk about today to get the 'ol Google Algo pumping? Tony Stewart is leaving NASCAR after this season because his team STINKS, so we're gonna take a trip down memory lane and beat some ass with Smoke.\n\nI've also got depressed Kyle Busch on today's menu, birthday girl Sam Busch, Hooters Gianna in Italy and a quick hitter on the silly Kyle Larson drama. Sound good?\n\nGood!\n\nFour tires, just a tad more fuel for Angry Ryan Blaney, and a glass of that good Italian stuff for Gianna ... Monday Morning Pit-Stop - the 'Who Had A NASCAR vs. Kyle Larson Dick-Measuring Contest On Their 2024 Bingo Card?' edition - is LIVE!\n\nHow about the nuts on NASCAR?\n\n... I didn't! Did you? If you're nodding your head yes, you are lying. Get outta here.\n\nLook, I don't wanna spend a lot of time on this today. Frankly, if yesterday's race was more exciting, I'd probably just skip it entirely, but I can only spend so much time breaking down Austin Cindric's win.\n\nHere's the bottom line for those - like me - who checked out last week entirely: NASCAR has yet to grant Kyle Larson a playoff waiver after missing the Coke 600. What does that mean?\n\nWell, as of today, the best driver in the series with two wins this year is not eligible for the playoffs in a few months. The rulebook says you have to participate in all points-paying races to be playoff eligible, unless, of course, you receive one of them golden waivers from NASCAR.\n\nChase Elliott got one last year after his leg snapped in two while snowboarding. Kyle Busch famously got one a decade ago after his leg broke at Daytona and went on to win the championship. Everyone assumed Kyle Larson would get one after rain ruined his chance at The Double last Sunday, but ... nothing.\n\nJust an agonizing three minutes to sit through, huh? (Ain't the first time I'll hear that today!)\n\nHow miserable is Kyle Larson right now? His Indy 500 debut was derailed by rain and a bad pit stop. He never got to run at Charlotte because of more rain. Now, NASCAR is weirdly holding him hostage and, so far, refusing to grant the waiver they've granted a billion times before. I don't get it.\n\nNow, I do think they will eventually give it to him. I can't imagine they won't. But is this some sort of weird punishment for Kyle Larson choosing Indy over NASCAR? Like, really? You're gonna make an example out of Kyle Larson? That's the flex you wanna make right now?\n\nIt's truly amazing how dumb NASCAR can be sometimes. If you idiots would focus a little more on this crappy Next Gen car, and a little less on punishing your best driver for GIVING YOU FREE MARKETING DURING ARGUABLY THE BIGGEST AUTO RACE OF THE YEAR, I promise you'd be happier. Just try it. One time.\n\nMight as well keep the momentum up with this annual NASCAR Pride tweet that pisses everyone off\n\nCome on, Bubba! You had such an easy softball here, lobbed right up at ya, down the cock ... and you whiffed. I do respect you taking your role as NASCAR's chief villain a little more seriously as of late, though.\n\nLove it for us here in the #Content game.\n\nAnyway, NASCAR discouraging their drivers from running The Double, which is one of the cooler things in racing, is just such a piss poor move. And so unnecessary. Like, if they had just given Larson the waiver the next day like normal, nobody would've batted an eye.\n\nInstead, here I am spending 1000 words on it on my first day back from vacation. Thanks.\n\nIs NASCAR stupid, or am I? Zach.Dean@OutKick.com.\n\nWhile we're sort of dumping on NASCAR this morning, which I didn't intend to do, by the way, we might as well check in on BY FAR their most hated tweet every single year:\n\nSad Kyle Busch and Blaney kicked in the nuts\n\nI look forward to this tweet every single year. It's the best.\n\nOn one hand, it's just so on-brand for virtue-signaling NASCAR to send it out. Same with MLB. Same with all the stupid car companies like Mercedes and BMW - but only the American branches, of course:\n\nHilarious. It's all just virtue-signaling. Oh, it's June 1? Hurry, send up a Pride tweet about 'love' so we don't get canceled even though literally nobody is asking for it. Go, now!\n\nAnyway, that annual NASCAR tweet got dragged through the mud - like always - and went mega-viral, which is great for us in the #content game, but not great for them. Oh well. Nothing like a little engagement farming to start the month!\n\nOK, we've gone wayyyy too long today without talking about the actual automobile race from yesterday afternoon. When the dust settled and Austin Cindric had an important win fall smack-dab into his lap, I'm pretty sure he was the only person in the garage who wasn't pissed as hell:\n\nLet's quickly remember how great Tony Stewart was\n\nI didn't bet on yesterday's race, but I just can't imagine a worse beat than having that Ryan Blaney ticket in your back pocket with one lap to go only to see that happen. Brutal. Not sure you ever truly come back from a loss like that.\n\nPS: how absolutely miserable is Kyle Busch right now? He hasn't won a race since this race, last season. That would be 364 days, for those keeping track at home.\n\nGood thing he's a level-headed guy to begin with! Phew.\n\nBefore we get to Ms. Kyle Busch, and soon-to-be Ms. Ryan Blaney, let's quickly pour one out for Stewart-Haas Racing, which announced late last week that they would close up shop at the end of this season.\n\nTough loss for NASCAR, but I think we all saw it coming. The organization has struggled for years now, and I feel like Kevin Harvick retiring after last season was pretty much the final nail.\n\nIf you know Tony Stewart, he ain't got time for shitty racing - and that's pretty much what SHR has turned into. Just sort of meh racing. Not good enough for Smoke.\n\nI mean, he's just the best. This sport was so much better when Tony Stewart was racing full-time. He ran The Double decades ago, for those who don't remember.\n\nOK, that's enough for today. Take us home, Gianna and Sam.

Sandy Bressner/Shaw Local News Network\n\nRobert Larson was an 18-year-old high school graduate with a horn when he joined the U.S. Navy on Nov. 22, 1942, to play in the band on ships.\n\nLarson was a Musician 2nd Class, assigned to the band on the USS Texas, a 27,000-ton battleship.\n\n\"Every ship or shore station in the world, if it had 1,000 men or more, rated a chaplain and the band,\" Larson said.\n\nLarson, a resident of The Holmstad in Batavia, celebrated his 100th birthday on May 29. He recalled serving on the USS Texas in World War II.\n\nThe New York class battleship was at Omaha Beach for a bombardment in support of the D-Day invasion of Normandy, France, on June 6, 1944.\n\n\"We got to Normandy about 4 a.m., before dawn, before the troops hit the beach -- we were softening up targets,\" Larson said.\n\nTo soften up a target means to kill the people who were shooting at them, he said.\n\nThe Texas also became a hospital, taking on D-Day wounded.\n\n\"I had three jobs,\" Larson said. \"When the ship was in port, I was a musician. When we were underway, I was a surface lookout. And when the ship was engaged in battle, I was working with a doctor and a corpsman.\"\n\nLarson and others did anything that needed to be done for the wounded, carrying stretchers and even assisting in surgery.\n\n'Go take those guns out'\n\nAfter Normandy, the USS Texas went to the German-occupied city of Cherbourg, France to retake the city and open the port to the Allied powers.\n\n\"The Germans had fortified the cliffs with big guns. They had them embedded in the cliff sides with sliding doors.\" Larson said. \"And they had mined the harbor ... so we could not use the port. ... And we could not get in and sweep the harbor of mines because of those guns. So they told us, 'Go take those guns out.'\"\n\nThe Texas and a couple of other ships engaged those guns. and the Texas was hit twice by return fire.\n\n\"We had one shell land on the port side of the bow, just above the waterline. But it didn't explode. We used it later for war bond rallies,\" Larson said.\n\nThe Texas knocked the guns out, swept the harbor and removed the mines.\n\nAfter Cherbourg, the battleship went on to support the invasion of Southern France in the Mediterranean Sea, then to the Pacific to support invasions at Iwo Jima and Okinawa.\n\nThey were there for 50 days and had to deal with Japanese kamikazes -- suicide pilots.\n\nThe Texas then went to Subic Bay in the Philippines to wait with the rest of the fleet for the invasion of Japan.\n\n\"While we were there, I received orders that my sea duty was ending,\" Larson said.\n\nMusicians are supposed to be at sea for two years and two years on the beach. Larson had been at sea for two years and two months.\n\n\"I was on my way home on another ship, and I heard about a bomb that had been dropped on Hiroshima,\" Larson said. \"It was an awesome bomb, but ended the war.\"\n\nIt started with a cornet\n\nLarson's parents were Swedish immigrants who settled on Chicago's south side.\n\nWhen Larson was about 10, his father handed him a cornet, similar to a trumpet but more compact.\n\n\"He said, 'Here. Learn to play this.'\"\n\nEventually, young Larson began taking lessons from a French horn player in the Chicago's Women's Symphony, Elsie Engelmann Blank.\n\n\"I was learning to play and enjoying it,\" he said. \"She was a real teacher. I learned to play but also to love music.\"\n\nLarson spent his last four months of service in the Navy Music School.\n\nPastor Larson\n\nAfter the Navy, Larson became a minister in the Evangelical Covenant Church. He attended North Park Junior College -- now North Park University -- for eight years and was ordained at age 29.\n\nHe served congregations in Michigan, Wisconsin and Rhode Island.\n\nWhile serving a congregation in Ishpeming, Michigan, Larson married a widow with a daughter, whom he adopted, and they had two more children. He returned to Illinois. His wife died in 2012 of Alzheimer's.\n\n\"I took care of her as long as I could,\" Larson said.\n\nRecalling the details of his wartime service, Larson said he longs for peace in a world that seems to be constantly at war.\n\nHe looks to his faith for guidance.\n\n\"We believe if you choose to have Christ in your life, you'll have a better life. Your life will be full of love and not warfare,\" Larson said. \"I know in my own heart that when you have Christ in your life, there's an unaccountable love that's there. It helps you to love people more than you would otherwise.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailyherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Herald"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brenda_schory@dailyherald.com",

Suggesting he chose IndyCar over NASCAR is overly simplistic.\n\nNASCAR SPEED FREAKS Is Ryan Blaney jinxed?

But when it comes to Sonoma, specifically, Martin Truex is the man.\n\nHe's won three of his last five Sonoma starts, including last year, and was third in one of those other two.\n\nHis winless streak is at 31, and since the playoffs started last year, he's been kinda lost.

track but trial still far off", "body": "Former president Donald Trump is charged with conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election\n\nFormer US president Donald Trump's case on charges of conspiring to overturn the 2020 election is back on track, but whether a trial will be held before the November White House vote remains unlikely.\n\nDistrict Judge Tanya Chutkan regained jurisdiction over the historic case last week, after it was paused so the Supreme Court could rule on whether a former president is immune from criminal prosecution.\n\nThe conservative-dominated top court ruled 6-3 on July 1 that an ex-president has broad immunity from prosecution for official acts conducted while in office, but can be pursued for unofficial acts.\n\nThe case against Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, formally returned to Chutkan on Friday and she wasted no time in laying out a schedule for it to move forward, setting a calendar for the next proceedings.\n\nA status hearing in USA vs Donald Trump is to be held at 10:00 am (1400 GMT) on August 16 at a downtown Washington courthouse.\n\nTrump is not personally required to appear at the hearing, which is to be held three days ahead of the Democratic convention, where his November rival Vice President Kamala Harris is to receive the party's presidential nomination.\n\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith\n\nChutkan asked Special Counsel Jack Smith, who brought the charges against Trump, and defense lawyers to file a schedule by Friday for pretrial proceedings.\n\nChutkan also rejected a motion filed by Trump's lawyers last year seeking to dismiss the case on the grounds of \"selective and vindictive prosecution.\"\n\nShe said they could file the motion again once immunity issues have been resolved, but no \"meaningful evidence\" had been presented so far to back up defense claims that Trump was unlawfully singled out for prosecution to torpedo his renewed White House bid.\n\n- Immunity issues -\n\nUS District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan\n\nTrump is accused of conspiracy to defraud the United States and conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding -- the January 6, 2021 joint session of Congress that was attacked by a mob of Trump supporters.\n\nTrump is also accused of seeking to disenfranchise American voters with his false claims he won the 2020 election.\n\nHe was originally scheduled to go on trial on March 4, but it was put on hold while his lawyers pushed his claim of presidential immunity all the way up to the Supreme Court.\n\nFollowing the Supreme Court ruling, it will be up to Chutkan, an appointee of former Democratic president Barack Obama, to decide which of Trump's actions regarding the 2020 election were official acts and which were unofficial acts subject to potential prosecution.\n\nThat -- along with other pre-trial issues -- is expected to take months, making it extremely unlikely that the case will go to trial before the November 5 election between Trump and Harris.\n\nTrump was convicted in New York in May of 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments made to porn star Stormy Daniels, who alleged she had a sexual encounter with the real estate tycoon.\n\nSentencing has been scheduled for September 18, but Trump's lawyers have asked for his conviction to be tossed, citing the Supreme Court immunity ruling.\n\nJudge Aileen Cannon, who dismissed the criminal case against Donald Trump on charges of mishandling top secret documents\n\nTrump also faces charges in Georgia related to efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election he lost to Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nThe first former US president convicted of a crime, Trump has been doing everything in his power to delay the trials until after the November election, when he could potentially have the charges dismissed if he wins.\n\nTrump was also charged in Florida with mishandling top secret documents after leaving the White House -- but the judge presiding over the case, Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee, dismissed the charges on the grounds that Smith, the special counsel, was unlawfully appointed.\n\nSmith has appealed Cannon's ruling.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Trial Still Far Off", "body": "Former US president Donald Trump's case on charges of conspiring to overturn the 2020 election is back on track, but whether a trial will be held before the November White House vote remains unlikely.\n\nDistrict Judge Tanya Chutkan regained jurisdiction over the historic case last week, after it was paused so the Supreme Court could rule on whether a former president is immune from criminal prosecution.\n\nThe conservative-dominated top court ruled 6-3 on July 1 that an ex-president has broad immunity from prosecution for official acts conducted while in office, but can be pursued for unofficial acts.\n\nThe case against Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, formally returned to Chutkan on Friday and she wasted no time in laying out a schedule for it to move forward, setting a calendar for the next proceedings.\n\nA status hearing in USA vs Donald Trump is to be held at 10:00 am (1400 GMT) on August 16 at a downtown Washington courthouse.\n\nTrump is not personally required to appear at the hearing, which is to be held three days ahead of the Democratic convention, where his November rival Vice President Kamala Harris is to receive the party's presidential nomination.\n\nChutkan asked Special Counsel Jack Smith, who brought the charges against Trump, and defense lawyers to file a schedule by Friday for pretrial proceedings.\n\nChutkan also rejected a motion filed by Trump's lawyers last year seeking to dismiss the case on the grounds of \"selective and vindictive prosecution.\"\n\nShe said they could file the motion again once immunity issues have been resolved, but no \"meaningful evidence\" had been presented so far to back up defense claims that Trump was unlawfully singled out for prosecution to torpedo his renewed White House bid.\n\nTrump is accused of conspiracy to defraud the United States and conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding -- the January 6, 2021 joint session of Congress that was attacked by a mob of Trump supporters.\n\nTrump is also accused of seeking to disenfranchise American voters with his false claims he won the 2020 election.\n\nHe was originally scheduled to go on trial on March 4, but it was put on hold while his lawyers pushed his claim of presidential immunity all the way up to the Supreme Court.\n\nFollowing the Supreme Court ruling, it will be up to Chutkan, an appointee of former Democratic president Barack Obama, to decide which of Trump's actions regarding the 2020 election were official acts and which were unofficial acts subject to potential prosecution.\n\nThat -- along with other pre-trial issues -- is expected to take months, making it extremely unlikely that the case will go to trial before the November 5 election between Trump and Harris.\n\nTrump was convicted in New York in May of 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments made to porn star Stormy Daniels, who alleged she had a sexual encounter with the real estate tycoon.\n\nSentencing has been scheduled for September 18, but Trump's lawyers have asked for his conviction to be tossed, citing the Supreme Court immunity ruling.\n\nTrump also faces charges in Georgia related to efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election he lost to Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nThe first former US president convicted of a crime, Trump has been doing everything in his power to delay the trials until after the November election, when he could potentially have the charges dismissed if he wins.\n\nTrump was also charged in Florida with mishandling top secret documents after leaving the White House -- but the judge presiding over the case, Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee, dismissed the charges on the grounds that Smith, the special counsel, was unlawfully appointed.", "source": {"uri": "ibtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "International Business Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_lefkow@ibtimes.com", "name": "Chris Lefkow", "type":

jurisdiction over the historic case last week, after it was paused so the Supreme Court could rule on whether a former president is immune from criminal prosecution.\n\nThe conservative-dominated top court ruled 6-3 on July 1 that an ex-president has broad immunity from prosecution for official acts conducted while in office, but can be pursued for unofficial acts.\n\nThe case against Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, formally returned to Chutkan on Friday and she wasted no time in laying out a schedule for it to move forward, setting a calendar for the next proceedings.\n\nA status hearing in USA vs Donald Trump is to be held at 10:00 am (1400 GMT) on August 16 at a downtown Washington courthouse.\n\nTrump is not personally required to appear at the hearing, which is to be held three days ahead of the Democratic convention, where his November rival Vice President Kamala Harris is to receive the party's presidential nomination.\n\nChutkan asked Special Counsel Jack Smith, who brought the charges against Trump, and defense lawyers to file a schedule by Friday for pretrial proceedings.\n\nChutkan also rejected a motion filed by Trump's lawyers last year seeking to dismiss the case on the grounds of \"selective and vindictive prosecution.\"\n\nShe said they could file the motion again once immunity issues have been resolved, but no \"meaningful evidence\" had been presented so far to back up defense claims that Trump was unlawfully singled out for prosecution to torpedo his renewed White House bid.\n\n- Immunity issues -\n\nTrump is accused of conspiracy to defraud the United States and conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding -- the January 6, 2021 joint session of Congress that was attacked by a mob of Trump supporters.\n\nTrump is also accused of seeking to disenfranchise American voters with his false claims he won the 2020 election.\n\nHe was originally scheduled to go on trial on March 4, but it was put on hold while his lawyers pushed his claim of presidential immunity all the way up to the Supreme Court.\n\nFollowing the Supreme Court ruling, it will be up to Chutkan, an appointee of former Democratic president Barack Obama, to decide which of Trump's actions regarding the 2020 election were official acts and which were unofficial acts subject to potential prosecution.\n\nThat -- along with other pre-trial issues -- is expected to take months, making it extremely unlikely that the case will go to trial before the November 5 election between Trump and Harris.\n\nTrump was convicted in New York in May of 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments made to porn star Stormy Daniels, who alleged she had a sexual encounter with the real estate tycoon.\n\nSentencing has been scheduled for September 18, but Trump's lawyers have asked for his conviction to be tossed, citing the Supreme Court immunity ruling.\n\nTrump also faces charges in Georgia related to efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election he lost to Democrat Joe Biden.\n\nThe first former US president convicted of a crime, Trump has been doing everything in his power to delay the trials until after the November election, when he could potentially have the charges dismissed if he wins.\n\nTrump was also charged in Florida with mishandling top secret documents after leaving the White House -- but the judge presiding over the case, Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee, dismissed the charges on the grounds that Smith, the special counsel, was unlawfully appointed.\n\nSmith has appealed Cannon's ruling.\n\ncl/st", "source": {"uri": "ccenterdispatch.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Clay Center Dispatch On-Line"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_lefkow@ccenterdispatch.com", "name": "Chris

(Scripps News)\n\nThe federal judge presiding over the election subversion case against former President Donald Trump rejected Saturday a defense effort to dismiss the indictment on claims that he was prosecuted for vindictive and political purposes.\n\nThe ruling from U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan is the first substantive order since the case was returned to her Friday following a landmark Supreme Court opinion last month that conferred broad immunity for former presidents and narrowed special counsel Jack Smith's case against Trump.\n\nIn their motion to dismiss the indictment, defense lawyers argued that Trump was mistreated because he was prosecuted even though others who have challenged election results have avoided criminal charges. Trump, the Republican nominee in the 2024 presidential race, also suggested that President Joe Biden and the Justice Department launched a prosecution to prevent him from winning reelection.\n\nBut Chutkan rejected both arguments, saying Trump was not charged simply for challenging election results but instead for \"knowingly making false statements in furtherance of criminal conspiracies and for obstruction of election certification proceedings.\" She also said that his lawyers had misread news media articles that they had cited in arguing that the prosecution was political in nature.\n\nRELATED STORY | What does the Supreme Court's immunity ruling mean for Trump's federal election interference case?\n\n\"After reviewing Defendant's evidence and arguments, the court cannot conclude that he has carried his burden to establish either actual vindictiveness or the presumption of it, and so finds no basis for dismissing this case on those grounds,\" Chutkan wrote in her order.\n\nAlso Saturday, she scheduled an Aug. 16 status conference to discuss next steps in the case.\n\nThe four-count indictment, brought in August 2023, accuses Trump of conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election he lost to President Joe Biden through a variety of schemes, including by badgering his vice president, Mike Pence, to block the formal certification of electoral votes.\n\nTrump's lawyers argued that he was immune from prosecution as a former president, and the case has been on hold since December as his appeal worked its way through the courts.\n\nThe Supreme Court, in a 6-3 opinion, held that presidents enjoy absolute immunity for core constitutional duties and are presumptively immune from prosecution for all other official acts. The justices sent the case back to Chutkan to determine which acts alleged in the indictment can remain part of the prosecution and which must be discarded.", "source": {"uri": "abcactionnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WFTS"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ava_joye_burnett@abcactionnews.com", "name": "Ava-joye Burnett", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_judge", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States federal judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripps_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Scripps News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanya_S._Chutkan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tanya S.

Circuit returned Donald Trump's criminal election subversion case back to federal judge Tanya Chutkan on Friday, just over a month after the Supreme Court ruled that presidents are immune from criminal prosecution for any official act taken while in office.\n\nThe move marks a long-awaited resumption of one of Trump's ongoing criminal cases. This particular one has been on hold since January 2024, as the D.C. appellate court and the high court considered Trump's argument that the case should be dismissed on the grounds of presidential immunity.\n\nFollowing the delay, a full jury trial before the November election is next to impossible. However, Chutkan will have to conduct a \"mini-trial\" to determine whether Trump could be tried on any of his alleged conduct following the Supreme Court ruling.\n\nChutkan, a Barack Obama appointee, can now begin issuing orders again -- and can set a briefing schedule related to the high court's immunity decision. The move comes just under a year after Trump was arranged and entered his not guilty plea in 2023.\n\nIn the high court's 6-3 July 1 decision, Chief Justice John Roberts ruled that a president's actions can fall within three distinct levels: core official acts (such as pardons); official acts within the \"outer perimeter\" of a president's duties; and unofficial acts. Core acts receive absolute immunity, while unofficial acts receive none whatsoever.\n\nOfficial acts within the \"outer perimeter\" constitute a vast majority of the president's actions, and should be presumed to carry immunity, Roberts wrote in the majority opinion. That presumption sets a high bar for prosecutors to clear -- though just how high it is remains to be tested.\n\nRoberts ordered Chutkan, a Barack Obama appointee, to conduct an analysis to determine which level Trump's conduct alleged in special counsel Jack Smith's indictment falls, and whether Smith can clear the bar of presumptive immunity.\n\nThe high court applied very little of their new test to Trump's conduct, only using it to determined certain actions as official acts, such as Trump's communications with the Justice Department -- including threats to then-acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen -- regarding potential election fraud investigations.\n\nTrump's communications to former Vice President Mike Pence, pressuring him to use his ceremonial role over Congress' certification of the electoral ballots to instead certify ballots from Trump's false electors, should also receive \"presumptive immunity,\" Roberts said.\n\nThat leaves a little room for Smith to prove that Trump's communications with Pence were unofficial -- but not much. Roberts suggested in the opinion that discarding immunity for those communications would likely \"hinder the president's ability to perform his constitutional function,\" a repeated concern for the conservative majority.\n\nRoberts did not address whether Trump's efforts to push state legislators and election officials in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin to forego their electoral counts and vote for Trump should fall within the outer perimeter or unofficial.\n\nFurther, Trump's public statements and social media posts, which Roberts said likely \"fall comfortably\" in the outer perimeter, will need to be addressed by Chutkan.\n\nBy leaving much of the test up to Chutkan, the Supreme Court left room for Trump to again challenge her decisions -- potentially upending the case for good if Trump manages to win back the White House in November, at which point he could order his new attorney general to dismiss the case.\n\nTrump has recently been enjoying a slew of victories in his federal cases. He also survived a failed assassination attempt. Trump- ppointee Aileen Cannon dismissed his classified documents case in Florida, adopting a conservative legal theory that special counsel Smith had been unlawfully appointed to his post.\n\nSmith has since appealed the dismissal, but he is unlikely to find much success if the case eventually reaches the Supreme Court, where Justice Clarence Thomas supported the theory in a concurring opinion in the immunity decision.\n\nBefore the Supreme Court agreed to hear Trump's immunity argument, Chutkan had indicated that she would give Trump's legal team a certain grace period to catch up in the election subversion case before resuming the proceeding's speedy pace. It is unclear whether that offer still stands nearly seven months later.", "source": {"uri": "tucsonsentinel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tucson Sentinel"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_knappenberger@tucsonsentinel.com", "name": "Ryan Knappenberger", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_immunity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sovereign immunity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_trial", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jury trial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Roberts", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "John Roberts"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_immunity", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Absolute immunity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanya_S._Chutkan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tanya S.

United States.\n\nThe judge wants both parties, by August 9, to brief her on their respective visions for a schedule of \"pretrial proceedings moving forward.\" Judge Chutkan adds that \"If necessary, the parties may explain any disagreements. \" She declares the \"court will set additional deadlines\" following the meeting on August 16.\n\nThe scheduling order marks a new phase in Trump, which has traced a circuitous path up and down the tiers of the federal judiciary. In February Judge Chutkan, who meted out harsh punishments to January 6 rioters, ruled that former presidents are not entitled to immunity because they do not operate under the \"divine right of kings.\" She was affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n\nThen the high court, in a six to three decision authored by Chief Justice Roberts, reversed Judge Chutkan and the appellate riders. The justices ruled that presidents are presumptively immune for official acts, absolutely immune for actions at the heart of their responsibilities, and lack immunity for unofficial acts. The Nine returned the case to Judge Chutkan. The justices explain that the \"first step in deciding whether a former President is entitled to immunity from a particular prosecution is to distinguish his official from unofficial actions.\"\n\nJudge Chutkan now has now been tasked by the Nine with a job that she could find disagreeable. Her belief in the fallibility of presidents, at least as regards Trump, have been well-documented. In addition to her \"divine right\" ruling in the immunity case she also declared the \"presidents are not kings\" in a 2021 order compelling Trump to release White House records to the Congressional Democrats investigating January 6.\n\nNo judge has ever had to parse presidential behavior. The Supreme Court notes that \"no court thus far has drawn\" the distinction between official or unofficial acts, \"in general or with respect to the conduct alleged in particular.\" Chief Justice Roberts insists that the district court is the venue for such an investigation, as the high court \"is a court of final review and not first view.\" The determinations Judge Chutkan makes, though, could be considered by the justices on appeal.\n\nNow Judge Chutkan will have to preside over the unprecedented -- a so-called \"mini-trial\" to discern which acts can serve as a basis for prosecution and which must be excised from Mr. Smith's charge sheets. She will be required to hew, however grudgingly, to the Supreme Court's mandate that acts that are entitled to immunity are not only blocked from prosecution -- they also cannot be used as evidence to build a case.\n\nIn inviting Trump and Mr. Smith to share their views on how this novel process should unfold, Judge Chutkan appears to be modeling rhythms of a traditional trial. A point of contention is likely to be scheduling. Mr. Smith has long asserted the public's \"compelling\" interest in a trial before November's election, though the Supreme Court has not found that persuasive. Still, the case could see hearings in the fall.\n\nJudge Chutkan ensured that immunity would have its day in district court when she declined to grant Trump's motion to dismiss the case as an instance of \"selective and vindictive prosecution.\" She found that Mr. Smith's charges across multiple jurisdictions failed to \"raise the red flag of vindictiveness\" enough to warrant dismissal. That is a vote of confidence for Mr. Smith's case, which now must navigate an adverse immunity ruling.\n\nThe immunity litigation, which will involve witnesses and the presentation of evidence, could serve as a preview for the full-blown trial, if one ever occurs. That could depend on whether Trump wins the White House. If he does, he could fire Mr. Smith and possibly issue himself a pardon. If, though, voters choose Ms. Harris, Judge Chutkan would likely have the time to conduct not only a \"mini-trial,\" but also the kind that features a jury.", "source": {"uri": "nysun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Sun"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Smith_(lawyer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jack Smith (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_immunity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Legal immunity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mueller_special_counsel_investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mueller special counsel investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanya_S._Chutkan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tanya S.

The rapid revival did nothing to quell concerns from her critics that she was rushing a case that required, in their view, a more methodical approach.\n\n\"Criminal cases usually never move this quickly, especially something of this complexity,\" Josh Blackman, a professor at South Texas College of Law Houston, told the Washington Examiner.\n\nChutkan regained jurisdiction over Trump's case one month after the Supreme Court ruled on July 1 that presidents have some immunity from criminal prosecution. While this is a typical timeline for the high court, it meant Chutkan could see the 119-page ruling but had no ability to act on it until Aug. 2.\n\nWhen Chutkan finally received the Supreme Court's order, known as a \"mandate,\" she jumped almost immediately by setting a scheduling conference for Aug. 16. The judge asked parties to submit a report in anticipation of the conference by Aug. 9. Additionally, she denied a motion to dismiss from Trump, effectively rejecting the former president's argument that special counsel Jack Smith failed to articulate in his indictment how Trump violated laws.\n\nHours later, she denied another outstanding request from Trump to toss out his charges, this time shutting down his argument that his case should be dismissed because the indictment was politically motivated.\n\nPrior to this weekend, the case docket had seen no meaningful activity since mid-December because of the drawn-out appeals processes. Blackman suspected that Chutkan had her orders ready \"weeks ago.\"\n\n\"She was just sitting, waiting for the mandate to come, and she acted right away,\" Blackman said. \"She wants to move as quickly as humanly possible.\"\n\nBlackman is among those who believe Chutkan and Smith have been working to put Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, in front of a jury before the election, but this is a \"completely alien\" way to view the criminal justice system, he said.\n\n\"It's not about trying to inform voters. You should do the opposite. You try to not have this [before the election],\" Blackman said, adding that judges and prosecutors should not aim to \"affect politics.\"\n\nConservative legal analyst Andy McCarthy said in an op-ed that Chutkan's quick responses to the Supreme Court mandate were a futile and \"transparent effort to get [the case] back on track\" to influence the election.\n\n\"There are now too many obstacles for the anti-Trump lawfare crusade to exact the damage Democrats hoped to inflict on Trump's 2024 presidential campaign,\" McCarthy wrote, adding that Trump's strategy of \"delay, delay, delay\" has been a success.\n\nWhat happens next depends largely on how Smith approaches the conundrum the immunity decision has presented. The Supreme Court deemed at least some of the activity in his indictment of Trump as off-limits from being used in a criminal prosecution, meaning Smith has to, at the least, carve out parts of the indictment and reduce Trump's charges.\n\nThe process could be lengthy and open more opportunities for Trump to file appeals. It almost certainly guarantees that no full trial will take place before the election -- a death knell to Chutkan's \"rocket docket,\" according to George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley.\n\nThose who have been rooting to see Trump face a trial before November, such as left-leaning legal analyst Norm Eisen, have called for Smith to scale down his sweeping allegations that Trump illegally attempted to overturn the 2020 election and defrauded voters. A mini-trial, which would not result in a verdict but would involve hearings that could be unflattering for Trump, is one option, Eisen said.\n\n\"A mini trial is the way to go, but regardless, Jack Smith should 'slim to win,'\" Eisen wrote on X. \"Meaning dropping certain charges or paring down allegations that arguably implicate official presidential functions.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nRegardless of how Smith wants to move forward, Chutkan will have the final say in what charges, if any, Smith can move forward with, and Blackman opined that the judge may be weighing the idea of a smaller indictment.\n\n\"I think what she's wrestling with is whether to go forward with a more skinny trial, just some of the claims, versus the entire kit and caboodle,\" Blackman said, noting that Smith and Chutkan could aim for a shorter trial \"just to get Trump convicted on something\" before the election.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ashley_oliver@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Ashley Oliver", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Texas_College_of_Law_Houston", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Texas College of Law Houston"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Blackman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Josh Blackman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Examiner", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Examiner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanya_S._Chutkan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tanya S.

The maneuver effectively delayed any possibility of a trial before the election, a scenario that has significant implications for Trump and the 2024 election.\n\n\"So there's absolutely no chance this one is getting to trial,\" Vance started. \"That's because the way the Supreme Court structured this decision, Judge Chutkan will make her rulings and if she permits any of the charges to go forward, any of the allegations in the indictment to remain in place, indicates that the government can use any of this evidence despite Trump's claims that it's all now cloaked in presidential immunity, there will be a round two appeal.\"\n\n\"The way immunity works and the Supreme Court makes this clear. The whole point of having immunity is you shouldn't have to stand trial for charges that you have immunity from. So Trump will inevitably take objection to anything that she permits to move forward.

The presidential immunity ruling of July 1 is both sweeping and hamfisted, ensuring that Trump will be able to litigate its contours not just through November, but for the rest of his natural life. They conveniently left open the question of whether executive immunity for actions within the \"outer perimeter\" of presidential duties merit absolute or merely presumptive immunity -- just in case they need to swoop in and bail out their boy one more time.\n\nEven the New York false business records conviction is in jeopardy, since the Court went out of its way to invent an immunity not just for official acts, but for evidence of official acts. Paying off a pornstar and then covering it up by laundering the payments through your private business is unquestionably unofficial conduct, but Trump's conviction was secured with testimony from two presidential aides and his federal financial disclosure. So, even if Justice Juan Merchan rules that this was harmless error, it will be tied up in appeals for years. Sentencing is set for September, conveniently injecting Trump's false business records conviction into the news cycle at regular intervals for the foreseeable future, and potentially pulling him off the campaign trail for court appearances.\n\nAnd while Trump may escape a jail cell, he will not escape having his shit on main in a whole lot of courtrooms this fall. Some of that is by his own choice, as in the defamation suit he filed in Florida against ABC and George Stephanopoulos, who repeatedly suggested that Trump was an adjudicated rapist. In fact, the jury was unable to conclude that Trump managed to forcibly penetrate E. Jean Carroll with his penis, but did conclude that he was able to pin her against the wall while jamming his fingers inside her. Trump is inexplicably suing to remind us all once again that he is only a digital rapist, not a penile one. The case is set to go to trial in February, and discovery is ongoing after Judge Cecilia Altonaga denied ABC's motion to dismiss.\n\nMeanwhile, appeals of the $88 million verdicts in the Carroll cases continue apace, with oral argument before the Second Circuit set for September 6. Similarly, oral arguments in Trump's appeal of the $354 million civil fraud verdict will likely take place in September or October before the New York Appellate Division.\n\nOn the criminal front, the Fulton County election interference case is functionally on ice, as is the Florida documents case, with the Eleventh Circuit asking the special counsel to brief his appeal of Judge Cannon's Special Counsels Are Unlegal Akshully dismissal ruling in October.\n\nBut in DC, the federal election interference case is just getting back under way. Approximately 37 seconds after the Supreme Court relinquished control of the immunity decision, the DC Circuit remanded the case to Judge Tanya Chutkan to sort out the godawful mess SCOTUS made of it. She promptly set a scheduling hearing for next Friday to canvas the parties on how they intend to pick up the pieces. She also ruled on two of Trump's pending motions to dismiss.\n\nThe one based on \"statutory grounds,\" in which the defendant claimed that nothing he did was against the laws, she denied without prejudice, inviting him to \"file a renewed motion once all issues of immunity have been resolved.\" This will presumably include an entire new section on 18 USC \u00a7 1512(c)(1), in light of the Supreme Court's bizarro ruling in Fischer v. US that obstruction of an official proceeding has to involve destruction of paper documents.\n\nJudge Chutkan also denied the motion to dismiss based on selective and/or vindictive prosecution. And this ruling was with prejudice in the extreme.\n\n\"At the outset, the court must address -- as it has before -- Defendant's improper reframing of the allegations against him,\" she began, adding that \"The Indictment does not charge Defendant for publicly disputing the election outcome and merely 'working with others' to propose alternate electors.\"\n\nTrump's legal theories in the underlying motion are beyond preposterous. Despite having promised to pardon the hundreds of January 6 defendants convicted for their efforts to block certification of President Biden's electoral win, he complains that the government discriminated against him by treating him worse than his comparators. He claims that the appointment of a special counsel after he declared his candidacy is prima facia evidence of a plot to indict him, rather than the necessary protection to remove an ongoing investigation of a rival from the purview of the sitting president. He argues that articles in the Times and the Post reporting that Biden privately expressed his wish that Attorney General Merrick Garland would be more aggressive in his treatment of Trump was an express order in the form of a leak. And he insists that the indictment in DC must be vindictive, coming as it did on the heels of his decision to plead not guilty in the Florida documents case.\n\n\"Precedent squarely forecloses that line of reasoning,\" Judge Chutkan scoffs, adding that \"If vindictiveness could be established by new charges following a not guilty plea or a defendant's public criticism of the prosecution, then defendants could effectively immunize themselves from superseding indictments by taking such action. That cannot be the law.\"\n\nThis does not sound like a judge who is going to tolerate a lot of bullshit. But Trump's lawyers are clearly about to launch an avalanche of it, insisting that the election interference case must be yanked out root and branch since the grand jury indictment was secured using testimony which is now excluded under the Supreme Court's ruling. They'll argue that every bit of the indictment, from the speech on the Ellipse to the pressure campaign to get Mike Pence to throw out valid slates of electors was part of his presidential duty.\n\nIt'll be a massive, ugly fight. And at least the beginning of it will take place in the public eye, since Judge Chutkan scheduled the first hearing for August 16.

The decision has been accurately described, by Akhil Amar and others, as one of the worst in the Court's history because of the leeway it gives a president to commit crimes and its expansion of exclusive executive authority. However, the Court's ruling shields only some official presidential conduct from criminal prosecution. Unofficial acts are not covered by immunity, and not all official acts are absolutely immune. A key question in the January 6 case becomes which of the specific acts alleged in the indictment are immune under the Court's new test and which aren't. The Court gave important \"guidance\" (its term), but largely left that question for the trial court to answer in the first instance. The trial court's process for answering that question will involve an evidentiary inquiry, and perhaps hearings, to assess alleged facts relevant to the legal test.\n\nOn our view, the Court's decision leaves the core of the case against Trump intact. A fair application of the Court's new immunity test to the indictment's allegations yields a narrowed but still plainly viable prosecution. As we write, the trial court and the parties are preparing to grapple with this issue. On Saturday, August 3, Judge Tanya Chutkan -- the trial judge presiding over the case -- issued an order requesting the parties to propose a schedule for the remaining pretrial proceedings. The order also scheduled a status conference for August 16, at which the court may decide the path forward. The application of the immunity test will likely be a central part of that process.\n\nIn this essay, we discuss how the trial court should approach applying the Supreme Court's ruling. We believe that as soon as possible following the status conference, Judge Chutkan should schedule an evidentiary hearing -- a \"mini-trial,\" in which documents and witnesses are presented -- to determine the scope of the immunity in this case. Our examination of the new immunity rule and the specific allegations against Trump indicate that Smith's case remains strong and should survive that inquiry with key elements remaining unscathed.\n\nOur analysis is supplemented by an annotated version of Smith's indictment, which color-codes the allegations according to the degree to which they are now potentially protected by the Supreme Court's immunity ruling. Green are the least affected and red are the most affected, with the full coding approach outlined below in Section III of this essay.\n\n*snip*", "source": {"uri": "democraticunderground.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Democratic Underground"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_immunity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sovereign immunity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akhil_Amar", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Akhil Amar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trial court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indictment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Indictment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_(government)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Executive (government)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanya_S._Chutkan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tanya S.

(AP) -- New York City's watchdog agency has launched an investigation into allegations that the city's police department improperly used its official social media accounts to target public officials and private citizens.\n\nThe city Department of Investigation confirmed the probe in a statement Wednesday, saying it was prompted by recent requests from City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and the Legal Aid Society asking it to look into the NYPD's social media policies and practices.\n\nAdams, a Democrat, in her Friday letter cited reports from The Associated Press and others highlighting how the department and some of its top officials have in recent months adopted a more aggressive online presence, using their accounts on the X platform to take on critics.\n\nIn one post featured in the reports, Chief of Patrol John Chell said a Democratic city councilmember who had criticized the NYPD for arresting pro-Palestinian protesters at Columbia University \"hates our city.\" In another post, from February, Chell misidentified a judge in a criminal case, falsely accusing her of letting a \"predator\" loose on the city's streets.\n\n\"The recent deployment of official NYPD social media accounts to aggressively target public officials and civilians in our city, use dog whistles that can lead to threats and violence, and convey inaccurate information, is dangerous, unethical and unprofessional,\" Adams said in a statement Friday.\n\nThe NYPD did not immediately return a request for comment Wednesday.\n\nThe Legal Aid Society in its letter on Monday backed Adams' request, and also accused the police department of using social media \"unprofessionally and unethically\" to discredit pro-Palestinian protesters at local colleges.\n\nThe legal aid group pointed to X posts from Chell and NYPD Deputy Commissioner of Operations Kaz Daughtry after the department cleared campus encampments last week.\n\nOne post the organization cited noted \"a book on TERRORISM\" was found at Columbia University's Hamilton Hall, saying it was among items -- also including ear plugs, helmets, goggles, knives and ropes -- that were \"not the tools of students protesting\" but rather of \"people working on something nefarious.\" The title was, in fact, a nonfiction book on the subject published by Oxford University Press.\n\nAfter receiving the two requests, \"DOI has begun an investigation of the relevant social media use and exchanges, as well as applicable City policies,\" spokesperson Diane Struzzi said in a statement.\n\nThe Legal Aid Society had also asked for a probe into the general police response to the protests at universities, but the Department of Investigation declined to comment on that request.\n\nIn February, the NYPD's top spokesperson defended the department's social media tactics.\n\n\"We want to go on social media and push back on the misinformation that's out there,\" Tarik Sheppard told the AP at the time. \"Because if we don't, it could cause damage to the reputation of our cops and the work that we're doing.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

But a spokeswoman for Mayor Adams, who has defended police brass amid the social media controversy, said DOI's probe should also scrutinize some of the politicians targeted by the NYPD officials online.\n\n\"It is clear that a small number of advocates and Council members -- who have gone unchallenged in using their social media to make disparaging comments against the hardworking public servants of our city -- only support speech that is politically convenient for them,\" said spokeswoman Kayla Mamelak. \"We hope this DOI review includes the unprofessional actions of the small number of Council members who have engaged in this behavior.\"\n\nThe request from Speaker Adams, submitted with DOI's inspector general for the NYPD on Friday, referenced recent posts on X from NYPD Chief of Patrol John Chell, Deputy Commissioner for Operations Kaz Daughtry and other department brass that she alleged violated \"city laws that prohibit the use of city resources for political purposes.\"\n\nThe posts in question include Chell dispatches from his official department X account in which he blasted progressive Queens Councilwoman Tiffany Caban's political views as \"garbage\" and urged his followers to \"vote the change you seek\" if they dislike her, too.\n\nLegal Aid's request for DOI intervention called the social media activities from the police officials \"a clear abuse of the NYPD's authority.\"\n\nCity ethics law bars police officials from using city resources, such as department social media accounts, for blatantly political purposes. The NYPD's patrol guide prohibits police employees from engaging in political activities while in official capacity.\n\nIn addition to the requests for DOI involvement, dozens of local elected officials, including members of New York's congressional delegation, sent a letter to Mayor Adams last week demanding that he reprimand Chell for his recent social media posts.\n\nThe mayor has defended Chell against the pushback, saying the chief is a \"professional.\"\n\nThough he has vowed on X to continue to be outspoken, the NYPD press office said Tuesday that Chell had canceled a planned Wednesday night appearanc e at a Republican Party event in Queens after the Daily News inquired about it.\n\nThe mounting pressure on Chell and other NYPD officials comes amid stepped-up PR efforts on social media by department brass. While facing criticism on some fronts, the NYPD officials have been backed up by local Republicans.\n\n\"NYPD brass have every right to explain their policies and defend their positions as agency leadership on social media, especially against often baseless and politicized attacks from media and elected officials,\" Queens Councilwoman Vickie Paladino, one of the chamber's most conservative members, wrote on X in response to the DOI investigation announcement.\n\nLegal Aid's request for a probe also asked DOI to investigate whether the NYPD violated legal agreements by keeping \"dozens\" of pro-Palestinian protesters detained for more than 24 hours after they were arrested last week during raids on the Columbia University and City College campuses, where demonstrators had set up encampments and occupied an academic building.\n\nThe NYPD has said it intervened and made arrests on the campuses after being asked to do so by school leaders.\n\nStruzzi said DOI's probe is, at least for now, only focused on the social media aspect.\n\n\u00a92024 New York Daily News.

And tensions have deepened over the NYPD's recent response to college protests and encampments.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Comptroller Brad Lander and Council Speaker Adrienne Adams belong to the politically and racially diverse coalition that views the X posts as part of a pattern of bullying.\n\nThe speaker in particular had urged the DOI to probe the NYPD's use of official social media accounts that she wrote \"can plainly be construed as intimidating and dangerous.\"\n\nNearly three dozen other elected officials sent their letter last Friday to the mayor saying an X post by Chell that lambasted City Council Member Tiffany Cab\u00e1n and told his followers \"you know what to do\" in voting her out veers into political territory, thereby violating a conflicts of interest rule. They denounced Chell's \"completely unacceptable, undemocratic, illegal, dangerous, and false attack.\"\n\nCab\u00e1n, a Queens democratic socialist, had been critiquing the police raid of Columbia University's pro-Palestinian protesters.\n\nBeyond its social media platform, the NYPD has sought to tell its own story with sizzle reels, including a highly stylized video lionizing officers who cleared out protesters from a barricaded Columbia building, though one cop's weapon had been accidentally discharged.\n\nChell in a PIX11 interview last Friday was unapologetic about his X post on Cab\u00e1n, saying, \"I would rather not do that, but when you come out with a statement a day after what these cops did in the city, the night before, for these campuses, I will take a stand.\"\n\nCab\u00e1n stressed that Chell is not just an average New Yorker but a high-ranking NYPD leader, one using an official platform for political speech.\n\n\"If that person can incite violence against a duly elected official, what makes it so that every other rank-and-file officer can't do the same?\" she said in an interview. \"What does that say about the level of force and privilege and control that they think that they have over just regular, everyday citizens? That should be very scary to people.\"\n\nNYPD press representatives did not respond to POLITICO's requests for comment or to make Chell or other police leaders available for an interview.\n\nA 30-year veteran of the force, Chell wrote he won't be silenced in a lengthy X missive on Monday. \"We are going to tell our story, PROTECT OUR CITY, defend our cops, and push back against a disingenuous narrative from A SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO never want the NYPD to succeed,\" he posted.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Daily News reported that the chief of patrol had canceled a planned appearance at a political event for a Queens GOP club, a poster for which featured him in uniform.\n\nPublic defenders and watchdogs have said the NYPD's social media posts amount to an abuse of authority.\n\n\"They're trying to intimidate another separate, independent branch of government,\" Jennvine Wong, supervising attorney with the Legal Aid Society's Cop Accountability Project, said in an interview.\n\nChristopher Dunn, legal director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, called the social media posts \"petty, impulsive and retaliatory.\" Dunn added, \"It's clear the mayor, not only is he not going to check them, he is encouraging them.\"\n\nIn an illustration of Dunn's point, Adams last week called Chell a \"professional\" when a reporter described how the chief labeled campus protesters \"entitled, hateful students.\"\n\nThe full-throated backing of the NYPD reinforces Adams' evolution from police agitator to police defender.\n\nA co-founder of 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care, Adams had been a constant thorn in NYPD leaders' side when he was on the force. But as a 2021 candidate for mayor during the post-pandemic rise in certain types of crime, he emphasized keeping New Yorkers safe more than bringing the police force to heel.\n\nNow, Adams is, undeniably, a cop's mayor.\n\nHe has railed against bail reform measures and recidivism, vetoed legislation requiring police to document lower-level stops (a move the City Council overrode), backed a decision not to internally discipline the officers involved in Kawaski Trawick's killing and commended cops in riot gear sent in to quell pro-Palestinian protesters on New York City campuses.\n\nLast month, the mayor pushed out the interim chair of the Civilian Complaint Review Board charged with NYPD oversight, saying he wanted to make his own appointment rather than having a holdover in Arva Rice.\n\n\"I'm still an advocate, but I'm the mayor of the city. I have to maintain the right tone, not allow my emotions to get involved. I have to make sure that my police officers are able to do their job,\" Adams told reporters recently. \"I can't just criticize. I have to improve.\"\n\nAdams has, relatedly, displayed a visceral dislike of those on his political left who keep pressure on the NYPD, including elected officials hailing from parts of the city that are whiter, more affluent and more progressive.\n\nThe Rev. Herbert Daughtry, a longtime mentor who introduced Adams as a troubled youth to the NYPD, said in an interview, \"I know that he has compassion for and strives to understand and be fair to both the police and to the citizens. I think he's tried to do the right thing.\"\n\nClose Adams confidant Frank Carone applauded the mayor's near-unequivocal show of support for police.\n\n\"If I was still his chief of staff, I would say to him, 'Good for you,'\" Carone said in an interview. \"Every one of these agencies, they are made up of human beings who bleed, who have children, who have emotions, and they're allowed to defend themselves.\"\n\nThe Democratic mayor's vehemently pro-police posture hasn't gone unnoticed by police unions and Republicans.\n\n\"I'm grateful that Mayor Adams has bucked the radical progressive base of his party,\" said Rep.

Former President Donald Trump recently took a break from his hush money trial to visit a Harlem bodega where a worker was cleared in a fatal attack on a violent customer.\n\n\"We have to straighten out New York,\" Trump said during that appearance. \"If it goes any further out, it'll never come back.\"\n\nRichard Briffault, an ex-chairman of the city Conflicts of Interest Board, said Chell should've told the club to not use his police credentials in advertising the event, arguing it's incumbent on him as one of the NYPD's top officials to ensure the public isn't \"mislead to believe that his appearance has extra weight and has the endorsement of the Police Department.\"\n\n\"As an individual, you can engage in political activity, but using your title and your uniform, that's a misuse of your office,\" Briffault, who served as Conflicts of Interest Board chair between 2014 and 2020, said, noting that there are city ethics laws against such conduct, too.\n\nChell's appearance comes as he and other NYPD officials, including Deputy Commissioner Kaz Daughtry, are engaged in an increasingly aggressive effort on social media to challenge elected officials critical of them and Mayor Adams.\n\nDozens of local elected officials sent the mayor a letter last week urging him to punish Chell for recently attacking Democratic members of the City Council from his department social media accounts, including by urging his followers on X to vote if they dislike left-leaning Queens Councilwoman Tiffany Caban.\n\nAsked Tuesday about the pushback against Chell and Daughtry, the mayor stood by them.\n\n\"We are the kindest and the gentlest and the most loving Police Department on the globe,\" the mayor, a retired NYPD captain, told reporters. \"Chief Chell, Commissioner, Daughtry, etc., they are the leaders of the agency and they set the tone in defending police officers.\"\n\nThe mayor, a Democrat, didn't return a request for comment via his office Tuesday.\n\nIn a Monday post on X, Chell indicated he has no intention of dialing down his social media rhetoric.\n\n\"No matter what complaints we receive to silence us, it won't work!\" he posted. \"We are going to tell our story, PROTECT OUR CITY, defend our cops, and push back against a disingenuous narrative from A SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO never want the NYPD to succeed. We realize some people have not been prepared for our voice, but I suggest THEY get used to it.\"\n\nCarolyn Miller, the Conflicts of Interest Board's current executive director, declined to comment on specifics involving Chell, but said: \"Public servants are free to engage in political activities on their own time and using their own resources; they may not use City time or City resources to do so.\"\n\nRae Downes Koshetz, an ex-NYPD deputy commissioner of trials, said Chell's club appearance \"may not cross the line\" if the conversation is squarely focused on \"fighting crime.\"\n\n\"But if Republican candidates and policy proposals are being discussed and it looks as though NYPD executives are supporting Republicans, it could violate Department rules,\" she said.\n\nIn addition to Chell, the poster for Wednesday night's event -- which features a photo of a police car on fire -- says it'll feature remarks from Joe Imperatice and unidentified \"NYPD executives.\" It's unclear who the other NYPD officials are.\n\nImperatice is an NYPD sergeant and founder of Blue Lives Matter NYC, a pro-police nonprofit group, according to its website.\n\nImperatice notably isn't identified by his police rank in the poster or pictured in uniform.\n\nWilbur Chapman, a 43-year Police Department veteran who served in Chell's chief of patrol post between 1995 and 1998, said he can't \"remember any ranking officer speaking in front\" of a political club.\n\nGiven that Chell has raised hackles for weeks over his recent political engagement, Chapman faulted the mayor and NYPD Commissioner Ed Caban for not reprimanding him.\n\n\"Caban has failed to silence or chastise him,\" Chapman said. \"Does this chief think he can enter and be successful in the political arena? It looks like he is preparing for a new career.\"", "source": {"uri": "nydailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_sommerfeldt@nydailynews.com", "name":

And tensions have deepened over the NYPD's recent response to college protests and encampments.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Comptroller Brad Lander and Council Speaker Adrienne Adams belong to the politically and racially diverse coalition that views the X posts as part of a pattern of bullying.\n\nThe speaker in particular had urged the DOI to probe the NYPD's use of official social media accounts that she wrote \"can plainly be construed as intimidating and dangerous.\"\n\nNearly three dozen other elected officials sent their letter last Friday to the mayor saying an X post by Chell that lambasted City Council Member Tiffany Cab\u00e1n and told his followers \"you know what to do\" in voting her out veers into political territory, thereby violating a conflicts of interest rule. They denounced Chell's \"completely unacceptable, undemocratic, illegal, dangerous, and false attack.\"\n\nCab\u00e1n, a Queens democratic socialist, had been critiquing the police raid of Columbia University's pro-Palestinian protesters.\n\nBeyond its social media platform, the NYPD has sought to tell its own story with sizzle reels, including a highly stylized video lionizing officers who cleared out protesters from a barricaded Columbia building, though one cop's weapon had been accidentally discharged.\n\nChell in a PIX11 interview last Friday was unapologetic about his X post on Cab\u00e1n, saying, \"I would rather not do that, but when you come out with a statement a day after what these cops did in the city, the night before, for these campuses, I will take a stand.\"\n\nCab\u00e1n stressed that Chell is not just an average New Yorker but a high-ranking NYPD leader, one using an official platform for political speech.\n\n\"If that person can incite violence against a duly elected official, what makes it so that every other rank-and-file officer can't do the same?\" she said in an interview. \"What does that say about the level of force and privilege and control that they think that they have over just regular, everyday citizens? That should be very scary to people.\"\n\nNYPD press representatives did not respond to POLITICO's requests for comment or to make Chell or other police leaders available for an interview.\n\nA 30-year veteran of the force, Chell wrote he won't be silenced in a lengthy X missive on Monday. \"We are going to tell our story, PROTECT OUR CITY, defend our cops, and push back against a disingenuous narrative from A SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO never want the NYPD to succeed,\" he posted.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Daily News reported that the chief of patrol had canceled a planned appearance at a political event for a Queens GOP club, a poster for which featured him in uniform.\n\nPublic defenders and watchdogs have said the NYPD's social media posts amount to an abuse of authority.\n\n\"They're trying to intimidate another separate, independent branch of government,\" Jennvine Wong, supervising attorney with the Legal Aid Society's Cop Accountability Project, said in an interview.\n\nChristopher Dunn, legal director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, called the social media posts \"petty, impulsive and retaliatory.\" Dunn added, \"It's clear the mayor, not only is he not going to check them, he is encouraging them.\"\n\nIn an illustration of Dunn's point, Adams last week called Chell a \"professional\" when a reporter described how the chief labeled campus protesters \"entitled, hateful students.\"\n\nThe full-throated backing of the NYPD reinforces Adams' evolution from police agitator to police defender.\n\nA co-founder of 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care, Adams had been a constant thorn in NYPD leaders' side when he was on the force. But as a 2021 candidate for mayor during the post-pandemic rise in certain types of crime, he emphasized keeping New Yorkers safe more than bringing the police force to heel.\n\nNow, Adams is, undeniably, a cop's mayor.\n\nHe has railed against bail reform measures and recidivism, vetoed legislation requiring police to document lower-level stops (a move the City Council overrode), backed a decision not to internally discipline the officers involved in Kawaski Trawick's killing and commended cops in riot gear sent in to quell pro-Palestinian protesters on New York City campuses.\n\nLast month, the mayor pushed out the interim chair of the Civilian Complaint Review Board charged with NYPD oversight, saying he wanted to make his own appointment rather than having a holdover in Arva Rice.\n\n\"I'm still an advocate, but I'm the mayor of the city. I have to maintain the right tone, not allow my emotions to get involved. I have to make sure that my police officers are able to do their job,\" Adams told reporters recently. \"I can't just criticize. I have to improve.\"\n\nAdams has, relatedly, displayed a visceral dislike of those on his political left who keep pressure on the NYPD, including elected officials hailing from parts of the city that are whiter, more affluent and more progressive.\n\nThe Rev. Herbert Daughtry, a longtime mentor who introduced Adams as a troubled youth to the NYPD, said in an interview, \"I know that he has compassion for and strives to understand and be fair to both the police and to the citizens. I think he's tried to do the right thing.\"\n\nClose Adams confidant Frank Carone applauded the mayor's near-unequivocal show of support for police.\n\n\"If I was still his chief of staff, I would say to him, 'Good for you,'\" Carone said in an interview. \"Every one of these agencies, they are made up of human beings who bleed, who have children, who have emotions, and they're allowed to defend themselves.\"\n\nThe Democratic mayor's vehemently pro-police posture hasn't gone unnoticed by police unions and Republicans.\n\n\"I'm grateful that Mayor Adams has bucked the radical progressive base of his party,\" said Rep. Anthony D'Esposito, a former NYPD detective and Long Island Republican who even urged Adams' return to the GOP. \"I encourage the mayor to change his party registration.\"", "source": {"uri":

The NYPD's patrol guide prohibits police employees from engaging in political activities while in official capacity.\n\nIn addition the the requests for DOI involvement, dozens of local elected officials, including members of New York's congressional delegation, sent a letter to Mayor Adams last week demanding that he reprimand Chell for his recent social media posts.\n\nThe mayor has defended Chell against the pushback, saying the chief is a \"professional.\"\n\nThough he has vowed on X to continue to be outspoken, the NYPD press office said Tuesday that Chell had cancelled a planned Wednesday night appearance at a Republican Party event in Queens after The News inquired about it.\n\nThe mounting pressure on Chell and other NYPD officials comes amid stepped-up PR efforts on social media by department brass. While facing criticism on some fronts, the NYPD officials have been backed up by local Republicans.\n\n\"NYPD brass have every right to explain their policies and defend their positions as agency leadership on social media, especially against often baseless and politicized attacks from media and elected officials,\" Queens Councilwoman Vickie Paladino, one of the chamber's most conservative members, wrote on X in response to the DOI investigation announcement.\n\nLegal Aid's request for a probe also asked DOI to investigate whether the NYPD violated legal agreements by keeping \"dozens\" of pro-Palestine protesters detained for more than 24 hours after they were arrested last week during raids on the Columbia University and City College campuses, where demonstrators had set up encampments and occupied an academic building.\n\nThe NYPD has said it intervened and made arrests on the campuses after being asked to do so by school leaders.\n\nStruzzi said DOI's probe is, at least for now, only focused on the social media aspect.", "source": {"uri": "nydailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_sommerfeldt@nydailynews.com", "name": "Chris Sommerfeldt", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chell_(Portal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chell (Portal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Daily_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Daily News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York City Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Interior", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of the Interior"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrienne_Adams_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adrienne Adams (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Adams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inspector_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inspector general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queens", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Queens"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Queens"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiffany_Cab\u00e1n", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tiffany Cab\u00e1n"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vickie_Paladino", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vickie Paladino"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_College_of_New_York", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "City College of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Columbia University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AP24076591843868b_57a379.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551420", "eventUri": "eng-9551420", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

following a controversy over political comments he made online.\n\nThe Queens event that is scheduled to take place on Wednesday had been advertised in a poster identifying Chell by rank and featuring a photo of him in uniform.\n\nRecently, the police chief has faced backlash over comments he made that were directed at Tiffany Cab\u00e1n, a left-leaning city counselor whom he called a \"colossal disgrace,\" after she criticized the police for their alleged infiltration of the Pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University on Tuesday.\n\n\"Tuesday night's authoritarian conduct by Columbia University's administrators and Mayor Adams' NYPD were a colossal disgrace, a horrifying affront to democracy and free speech, and an abject failure of public safety,\" Cab\u00e1n said in a post on X.\n\nChell then responded directly to her post the next day.\n\n\"I started to read this garbage and quickly realized this is coming from a person who hates our city and certainly does not represent the great people of NYC,\" he wrote on the NYPD's official Chief of Patrol account. \"Tuesday night's criminal conduct by entitled unaccountable students and the support they received from Councilmember Tiffany Cab\u00e1n is a colossal disgrace.\"\n\nThe post was soon after deleted from X, however a spokesperson said it was taken down by mistake, and that Chell still stands by his statements.\n\nReportedly, the poster for the Whitestone event concerned some ex-NYPD officers and local government officials, who told the Daily News there could be legal issues in Chell being connected with the political organization as a the Chief of Police.\n\nWord of Chell's cancellation came from the NYPD press office shortly after a story about his planned raincheck was published on The News' website late on Tuesday.\n\n\"Chief John Chell will not be attending this event,\" the NYPD press office said.\n\nChell's canceled appearance comes as he and other NYPD officials, including Deputy Commissioner Kaz Daughtry, have been increasingly participating in political social media discourse.\n\nDozens of local officials sent Mayor Adams a letter this week urging him to penalize Chell for his targeted remarks toward Democratic/Liberal city council members online, including posting a poll for his followers to vote if they dislike Councilwoman Cab\u00e1n.\n\nYet when questioned about the pushback on Tuesday, the mayor said he supported Chell and Daughtry.", "source": {"uri": "lavocedinewyork.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "La Voce di New York"}, "authors": [],

But a spokeswoman for Mayor Adams, who has defended police brass amid the social media controversy, said DOI's probe should also scrutinize some of the politicians targeted by the NYPD officials online.\n\n\"It is clear that a small number of advocates and Council members -- who have gone unchallenged in using their social media to make disparaging comments against the hardworking public servants of our city -- only support speech that is politically convenient for them,\" said spokeswoman Kayla Mamelak. \"We hope this DOI review includes the unprofessional actions of the small number of Council members who have engaged in this behavior.\"\n\nThe request from Speaker Adams, submitted with DOI's inspector general for the NYPD on Friday, referenced recent posts on X from NYPD Chief of Patrol John Chell, Deputy Commissioner for Operations Kaz Daughtry and other department brass that she alleged violated \"city laws that prohibit the use of city resources for political purposes.\"\n\nThe posts in question include Chell dispatches from his official department X account in which he blasted progressive Queens Councilwoman Tiffany Caban's political views as \"garbage\" and urged his followers to \"vote the change you seek\" if they dislike her, too.\n\nLegal Aid's request for DOI intervention called the social media activities from the police officials \"a clear abuse of the NYPD's authority.\"\n\nCity ethics law bars police officials from using city resources, such as department social media accounts, for blatantly political purposes. The NYPD's patrol guide prohibits police employees from engaging in political activities while in official capacity.\n\nIn addition to the requests for DOI involvement, dozens of local elected officials, including members of New York's congressional delegation, sent a letter to Mayor Adams last week demanding that he reprimand Chell for his recent social media posts.\n\n...continued", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York City Police Department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_the_Interior", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of the Interior"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrienne_Adams_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adrienne Adams (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Daily_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Daily News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Adams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Legal aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chell_(Portal)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chell (Portal)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mayor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inspector_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inspector general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiffany_Cab\u00e1n", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tiffany Cab\u00e1n"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daughtry_(band)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Daughtry (band)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Progressivism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queens", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Queens"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Queens"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://resources.arcamax.com/newspics/288/28853/2885333.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9551420", "eventUri": "eng-9551420", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

He takes great pleasure in supporting apartheid Israel and he conducted police raids and intelligence operations against student protesters. The former cop shows where his loyalties still lie.\n\nJohn Chell is Chief of Patrol of the New York Police Department (NYPD). Chell has made news lately because of his threatening social media posts directed at a judge, journalists, and even City Council Members. His language was of such concern that the City Council Speaker requested that the Department of Investigation's Inspector General conduct an official investigation.\n\nChell is also a white police officer who shot and killed a Black man in 2008. He shot Ortanzso Bovell in the back, claiming that he did so accidentally. In usual fashion he was never charged with a crime and the case was quickly closed. But a jury in the civil case found his version of events not credible and the city paid $2 million to Bovell's family. Oddly, Chell ended up investigating the murder of Bovell's surviving brother in 2022.\n\nDespite being a killer, Chell continued to climb the ladder in successive mayoral administrations and he now has a prominent position in the department which is under the jurisdiction of a Black mayor, Eric Adams. A killer cop is one of Adams' right hand members of the police top brass.\n\nChell and his colleagues played a strange role in the crackdown on the college protesters who were demanding that their institutions divest from Israel. The NYPD didn't just round up hundreds of people and arrest them, they drove a smear campaign which was reported uncritically by corporate media so-called journalists who acted as their personal scribes.\n\nNew York City is the epicenter of the state repression being carried out against anti-Zionist protesters. Mayor Adams and the NYPD were very happy foot soldiers as the order came down to break up encampments at colleges and universities and to smear students and their supporters with heavy handed propaganda, outright lies, and even gunfire.\n\nOn the evening of Tuesday, April 30, the NYPD arrested hundreds of people at City College and at Columbia University. Students had taken over Hamilton Hall at Columbia and renamed it Hind's Hall in honor of six-year old Hind Rajab , who was killed by the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) along with members of her family and the medics who were trying to rescue her.\n\nStudents were in negotiations with Columbia administrators when the police broke in and arrested them, causing injuries in the process. At one point a gun shot was fired, we are told accidentally, but as there has been no investigation, that claim should not be blindly accepted.\n\nWhat followed was a stage managed orgy of lies and smears which may have been orchestrated by people affiliated with the Israeli government. Jonathan Conricus is a former IDF spokesperson who posted this interesting statement on twitter along with a photo of Chell and Kaz Daughtry, an NYPD Deputy Commissioner. \"Bumped into two of New York's finest @NYPDnews at @NewsNation tonight. They defend law and order on US campuses and returned the flag after pro-Hamas thugs replaced it with a Palestinian one. Desecrating American values or symbols cannot be tolerated!\"\n\nConricus refers to a video on the Twitter/X platform which showed police removing a Palestine flag at City College and replacing it with an American flag, \"old glory\" as they called it. It was just one of a series of spectacles which New Yorkers were subjected to after the campus raids. Daughtry made quite a show of claiming that students had books on terrorism . Of course he was referring to a text book on terrorism but the moment wasn't as funny as it may have first appeared. The IDF often claims to have found copies of Mein Kampf in Gaza in order to justify their war crimes. NYPD is taking its cues from the Israeli state.\n\nThe NYPD has no business examining what anyone reads. Mayor Adams played the good cop and bad cop routine by vilifying students but also claiming that they were being \"radicalized.\" \"This is a global problem that young people are being influenced by those who are professionals at radicalizing our children, and I'm not going to allow that to happen as the mayor of the City of New York.\"\n\nYoung people are radicalized by U.S. and Israeli war crimes. But regardless of how they come by their political beliefs neither the mayor or any other politician ought to concern themselves with anyone's ideology. Doing so is a textbook definition of fascism, a political system we're now told will only be avoided if Joe Biden remains in the White House. Of course his actions as supporter and protector of Israel and the efforts to silence anyone who speaks out against him are themselves fascistic. It seems that the U.S. will have fascism regardless of the electoral outcome in November.\n\nThe corporate media played a disgraceful role in this process. The NYPD said that the wife of a \"known terrorist\" was involved in the protest. It is assumed that they referred to Nahla Al-Arian who briefly visited the Columbia encampment and whose husband, Sami Al-Arian, was indicted but cleared of terrorism charges. The claim was repeated by countless news outlets without skepticism or investigation. That practice of repeating what officials say is also an example of fascism in action.\n\nNew York City is sadly not an outlier in this regard. In Los Angeles another former IDF operative admitted to running a \"quiet infiltration operation into the UCLA encampment\" before it was violently attacked by that city's police department. The NYPD has an Israeli office and police departments all over the country send officers to train in Israel.\n\nRepression is the order of the day in the U.S. Of course police have always had a license to kill Black people as in the case of John Chell. Now the state is in crisis as a restive population expresses anger that their public monies are sent to foment wars against Russia or China or that Israel kills with the backing of the U.S. The lies have been exposed in a system that has lost all legitimacy and brute force is now their only out. Students are the first victims, but anyone who takes a public stance against U.S. policy risks getting the same treatment. Fascism is already here and we must determine how to fight against it.", "source": {"uri": "eurasiareview.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eurasia Review"}, "authors": [{"uri":

And they bear the stamp of approval of the Democratic Party.\n\nNYPD Chief of Patrol John Chell launched a diatribe against Tiffany Cab\u00e1n, a City Council member from Astoria, Queens and member of the Democratic Socialists of America, after she criticized the police sieges at Columbia and City College, calling them an affront to democracy.\n\nThe police chief responded by attacking Cab\u00e1n on X as \"a person who hates our city and certainly does not represent the great people of NYC.\" Chell's comment, which was posted on an official NYPD social media account, implied that it is not elected officials who represent the people of New York, but his gang of deputized thugs.\n\nThe denunciation of political opposition to police state operations has been accompanied by a series of videos on social media, set to stirring music, mythologizing the raids at each campus. A video portraying the NYPD raid of City College, for instance, depicts officers tearing down a Palestinian flag and raising the Stars and Stripes, comparing themselves to a heroic army planting the flag after emerging victorious on a battlefield.\n\nThe videos present the encampments as having been organized and funded by \"outside agitators\" intent on radicalizing young people. NYPD Chief of Operations Kaz Daughtry, in a video of the NYU raid, refers to the supplies in the encampment and says:\n\nLook at the water. This is very, very organized. We got water. We got cups, coolers. Somebody is definitely behind this.... There is definitely a mastermind behind this.\n\nAlong similarly farcical lines, the NYPD and Mayor Adams have pointed to other \"evidence\" to justify their claims: an academic textbook (at a college campus!) on understanding terrorism; a poster with a safety tip to \"mask up - COVID is on the rise\" and a warning to \"not engage with cops, Zionists or the media;\" and a piece of paper with the words \"Death to America\" printed on it.\n\nChief Chell proclaimed on social media:\n\nThere is an unknown entity who is radicalizing our vulnerable students. Taking advantage of their young minds. As parents and Americans we must demand some answers! I can't speak for the rest of America, but in NYC we won't rest until we find out! We will broadcast what we see and find. We will use the might of our Intelligence Bureau and our federal partners to quite simply connect the dots. Follow the money!!!!!!\"\n\nAppearing Sunday on ABC's This Week, Mayor Adams defended the police raid of campuses and doubled down on the supposed threat from outsiders.\n\nAdams, referring to the student protesters, stressed the need to \"terminate what is perceived to be a threat.\" Picking up on the charge of nefarious outsiders influencing youth, he added:\n\nWhen you train people to do disruptive things, you are an agitator. So, I'm not trying to be politically correct. I'm trying to be correct for the city of New York as we make sure this continues to be safe.\n\nThe attempt to portray the student protests as the work of outside agitators while ignoring the impact of the policies of \"Genocide Joe\" and the war criminals in both political parties cannot be written off as merely a matter of stupidity.\n\nDemocrats as well as Republicans around the country have sought to undermine support for campus protesters using a variety of smears, including the lie that opposition to Zionism and the crimes of Israel is antisemitism.\n\nMoreover, the claims of a conspiracy to radicalize young Americans and the presence of shadowy financial backers behind the campus protests are themselves antisemitic dog whistles to the far-right.\n\nBehind the irrational character of the propaganda lies a grave danger. The explicit threat to go after political forces that are supposedly radicalizing youth is a call to further dismantle the First Amendment protections on assembly and speech, and to use the full force of the state against opponents of American imperialism. To the extent that forces within the state argue for a softer hand, the NYPD leadership is making it clear they will not be tolerated.\n\nThe NYPD, with approximately 36,000 officers, is a vast apparatus that has done more than dip its toes into illegal and unconstitutional activity. Last year, the city settled a lawsuit for a record $13.7 million over the brutal NYPD rampages in 2020, when police arrested thousands illegally and unleashed terror on protesters following the Minneapolis police murder of George Floyd.\n\nThe NYPD's vast spying capabilities include its counterterrorism unit, set up to hound and brutalize Muslims and Arab-Americans during the \"War on Terror.\" It is now directed at anti-genocide protesters.\n\nWhile the courts shut down some of its most egregious practices after a lawsuit, the NYPD has continued to expand its operations in coordination with the Israeli military. The department also deploys sophisticated tracking technologies, including drones, facial recognition software, and cell phone trackers, while skirting its legal responsibility to disclose their use.\n\nThe Adams administration has elevated figures like Chief Chell, a killer cop who fatally shot a man in the back in 2008, to the highest levels of the department. Chell was never criminally charged for his crime, but a civil jury rejected his claim of accidental fire and required the city to pay the victim's family $1.5 million.\n\nThe violent character of the NYPD and the scale of its repressive resources has been further exposed with more details of the police crackdowns emerging since last Tuesday. At Columbia, the police rampage resulted in the hospitalization of multiple students.\n\nOne protester was thrown down the steps. Another was observed by student journalists lying unconscious on the ground with officers hovering above. Others were kicked and hit by cops, leading to swollen faces and similar injuries.\n\nDuring the raid on Hamilton Hall, police in armor entered with guns drawn, using stun grenades. One officer fired his weapon, supposedly accidentally.\n\nPress, legal observers and students were removed from the area and ordered to \"shelter in place\" under threat of arrest, in order to bar them from documenting the actions of the police.\n\nThe violence was replicated at City College, where police violently attacked the student encampment, beating protesters and arresting more than 170. Some of the students have been charged with felony burglary, a major crime. Such charges are transparently aimed at intimidating protestors, especially at working class campuses like City College.\n\nThe fact that the assault on democratic rights and the rejection of civilian authority over the police is advancing under Democratic administrations at the city, state and federal levels is highly significant. The posture of the Democrats as the moderating force in American politics, restraining the violence of the police and acting as a bulwark against the threat of Donald Trump, is being exposed as a complete fraud. The Democrats are enabling fascism.\n\nThe crackdown on campus protests has also undermined the increasingly threadbare claims of the Democratic Socialists of America that the Democratic Party can be transformed into an instrument of progress. No amount of hypocritical statements by DSA politicians can conceal the fact that the organization is a faction of the Democratic Party, whose most prominent figure, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, is actively campaigning for the reelection of the person most responsible for Israel's genocide in Gaza and the accompanying attack on dissent in the US, Joe Biden.\n\nFor decades, the Democrats have joined with the Republicans in systematically building up police forces and arming them with military weaponry repurposed from America's wars in the Middle East. Now, under conditions of rapidly expanding global conflict and escalating class conflict at home, they are demonstrating why: Imperialist war abroad requires the suppression of opposition at home.\n\nRead moreUnited front of Democrats and Republicans back escalation of police attacks on campus protests against genocide in Gaza6 May 2024Democrats spearhead military-police crackdown in New

They're dangerous.", "body": "Fight disinformation: Sign up for the free Mother Jones Daily newsletter and follow the news that matters.\n\nShortly after dozens of New York City police officers gathered to clear out student protests over Israel's war in Gaza last week, the city's police force published something peculiar on social media: a highly-produced sizzle reel of the raids.\n\nOne of the videos -- posted less than 12 hours after the police raids on encampments at New York University and the New School last Friday -- showed officers standing at attention as John Chell, Chief of Patrol for the NYPD, instructing them to remain \"professional\" and \"firm, but fair.\" Chell reminds them: \"You're dealing with children or teenagers slash young adults that aren't at the mental capacity that you are at as professional police officers -- keep that in mind.\" Ominous music plays in the background as scenes of protesters wearing keffiyehs flicker across the screen. One shot showed a protester flipping off the camera.\n\nThe video was the second the NYPD released in as many days recapping their raids on student encampments at universities throughout the city. Both were roundly mocked on social media as \"weird\" and \"embarrassing.\"\n\nBut experts warn that these reels aren't just dumb. They are also insidious forms of police propaganda that serve to justify crackdowns, often forceful, on dissent while allowing police to portray themselves as heroic. And in the process, they omit inconvenient facts.\n\nTake, for example, the video I mentioned: Chell's message that protesters are \"children\" is a glaring departure from New York City Mayor Eric Adams' repeated insistence that officers were dealing with professional \"outside agitators.\" At the scene of the NYU encampment, the sizzle reel shows NYPD Deputy Commissioner of Operations Kaz Daughtry wandering around tents while suggesting that nefarious forces are at work. \"Look at the water -- this is very, very organized,\" Daughtry is heard saying, pointing to stacks of cases of plastic water bottles. \"We got water, we got supplies here, cups, coolers -- somebody is definitely behind this, somebody is definitely supplying these, there is definitely a mastermind behind this.\"\n\n\"This is copaganda, designed primarily to provide the mayor with political cover, but then also to show off the military might and alleged professionalism of the NYPD,\" Alex Vitale, a sociologist at Brooklyn College and coordinator of the Policing and Social Justice Project, told Mother Jones.\n\nThe second sizzle reel, roughly four minutes and 30 seconds long, was similarly problematic in its limited focus on police preparing for the raid at Columbia before putting student protesters at Hamilton Hall in zip ties and racing through the seemingly mostly empty building during the April 30 raid. Absent from the NYPD's reel was footage captured by students and journalists showing scenes of chaos, with police shoving students outside the building, one of whom tumbled down a flight of stairs. Nowhere in the video did it show police threatening arrest as they wielded batons. (A spokesperson for City Hall defended the NYPD's conduct in a statement to Mother Jones, alleging that so-called outside agitators were \"training students in unlawful protest tactics including barricading buildings and destruction of property.\")\n\nPerhaps most glaringly, the NYPD video also makes no mention of an officer accidentally firing a gun inside Hamilton Hall, a fact officials only acknowledged after the local news outlet The City asked police about it. A video posted on X by Columbia Students for Justice in Palestine the night of the raid shows the close-up of an officer on their phone at the scene, texting, \"thought we fucking shot someone.\" (The Manhattan District Attorney's Office is reviewing the incident, The City reported.)\n\nThese sizzle reels \"are certainly not a substitute for press scrutiny,\" Lauren Bonds, executive director of the National Police Accountability Project, told me. The fact that police are behind the videos, Bonds added, \"really undermines the whole perspective that a journalist would provide about what was going on.\" But she explained that a desire to control the narrative -- thereby preventing journalists from doing so -- is likely the driving force behind the videos, particularly as the NYPD have become increasingly hostile towards the press.\n\nSuch hostility was on display during the Columbia raid, as police were seen barring media from entering the campus and forcing student journalists to disperse. Controversial social media strategies by the police extend beyond student protests. Chell specifically has a history of using social media to go after individual reporters who are critical of police, a tactic the mayor has defended. In a since-deleted post, Chell also went after Councilmember Tiffany Cab\u00e1n for calling the encampment raids \"authoritarian,\" prompting more than 30 local elected officials to ask the mayor's office to formally reprimand Chell over his behavior on social media.\n\n\"There's a deep culture of defensiveness, not just within the NYPD but within policing in general,\" Vitale told me. \"They feel deeply aggrieved about any criticism, and they hold a grudge.\"\n\nBoth Vitale and Bonds also see another potential motivation behind the NYPD's sizzle reels: recruitment of more cops, an effort the NYPD and police departments across the country have been struggling with in recent years as public criticism of policing has mounted.\n\n\"It's kind of this good versus evil, larger than life dynamic,\" Bonds said of the sizzle reels. \"This would be a really great tool to for them if they wanted to make the profession of policing look more appealing.\"\n\nAs you might expect, the NYPD did not respond to a half dozen detailed questions from Mother Jones for this story.", "source": {"uri": "motherjones.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mother Jones"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Mayor Adams' office told them at the last minute not appear, according to multiple sources with knowledge of the situation.\n\nAround 7 a.m. Thursday, the mayor's office told the duo not to show up, fearing that the hearing would turn into a \"circus\" over their tweets that some Council members claim violate departmental policy, are inflammatory and potentially dangerous, the sources told the Daily News.\n\nNYPD Deputy Commissioner of Public Information Tarik Sheppard also skipped the hearing, though he'd been scheduled to attend, too.\n\nWhile the department has traditionally used social media to spread word about good arrests and tips on how to fight crime, Chell began using the platform to criticize judges he believed were soft on crime in March.\n\nSince then, he and Daughtry have been lobbing critical tweets against journalists, columnists and elected officials they disagree with. The department previously said it was \"correcting the narrative\" on social media, which they believe was skewed against police.\n\nSheppard and the mayor have supported the new social media tactic.\n\nAt the hearing, neither Police Commissioner Edward Caban nor Michael Gerber, the NYPD's Deputy Commissioner for Legal Matters, would comment on Chell and Daughtry's posts, citing an ongoing investigation into the matter by the city's Department of Investigation.\n\n\"It's inappropriate to comment as the investigation is ongoing\" Caban said.\n\nBut the DOI said there isn't a gag order on the investigation, so the department could have spoken about the posts if officials wished.\n\n\"DOI has not instructed NYPD to refrain from speaking about its social media use during our ongoing investigation,\" said DOI spokeswoman Diane Struzzi.\n\nCouncil Speaker Adrienne Adams said NYPD brass should have addressed the controversial posts.\n\n\"I find it very appropriate given what I'm looking at,\" she said at the hearing as she looked over posts on X including one put out by Chell that blasted progressive Councilwoman Tiffany Caban. In it, he rejected her comments against the NYPD's crackdown on Columbia University protesters as \"garbage\" and urged his followers to \"vote the change you seek\" if they dislike her, too.\n\n\"These posts can often convey inaccurate or misleading information and can potentially incite threats of violence,\" said Speaker Adams, who'd called for the DOI investigation.\n\n\"I use the word potentially with caution because they have in some cases incited threats of violence to individuals,\" she added. \"This conduct is dangerous, unethical, unprofessional because included in the department's mission is to preserve the peace, protect the people and reduce fear.\"\n\nCity ethics law bars police officials from using city resources such as department social media accounts for blatantly political purposes. The NYPD's patrol guide prohibits police employees from engaging in political activities while in an official capacity.\n\nGerber repeatedly declined to comment as Speaker Adams peppered the dias, which included First Deputy Commissioner Tania Kinsella and Chief of Department Jeffrey Maddrey, with questions about who was responsible for approving social media posts before they go online and if Chell and Daughtry's tweets are examples of an ongoing change in the department's social media policy.\n\n\"We are fully cooperative with (the DOI) investigation and its critical that the investigation be allowed to play out,\" Gerber said, adding that the department doesn't believe the post against Councilwoman Caban violated the law or the NYPD patrol guide or could be considered political activity.\n\n\"It's part of a context of a significant debate about the nature of public safety in the city, the role of the police department and the role of policing in New York City,\" Gerber said, refraining from elaborating further.\n\nCouncilwoman Caban of Queens, who attended the hearing, said Gerber and Commissioner Caban were hiding behind the DOI investigation.\n\n\"You could have and you should have answered, but you chose not to,\" she said.\n\nAn email to the department for comment was not immediately returned. The mayor's office did not return a request for comment, either.\n\nThe Legal Aid Society called the social media activities from the police officials \"a clear abuse of the NYPD's authority.\"\n\nIn addition to the requests for DOI involvement, dozens of local elected officials, including members of New York's congressional delegation, sent a letter to Mayor Adams last week demanding that he reprimand Chell for his recent social media posts.", "source": {"uri": "nydailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_sommerfeldt@nydailynews.com", "name":

He takes great pleasure in supporting apartheid Israel and he conducted police raids and intelligence operations against student protesters. The former cop shows where his loyalties still lie.\n\nThought we fucking shot someone.\n\n- Text sent by NYPD officer at Columbia University\n\nJohn Chell is Chief of Patrol of the New York Police Department (NYPD). Chell has made news lately because of his threatening social media posts directed at a judge, journalists, and even City Council Members. His language was of such concern that the City Council Speaker requested that the Department of Investigation's Inspector General conduct an official investigation.\n\nChell is also a white police officer who shot and killed a Black man in 2008. He shot Ortanzso Bovell in the back, claiming that he did so accidentally. In usual fashion he was never charged with a crime and the case was quickly closed. But a jury in the civil case found his version of events not credible and the city paid $2 million to Bovell's family. Oddly, Chell ended up investigating the murder of Bovell's surviving brother in 2022.\n\nDespite being a killer, Chell continued to climb the ladder in successive mayoral administrations and he now has a prominent position in the department which is under the jurisdiction of a Black mayor, Eric Adams. A killer cop is one of Adams' right hand members of the police top brass.\n\nChell and his colleagues played a strange role in the crackdown on the college protesters who were demanding that their institutions divest from Israel. The NYPD didn't just round up hundreds of people and arrest them, they drove a smear campaign which was reported uncritically by corporate media so-called journalists who acted as their personal scribes.\n\nNew York City is the epicenter of the state repression being carried out against anti-Zionist protesters. Mayor Adams and the NYPD were very happy foot soldiers as the order came down to break up encampments at colleges and universities and to smear students and their supporters with heavy handed propaganda, outright lies, and even gunfire.\n\nOn the evening of Tuesday, April 30, the NYPD arrested hundreds of people at City College and at Columbia University. Students had taken over Hamilton Hall at Columbia and renamed it Hind's Hall in honor of six-year old Hind Rajab , who was killed by the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) along with members of her family and the medics who were trying to rescue her.\n\nStudents were in negotiations with Columbia administrators when the police broke in and arrested them, causing injuries in the process. At one point a gun shot was fired, we are told accidentally, but as there has been no investigation, that claim should not be blindly accepted.\n\nWhat followed was a stage managed orgy of lies and smears which may have been orchestrated by people affiliated with the Israeli government. Jonathan Conricus is a former IDF spokesperson who posted this interesting statement on twitter along with a photo of Chell and Kaz Daughtry, an NYPD Deputy Commissioner.\n\nBumped into two of New York's finest @NYPDnews at @NewsNation tonight. They defend law and order on U.S. campuses and returned the flag after pro-Hamas thugs replaced it with a Palestinian one. Desecrating American values or symbols cannot be tolerated!\n\nConricus refers to a video on the Twitter/X platform which showed police removing a Palestine flag at City College and replacing it with an American flag, \"old glory\" as they called it. It was just one of a series of spectacles which New Yorkers were subjected to after the campus raids. Daughtry made quite a show of claiming that students had books on terrorism . Of course he was referring to a text book on terrorism but the moment wasn't as funny as it may have first appeared. The IDF often claims to have found copies of Mein Kampf in Gaza in order to justify their war crimes. NYPD is taking its cues from the Israeli state.\n\nThe NYPD has no business examining what anyone reads. Mayor Adams played the good cop and bad cop routine by vilifying students but also claiming that they were being \"radicalized.\"\n\nThis is a global problem that young people are being influenced by those who are professionals at radicalizing our children, and I'm not going to allow that to happen as the mayor of the City of New York.\n\nYoung people are radicalized by U.S. and Israeli war crimes. But regardless of how they come by their political beliefs neither the mayor or any other politician ought to concern themselves with anyone's ideology. Doing so is a textbook definition of fascism, a political system we're now told will only be avoided if Joe Biden remains in the white house. Of course his actions as supporter and protector of Israel and the efforts to silence anyone who speaks out against him are themselves fascistic. It seems that the U.S. will have fascism regardless of the electoral outcome in November.\n\nThe corporate media played a disgraceful role in this process. The NYPD said that the wife of a \"known terrorist\" was involved in the protest. It is assumed that they referred to Nahla Al-Arian who briefly visited the Columbia encampment and whose husband, Sami Al-Arian, was indicted but cleared of terrorism charges. The claim was repeated by countless news outlets without skepticism or investigation. That practice of repeating what officials say is also an example of fascism in action.\n\nNew York City is sadly not an outlier in this regard. In Los Angeles another former IDF operative admitted to running a \"quiet infiltration operation into the UCLA encampment\" before it was violently attacked by that city's police department. The NYPD has an Israeli office and police departments all over the country send officers to train in Israel.\n\nRepression is the order of the day in the U.S. Of course police have always had a license to kill Black people as in the case of John Chell. Now the state is in crisis as a restive population expresses anger that their public monies are sent to foment wars against Russia or China or that Israel kills with the backing of the U.S. The lies have been exposed in a system that has lost all legitimacy and brute force is now their only out. Students are the first victims, but anyone who takes a public stance against U.S. policy risks getting the same treatment. Fascism is already here and we must determine how to fight against it.", "source": {"uri": "mronline.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "MR Online"}, "authors": [{"uri": "paul_burkett@mronline.org",

A spokesperson for the Mayor's office indicated a desire for the DOI's probe to also examine the actions of some politicians who have targeted the NYPD online.\n\nThis suggests the Mayor may be aiming for a solution that ensures both the NYPD's right to respond to criticism and the maintenance of a professional online presence that fosters public trust.\n\nThe investigation into the NYPD's social media practices is not happening in isolation.

'unprofessional' social media...", "body": "City Council leaders grilled the NYPD Thursday over \"dangerous, unethical, unprofessional\" social media posts by top officials -- as well as $168 million in unplanned overtime costs from policing raging anti-Israel protests and migrant shelters.\n\nThe heated proceedings played out after the city Department of Investigation opened a probe into posts by department brass at the request of Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and the Legal Aid Society.\n\n\"These posts can often convey inaccurate or misleading information and could potentially incite threats of violence,\" Adams, no relation to Mayor Eric Adams, said.\n\n\"This conduct is dangerous, unethical, unprofessional because included in the department's mission is to preserve peace, protect the people and reduce fear at the preliminary budget.\"\n\nThe posts at issue include NYPD Chief of Patrol John Chell's controversial jab at Queens Councilwoman Tiffany Caban calling her online criticism of the department \"garbage.\"\n\nThe council speaker said Chell's since-deleted retort to Caban's critique of a city agency was potentially \"a horrifying affront to democracy\" that could \"be misinterpreted and lead to threats.\"\n\nThe NYPD has more than 250 social media accounts that department higher-ups, including precinct commanders, have control of -- which the council said are intended to inform the public, not inflame tensions with elected officials.\n\nChell and other department brass have used the online platform as a weapon to fight back against perceived anti-cop policies pushed by the council, including the controversial \"How Many Stops\" initiative that bogged cops down in excessive paperwork.\n\n\"I started to read this garbage and quickly realized this is coming from a person who hates our city and certainly does not represent the great people of NYC,\" Chell wrote in his missive about Caban, who had criticized the NYPD's response to anti-Israeli demonstrators on the Columbia University campus, when cops in riot gear cleared students and arrested more than 100.\n\n\"Last night's authoritarian conduct by Columbia University administrators and Mayor Adams' NYPD were a colossal disgrace, a horrifying affront to democracy and free speech,\" Caban's post on X read. \"And an abject failure of public safety.\"\n\nAdams interrogated NYPD Deputy Commissioner of Legal Matters Michael Gerber about Chell's response during a blistering back-and-forth at the council budget hearing.\n\n\"Do you feel the post was appropriate?\" she asked.\n\nGerber repeatedly noted it was \"critical\" that the DOI probe into the posts be allowed to play out, and said the department was being \"fully cooperative\" with the investigation.\n\n\"Do you feel the post was appropriate?\" Adams pressed.\n\n\"I'm gonna be the arbitrator of discipline,\" Gerber answered. \"So at this time, I cannot comment.\"\n\nAdams also took the department to task over the NYPD overtime tab.\n\nAs of March, the department spent about $788 million in overtime during the 2024 fiscal year -- almost $271 million over budget, the council leader said.\n\n\"Repeated overspending beyond the allocated budget raises concerns about agency and fiscal management and accurate budgeting,\" Adams said.\n\nPolice Commissioner Edward Caban said NYPD spending was down 8% from pre-pandemic years, and attributed $160 million in additional overtime primarily to \"migrant shelter security, enhanced translation and deployment of protests.\"\n\n\"These are unprecedented events, which no one could have planned for,\" the top cop said. \"And as a result, spending for these activities is outside of our adopted financial plan baseline.\"", "source": {"uri": "nypost.com",

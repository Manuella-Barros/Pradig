{"id": 243349546, "title": "Ask Amy: What can go wrong at a wedding? Here\u2019s a list", "text": "Dear Readers: With wedding season upon us, I\u2019m re-running a favorite column from 2021 devoted to wedding mishaps \u2014 all sent in by readers. Perhaps reading about some of the things that can go wrong at a wedding will inspire people to avoid these pitfalls. And if these incidents can\u2019t be avoided, marrying couples can try to embrace them and laugh about it all later. So take your seat at the \u201csingles\u201d table \u2014 and enjoy! Dear Amy: My brother got married at our house in front of a bay window with a magnificent view of the Concord River. Halfway through the ceremony, his stoner friend from high school arrived in a canoe, stumbled ashore, and wobbled his way up the yard in full view of the guests. Hilarious backdrop! \u2013 I Was Sober Dear Amy: My long-ago boyfriend invited me as his \u201cplus one.\u201d Once we got there it was obvious that he was invited solo, as there was no table card for me. My father once said, \u201cThere\u2019s always someone at a wedding who shouldn\u2019t be there.\u201d In that instance it was me! \u2013 Plus One Dear Amy: My two brothers-in-law offered to be our photographers for our wedding. My sisters had each just had their firstborns. There were a few photos of my husband and me, but most were of their little darlings. The other photos were of my husband\u2019s buxom cousin in her revealing cleavage. Sigh. \u2013 Busted Dear Amy: The first song at my uncle\u2019s second wedding: David Lee Roth\u2019s cover of \u201cJust a Gigolo.\u201d And the bride\u2019s uncle later had a coronary while dancing the polka. \u2013 Danced Out Dear Amy: My friend and his date \u201cSheila\u201d were heavily making out on the dance floor; Sheila later hit on multiple other (married) guests and then told my mom how hot she thought the groom was. My mom replied: \u201cYes, that\u2019s my new son-in-law.\u201d \u2013 Good Times Dear Amy: An unsupervised child at my wedding was running around and ran into a door. Got a nosebleed. The mother went to my father (father of the bride) to demand the venue\u2019s wedding coordinator be fired for negligence. They stormed out when my dad refused. (The child was fine, by the way!) \u2013 Still Married Dear Amy: We were letting immediate family members know the date we\u2019d finally chosen for our wedding before booking vendors. My parents said, \u201c...but we have Notre Dame football tickets that day.\u201d We tried other dates, but they all interfered with their football ticket schedule. We don\u2019t talk anymore. \u2013 Fighting Irish Dear Amy: I locked the keys in a running limo in front of the church (in the \u201880s), which meant needing a phone book and the minister\u2019s office phone to frantically find a locksmith. \u2013 Locked Out Dear Amy: I was a member of a flash mob at the reception. Short version of the story: Another member of the mob couldn\u2019t kick as high as he thought he could (due to overly tight suit pants), and ended up kicking the bride in the head. Everyone was fine. \u2013 We Have Video! Dear Amy: In my 20s I was in a friend\u2019s wedding. A bunch of us rented a room together. I woke up in the middle of the night with a pounding headache, so I drank a glass of water. It was a groomsman\u2019s contact lens solution \u2014 and his lenses. \u2013 Tastebuds are 20/20 Dear Amy: Our rabbi thought our NOON wedding was at 6 p.m. Luckily, one of our guests found a replacement rabbi who stopped by to marry us on his way to a funeral he was officiating. Our marriage has lasted for 28 years. \u2013 Happy it Took Dear Amy: My college roommate wanted a child-free wedding, but her family pitched a fit that children wouldn\u2019t be included. At the reception, one niece ran circles around the room, and then vomited on herself on the dais at the front of the room during the meal. \u2013 I Won\u2019t Have What She\u2019s Having Dear Amy: The bride\u2019s mom caught my buddy and his date in a delicate position in the bridal suite (and neither were in the wedding party). \u2013 Can\u2019t Unsee That Dear Amy: My best friend\u2019s (drunk) uncle officiated at his wedding. Drunk Uncle cleared his throat, produced a page he\u2019d ripped out of his hotel room\u2019s Bible, and began. \u2013 Gideon\u2019s Way Dear Amy: On the receiving line at my wedding, one of the guests told me, \u201cIf I had known you didn\u2019t have a nice dress, I would have lent you mine.\u201d \u2013 Dressed Down Check out prior Ask Amy columns (You can email Amy Dickinson at askamy@amydickinson.com or send a letter to Ask Amy, P.O.

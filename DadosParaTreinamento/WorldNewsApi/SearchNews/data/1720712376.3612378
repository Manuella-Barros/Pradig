{"id": 231991628, "title": "Ian Wright hits out at media scapegoating Black England players and warns of \u2018gaslighting\u2019", "text": "Ian Wright has called out the media for scapegoating England\u2019s Black players and warned that they will try to gaslight the nation into believing it\u2019s not happening. England suffered a disappointing 1-0 defeat to Iceland in their final Euro 2024 warm-up match at Wembley on Friday evening as a sub-par performance saw Gareth Southgate\u2019s men head into the tournament in Germany on a low note. Social media users then pointed out that negative media coverage of the loss and the images accompanying the articles often seemed to centre the team\u2019s Black stars. The following day\u2019s back pages of The Sun and The Daily Star, as well as a player ratings piece by The Telegraph and the live blog on the BBC Sport website all featured Bukayo Saka as a main picture, despite the attacker only coming off the bench in the 65th minute, long after England conceded the only goal of the game. Ex-England international and current pundit Wright weighed in on the claims, suggesting certain players were \u201cbeing set up to be the face of defeat\u201d and urged positivity in the face of negative coverage. Wright said on Twitter/X: \u201cNow more than ever let\u2019s get behind & support these young people. We can all see what\u2019s happening & who\u2019s being set up to be the face of defeat. \u201cWe are going to be gas lit with explanations & justifications, but those deciding who goes on the back pages know what they\u2019re doing. Let\u2019s keep our energy focused on giving these players pure love & support throughout the tournament.\u201d F1 star Lewis Hamilton, who has been a consistently outspoken voice in the fight against racism, also appeared to back Wright\u2019s critique by sharing to his Instagram Story a post demanding accountability from the English media. The initial post from Versus that Hamilon reposted said: \u201cWe need to hold the English media accountable for systemically vilifying Black players. The constant scapegoating of Black players needs to stop. This endemic racial discrimination has no place in football, yet countless news outlets suggest otherwise.\u201d Saka was among a number of England players who were racially abused online following the Three Lions\u2019s penalty shootout defeat to Italy in the final of the previous Euros in 2021. Within minutes of his penalty being saved in the shootout, Saka received abuse on his Instagram account, which was flooded with monkey emojis. Police made 11 arrests following the final, with one individual sentenced to 10 weeks in prison. Ahead of Euro 2024, England players have been reassured by police that anyone who racially abuses them online will be prosecuted. While Southgate\u2019s squad have been made aware of all the relevant steps and tools on social media such as filters, they have also been talked through the reporting process and shown examples of how people have been prosecuted under the Malicious Communications Act. The clear message is that online abusers won\u2019t be able to \u201chide behind keyboards\u201d \u2013 even if abroad.", "summary": "<p>Wright commented on Bukayo Saka being set up as \u2018the face of defeat\u2019 by certain media outlets following England\u2019s defeat to Iceland and F1 star Lewis Hamilton appeared to back his claim </p>", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/ian-wright-england-black-players-racism-euro-2024-b2559401.html", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/05/22/09/GettyImages-1484849166.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-09 14:01:34", "author": "Luke Baker", "authors": ["Luke Baker"], "language": "en", "catgory": "sports", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.048}

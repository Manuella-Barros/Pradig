{"id": 231988684, "title": "Netanyahu Condemns UN Decision to Label Israeli Military a Child-Harming Entity", "text": "The United Nations is placing the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on a list of offenders that have committed violations against children, a decision the Israeli government denounced as \u201cabsurd\u201d and \u201cshameful.\u201d Stephane Dujarric, a spokesperson for U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, said Israel will be added to the list as part of the international organization\u2019s annual report on Children and Armed Conflict. The report is set to be presented to the U.N. Security Council on June 14 and officially published on June 18. It is reported that the list will also include Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the two Gaza-based terrorist groups responsible for last October\u2019s mass killing and kidnapping of civilians in southern Israel. Mr. Dujarric declined to confirm or deny those reports. Gilad Erdan, Israel\u2019s ambassador who last month destroyed a copy of U.N. charter with a tiny shredder in front of the U.N. General Assembly, described the move as \u201cshameful.\u201d \u201cThis immoral decision will only aid the terrorist and reward Hamas,\u201d he said in the video, claiming that the IDF is \u201cthe most moral army in the world.\u201d The ambassador accused the top U.N. official of \u201cincentivizing\u201d Hamas fighters to keep embedding themselves in civilian facilities. \u201cThis shameful decision will only give Hamas hope to survive and will only extend the war and suffering.\u201d Mr. Dujarric criticized Mr. Erdan\u2019s social media response. \u201cAmbassador Erdan\u2019s video recording of that phone call and the partial release of that recording on Twitter, is shocking and unacceptable and, frankly, something that I\u2019ve never seen in my 24 years serving this organization,\u201d he told reporters on June 7. Echoing Mr. Erdan\u2019s claims, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wrote on X that the IDF \u201cis the most moral military in the world.\u201d \u201cThe U.N. put itself today on history\u2019s black list when it adopted the absurd claims of Hamas,\u201d he wrote. In defense of the upcoming children-in-war-zone report, Mr. Dujarric said it is based on a \u201cvery well-established, transparent methodology.\u201d \u201cTaking a step back, I think the secretary-general has been very clear in speaking out since 7 October on issues of violations of international law, on issues of violation of human rights, which includes the condemning of the terror attacks by Hamas,\u201d he said. Mr. Dujarric didn\u2019t outline the specific violations the IDF is accused of committing.", "summary": "The list is part of a report set to be presented at the U.N.

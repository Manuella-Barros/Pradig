A source close to the Biden family revealed that Obama views Harris as incompetent, particularly due to her handling of immigration and other key topics. Despite Biden's endorsement of Harris following his withdrawal from the race, Obama is reportedly frustrated and had preferred Senator Mark Kelly as a candidate.Former President Barack Obama has not yet endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for the US presidential race. According to a source close to the Biden family, Obama has reservations about Harris's ability to defeat Republican candidate Donald Trump. \"Obama's very upset because he knows she can't win,\" the source told the New York Post.\n\nConcerns Over Harris's Competency\n\nThe Biden family source further elaborated, \"Obama knows she's just incompetent -- the border czar who's never visited the border, advocating that all migrants should have health insurance. She's not equipped to navigate the challenges ahead.\" The source highlighted that Harris's stance on critical issues could lead to potential missteps, particularly in debates against Trump on topics such as Israel, Palestine, and Ukraine.\n\nBiden's Exit and Immediate Endorsement\n\nJoe Biden, 81, unexpectedly withdrew from the presidential race and immediately endorsed Harris. This move prompted most Democratic leaders to support her candidacy. However, Obama's lack of endorsement has created a notable divide. The turning point for Biden came after a widely criticized debate performance against Trump last month. The source revealed that Obama had initially hoped to facilitate Biden's exit through an article by George Clooney urging Biden to step aside.\n\nObama's Preferred Candidate\n\nAccording to the New York Post, Obama preferred Arizona Senator Mark Kelly as a potential candidate for the Democratic National Convention. The source mentioned, \"Obama is furious that things haven't gone his way, which is why he hasn't joined the Democratic Party's support for Harris.\" Former Democratic governor Rod Blagojevich, now a Trump supporter, claimed that without Obama's influence, Biden would likely still be the Democratic nominee.\n\nSpeculation About Michelle Obama\n\nBefore Biden's withdrawal, US Senator Ted Cruz speculated that former First Lady Michelle Obama might replace him. Cruz stated, \"The odds are north of 80% that the Democratic Party will remove Joe Biden from the ticket and replace him with Michelle Obama because Biden did so disastrously badly (in the debate) that Democrats across the country are in utter freefall and complete panic.\" However, Michelle Obama has not expressed any interest in joining the race.\n\nNBC News Report and Future Plans\n\nDespite the controversy, NBC News reported that Obama plans to endorse Harris soon. \"Obama privately has fully supported Harris' candidacy and has been in regular contact with her,\" the report stated, citing people familiar with the discussions. The report also noted that aides to Obama and Harris have discussed arranging joint campaign trail appearances, though no dates have been set.\n\nDemocratic National Convention Dynamics\n\nOn Monday, Kamala Harris secured support from a majority of delegates to the Democratic National Convention, ensuring her position as the party's nominee. An Associated Press survey showed Harris had the backing of 2,538 delegates, surpassing the 1,976 needed. Democratic National Committee Chairman Jaime Harrison confirmed that the party would finalize its presidential nominee by August 7. Amid questions about his age and health, Biden pledged to remain in office until his term ends on January 20, 2025.\n\nObama's reluctance to endorse Harris has introduced uncertainty and speculation within the Democratic Party. As the race progresses, the party faces internal challenges and the looming question of whether Harris can effectively contest against Trump.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Family of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mark Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michelle Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_Blagojevich", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rod Blagojevich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Cruz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ted Cruz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaime_Harrison", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaime Harrison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-112007491,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-1592291,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751667", "eventUri": "eng-9751667", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-07", "textStart": 3680, "textEnd": 3688}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-01-", "textStart": 3788, "textEnd": 3798}], "sentiment": -0.192156862745098, "wgt": 207, "relevance": 1}

Obama's senior adviser Eric Schultz told NBC the former President 'looks forward to helping Democrats up and down the ballot make the case to voters this fall'.\n\nHe said Obama feels he can help 'unify his party' and plans to use a strategy focused on 'driving impact, especially where and when his voice can move the needle'. Obama and Harris have known each other for several years, with the Vice President having been an early supporter of his 2008 presidential campaign.\n\nHarris was also given a speaking role at his 2012 nominating convention. Obama has also previously backed Harris, throwing his support behind both her campaigns for attorney general in California and her bid for the Senate in 2016.

The two have close ties, but Obama is yet to publicly endorse Harris. File image/AFP\n\n\"She's tough; she's capable. She's been an incredible partner to me and a leader for our country.\"\n\nOn Wednesday night, US President Joe Biden sitting at the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office in the White House said these words about his vice president and possible Democratic nominee for the presidential election, Kamala Harris.\n\nIt's a loud and emphatic endorsement of 59-year-old Harris. But Biden's endorsement isn't the only one she has received since the US president announced last Sunday that he was dropping out of the race. Kamala Harris has received the backing of Democrats from former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton to progressives like Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Days after Biden's bombshell, Nancy Pelosi, the former House Speaker, also endorsed Harris, expressing \"full confidence\" in the vice president's bid to win the election in November. Even Hollywood superstar George Clooney has backed the current vice president.\n\nBut amid the many voices and endorsements for Vice President Kamala Harris, one remains mum. And the silence is telling. That voice belongs to former US President Barack Obama.\n\nWhy is Barack Obama mum?\n\nNotably, Obama, the former president of the US, was reportedly one of the foremost voices for Biden to drop out of the US presidential race following the 81-year-old's debate debacle. And it seems that the pressure Obama exerted was able to make Biden change his mind.\n\nLast Sunday (July 21), the US president announced from Delaware, while he was self-isolating due to COVID-19, that he was stepping down and endorsed his Vice President Kamala Harris to take over in the race.\n\nShortly later, Obama in a post on Medium wrote: \"Joe Biden has been one of America's most consequential presidents, as well as a dear friend and partner to me. Today, we've also been reminded -- again -- that he's a patriot of the highest order.\"\n\nIn his piece, he wrote why he chose Biden to be his running mate in 2008, saying at the time that he wanted an older, more experienced running mate with \"grey in his hair\" and limited future presidential ambitions.\n\nAt the end of his post, he wrote: \"We will be navigating uncharted waters in the days ahead. But I have extraordinary confidence that the leaders of our party will be able to create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges. I believe that Joe Biden's vision of a generous, prosperous, and united America that provides opportunity for everyone will be on full display at the Democratic Convention in August. And I expect that every single one of us is prepared to carry that message of hope and progress forward into November and beyond.\"\n\nObama's message had no mention of Kamala Harris. And to date, he hasn't spoken publicly on Harris, her ability to run and if she is a viable candidate.\n\nMany, especially among the Republicans, believe it's because Obama doesn't think the 59-year-old has what it takes to beat Donald Trump.\n\nA New York Post citing a Biden family source said: \"Obama's very upset because he knows she can't win.\"\n\n\"Obama knows she's just incompetent -- the border czar who never visited the border, saying that all migrants should have health insurance. She cannot navigate the landmines that are ahead of her.\"\n\n\"Obama knew this was going to happen, Joe knew this was going to happen. Now she is going to have to answer real questions,\" said the source to the Post, referring to Harris' ability to debate Trump if she is chosen as the Democratic Party's nominee.\n\nThe report adds that Obama, who has quit politics but is still an influential voice, wanted Arizona senator and former astronaut Mark Kelly to be the Democrats' top choice. However, things haven't gone Obama's way and there are reports that Kelly might be chosen as Harris' running mate.\n\nBut that's one reason being given for Obama's silence.\n\nHowever, people in the know say that Obama not endorsing Harris immediately is a mark of respect to Biden. The New York Times reports that Biden has never fully forgiven Obama for quietly backing former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the 2016 campaign. Moreover, he wasn't too when Obama told him that he should consider sitting out 2020.\n\nFor this reason, a White House official speaking to the New York Times said, \"Obama wanted Sunday to be about Biden, a celebration of his accomplishments -- and does not feel pressured to act hastily.\"\n\nA political commentator also noted, \"I would guess he (Obama) wants to wait to let things shake out on their own rather than being accused of anointing someone or orchestrating things.\"\n\nTexas-based political consultant David Logan also shared similar views. Speaking to The Independent, he said that Obama not immediately endorsing her was just a sign that he was endorsing the correct political process. \"With the Democratic convention due to take place in his hometown of Chicago, I'm sure he's just letting the party do its thing; letting those who have been elected run the party.\"\n\nAn NBC News report, however, states that Obama's endorsement of Harris will be announced soon. The report said that the two leaders -- Harris and Obama -- have been in close touch since she announced her presidential candidacy, having multiple conversations this week as she kicks off her campaign.\n\nWho has endorsed Harris?\n\nWhile a public endorsement from Obama is still to happen, Kamala Harris, raised by her single Indian mother, has received backing from many other Democrats as well as donors and celebrities.\n\nMajor Democratic fundraiser George Clooney has lent his support to Harris and has promised to \"do whatever we can to support Vice President Harris\". Singers Charli XCX and Olivia Rodrigo have also raised their voice in support of the vice president.\n\nMajor Democratic leaders in Congress, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, also announced their endorsement at a news conference on Tuesday, with Schumer saying they'd held off for a few days to give Harris a chance to build support \"from the grassroots\".\n\n\"Vice President Harris has done a truly impressive job securing the majority of delegates needed to win the Democratic Party's nomination,\" Schumer said. \"Democrats are moving forward stronger and more united than ever before.\"\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom, whose name had been floated as a potential candidate himself, threw his support behind Harris. \"Tough. Fearless. Tenacious. With our democracy at stake and our future on the line, no one is better to prosecute the case against Donald Trump' s dark vision and guide our country in a healthier direction than America's Vice President, @KamalaHarris,\" Newsom posted on social media.\n\nHarris has already secured the support of a majority of Democratic delegates to become the party's nominee for president. A survey by the Associated Press on Monday evening said she had received the endorsement of more than the 1,976 delegates needed to win the nomination in the first round of voting. This means that Harris is on course to be crowned the party's representative and take on Donald Trump in November's presidential election.\n\nWho is yet to endorse Harris?\n\nApart from Obama, there are still some who haven't endorsed Harris. The most notable of them is former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who is a major Democratic donor. On Monday, he wrote that choosing a candidate is \"too important to rush, because the election is too important to lose\".\n\nRepresentative Rashida Tlaib of Michigan has also not extended her support to the American vice president. She said that she supports a \"transparent democratic process at an open convention next month,\" according to The Intercept.\n\nThe Democratic National Convention where the party's official nominee will be announced will kick off next month -- from August 19 through August 22 in Chicago. And we guarantee that it's going to be a closely watched event.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

While other party leaders have stepped forward to publicly back her, he has so far kept his support private.\n\nThe people familiar with the discussions didn't know the precise timing of his endorsement. One of them said Obama didn't want it to overshadow President Joe Biden's moment, particularly his Oval Office address to the nation Wednesday night.\n\nAnother person familiar with the discussions said Obama and Harris, who is seeking to maintain the momentum her campaign has enjoyed among Democrats since she entered the race, wanted his endorsement to stand as its own moment.\n\nAides to Obama and Harris also have discussed arranging for the two of them to appear together on the campaign trail, though no date has been set, three of the people familiar with the discussions said.\n\nMichelle Obama also supports Harris' candidacy, two people familiar with the matter said.\n\n\"President Obama looks forward to helping Democrats up and down the ballot make the case to voters this fall,\" said Eric Schultz, a senior adviser to Obama. \"Our strategy will be based on driving impact, especially where and when his voice can move the needle.\"\n\nDuring their conversations in recent days, Obama has offered Harris his counsel on setting up a campaign and on other aspects of mounting a successful bid for the White House, which he has done twice, the people familiar with their discussions said.\n\nFrom Obama's perspective, Harris has taken on a lot in a very short time, and he sees himself as a resource and a sounding board for her as she navigates a high-stakes campaign with about just 100 days until Election Day, according to two of the people familiar with their discussions.\n\nObama views his utility in the campaign as helping unify his party and moving Democrats forward, and he's expected to be a fixture on the campaign trail this fall.\n\nThe only publicly known phone call between Obama and Harris took place Sunday, when Biden announced he was ending his re-election campaign and swiftly endorsed Harris.\n\nObama issued a statement Sunday praising Biden and supporting a process to select a new Democratic nominee, but he didn't endorse Harris.\n\n\"We will be navigating uncharted waters in the days ahead,\" Obama said in the statement. \"But I have extraordinary confidence that the leaders of our party will be able to create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges.\"\n\nHarris then quickly received endorsements from across the country, and no one has stepped up to challenge her for the nomination.\n\nSince Biden's June 27 debate performance, Obama had privately expressed concerns about his former vice president's ability to defeat former President Donald Trump in November, NBC News has reported.

Democrats nationwide soon united in their calls for Harris to become the party's nominee as they square up for another election battle against former President Donald Trump.\n\nThough Democratic leaders such as Sen. Chuck Schumer and Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, as well as the Clintons and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have offered Harris their endorsements, Obama has remained mum.\n\n\"Michelle and I just want to express our love and gratitude to Joe and Jill for leading us so ably and courageously during these perilous times\u200a -- \u200aand for their commitment to the ideals of freedom and equality that this country was founded on,\" Obama wrote in his statement following Biden bowing out, which did not including mentioning Harris.\n\nSince leaving the Oval Office, Obama has typically held his endorsement card close to his chest. He endorsed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in June of 2016, while his endorsement of Biden in 2020 was only made days ahead of the DNC.\n\nObama remained coy for a long while during the 2020 election about whom he would endorse, saying he would not back anyone during the primary. As Democratic contenders such as Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders dropped out of the primary race and cleared a path for Biden, however, Obama finally endorsed his former veep in August of that year.\n\nHarris was among the first elected Democrats in the nation to endorse Obama's first run for president in the 2008 election, snubbing Hillary Clinton in favor of the then-Illinois senator.\n\n\"I'm told that I was the first elected person in California to endorse [Obama] when he decided to run for president,\" Harris said back in 2019 while she was campaigning for president. \"I will remind you, and it is important to know, that early in those days Joe Biden was running against him.\"\n\nHarris was in attendance when Obama announced his candidacy for president in 2007, after first meeting him 2004 when he was an Illinois state senator running for the U.S. Senate, the Washington Examiner previously reported.\n\n\"Barack Obama will be a president who finally ends the era of fear that has been used to divide and demoralize our country,\" Harris said during California's Democratic convention in 2008.\n\nAs Harris built her political career from San Francisco district attorney to California attorney general and then senator, Harris was even dubbed \"the female Obama\" by some political analysts.\n\nFast forward to Harris' 2020 campaign for the presidency, those in Obama's orbit rallied around Harris' campaign while the 44th president kept quiet. Public relations executive Michael Kempner and his wife held a fundraiser for Harris in the Hamptons that cycle, after they raised millions for Obama during his 2012 re-election campaign, Politico reported at the time. Eugene Duffy, who served as national finance committee member for Obama in 2008, helped fundraise for Harris that cycle, as did Obama donor and supporter, Jeff Shell, the former CEO of NBCUniversal.\n\nThough Obama is again remaining coy with his endorsement in 2024 cycle, powerful advisers and allies in his orbit have joined Harris' campaign. Harris tapped Obama's former attorney general Eric Holder to lead the vetting process of Harris' potential running mates, while the campaign also reportedly contacted longtime Obama adviser David Plouffe for a leadership position on the team. Jennifer O'Malley Dillon, who worked as Obama's 2012 deputy campaign manager and Biden's 2024 reelection campaign chair, was announced as Harris' campaign manager.\n\nAhead of Biden dropping out of the race on Sunday afternoon, Obama allies notably helped lead the charge in calling for Biden to exit the race in favor of a candidate they believed was more suitable to take on Trump.\n\nObama's former chief campaign strategist David Axelrod declared earlier this month that Biden is \"not winning this race.\" Actor George Clooney called on Biden to drop out of the race in a bombshell op-ed that was published just weeks after the Hollywood star co-hosted Biden, alongside Obama, for a ritzy campaign event in Los Angeles. Clooney has long had a personal friendship with Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama, including vacationing with the first couple in previous years.\n\nAnother ally in Obama's orbit, Jon Favreau, who served as former director of speech writing for Obama, also called on Biden to drop out of the race this month, saying he attended the fundraiser in L.A. with Clooney and Obama and witnessed firsthand Biden's state of mental acuity. Favreau, alongside former Obama advisers Jon Lovett and Tommy Vietor -- known collectively as the \"Obama Bros\" when they worked in the White House -- also dedicated the majority of a podcast episode of \"Pod Save America\" this month to trashing Biden.\n\nThe \"Obama Bros\" and other former advisers in Obama's orbit have since taken to social media to celebrate Harris' run.\n\nAs momentum builds behind Harris' candidacy, with the DNC anticipated to certify her as the nominee on Aug. 1, Obama's statement Sunday follows his history of not expeditiously tipping the political scales in favor of one candidate over another.\n\n\"We will be navigating uncharted waters in the days ahead. I have extraordinary confidence that the leaders of our party will be able to create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges,\" Obama said in his statement on Sunday. \"I believe that Joe Biden's vision of a generous, prosperous, and united America that provides opportunity for everyone will be on full display at the Democratic Convention in August. And I expect that every single one of us are prepared to carry that message of hope and progress forward into November and beyond.\"", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Obama refraining from endorsing Harris is in stark contrast to other Democratic leaders, including Nancy Pelosi, backing Harris as the presidential nominee. Obama believes Harris cannot defeat Donald Trump in the November election.\n\n\"Obama's very upset because he knows she can't win,\" a Biden family source told The New York Post. \"Obama knows she's just incompetent -- the border czar who never visited the border, saying that all migrants should have health insurance. She cannot navigate the landmines that are ahead of her.\"\n\nThe source also expressed doubts about Harris' ability to perform well in a televised debate.\n\n\"Wait until the debate\u00e2\u0080\u00e6 She can't debate. She's going to put her foot in her mouth about Israel, Palestine, Ukraine. She's going to say something really stupid,\" a source told The Post.\n\nThe turning point for Biden's decision to step down was his poor performance in the first presidential debate against Trump, which took place on June 27 in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nDuring the debate, Biden often lost his train of thought, gave confusing answers, and didn't challenge former President Donald Trump's false statements.\n\nAccording to the source, Obama had hoped to get Biden out of the way, and an article written by George Clooney in the New York Times asking him to step aside was part of that plan.\n\nHowever, Obama was \"shocked\" when Biden endorsed Harris right away, reported The Post.\n\n\"Obama being surprised by a smart political decision actually makes sense when coupled with his personal inability to see politics beyond his singular, immediate interests. Obama always thinks he is the smartest and coolest guy in the room. He's friends with George Clooney, after all,\" another Democrat source noted.\n\nRod Blagojevich, the former governor of Illinois, believes \"Obama was instrumental\" in getting Biden out of the race.\n\nHowever, Biden is still in the race, with a second debate scheduled for September 10, until the Democratic presidential nominee is officially announced. The Democratic National Convention is set for August 19.\n\n\"It [Biden's departure from the race] couldn't have happened without him [Obama]. Without Obama, Biden is still the Democratic nominee. Obama was the conductor leading the orchestra that convinced Biden to step aside,\" Blagojevich was quoted as saying by The Post.\n\nDespite these claims, Obama has been in close touch with Harris, providing her with advice on organising her campaign and various elements of launching a successful presidential bid.\n\nNBC News has reported that the 44th US President, Barack Obama, is expected to endorse Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris soon, though the timing remains unclear.\n\nThe report stated that Obama has privately supported Harris' candidacy and has been in regular contact with her.\n\n\"Aides to Obama and Harris have also discussed arranging for the two of them to appear together on the campaign trail, though no date has been set,\" three people familiar with the discussions were quoted as saying by NBC News.", "source": {"uri": "indiatoday.in", "dataType": "news", "title": "India Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_Blagojevich", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rod Blagojevich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Illinois", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Illinois"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202407/kamala-harris-and-barack-obama-254612218-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=tWET7PgpLTaUTHWPUgg4PHa2MV7T4Cgf", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751667", "eventUri": "eng-9751667", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 1180, "textEnd": 1187}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-09-10", "textStart": 2144, "textEnd": 2156}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-19", "textStart": 2271, "textEnd": 2280}], "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

Lee and Jonathan Allen and Monica Alba\n\nJuly 25, 2024 at 6:01 AM\n\nWASHINGTON -- Former President Barack Obama and Vice President Kamala Harris have been in close touch since she announced her presidential candidacy Sunday, having multiple conversations this week as she kicks off her campaign, according to four people familiar with their discussions.\n\nObama privately has fully supported Harris' candidacy and plans to endorse her soon, these people said.\n\n\"He has been in regular contact with her and thinks she's been off to a great start,\" one of them said.\n\nObama is one of the only high-profile Democrats in the country who has yet to endorse Harris. While other party leaders have stepped forward to publicly back her, he has so far kept his support private.\n\nThe people familiar with the discussions didn't know the precise timing of his endorsement. One of them said Obama didn't want it to overshadow President Joe Biden's moment, particularly his Oval Office address to the nation Wednesday night.\n\nAnother person familiar with the discussions said Obama and Harris, who is seeking to maintain the momentum her campaign has enjoyed among Democrats since she entered the race, wanted his endorsement to stand as its own moment.\n\nAides to Obama and Harris also have discussed arranging for the two of them to appear together on the campaign trail, though no date has been set, three of the people familiar with the discussions said.\n\nMichelle Obama also supports Harris' candidacy, two people familiar with the matter said.\n\n\"President Obama looks forward to helping Democrats up and down the ballot make the case to voters this fall,\" said Eric Schultz, a senior adviser to Obama. \"Our strategy will be based on driving impact, especially where and when his voice can move the needle.\"\n\nDuring their conversations in recent days, Obama has offered Harris his counsel on setting up a campaign and on other aspects of mounting a successful bid for the White House, which he has done twice, the people familiar with their discussions said.\n\nFrom Obama's perspective, Harris has taken on a lot in a very short time, and he sees himself as a resource and a sounding board for her as she navigates a high-stakes campaign with about just 100 days until Election Day, according to two of the people familiar with their discussions.\n\nObama views his utility in the campaign as helping unify his party and moving Democrats forward, and he's expected to be a fixture on the campaign trail this fall.\n\nThe only publicly known phone call between Obama and Harris took place Sunday, when Biden announced he was ending his re-election campaign and swiftly endorsed Harris.\n\nObama issued a statement Sunday praising Biden and supporting a process to select a new Democratic nominee, but he didn't endorse Harris.\n\n\"We will be navigating uncharted waters in the days ahead,\" Obama said in the statement. \"But I have extraordinary confidence that the leaders of our party will be able to create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges.\"\n\nHarris then quickly received endorsements from across the country, and no one has stepped up to challenge her for the nomination.\n\nSince Biden's June 27 debate performance, Obama had privately expressed concerns about his former vice president's ability to defeat former President Donald Trump in November, NBC News has reported. He didn't publicly or privately urge Biden to remain in the race, though he defended his debate performance by writing on X that he understood what it was like to have a poor presidential debate.\n\nObama and Harris have known each other for years. She was an early supporter of his 2008 campaign and was given a speaking role at his 2012 nominating convention. Obama campaigned for Harris when she was running for attorney general in California and supported her when she ran for the Senate in 2016.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "carol_e_lee@aol.com", "name": "Carol E.

Or is it just wishful thinking among her admirers? Here, Yahoo News takes a look at what Obama has said about the upcoming presidential race.\n\nWhat has Michelle Obama said?\n\nMichelle Obama was asked if she ever planned on running for office as early as 2012, when her husband was still president.\n\nShe told an event at the White House: \"Absolutely not. I think that once his terms are over, we'll go on to do other important things, because there are so many ways you can help this country and the world, even if you're not president of the United States.\"\n\nObama and her husband have been asked this question during various media appearances and public events in the following years, with the attorney insisting she was \"not interested\" in a career in politics.\n\nIn December 2016 she told Oprah Winfrey she didn't want to put her children through another election campaign, adding: \"I'm not coy. I've proven that. I'm pretty direct. If I were interested in it, I would say it. I don't believe in playing games.\"\n\nShe was asked the same question by Winfrey in 2023, and gave the same answer.\n\n\"I'm just wondering: Does what I want have anything to do with anything? Does who I choose to be have anything to do with it?,\" she asked the presenter.\n\nIn a Netflix special released last year, Obama said politics is \"hard... and the people who get into it... It's got to be in your soul, because it is so important. It is not in my soul.\"\n\nWhat have the Democrats said?\n\nBarack Obama has so far held off from publicly supporting Kamala Harris, calling for a process \"from which an outstanding nominee emerges\".\n\nSpeculation that the former president was holding back in the hope that his wife could be included on the nomination papers appears to be unfounded - he previously waited until after the 2020 primaries to endorse Biden for president and has long presented himself as above party politics.\n\nMichelle Obama does not appear to have received any public endorsements from major Democratic figures. Despite this, some in the Republican Party still view her as a formidable opponent, albeit a theoretical one.\n\n\"I don't think I'd be revealing any sort of polling secrets if I said Michelle Obama would probably be the one person that could step in and keep the party united and probably provide a little bit of a moving start because of her obvious notoriety,\" Republican senator Kevin Cramer told New York Magazine.\n\nWhat do the polls say?\n\nDespite her repeated refusals to run the office, there still appears to be a strong public appetite for her to throw her hat into the ring.\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll released on July 2 found that Obama would outperform Biden among voters. Among those who answered the survey, 50% said they would vote for the former first lady, compared to 39% for Trump.\n\nIn comparison, the contest was tighter between Biden and Trump, who both maintained the support of 40% of registered voters.\n\nIn a race between Harris and Trump, there was only one percentage point between them, with 42% backing the vice president compared to 43% for the Republican nominee.\n\nPolling for the Center Square Voters' Voice carried out in January suggested that if Democrat-leaning voters could pick anyone as their party's candidate, Harris would finish in seventh place, the Highland County Press reports.\n\nOut of those who responded, 24% said they would pick Obama, compared to 20% for Biden, 12% for Bernie Sanders and 9% for \"someone else\", 9% for secretary of transportation Pete Buttigieg, 8% for Hillary Clinton, 7% for Harris and 5% for Elizabeth Warren.\n\nHow could she help the Democrat nominee?\n\nWhile Barack Obama was seen on the campaign trail with Biden, Michelle has not publicly shown her support for the incumbent president's bid.\n\nThis was reportedly due to a feud over how the Biden family treated her friend Kathleen Buhle after her divorce from the president's son Hunter.\n\nHowever, this may change now Biden has dropped out, and her star power could be a great asset to Harris if Obama chooses to back her.\n\nKevin Munoz, the Biden campaign spokesman, said Obama was \"enormously helpful in the fight to beat Donald Trump\" in 2020.\n\nAfter Biden and Harris won the November 2020 election, the Obamas congratulated them in a joint-statement, describing Harris' rise to vice presidency \"groundbreaking\".\n\nSharing a post on her Instagram account, Michelle said: \"I'm beyond thrilled that my friend Joe Biden and our first Black and Indian-American woman Vice President, Kamala Harris, are headed to restore some dignity, competence, and heart at the White House. Our country sorely needs it.\"\n\nIn August 2020, Obama shared a post on social media explaining what Harris's vice presidential candidacy would mean for young girls.\n\n\"I've been thinking about all those girls growing up today who will be able to take it for granted that someone who looks like them can grow up to lead a nation like ours. Because @KamalaHarris may be the first, but she won't be the last,\" she said. \"I am here for it all. Let us embrace and celebrate this moment. Go get 'em girl.\"\n\nWith this in mind, Obama could be more open to throwing her weight behind Harris's campaign, particularly with the prospect of a Trump victory appearing so close.\n\nRead more\n\nWhy has Obama not endorsed Harris?

Or is it just wishful thinking among her admirers? Here, Yahoo News takes a look at what Obama has said about the upcoming presidential race.\n\nMichelle Obama was asked if she ever planned on running for office as early as 2012, when her husband was still president.\n\nShe told an event at the White House: \"Absolutely not. I think that once his terms are over, we'll go on to do other important things, because there are so many ways you can help this country and the world, even if you're not president of the United States.\"\n\nObama and her husband have been asked this question during various media appearances and public events in the following years, with the attorney insisting she was \"not interested\" in a career in politics.\n\nIn December 2016 she told Oprah Winfrey she didn't want to put her children through another election campaign, adding: \"I'm not coy. I've proven that. I'm pretty direct. If I were interested in it, I would say it. I don't believe in playing games.\"\n\nShe was asked the same question by Winfrey in 2023, and gave the same answer.\n\n\"I'm just wondering: Does what I want have anything to do with anything?. Does who I choose to be have anything to do with it?,\" she asked the presenter.\n\nIn a Netflix special released last year, Obama said politics is \"hard... and the people who get into it... It's got to be in your soul, because it is so important. It is not in my soul.\"\n\nBarack Obama has so far held off from publicly supporting Kamala Harris, calling for a process \"from which an outstanding nominee emerges\".\n\nSpeculation that the former president was holding back in the hope that his wife could be included on the nomination papers appears to be unfounded - he previously waited until after the 2020 primaries to endorse Biden for president and has long presented himself as above party politics.\n\nMichelle Obama does not appear to have received any public endorsements from major Democratic figures. Despite this, some in the Republican party still view her as a formidable opponent, albeit a theoretical one.\n\n\"I don't think I'd be revealing any sort of polling secrets if I said Michelle Obama would probably be the one person that could step in and keep the party united and probably provide a little bit of a moving start because of her obvious notoriety,\" Republican senator Kevin Cramer told New York Magazine.\n\nDespite her repeated refusals to run the office, there still appears to be a strong public appetite for her to throw her hat into the ring.\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll released on July 2 found that Obama would outperform Biden among voters. Among those who answered the survey, 50% said they would vote for the former first lady, compared to 39% for Trump.\n\nIn comparison, the contest was tighter between Biden and Trump, who both maintained the support of 40% of registered voters.\n\nIn a race between Harris and Trump, there was only one percentage point between them, with 42% backing the vice president compared to 43% for the Republican nominee.\n\nPolling for the Center Square Voters' Voice carried out in January suggested that if Democrat-leaning voters could pick anyone as their party's candidate, Harris would finish in seventh place, the Highland County Press reports.\n\nOut of those who responded, 24% said they would pick Obama, compared to 20% for Biden, 12% for Bernie Sanders and 9% for \"someone else\", 9% for secretary of transportation Pete Buttigieg, 8% for Hillary Clinton, 7% for Harris and 5% for Elizabeth Warren.\n\nWhile Barack Obama was seen on the campaign trail with Biden, Michelle has not publicly shown her support for the incumbent president's bid.\n\nThis was reportedly due to a feud over how the Biden family treated her friend Kathleen Buhle after her divorce from the president's son Hunter.\n\nHowever, this may change now Biden has dropped out, and her star power could be a great asset to Harris if Obama chooses to back her.\n\nKevin Munoz, the Biden campaign spokesman, said Obama was \"enormously helpful in the fight to beat Donald Trump\" in 2020.\n\nAfter Biden and Harris won the November 2020 election, the Obamas congratulated them in a joint-statement, describing Harris' rise to vice presidency \"groundbreaking\".\n\nSharing a post on her Instagram account, Michelle said: \"I'm beyond thrilled that my friend Joe Biden and our first Black and Indian-American woman Vice President, Kamala Harris, are headed to restore some dignity, competence, and heart at the White House. Our country sorely needs it.\"\n\nIn August 2020, Obama shared a post on social media explaining what Harris's vice presidential candidacy would mean for young girls.\n\n\"I've been thinking about all those girls growing up today who will be able to take it for granted that someone who looks like them can grow up to lead a nation like ours.

After which the former president has finally taken a decision on whether he should be endorsing the vice president.\n\nThe NBC report quotes four unnamed sources claiming Obama has privately fully supported Harris's candidacy and plans to endorse her soon. One source mentions in the report, \"He has been in regular contact with her and thinks she's been off to a great start.\"\n\nWhile many prominent Democrats have already endorsed Harris, Obama has kept his support private. The timing of his public endorsement is still uncertain, report stated.\n\nDespite his public silence, in the backdoor Obama is also providing Harris guidance on campaign strategies, drawing from his own experience in running successful presidential campaigns. Report claims he sees himself as a resource for Harris as she navigates her high-stakes campaign, with only about 100 days left until Election Day.\n\nThere can be several reasons behind Barack Obama's silence, significant one being his apprehension of GOP considering Kamala's wild card entry into the US election as undemocratic. Vance has already called Democrats 'undemocratic' for picking Kamala without a due election process.\n\nHe also doesn't want to overshadow President Joe Biden's recent announcements, including his Oval Office address. Another reports suggests that Obama and Harris may wish to create a significant moment with his endorsement, separate from other political events.\n\nReports suggest Michelle Obama is also supportive of Harris's candidacy. Eric Schultz, a senior adviser to Obama, recently stated, \"President Obama looks forward to helping Democrats up and down the ballot make the case to voters this fall.\" He added that Obama's involvement will be strategically impactful, particularly where his influence can be most effective.\n\nObama is one of the only high-profile Democrats who has been silent over Harris. His silence over Kamala candidacy is being labelled as a 'snub' by the Republicans. NY Post has even filed a story claiming, \"Obama's very upset because he knows she can't win,\" the Biden family source told The Post.\" Hence, Kamala will be eager to get popular Barack Obama by her side as soon as possible.\n\nHarris has a long history with Obama, having been an early supporter of his 2008 campaign. She was also given a speaking role at the 2012 Democratic National Convention. Obama has supported Harris in her past political endeavours, including her campaigns for California Attorney General and U.S. Senate in 2016.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Election Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2008 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_General_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attorney General of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michelle Obama"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Children's", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2024/07/25/1600x900/barack_obama_and_kamala_harris_1721887113830_1721887113984.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751667", "eventUri": "eng-9751667", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

She cannot navigate the landmines that are ahead of her,\" the source reportedly said.\n\nThe turning point for Biden, 81, came after his disastrous performance against Trump in a televised debate in Atlanta last month which, The Post first revealed, was part of an \"elaborate set-up\" to remove him from the race.\n\nBut the source doesn't have high hopes for a TV debate between Trump and Harris. When Biden was still in the race, a second debate was scheduled for September 10.\n\n\"Wait until the debate... She can't debate. She's going to put her foot in her mouth about Israel, Palestine, Ukraine. She's going to say something really stupid,\" the source said.\n\n\"Obama knew this was going to happen, Joe knew this was going to happen. Now she is going to have to answer real questions.\"\n\nTrump told reporters he would like to debate Harris multiple times.\n\nFox News invited Trump and Harris to a debate on September 17th.\n\nDonald Trump And Kamala Harris Invited To Fox News Debate, Here's When\n\nAlthough Obama hasn't endorsed Harris, other reports suggested Obama's inner circle believes he still supports her campaign.\n\nPer Fox News:\n\nThough Obama is again remaining coy with his endorsement in the 2024 cycle, powerful advisers and allies in his orbit have joined Harris' campaign. Harris tapped Obama's former attorney general Eric Holder to lead the vetting process of Harris' potential running mates, while the campaign also reportedly contacted longtime Obama adviser David Plouffe for a leadership position on the team. Jennifer O'Malley Dillon, who worked as Obama's 2012 deputy campaign manager and Biden's 2024 re-election campaign chair, was announced as Harris' campaign manager.\n\nAhead of Biden dropping out of the race on Sunday afternoon, Obama allies notably helped lead the charge in calling for Biden to exit the race in favor of a candidate they believed was more suitable to take on Trump.\n\nObama's former chief campaign strategist David Axelrod declared earlier this month that Biden is \"not winning this race.\" Actor George Clooney called on Biden to drop out of the race in a bombshell op-ed that was published just weeks after the Hollywood star co-hosted Biden, alongside Obama, for a ritzy campaign event in Los Angeles. Clooney has long had a personal friendship with Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama, including vacationing with the first couple in previous years.\n\nAnother ally in Obama's orbit, Jon Favreau, who served as former director of speech writing for Obama, also called on Biden to drop out of the race this month, saying he attended the fundraiser in L.A. with Clooney and Obama and witnessed firsthand Biden's state of mental acuity. Favreau, alongside former Obama advisers Jon Lovett and Tommy Vietor -- known collectively as the \"Obama Bros\" when they worked in the White House -- also dedicated the majority of a podcast episode of \"Pod Save America\" this month to trashing Biden.\n\nThe \"Obama Bros\" and other former advisers in Obama's orbit have since taken to social media to celebrate Harris' run.\n\n\"What the @KamalaHarris campaign team has pulled of since Sunday is truly incredible. No campaign in history has ever undergone such a shift with no notice. The way they been able to capture the wave of enthusiasm is so impressive. True professionals,\" former Obama Senior Advisor Dan Pfeiffer said.\n\n\"This was excellent, and she's crushing the rest of the speech too,\" Favreau said in response to a speech from Harris.",

Are these sources telling the truth? Who knows. But it could cause a rift or stir some trouble in a chaotic situation.\n\nThe first report said the bigwigs within the Democrat Party pushed out Biden.\n\nNow, if I recall correctly, Obama did not endorse anyone in 2016 or 2020 until after the primary. Maybe Hillary right before the convention.\n\nHowever, 2024 is a completely different situation. It's obvious the party pushed out Biden. It's obvious the party used 2020 as a way to get Kamala to the top of the ticket without the voters.\n\nFollowing Joe Biden's shock resignation from the race on Sunday, and his immediate endorsement of the vice president, most of the Democratic elite have been quick to rally behind Harris -- but Obama is a notable exception.\n\n\"Obama's very upset because he knows she can't win,\" the Biden family source told The Post.\n\n\"Obama knows she's just incompetent -- the border czar who never visited the border, saying that all migrants should have health insurance. She cannot navigate the landmines that are ahead of her.\"\n\n\"When you are running for president there are things you can and can't say.\"\n\nThe source also said a debate between Trump and Harris will show she is weak:\n\n\"Wait until the debate... She can't debate. She's going to put her foot in her mouth about Israel, Palestine, Ukraine. She's going to say something really stupid,\" the source said.\n\nObama wanted Biden out of the race, but he thought the party would go with someone else.\n\nObama preferred Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly. The source in the first Post report mentioned the possibility of Kelly coming out on top at the convention:\n\nHowever, the higher ups in the Democratic Party didn't count on Biden endorsing Harris right away and \"Obama was shocked\" when Joe endorsed her, according to the insider.\n\nAfter Biden's ouster, Obama -- who did not return a request for comment Wednesday -- wanted Arizona Senator and former astronaut Mark Kelly \"at the top of the ticket\" when the Democratic National Convention is held next month, the source said.\n\nObama is \"furious,\" things haven't gone his way, which is why he is not joining in the Democratic Party's support of Harris,\" the Biden source added.\n\nBut another Democrat source isn't surprised Obama overplayed his hand:\n\nAnother well-placed Democrat source said, \"Obama being surprised by a smart political decision actually makes sense when coupled with his personal inability to see politics beyond his singular, immediate interests.\n\n\"Obama always thinks he is the smartest and coolest guy in the room. He's friends with George Clooney, after all.\"", "source": {"uri": "legalinsurrection.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Le\u00b7gal In\u00b7sur\u00b7rec\u00b7tion"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mechastain@legalinsurrection.com", "name": "mechastain", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Family of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mark Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_out", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coming out"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Open_Source/Articles", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Open Source/Articles", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Children", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://legalinsurrection.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Barack-Obama-Kamala-Harris.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751667", "eventUri": "eng-9751667", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

It reminds me a bit of how many of Obama's former staffers talked out of both sides of their mouths about Hillary Clinton in 2016, only it feels like President Biden and President Obama's relationship is not in a good place and may never recover. Many sources have said outright that Biden feels betrayed by party leaders and by Obama. Many sources have indicated that Obama has barely been in communication with Biden or his people in recent months. When President Biden withdrew from the race on Sunday, Obama offered a tribute to Biden's decades of public service but Obama did not endorse VP Kamala Harris. That too has irritated a lot of Democrats and Dem activists, who wonder about the extent of Obama's role in the party coup.\n\nNewsNation's Kellie Meyer tweeted yesterday that Obama will not endorse anyone before the nominee is chosen, and he did not endorse Kamala Harris or anyone else because \"Obama believes he will be uniquely positioned to help unite the party once we have a nominee, lift-up that candidate, and do everything he can to get that candidate elected in November.\" I recognize this as an effort to turn down the temperature on the ratf-king allegations, and I'm sure Obama has been getting some calls too, especially as the party has already enthusiastically coalesced around VP Kamala Harris. Suddenly, Obama and his people are very chatty about Obama's perspective, and they even contacted the New York Times:\n\nMany of the marquee names in Democratic politics began quickly lining up behind Vice President Kamala Harris on Sunday, but one towering presence in the party held back: Barack Obama. The former president has not yet endorsed Ms. Harris; in fact, he did not mention her once in an affectionate -- if tautly written -- tribute to President Biden that was posted on Medium shortly after he decided to bow out on Sunday.\n\nRepublicans interpreted that as a snub. But people close to Mr. Obama, who has positioned himself as an impartial elder statesman above intraparty machinations, said not to read too much into it -- and had no alternate candidate in mind when he made the decision not to immediately endorse Ms. Harris.\n\nMr. Obama adopted an identical stance four years ago when Mr. Biden's aides pressured him to endorse early in the Democratic primaries before Senator Bernie Sanders dropped out. (Mr. Obama's favored phrase back then was \"I don't want to thumb the scale.\") Endorsing too early now would also be a political mistake -- fueling criticism that Ms. Harris's nomination, should it come, was a coronation rather than the best possible consensus under rushed circumstances, they said.\n\nInstead, Mr. Obama sees his role as helping to quickly \"unite the party once we have a nominee,\" a person familiar with his thinking said.\n\nBut there are other more personal considerations, exacerbating Mr. Obama's innate caution. Mr. Biden is a deeply prideful man, and he has never fully forgiven Mr. Obama for quietly backing former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the 2016 campaign. Mr. Biden still believes he could have beaten former President Donald J. Trump that year if given the chance. Nor was Mr. Biden pleased when Mr. Obama told him that he should consider sitting out 2020, too, people in his circle have said. Mr. Obama wanted Sunday to be about Mr. Biden, a celebration of his accomplishments -- and does not feel pressured to act hastily, according to a former White House official who speaks with the former president regularly.\n\n[From The NY Times]\n\nThis reads to me like Obama is in damage-control mode because he's realized that his public reticence and private maneuvers have not gone down well with the party. As I've been saying, this whole episode has left a bad taste in a lot of Democrats' mouths. Even if you make the argument that President Biden had to be convinced to drop out, did the Obama allies, ratf-kers and Dem Congressional leaders really believe that the best way to achieve that goal was torching a sitting Democratic president publicly and spending three weeks advocating for the disenfranchisement of Democratic voters at the behest of big-money donors?\n\nThe fact that Obama is making his endorsement all about his own importance is the wrong move too - the party is quickly coalescing behind VP Harris, it's July, there are only 104 days until the election. Instead of unifying quickly and ensuring that Democrats look like they're more than ready to take on Trump and the MAGA cult (after literally overshadowing the Republican National Convention with their party coup bullsh-t), Obama is navel-gazing and dithering.", "source": {"uri": "celebitchy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Celebitchy"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'\u00e9tat", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Coup d'\u00e9tat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medium (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bernie Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Primary election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751667", "eventUri": "eng-9751667", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

Democrats nationwide soon united in their calls for Harris to become the party's nominee as they square up for another election battle against former President Trump.\n\nThough Democratic leaders such as Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., as well as the Clintons and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., have offered Harris their endorsements, Obama has remained mum.\n\n\"Michelle and I just want to express our love and gratitude to Joe and Jill for leading us so ably and courageously during these perilous times\u200a -- \u200aand for their commitment to the ideals of freedom and equality that this country was founded on,\" Obama wrote in his statement following Biden bowing out, which did not including mentioning Harris.\n\nGROWING LIST OF OBAMA ALLIES, FORMER ADVISERS LOOK TO SINK BIDEN RE-ELECTION BID\n\nSince leaving the Oval Office, Obama has typically held his endorsement card close to his chest. He endorsed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in June 2016, while his endorsement of Biden in 2020 was only made days ahead of the Democratic National Convention.\n\nObama remained coy for a long while during the 2020 election about whom he would endorse, saying he would not back anyone during the primary. As Democratic contenders such as Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont dropped out of the primary race and cleared a path for Biden, however, Obama finally endorsed his former veep in August of that year.\n\nHarris was also a contender in the 2020 race, and had long had a friendship with Obama prior to her 2020 run, sparking media speculation that the 44th president could throw his support behind Harris instead of his VP.\n\nOBAMA ALLIES, ADVISERS HELPED LEAD THE CHARGE AMONG DEMS LOOKING TO SINK BIDEN AHEAD OF OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT\n\nHarris was among the first elected Democrats in the nation to endorse Obama's first run for president in the 2008 election, snubbing Hillary Clinton in favor of the then-Illinois senator.\n\n\"I'm told that I was the first elected person in California to endorse [Obama] when he decided to run for president,\" Harris said back in 2019 while she was campaigning for president. \"I will remind you, and it is important to know, that early in those days Joe Biden was running against him.\"\n\nHarris was in attendance when Obama announced his candidacy for president in 2007, after first meeting him in 2004 when he was an Illinois state senator running for the U.S. Senate, the Washington Examiner previously reported.\n\n\"Barack Obama will be a president who finally ends the era of fear that has been used to divide and demoralize our country,\" Harris said during California's Democratic convention in 2008.\n\nAs Harris built her political career from San Francisco district attorney to California attorney general and then senator, Harris was even dubbed \"the female Obama\" by some political analysts.\n\nEX-OBAMA ADVISER SAYS BIDEN CAN'T BEAT 'FATHER TIME' AND IS 'NOT WINNING THIS RACE'\n\nFast-forward to Harris' 2020 campaign for the presidency -- those in Obama's orbit rallied around Harris' campaign while the 44th president kept quiet. Public relations executive Michael Kempner and his wife held a fundraiser for Harris in the Hamptons that cycle, after they raised millions for Obama during his 2012 re-election campaign, Politico reported at the time. Eugene Duffy, who served as national finance committee member for Obama in 2008, helped fundraise for Harris that cycle, as did Obama donor and supporter Jeff Shell, the former CEO of NBCUniversal.\n\nThough Obama is again remaining coy with his endorsement in the 2024 cycle, powerful advisers and allies in his orbit have joined Harris' campaign. Harris tapped Obama's former attorney general Eric Holder to lead the vetting process of Harris' potential running mates, while the campaign also reportedly contacted longtime Obama adviser David Plouffe for a leadership position on the team. Jennifer O'Malley Dillon, who worked as Obama's 2012 deputy campaign manager and Biden's 2024 re-election campaign chair, was announced as Harris' campaign manager.\n\nOBAMA SILENT OVER REPORTS HE'S WORKING 'BEHIND THE SCENES' TO FORCE BIDEN OUT OF THE 2024 RACE\n\nAhead of Biden dropping out of the race on Sunday afternoon, Obama allies notably helped lead the charge in calling for Biden to exit the race in favor of a candidate they believed was more suitable to take on Trump.\n\nObama's former chief campaign strategist David Axelrod declared earlier this month that Biden is \"not winning this race.\" Actor George Clooney called on Biden to drop out of the race in a bombshell op-ed that was published just weeks after the Hollywood star co-hosted Biden, alongside Obama, for a ritzy campaign event in Los Angeles. Clooney has long had a personal friendship with Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama, including vacationing with the first couple in previous years.\n\nOBAMA AGAIN STEPPING INTO ROLE AS JOE'S CLOSER AHEAD OF TRUMP V BIDEN REMATCH\n\nAnother ally in Obama's orbit, Jon Favreau, who served as former director of speech writing for Obama, also called on Biden to drop out of the race this month, saying he attended the fundraiser in L.A. with Clooney and Obama and witnessed firsthand Biden's state of mental acuity. Favreau, alongside former Obama advisers Jon Lovett and Tommy Vietor -- known collectively as the \"Obama Bros\" when they worked in the White House -- also dedicated the majority of a podcast episode of \"Pod Save America\" this month to trashing Biden.\n\nThe \"Obama Bros\" and other former advisers in Obama's orbit have since taken to social media to celebrate Harris' run.\n\nAs momentum builds behind Harris' candidacy, with the DNC anticipated to certify her as the nominee on Aug. 1, Obama's statement Sunday follows his history of not expeditiously tipping the political scales in favor of one candidate over another.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"We will be navigating uncharted waters in the days ahead. I have extraordinary confidence that the leaders of our party will be able to create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges,\" Obama said in his statement on Sunday. \"I believe that Joe Biden's vision of a generous, prosperous, and united America that provides opportunity for everyone will be on full display at the Democratic Convention in August. And I expect that every single one of us are prepared to carry that message of hope and progress forward into November and beyond.\"", "source": {"uri": "wfin.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

She cannot navigate the landmines that are ahead of her,\" the source reportedly said.\n\nFrom the New York Post:\n\nThe turning point for Biden, 81, came after his disastrous performance against Trump in a televised debate in Atlanta last month which, The Post first revealed, was part of an \"elaborate set-up\" to remove him from the race.\n\nBut the source doesn't have high hopes for a TV debate between Trump and Harris. When Biden was still in the race, a second debate was scheduled for September 10.\n\n\"Wait until the debate... She can't debate. She's going to put her foot in her mouth about Israel, Palestine, Ukraine. She's going to say something really stupid,\" the source said.\n\n\"Obama knew this was going to happen, Joe knew this was going to happen. Now she is going to have to answer real questions.\"\n\nTrump told reporters he would like to debate Harris multiple times.\n\nFox News invited Trump and Harris to a debate on September 17th.\n\nDonald Trump And Kamala Harris Invited To Fox News Debate, Here's When\n\nAlthough Obama hasn't endorsed Harris, other reports suggested Obama's inner circle believes he still supports her campaign.\n\nPer Fox News:\n\nThough Obama is again remaining coy with his endorsement in the 2024 cycle, powerful advisers and allies in his orbit have joined Harris' campaign. Harris tapped Obama's former attorney general Eric Holder to lead the vetting process of Harris' potential running mates, while the campaign also reportedly contacted longtime Obama adviser David Plouffe for a leadership position on the team. Jennifer O'Malley Dillon, who worked as Obama's 2012 deputy campaign manager and Biden's 2024 re-election campaign chair, was announced as Harris' campaign manager.\n\nAhead of Biden dropping out of the race on Sunday afternoon, Obama allies notably helped lead the charge in calling for Biden to exit the race in favor of a candidate they believed was more suitable to take on Trump.\n\nObama's former chief campaign strategist David Axelrod declared earlier this month that Biden is \"not winning this race.\" Actor George Clooney called on Biden to drop out of the race in a bombshell op-ed that was published just weeks after the Hollywood star co-hosted Biden, alongside Obama, for a ritzy campaign event in Los Angeles. Clooney has long had a personal friendship with Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama, including vacationing with the first couple in previous years.\n\nAnother ally in Obama's orbit, Jon Favreau, who served as former director of speech writing for Obama, also called on Biden to drop out of the race this month, saying he attended the fundraiser in L.A. with Clooney and Obama and witnessed firsthand Biden's state of mental acuity. Favreau, alongside former Obama advisers Jon Lovett and Tommy Vietor -- known collectively as the \"Obama Bros\" when they worked in the White House -- also dedicated the majority of a podcast episode of \"Pod Save America\" this month to trashing Biden.\n\nThe \"Obama Bros\" and other former advisers in Obama's orbit have since taken to social media to celebrate Harris' run.\n\n\"What the @KamalaHarris campaign team has pulled of since Sunday is truly incredible. No campaign in history has ever undergone such a shift with no notice. The way they been able to capture the wave of enthusiasm is so impressive. True professionals,\" former Obama Senior Advisor Dan Pfeiffer said.\n\n\"This was excellent, and she's crushing the rest of the speech too,\" Favreau said in response to a speech from Harris.", "source": {"uri": "en-volve.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "enVolve"}, "authors": [{"uri": "a_m_smith@en-volve.com", "name": "A.M.

Obama had hoped for Arizona Senator Mark Kelly to lead the Democratic ticket at the upcoming National Convention.\n\nHowever, NBC News reported on Thursday that Obama plans to endorse Harris soon. Despite his public silence, Obama has privately supported Harris's candidacy and has maintained regular contact with her. Discussions are underway to arrange joint campaign appearances, although no dates have been set.\n\nMeanwhile, US Senator Ted Cruz predicted that former First Lady Michelle Obama might replace Biden on the Democratic ticket, following Biden's criticized debate performance against Trump. Cruz claimed there was an \"80% chance\" of this happening, though Michelle Obama has not shown any interest in joining the race.\n\nAs the Democratic campaign continues, the potential endorsement from Obama could play a crucial role in unifying the party and strengthening Harris's position against Trump.", "source": {"uri": "lagatar24.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lagatar English"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mark Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Cruz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ted Cruz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michelle Obama"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://lagatar24.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/barack-obama-refuses-endorse-kamala-harris-replace-joe-biden-election-1721593332356.jpg.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751667", "eventUri": "eng-9751667", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Adam Schiff calling for President Biden to exit the 2024 race on 'America Reports.'\n\nFormer President Obama has not yet endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee for president, though allies in the Obama orbit indicate the 44th president is squarely behind Harris' campaign.\n\nPresident Biden dropped out of the 2024 race Sunday afternoon in a letter posted to his X account, which was shortly followed by him endorsing Harris for president. Democrats nationwide soon united in their calls for Harris to become the party's nominee as they square up for another election battle against former President Donald Trump.\n\nThough Democratic leaders such as Sen. Chuck Schumer and Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, as well as the Clintons and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have offered Harris their endorsements, Obama has remained mum.\n\n\"Michelle and I just want to express our love and gratitude to Joe and Jill for leading us so ably and courageously during these perilous times\u200a -- \u200aand for their commitment to the ideals of freedom and equality that this country was founded on,\" Obama wrote in his statement following Biden bowing out, which did not including mentioning Harris.\n\nGROWING LIST OF OBAMA ALLIES, FORMER ADVISERS LOOK TO SINK BIDEN RE-ELECTION BID\n\nSince leaving the Oval Office, Obama has typically held his endorsement card close to his chest. He endorsed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in June of 2016, while his endorsement of Biden in 2020 was only made days ahead of the DNC.\n\nObama remained coy for a long while during the 2020 election about whom he would endorse, saying he would not back anyone during the primary. As Democratic contenders such as Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders dropped out of the primary race and cleared a path for Biden, however, Obama finally endorsed his former veep in August of that year.\n\nHarris was also a contender in the 2020 race, and had long had a friendship with Obama prior to her 2020 run, sparking media speculation that the 44th president could throw his support behind Harris instead of his VP.\n\nOBAMA ALLIES, ADVISERS HELPED LEAD THE CHARGE AMONG DEMS LOOKING TO SINK BIDEN AHEAD OF OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT\n\nHarris was among the first elected Democrats in the nation to endorse Obama's first run for president in the 2008 election, snubbing Hillary Clinton in favor of the then-Illinois senator.\n\n\"I'm told that I was the first elected person in California to endorse [Obama] when he decided to run for president,\" Harris said back in 2019 while she was campaigning for president. \"I will remind you, and it is important to know, that early in those days Joe Biden was running against him.\"\n\nHarris was in attendance when Obama announced his candidacy for president in 2007, after first meeting him 2004 when he was an Illinois state senator running for the U.S. Senate, the Washington Examiner previously reported.\n\n\"Barack Obama will be a president who finally ends the era of fear that has been used to divide and demoralize our country,\" Harris said during California's Democratic convention in 2008.\n\nAs Harris built her political career from San Francisco district attorney to California attorney general and then senator, Harris was even dubbed \"the female Obama\" by some political analysts.\n\nEX-OBAMA ADVISER SAYS BIDEN CAN'T BEAT 'FATHER TIME' AND IS 'NOT WINNING THIS RACE'\n\nFast forward to Harris' 2020 campaign for the presidency, those in Obama's orbit rallied around Harris' campaign while the 44th president kept quiet. Public relations executive Michael Kempner and his wife held a fundraiser for Harris in the Hamptons that cycle, after they raised millions for Obama during his 2012 re-election campaign, Politico reported at the time. Eugene Duffy, who served as national finance committee member for Obama in 2008, helped fundraise for Harris that cycle, as did Obama donor and supporter, Jeff Shell, the former CEO of NBCUniversal.\n\nThough Obama is again remaining coy with his endorsement in 2024 cycle, powerful advisers and allies in his orbit have joined Harris' campaign. Harris tapped Obama's former attorney general Eric Holder to lead the vetting process of Harris' potential running mates, while the campaign also reportedly contacted longtime Obama adviser David Plouffe for a leadership position on the team. Jennifer O'Malley Dillon, who worked as Obama's 2012 deputy campaign manager and Biden's 2024 reelection campaign chair, was announced as Harris' campaign manager.\n\nOBAMA SILENT OVER REPORTS HE'S WORKING 'BEHIND THE SCENES' TO FORCE BIDEN OUT OF THE 2024 RACE\n\nAhead of Biden dropping out of the race on Sunday afternoon, Obama allies notably helped lead the charge in calling for Biden to exit the race in favor of a candidate they believed was more suitable to take on Trump.\n\nObama's former chief campaign strategist David Axelrod declared earlier this month that Biden is \"not winning this race.\" Actor George Clooney called on Biden to drop out of the race in a bombshell op-ed that was published just weeks after the Hollywood star co-hosted Biden, alongside Obama, for a ritzy campaign event in Los Angeles. Clooney has long had a personal friendship with Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama, including vacationing with the first couple in previous years.\n\nOBAMA AGAIN STEPPING INTO ROLE AS JOE'S CLOSER AHEAD OF TRUMP V BIDEN REMATCH\n\nAnother ally in Obama's orbit, Jon Favreau, who served as former director of speech writing for Obama, also called on Biden to drop out of the race this month, saying he attended the fundraiser in L.A. with Clooney and Obama and witnessed firsthand Biden's state of mental acuity. Favreau, alongside former Obama advisers Jon Lovett and Tommy Vietor -- known collectively as the \"Obama Bros\" when they worked in the White House -- also dedicated the majority of a podcast episode of \"Pod Save America\" this month to trashing Biden.\n\nThe \"Obama Bros\" and other former advisers in Obama's orbit have since taken to social media to celebrate Harris' run.\n\nAs momentum builds behind Harris' candidacy, with the DNC anticipated to certify her as the nominee on Aug. 1, Obama's statement Sunday follows his history of not expeditiously tipping the political scales in favor of one candidate over another.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"We will be navigating uncharted waters in the days ahead. I have extraordinary confidence that the leaders of our party will be able to create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges,\" Obama said in his statement on Sunday. \"I believe that Joe Biden's vision of a generous, prosperous, and united America that provides opportunity for everyone will be on full display at the Democratic Convention in August. And I expect that every single one of us are prepared to carry that message of hope and progress forward into November and beyond.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

So, why hasn't Obama? There's a reason. He doesn't think she can beat Donald Trump, reports the New York Post.\n\nFollowing Joe Biden's shock resignation from the race on Sunday, and his immediate endorsement of the vice president, most of the Democratic elite have been quick to rally behind Harris -- but Obama is a notable exception.\n\n\"Obama's very upset because he knows she can't win,\" the Biden family source told The Post.\n\n\"Obama knows she's just incompetent -- the border czar who never visited the border, saying that all migrants should have health insurance. She cannot navigate the landmines that are ahead of her.\"\n\n\"When you are running for president there are things you can and can't say.\"\n\nThe turning point for Biden, 81, came after his disastrous performance against Trump in a televised debate in Atlanta last month which, The Post first revealed, was part of an \"elaborate set-up\" to remove him from the race.\n\nBut the source doesn't have high hopes for a TV debate between Trump and Harris. When Biden was still in the race, a second debate was scheduled for September 10.\n\n\"Wait until the debate... She can't debate. She's going to put her foot in her mouth about Israel, Palestine, Ukraine. She's going to say something really stupid,\" the source said.\n\n\"Obama knew this was going to happen, Joe knew this was going to happen. Now she is going to have to answer real questions.\"\n\nAccording to a source close to the situation, Barack Obama had hoped to maneuver Joe Biden out of the presidential race. As part of this strategy, Obama enlisted George Clooney to write an article in the New York Times urging Biden to step aside. However, the plan did not account for Biden's swift endorsement of Kamala Harris, which, the source said, threw Obama for a loop.\n\nPrevious: Democrat Civil War Watch: Will the Donor Class Prevent Kamala's Coronation?\n\nThe source indicates that, following Biden's potential exit, Obama had intended for Arizona Senator and former astronaut Mark Kelly to be at the top of the ticket during the Democratic National Convention next month.

Obama did not question the viability of Biden's candidacy until July 17 in a Washington Post leak. The leak immediately followed reports that former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), House Democrat Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) had urged the president to step aside.\n\nThe timing of the leak to the Post suggests an organized effort by the Democrat leaders to convince Biden to drop out after weeks of chaos within the party amid continued media scrutiny of Biden's political viability.\n\nTop Democrats threatened Biden with the 25th Amendment to force him out of office if he did not voluntarily step aside, sources told the Post on Monday. Democrats allegedly placed the \"well-orchestrated\" coup in motion weeks ago, which entailed allowing Biden to debate Trump.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "wendell_huseb\u00f8@breitbart.com", "name": "Wendell Huseb\u00f8", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-fifth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/07/Kamala-Harris-and-Barack-Obama.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751667", "eventUri": "eng-9751667", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-17", "textStart": 2224, "textEnd": 2231}], "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries have all endorsed VP Harris. But a notable holdout remains. Former President Barack Obama has yet to endorse Harris -- something many pundits have noticed.\n\nPresident Biden almost immediately endorsed his former running mate in her run for the White House -- after he announced his exit from the race last Sunday. A report in the New York Post, published Wednesday, suggested Obama was highly upset with Harris as the potential nominee. The report further said Obama doesn't think Harris can win against former President Trump. But now a new report says Obama was just biding his time. NBC News reports Obama will endorse Harris \"soon.\"\n\nThe reporting from NBC says former President Obama and Vice President Harris have held meetings in recent days. Obama is reportedly supporting Harris behind closed doors, even if he's yet to do so publicly. The Post's report said Obama preferred former astronaut Mike Kelly as the Democrats' nominee. NBC says Michelle Obama also supports Harris' candidacy -- some have floated the former first lady as a potential pick for the Democrats.", "source": {"uri": "wabcradio.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "77 WABC Radio"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_flippin@wabcradio.com", "name": "James Flippin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Palm_Beach_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Palm Beach Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Kelly_(Pennsylvania_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Kelly (Pennsylvania politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "First Lady of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Michelle Obama"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related_Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related Organizations", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Major_Companies/Company_Information", "label": "dmoz/Business/Major Companies/Company Information", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://dehayf5mhw1h7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/1494/2024/07/25132409/mixcollage-25-jul-2024-01-18-pm-2386-e1721928727579-1024x575.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751667", "eventUri": "eng-9751667", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

Now she is going to have to answer real questions.\"\n\nThe White House did not respond to The Post's request for comment on this story.\n\nThe source suggests that Obama's aim was to clear Biden out of the way, and an article written by George Clooney in the New York Times urging Biden to step aside was part of that plan.\n\nHowever, the top figures in the Democratic Party didn't anticipate Biden endorsing Harris so promptly and \"Obama was shocked\" when Joe supported her, the insider added.\n\nAfter Biden's exit, Obama -- who did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday -- wanted Arizona Senator and former astronaut Mark Kelly \"at the top of the ticket\" when the Democratic National Convention is held next month, according to the source.\n\nObama is \"furious\" that events haven't unfolded as he wished, which is why he is not joining the Democratic Party's support of Harris, the Biden source noted.\n\nAnother high-ranking Democratic source remarked, \"Obama being surprised by a smart political decision actually makes sense when coupled with his personal inability to see politics beyond his singular, immediate interests.\n\n\"Obama always thinks he is the smartest and coolest guy in the room. He's friends with George Clooney, after all.\"\n\nRod Blagojevich, the disgraced former governor of Illinois who criticized Obama as a \"threat to democracy\" in a Wall Street Journal op-ed on Tuesday, told The Post he believes \"Obama was instrumental\" in removing Biden from the race.\n\nBlagojevich, a former Democrat now supporting Trump, was governor of Illinois when Obama became a state senator in 2005.\n\n\"It [Biden's departure from the race] couldn't have happened without him [Obama],\" Blagojevich told The Post. \"Without Obama, Biden is still the Democratic nominee. Obama was the conductor leading the orchestra that convinced Biden to step aside.\"\n\nObama left his role as Illinois senator when he was elected president in 2008, while Blagojevich was impeached in 2009 for attempting to sell Obama's vacant senate seat, removed from office, and convicted on corruption charges a year later.\n\nReports indicate that Obama discouraging Biden from running for president in 2016, to allow Hillary Clinton a chance, remains a sore point between them.\n\n\"He was not encouraging,\" Biden later told the New York Times, referring to the former President, who believed at the time that the former Secretary of State had a better chance of beating Trump.\n\n\"He's running the Democratic party like a Chicago ward boss from the shadows in the back room,\" Blagojevich continued. \"In this case, it's a big backroom because he has a lot of big houses.\"", "source": {"uri": "matzav.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "matzav.com"}, "authors": [],

Perhaps he just wanted to spend some time with her ahead of the decision.\n\nHarris is widely expected to receive the official nomination from the Democratic Party heading into the November election, following Joe Biden's decision to drop out.\n\nThe Democratic National Convention is set to take place in Chicago next month.\n\nRelated: Jerry Jones Made It Very Clear Which Way He Leans Politically", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "andrew_holleran@postandcourier.com", "name": "Andrew Holleran", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice_and_Guides", "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice and Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/custom/image/6903687a-a7dc-11e9-896c-0bef6d6c9301.jpg?resize=600%2C314", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751667", "eventUri": "eng-9751667", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 179, "relevance": 1}

What are her chances?", "body": "Former US President Barack Obama listens as former first lady Michelle Obama speaks during the unveiling of their official White House portraits, in the East Room of the White House, in Washington, US, September, 7, 2022. File Image/Reuters\n\nMichelle Obama's popularity within Democratic circles and beyond is undeniable. As the spouse of former United States President Barack Obama, she left a lasting impression during her tenure as First Lady of the US, championing various social causes and maintaining a high public profile.\n\nWith the political landscape in the United States having undergone a seismic shift following US President Joe Biden's decision to withdraw from the 2024 US presidential race. The development has sparked widespread speculation and debate about potential replacements, with Michelle Obama's name frequently mentioned as a top contender.\n\nHer potential candidacy has stirred considerable excitement and concern among different political factions.\n\nWhat are Michelle Obama's chances?\n\nA recent Ipsos poll revealed that Michelle Obama is the only hypothetical candidate who could decisively defeat Donald Trump in a head-to-head match-up. The poll showed her leading Trump with 50 per cent to his 39 per cent, while other candidates, including Vice President Kamala Harris, showed a much narrower margin or even a slight deficit against Trump.\n\nAdditionally, a survey by The Center Square Voters\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Voice in collaboration with Noble Predictive Insights indicated that 24 per cent of Democrat-leaning likely voters preferred Michelle Obama over other candidates, with Kamala Harris trailing significantly at 7 per cent.\n\nAre Republicans 'scared'?\n\nRepublican figures have also taken notice of Michelle Obama's potential candidacy. US Senator Kevin Cramer told New York magazine that \"Michelle Obama would probably be the one person that could step in and keep the party united and probably provide a little bit of a moving start because of her obvious notoriety.\"\n\nAlso Read: Why Joe Biden\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decision to drop out is not necessarily good news for Donald Trump\n\nFormer GOP contender Vivek Ramaswamy echoed this sentiment, predicting that neither Joe Biden nor Kamala Harris would secure the Democratic nomination and leaving open the possibility for Michelle Obama to step in.\n\nWhat has Michelle Obama said?\n\nDespite the widespread speculation, Michelle Obama has consistently stated her disinterest in running for office.\n\nIn a Netflix special with Oprah Winfrey, she said, \"Politics is hard. And the people who get into it&mldr; you've got to want it. It's got to be in your soul, because it is so important. It is not in my soul.\" Earlier this year, her office reaffirmed this stance to NBC News, clarifying that she had no plans to run for office in 2024.\n\nHas Barack Obama said anything?\n\nFormer US President Barack Obama's comments have added fuel to the speculation. While praising Joe and Jill Biden, he notably refrained from endorsing Kamala Harris, saying, \"For now, Michelle and I just want to express our love and gratitude to Joe and Jill for leading us so ably and courageously during these perilous times\u00e2\u20ac\u0160\u00e2\u20ac\"\u00e2\u20ac\u0160and for their commitment to the ideals of freedom and equality that this country was founded on.\"\n\nAlso Read | Joe Biden exits, Kamala Harris top contender: Is America ready to vote a woman into the\u00c2 White\u00c2 House?\n\nThe phrase \"for now\" has led some to believe that an endorsement for another candidate, possibly Michelle Obama, might be forthcoming.\n\nWhat does the public want?\n\nThe internet has been abuzz with discussions about Michelle Obama's potential candidacy. Social media platforms, especially X, have seen a surge in posts advocating for her to run.\n\nOne user wrote, \"Please focus on Michelle Obama. Kamala will get thrown under the bus. She is the sacrificial lamb. At the convention, it will be Michelle. Please focus on her statements/behaviour for examination. We will not have enough time once she\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s selected.\"\n\nPolitical analysts and commentators have weighed in on the situation. Some believe that Michelle Obama is the Democrats' best shot at defeating Donald Trump, given her high favorability and public appeal.\n\nDawn Staley, a women's basketball legend and head coach at the University of South Carolina, even made a public appeal to Barack Obama on X: \"Now please let us borrow @MichelleObama for just 4 short years! First Gentleman is a good look for you.\"\n\nBiden's endorsement of Kamala Harris as the Democratic Party's new nominee has not quelled the speculation about Michelle Obama.\n\nThe Democratic Party now faces a critical decision. While Kamala Harris is the potential official nominee, the lingering question remains whether Michelle Obama might be a better choice to unite the party and present a formidable challenge to Donald Trump.\n\nAlso Read: Obama to Pelosi, US Democrats who haven't endorsed Kamala Harris, yet\n\nWith the Democratic National Convention approaching, which reportedly begins on August 19, there is still time for a shift in strategy, potentially leading to a surprise nomination.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "First Lady of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michelle Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipsos", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ipsos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Room", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "East Room"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Cramer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Cramer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jill Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oprah_Winfrey", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oprah Winfrey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Netflix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_South_Carolina", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of South Carolina"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reuters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2024/07/Obamas-2022-Reuters-2024-07-de2e4f6a4bb4471f786fd73ae8c21bba.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751667", "eventUri": "eng-9751667", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-19", "textStart": 5015, "textEnd": 5024}], "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 176, "relevance": 1}

It did not endorse Kamala Harris, who is taking over the top spot on the 2024 Democratic Party ticket. Most of the party is behind Harris since they have no other choice. The party is saddled with two loser candidates, though one -- Harris -- appears to have solved the Democrats' fundraising problems for now. Yet, the most popular Democrat has been mum on Harris, and we know why: he also thinks she can't beat Trump (via NY Post):\n\nFormer president Barack Obama hasn't endorsed Kamala Harris' presidential bid because he doesn't think she can beat Donald Trump, according to a source close to the Biden family.\n\nFollowing Joe Biden's shock resignation from the race on Sunday, and his immediate endorsement of the vice president, most of the Democratic elite have been quick to rally behind Harris -- but Obama is a notable exception.\n\n\"Obama's very upset because he knows she can't win,\" the Biden family source told The Post.\n\n\"Obama knows she's just incompetent -- the border czar who never visited the border, saying that all migrants should have health insurance. She cannot navigate the landmines that are ahead of her.\"\n\nThe turning point for Biden, 81, came after his disastrous performance against Trump in a televised debate in Atlanta last month which, The Post first revealed, was part of an \"elaborate set-up\" to remove him from the race.\n\nBut the source doesn't have high hopes for a TV debate between Trump and Harris. When Biden was still in the race, a second debate was scheduled for September 10.\n\n\"Wait until the debate... She can't debate. She's going to put her foot in her mouth about Israel, Palestine, Ukraine. She's going to say something really stupid,\" the source said.\n\n\"Obama knew this was going to happen, Joe knew this was going to happen. Now she is going to have to answer real questions.\"\n\nThe White House did not respond to The Post's request for comment on this story.\n\nThe former president was bearish on his former vice president's chances to win re-election, which has reportedly driven a wedge between the two men -- Biden still resents Obama passing him over for Hillary Clinton in 2016. The Clintons were reportedly supportive of Biden staying in the race before the president decided to quit on July 21, perhaps a late overture of good faith and support as a makeup for what went down eight years ago.\n\nObama wasn't supportive of Biden's 2020 run and tried to talk him into dropping out behind the scenes in 2024 because he felt the president could win. We've come full circle because Biden, like Obama, also felt that his vice president couldn't win, which partially explained his reluctance to drop out -- a brush with COVID and maybe another more serious medical episode might have forced his hand.\n\nIt's clear that Obama, while a loyal Democrat, knows this ticket isn't it. He may be wrong politically, but he knows how to win. He built a virtually unbeatable coalition -- thank God for term limits -- and he knows Biden-Harris, Harris-whoever is a losing candidacy.

But people close to Obama, who has positioned himself as an impartial elder statesman above intraparty machinations, said not to read too much into it -- and had no alternate candidate in mind when he made the decision not to immediately endorse Harris.\n\nObama adopted an identical stance four years ago when Biden's aides pressured him to endorse early in the Democratic primaries before Sen. Bernie Sanders dropped out. (Obama's favored phrase back then was \"I don't want to thumb the scale.\") Endorsing too early now would also be a political mistake -- fueling criticism that Harris' nomination, should it come, was a coronation rather than the best possible consensus under rushed circumstances, they said.\n\nInstead, Obama sees his role as helping to quickly \"unite the party once we have a nominee,\" a person familiar with his thinking said.\n\nBut there are other more personal considerations, exacerbating Obama's innate caution.\n\nBiden is a deeply prideful man, and he has never fully forgiven Obama for quietly backing former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the 2016 campaign, and Biden still believes he could have beaten former President Donald Trump that year if given the chance. Nor was Biden pleased when Obama told him that he should consider sitting out 2020, too, people in his circle have said.\n\nObama wanted Sunday to be about Biden, a celebration of his accomplishments -- and does not feel pressured to act hastily, according to a former White House official who speaks with the former president regularly.", "source": {"uri": "telegraphindia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Telegraph"}, "authors": [{"uri": "peter_baker@telegraphindia.com", "name": "Peter Baker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "glenn_thrush@telegraphindia.com", "name": "Glenn Thrush", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bernie Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice_and_Guides", "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice and Guides", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://assets.telegraphindia.com/telegraph/2023/Jul/1690258431_newobama.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751667", "eventUri": "eng-9751667", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2470588235294118, "wgt": 174, "relevance": 1}

You can check out at any time. More info\n\nMichelle Obama has been hailed as the \"only person who can beat Donald Trump \" following Joe Biden's shocking withdrawal from his re-election campaign. Biden, 81, has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to be the Democrat presidential candidate in the race against Trump.\n\nHowever, some figures have shown their support for Obama, who was the First Lady of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Dragons' Den entrepreneur Steven Bartlett, 31, previously supported Obama, a Princeton University and Harvard Law School graduate and former associate dean of student services at the University of Chicago.\n\nThe celebrity's sentiment has been echoed by others on X (formerly Twitter) tonight, following Biden's letter on social media. It read: \"While it has been my intention to seek re-election, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling the duties as President for the remainder of my term.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Joe Biden announces he won't run in US election - and Donald Trump's reaction\n\nREAD MORE: First Minister frontrunner drops out of race to replace Vaughan Gething\n\nMinutes after the letter was posted by the 81-year-old politician, numerous tweets praised Obama, 60, and urged her to enter the race. Senator Kevin Cramer of North Dakota said this week: \"I don't think I'd be revealing any sort of polling secrets if I said Michelle Obama would probably be the one person that could step in and keep the party united and probably provide a little bit of a moving start because of her obvious notoriety,\" reports the Mirror.\n\nOne woman took to Twitter this evening, stating emphatically: \"If they choose anyone other than Kamala Harris or Michelle Obama, I will NOT be voting.\" Another voiced her support for Michelle Obama: \"Michelle Obama... your country needs you... PLEASE throw your hat in the presidential race... you can beat him and think your husband was the first black president and you can be the first black and woman... power couple extraordinaire.\"\n\nA different user expressed their preference: \"Michelle Obama is the only one who'll defeat Trump.\" Similarly, another comment on social media read: \"In my opinion, Michelle Obama is the only real contender that could beat Trump - she would be able to energize voters, the party and has name recognition.\"\n\nHowever, father-of-four Biden shared his stance online: \"Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year. Democrats - it's time to come together and beat Trump.\"\n\nAmidst his self-isolation at his Delaware beach house following a COVID-19 diagnosis last week, Biden has been consulting with a tight-knit group of family and trusted advisers about his political path forward. He announced his intention to address the nation later in the week to elaborate on his decision.\n\nThe news of Biden's endorsement was a surprise to many senior campaign and White House staff, who were informed just moments before the announcement went public, as per sources in the know. The past few days have seen Biden contemplating his political journey, with the final choice being kept under wraps until now.\n\nMichelle Obama has not yet responded publicly to these comments, but Barack Obama, noted at the end of his statement following the news Biden is quitting: \"For now, Michelle and I just want to express our love and gratitude to Joe and Jill for leading us so ably and courageously during these perilous times -- and for their commitment to the ideals of freedom and equality that this country was founded on.\"", "source": {"uri": "walesonline.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "WalesOnline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bradley_jolly@walesonline.co.uk", "name": "Bradley Jolly", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "bethany_gavaghan@walesonline.co.uk", "name": "Bethany Gavaghan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michelle Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Law_School", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Harvard Law School"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "First Lady of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princeton_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Princeton University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrepreneurship", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Entrepreneurship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Chicago", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Chicago"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Cramer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Cramer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister_of_Scotland", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First Minister of Scotland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Office_of_the_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Executive Office of the President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://i2-prod.walesonline.co.uk/news/uk-news/article29585325.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_denmark-us-politics-literature.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751667", "eventUri": "eng-9751667", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

Obama is observing closely with the intention of promoting party unity once a nominee, whether Harris or another candidate, is selected.\n\nThe adviser explained that Obama's statement on Sunday was aimed at maintaining the focus on Biden, who had announced he would not seek reelection. Obama had been actively supportive of Biden's reelection campaign, participating in numerous fundraisers that generated millions of dollars. Additionally, Obama engaged in moderated discussions with Biden and urged supporters to contribute to fundraising efforts.\n\nDemocrats are progressing swiftly towards nominating Kamala Harris as their presidential candidate, having adopted the necessary rules on Wednesday to guide the selection process. Formal voting to officially nominate Harris is expected to commence on August 1.\n\nThe newly adopted rules outline procedures for ceremonial votes for both president and vice president at the Democratic convention in Chicago, scheduled for August 19-22.

He praised his domestic agenda and foreign policy achievements. Even as Joe Biden quit the race and endorsed Vice-President Kamala Harris, Obama has refused to endorse any candidate. Former US President Barack Obama responded to incumbent president Joe Biden's decision to end his election campaign. However, even as calls from certain quarters emerge on the replacement candidate, he refused to back any particular candidate. Joe Biden had earlier served as the Vice-President during the years of Obama's presidency.\n\nMany of the Democratic party supporters took to social media and demanded that Michelle Obama replace Joe Biden on the ballot box ahead of the US Presidential Election in November. As per various surveys, in a hypothetical competition between Donald Trump and Michelle Obama, the latter had a 11-point lead over the former president. She has refused to participate in any of the political events.\n\nThe former president heaped praises on Joe Biden and termed his decision to quit the presidential race as a visionary movie. He said that Biden had put the interests of the US ahead of his own narrow political interests. He said that this decision will have a far-reaching impact.\n\nHe hailed several reforms undertaken by Biden on the domestic front. First and foremost, the US had been severely impacted due to the COVID-19 crisis. Obama said that Biden is to be credited with the economic recovery which had led to higher economic growth and creation of jobs in the US. He also pointed out that for the first time in 30-years, the gun laws had been amended.\n\nLashing out at Trump, Obama said that Biden's presidency brought relief to all the Americans from falsehood and a divisive strategy which had split the country.\n\nObama also added that several of Biden administration's foreign policies have helped the US advance its interests and promote global peace and security. Obama said that the war in Ukraine and NATO had been strengthened by Joe Biden leading to a moral boost.\n\nMany of the Democrats took to social media and demanded that the former First Lady and Barack Obama's wife Michelle Obama be issued a presidential nomination by the party. Various national surveys have stated that she is the only Democrat who is capable of defeating Donald Trump.\n\nIn this regard, Obama has refused to endorse any Democrat including Vice-President Kamala Harris who has already been endorsed by Joe Biden. Obama has called on the party to hold a national convention and decide on a candidate who is capable of taking forward the party's agenda. He highlighted the importance of defeating Trump in the upcoming presidential election.\n\nWhich provision of the US Constitution confers the right to bear fire arms by a common citizen?\n\nEvery US citizen has the constitutional right to carry fire arms.

He lent his support to Biden during fundraisers, which were among some of the biggest blockbuster events of his campaign. He's also a draw during campaign events.\n\nHis backing could help activate and sustain energy -- and fundraising -- for Harris' campaign.

In Obama's statement following Biden's surprise suspension, he did not mention the vice president.\n\nHowever, Obama, who has known Harris for more than 20 years, thinks the vice president is off to an impressive start, the source told the Washington Examiner.\n\nAccording to the source, Obama believes it's important for Democrats to engage in a legitimate process where delegates can select the new nominee. Obama notably did not endorse Biden early on during the 2020 Democratic primary, and as Biden weighed a 2016 presidential run, Obama quietly worked to convince him not to enter the race against Hillary Clinton.\n\nDemocrats quickly coalesced around Harris as the new nominee after Biden threw his support behind her Sunday. Top leaders on Capitol Hill endorsed Harris in the days following Biden's withdrawal, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY). Harris raised $81 million in 24 hours after Biden dropped out, and, in total, she raised $126 million by Tuesday. Harris has secured more than the 1,976 delegates needed to likely lead the Democratic ticket.\n\nThe Democratic National Convention approved a new time frame Wednesday that limits the amount of time any other challengers have to announce a presidential campaign which nearly guarantees Harris will become the nominee during a virtual roll call that will be held by Aug. 7 to comply with state ballot certification deadlines.\n\n\"We are all working hard to execute this nomination with transparency, with fairness, and efficiency,\" Jaime Harrison, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, told the committee members.\n\nOne day later, Jeffries denied there were any attempts to rig the nominee for Harris during a press conference.\n\n\"What we've seen over the last few days is that the American people, all across the land, have been excited, enthusiastic, and energized by the candidacy of Vice President Harris,\" Jeffries said, later claiming he hadn't heard complaints about the nomination process.\n\n\"I haven't heard any of that from anyone that I'm privileged to represent back home in New York City, or in any of my travels around the country, or from any single member of the House Democratic Caucus, or from any of our supporters who have embraced the candidacy of Vice President Kamala Harris,\" he added. \"This was all organic in terms of the surge in enthusiasm and energy directed at Vice President Harris's campaign.\"\n\nHowever, according to one report from the New York Post, part of Obama's reticence in endorsing Harris is because he doesn't think she can defeat former President Donald Trump. \"Obama was shocked\" that Biden endorsed Harris roughly 30 minutes after his Sunday announcement, a source told the outlet. Former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich, who was convicted and jailed for corruption charges, told the outlet he believes Obama was pivotal in pressuring Biden to step away from the ticket.\n\nObama allegedly wanted Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ) to replace Biden as the Democratic presidential nominee, the source said. The Washington Examiner has not verified these claims, and Obama's office did not comment on these claims. The Harris campaign did respond to a request for comment.\n\nKelly dodged answering the question in response to inquiries from the Washington Examiner.\n\n\"I can't speak,\" Kelly said when asked about Obama's delayed endorsement of Harris.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nObama does have a previous connection with Kelly's family. He spoke at the memorial for the victims of the 2011 Tuscon, Arizona, shooting, of which former Arizona Rep. Gabby Giffords, Kelly's wife, was seriously injured after a failed assassination attempt. He also visited Gifford and other victims at the University Medical Center in the aftermath of the shooting.\n\nKelly is among the top contenders to join the Harris ticket as her running mate, but if he is selected, Democrats will need to find another candidate who can replace his high-profile Senate seat in the top battleground state that will determine control of the White House and Senate.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mabinty_quarshie@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Mabinty Quarshie", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Examiner", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington Examiner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_United_States_Electoral_College_vote_count", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2021 United States Electoral College vote count"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaime_Harrison", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jaime Harrison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Democratic_Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "House Democratic Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabby_Giffords", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gabby Giffords"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_Blagojevich", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rod Blagojevich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_John_F._Kennedy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assassination of John F.

But according to a New York Times piece by Glenn Thrush, this is not a snub from Obama to Kamala, but a calculated decision -- driven by several factors.\n\n'Obama's support would have made it easier for Kamala'\n\nKamala Harris' nomination -- she has already received the endorsement of the maximum Democrats -- should not look like a coronation and but as a decision reached through consensus.Obama did the same thing four years ago when Biden's aides pressured him to endorse early in the Democratic primaries before Senator Bernie Sanders dropped out.\n\nObama wants to play a role in helping to quickly united the party behind the nominee.\n\nObama didn't want to upset Biden\n\nThe NYT analysis said that Biden never forgave Obama for backing Hillary Clinton in the 2016 campaign because Biden believe he could have beaten Trump in the election. Biden was also not pleased when Obama discouraged him to contest in the 2020 election. So Obama was cautious to not rush to support Kamala Harris the moment Biden announced his \"retirement\".\n\n'Sunday was all about Biden'\n\nBiden's announcement on Sunday that he would be sitting out this election was most awaited for the Democrats but it also brought the curtains down on Biden's long political career. Obama did not want to deflect the attention to Harris and wanted Sunday to be about Biden -- a celebration of his accomplishments.\n\nWhat Obama wrote for Biden\n\nObama issued a long statement celebrating Biden's career. \"Joe Biden has been one of America's most consequential presidents, as well as a dear friend and partner to me. Today, we've also been reminded -- again -- that he's a patriot of the highest order,\" the statement read.\n\n\"Sixteen years ago, when I began my search for a vice president, I knew about Joe's remarkable career in public service. But what I came to admire even more was his character -- his deep empathy and hard-earned resilience; his fundamental decency and belief that everyone counts.\"\n\n\"...I also know Joe has never backed down from a fight. For him to look at the political landscape and decide that he should pass the torch to a new nominee is surely one of the toughest in his life. But I know he wouldn't make this decision unless he believed it was right for America. It's a testament to Joe Biden's love of country -- and a historic example of a genuine public servant once again putting the interests of the American people ahead of his own that future generations of leaders will do well to follow,\" he wrote.\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

He has not spoken again since.\n\nMany theories have emerged for why Obama failed to endorse Harris; ranging from not believing she is the best candidate to take on Trump, to speculation that his wife, Michelle Obama, plans to run.\n\nMichelle is the only Democrat who consistently polls higher than Trump, but she has repeatedly insisted she is not interested in politics and does not want the job. Announcing a run now would also be fraught with challenges following the barrage of Democrat endorsements for Harris on Monday.\n\nAndrew Rudalevige, a visiting professor of political science at the London School of Economics, told : \"I think he was trying to avoid looking like a 'kingmaker' in case other contenders emerged.\n\n\"But now that the VP seems to have earned a majority of DNC delegates, I would expect his endorsement to follow quickly.\"\n\nAccording to The New York Times citing an unnamed White House official, Obama's lack of endorsement may be for personal reasons. The report details how Biden has never fully forgiven Obama for quietly backing his secretary of state Hillary Clinton in the 2016 campaign - so Obama wanted Sunday to be about Biden, a celebration of his accomplishments.\n\nObama has a history of not rushing into endorsing candidates. Despite coming under pressure from aides to endorse Biden during his run against Bernie Sanders, he waited until the Senator from Vermont had stepped aside before endorsing his former vice president.\n\nIt is also widely believed that Obama may also want to stay out of internal party politics to maintain stability and unity within the party.\n\nPolitical analysts have voiced their concern about Harris's background as a senator from strongly Democratic California. Democrats need to win swing states and they often have a preference for candidates like Governor Josh Shapiro from Pennsylvania.\n\nHowever, Shapiro has already backed Harris. It may come as little surprise that Democratic candidates are not queuing up to take on Harris with her seemingly endless endorsements, stacked with Biden's campaign war chest, and risk standing in the way of a historic first female US president.\n\nBut experts warn that such delays in backing Harris give the Trump campaign an opportunity to define Harris's image - before she gets the opportunity to do it herself.\n\nProfessor Rudalevige said Harris is still \"very undefined and \"does not have the same name recognition as Trump. She needs to get out of the box quickly before the Trump campaign define her image,\" he added.", "source": {"uri": "inews.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "inews.co.uk"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Labor Day? Or the deadline that the DNC quietly set yesterday for any other competitors?\n\nWhen Joe Biden tweeted his withdrawal from the Democrat presidential nomination on Sunday and (almost) immediately endorsed Kamala Harris, party leaders rushed to add their support. Even the Dump Biden leaders who had been demanding an \"open process\" to replace Biden -- Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer -- were on board with The Anointment within 24 hours. The Clintons climbed aboard the Kamacela around the same time.\n\nNotably absent -- the man who picked Joe Biden as his own running mate. After a couple of days of head-scratching by observers, NBC News reports that Barack Obama will finally ready an endorsement ... \"soon\"?\n\nFormer President Barack Obama and Vice President Kamala Harris have been in close touch since she announced her presidential candidacy Sunday, having multiple conversations this week as she kicks off her campaign, according to four people familiar with their discussions.\n\nObama privately has fully supported Harris' candidacy and plans to endorse her soon, these people said.\n\n\"He has been in regular contact with her and thinks she's been off to a great start,\" one of them said.\n\nObama is one of the only high-profile Democrats in the country who has yet to endorse Harris. While other party leaders have stepped forward to publicly back her, he has so far kept his support private.\n\nWhat's the point of playing coy? It can't be to protect Biden's dignity by withholding an endorsement until after his Oval Office address last night. Obama had joined forces with other Dump Biden activists in an attempt to publicly push Biden into withdrawing from the nomination. His fingerprints were so visible that Biden's campaign openly tore into Obama for pushing Biden out in 2016 and helping to get Trump elected. Dignity in this process died shortly after the June 27 debate.\n\nBesides, Biden himself was the first to endorse Harris, on Sunday afternoon via Twitter/X. He called into Harris' visit to campaign HQ the next day in an awkward show of support as well. That allowed everyone else to line up quickly behind Harris and attempt to shut down the chaos that the Dump Biden movement and the debate exposure of the years-long cover-up of Biden's senility created.\n\nAnd it can't be for Obama to wait for a moment for the dramatic reveal. He's the only significant Democrat left to offer a public endorsement. Even the Protection Racket Media has gone into full Winston Smith Mode on Harris' behalf, erasing their own records of her status as border czar and declaring all criticisms of The Anointed One to be racist/sexist/ageist/ableist/transphobic/whateverist. He could have held a presser on Tuesday and still would have made himself The Final Word.\n\nSo what's taking so long? Especially if Obama has \"fully supported\" Harris' candidacy in private? Obama wanted Biden to withdraw; Biden withdrew. The likeliest outcome of that was always going to be Harris as the nominee without an open convention, or an \"open process.\" None of this makes much sense politically, unless Obama wants to wait to see if anyone else forces a competition for the nomination.\n\nThus we get back to the three-day window the DNC created, starting today, for any new entrants into the nomination contest. One has to wonder whether Obama sees the trap that Democrats have set for themselves by anointing a San Francisco Democrat with no real accomplishments and a track record of media incompetence as the nominee without considering better options. And if that's the case, the definition of \"soon\" may well be Saturday 6 pm ET, when that window for buyer's remorse officially closes at the DNC.", "source": {"uri": "hotair.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "HotAir"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ed_morrissey@hotair.com", "name": "Ed Morrissey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_Day", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Labor Day"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bill Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racketeering", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racketeering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anointing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anointing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dementia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dementia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ageism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transphobia", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Transphobia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sexism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2022/95/cebc2054-7032-416f-b228-618d3a0af6de.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751667", "eventUri": "eng-9751667", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 1900, "textEnd": 1907}], "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

Credit: Marc Nozell/Flickr/CC BY 2.0\n\nFormer President Barack Obama has not endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for the 2024 presidential race, reportedly due to his belief that she cannot defeat Donald Trump. According to a source close to the Biden family, Obama's reluctance stems from doubts about Harris' competency and electability.\n\nFollowing President Joe Biden's unexpected resignation from the race and his immediate endorsement of Harris, the Democratic elite swiftly rallied behind her. However, Obama's notable absence from this show of support has raised eyebrows within political circles, as per New York Post.\n\nThe Biden family source revealed that Obama is deeply concerned about Harris' ability to win the presidency. Criticisms of Harris' performance, particularly her handling of border issues and controversial statements about health insurance for migrants, have fueled these concerns. Obama reportedly believes Harris lacks the ability to navigate the complex political landscape and handle the tough questions that lie ahead.\n\nThe turning point for Biden came after a disastrous debate performance against Trump in Atlanta, which insiders claim was part of an orchestrated effort to push him out of the race. Despite this maneuvering, doubts remain about Harris' ability to effectively debate Trump, with concerns that she might falter on key issues such as Israel, Palestine, and Ukraine.\n\nWhile the White House has not commented on these developments, the source indicated that Obama had hoped to replace Biden with a more viable candidate, such as Arizona Senator and former astronaut Mark Kelly. The immediate endorsement of Harris by Biden reportedly came as a shock to Obama and disrupted his plans.\n\nObama's frustration with the current situation is evident, and his decision to withhold an endorsement reflects his dissatisfaction. Another Democratic insider suggested that Obama's surprise at Biden's political move underscores his limited perspective on politics, often driven by personal interests.\n\nRod Blagojevich, the disgraced former governor of Illinois, also weighed in, suggesting that Obama played a crucial role in orchestrating Biden's exit from the race. Blagojevich, who now supports Trump, described Obama as the key figure behind Biden's decision to step aside, likening him to a \"Chicago ward boss\" exerting control from behind the scenes.\n\nThe strained relationship between Obama and Biden has historical roots. Obama previously persuaded Biden not to run for the presidency in 2016, favoring Hillary Clinton as the Democratic candidate. Biden later expressed frustration with Obama's lack of support during that period.\n\nAs the Democratic National Convention approaches, the internal party dynamics and Obama's influence remain focal points. The uncertainty surrounding Harris' candidacy and Obama's reluctance to endorse her add complexity to the Democratic Party's strategy for the upcoming election.\n\nThe political landscape continues to evolve, with Harris' supporters hoping she can overcome these challenges and prove her detractors wrong.

However, figures online have expressed their support for Obama, who served as the first lady of the United States from 2009 to 2017.\n\nDragons' Den entrepreneur Steven Bartlett, 31, previously backed Obama, a graduate of Princeton University and Harvard Law School and a former associate dean of student services at the University of Chicago.\n\nThe celeb's message has been echoed by others on X, which was Twitter, tonight, following Biden's letter on social media. It read: \"While it has been my intention to seek re-election, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling the duties as President for the remainder of my term.\"\n\nMinutes after the letter was posted by the 81-year-old politician, scores of tweets praised Obama, 60, and called on her to throw her hat in the ring. Senator Kevin Cramer of North Dakota had said this week: \"I don't think I'd be revealing any sort of polling secrets if I said Michelle Obama would probably be the one person that could step in and keep the party united and probably provide a little bit of a moving start because of her obvious notoriety.\"\n\nOne woman tweeted tonight: \"If they choose anyone other than Kamala Harris or Michelle Obama, I will NOT be voting.\" Another posted: \"Michelle Obama... your country needs you...PLEASE throw your hat in the presidential race...you can beat him and think your husband was the first black president and you can be the first black and woman...power couple extraordinaire.\"\n\nAnother X user said: \"Michelle Obama is the only one who'll defeat Trump.\" Meanwhile, another on social media shared: \"In my opinion, Michelle Obama is the only real contender that could beat Trump - she would be able to energize voters, the party and has name recognition.\"\n\nBut father-of-four Biden said online: \"Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year. Democrats -- it's time to come together and beat Trump.\"\n\nBiden's decision came as he has been isolating at his Delaware beach house after being diagnosed with COVID-19 last week, huddling with a shrinking circle of close confidants and family members about his political future. Biden said he would address the nation later this week to provide \"detail\" about his decision.\n\nSenior campaign and White House staff were notified just minutes before the letter went out, according to people familiar with the matter.

It took the format of a folksy, light-hearted video chat between Harris and former president Barack Obama.\n\nThe former president, looking relaxed in an open-necked shirt and dark suit, tells her the work can be gruelling and asks if she has any tips to get through the day. Harris replies that she works out every morning, regardless of how much sleep she's had.\n\nHe asks what music she listens to; she says Mary J Blige. She then asks about his relationship with Biden; what does she need to know about the man who worked for him as vice president from 2009 to 2017?\n\nObama says Biden likes ice cream, pasta with red sauce, and that he loves his aviator sunglasses. \"He knows he looks good in them,\" he adds, signing off with a jovial \"Make sure you get those workouts in, get enough sleep and stay healthy.\"\n\nThe former California senator from Oakland and now America's first female vice president had the endorsement of one of the most popular public figures in America.\n\nAfter that November's election, when Biden and Harris emerged victorious, former first lady Michelle Obama tweeted her congratulations: \"I'm beyond thrilled that my friend Joe Biden and our first Black and Indian-American woman vice president, Kamala Harris, are headed to restore some dignity, competence, and heart at the White House. Our country sorely needs it.\"\n\nFast-forward to today, and with Biden now out of the race and a raft of endorsements from high-profile politicians in her party for Harris to replace him as the Democratic nominee for president, one name is conspicuous by its absence: Barack Obama.\n\nIt's an omission so glaring that it's generated headlines across the world. The question is: why hasn't that endorsement by such an imposing presence in the Democratic Party come?\n\nAfter Biden announced his withdrawal, he threw his support behind Harris, saying picking her as his vice president was the best decision he'd made, and offering his \"full support and endorsement\" in her own presidential run.\n\nIn a joint statement, former president Bill Clinton and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton said they were \"honoured to join the president in endorsing vice president Harris and will do whatever we can to support her.\"\n\nThen came Senator Elizabeth Warren, who said Harris could \"unite our party, take on Donald Trump, and win in November.\" Other heavyweights followed: California governor Gavin Newsom, who himself has been mooted as a potential candidate; transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg; Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer.\n\nOn Monday, despite initially calling for an open primary, former speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi gave her support to Harris. \"Politically, make no mistake,\" she said. \"Kamala Harris as a woman in politics is brilliantly astute - and I have full confidence that she will lead us to victory in November.\"\n\nBut despite Obama writing an affectionate tribute to his own former vice president and friend Biden - in which he called him a \"patriot of the highest order\" - the only reference to what would come next was the following line: \"I have extraordinary confidence that the leaders of our party will be able to create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges.\"\n\nRepublicans jumped on the statement, calling it a snub. Yet some politicos were unsurprised. \"Everyone chill out,\" wrote one political observer. \"Barack Obama not immediately endorsing Kamala Harris was NOT a snub. It's strategy. In case there's a contested nomination process, Obama, now an elder statesman, would play the role of peacemaker and bring unity. He'll work hard to elect her. No doubt.\"\n\nAnother said, \"I would guess he [Obama] wants to wait to let things shake out on their own rather than being accused of anointing someone or orchestrating things.\"\n\nTexas-based political consultant David Logan told The Independent that Obama not immediately endorsing her was just a sign that he is endorsing the correct political process. \"With the Democratic convention due to take place in his hometown of Chicago, I'm sure he's just letting the party do its thing; letting those who have been elected run the party.\"\n\nLike Obama, Harris was raised by her mother after her parents separated. Shyamala Gopalan emigrated to the US from India in the 1950s to do a master's, and later a PhD, in nutrition and endocrinology at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nThat's where she met Harris's father, Donald, who had come to the US from Jamaica to study economics. The couple married in 1963. Donald taught economics at Stanford University, and Shyamala became a renowned breast cancer researcher.\n\nThey had two children - Kamala and her younger sister Maya - and split when Kamala was seven years old. Remembering that time Harris wrote in her memoir that her mother \"understood very well that she was raising two black daughters\". She wanted to make sure \"we would grow into confident, proud black women\". Shyamala died in 2009.\n\nAlso like Obama and his wife, Michelle, Kamala and her sister both studied law and navigated a career in politics. After completing her political science and economics undergraduate studies at the historically black Howard University in Washington, DC, Harris went to law school in California before becoming a state prosecutor.\n\nIn 2004 she was elected as district attorney of San Francisco, and a couple of years after Obama became the first black president of America in 2009, she became the first woman, Black American and first Asian American to be elected attorney general of California.\n\nThe pair first met when he ran for US Senate in 2004, and Harris was an early supporter of his presidential bid at a time when Clinton was the establishment favourite. She campaigned for him in his senate race 20 years ago when she was the district attorney of San Francisco, then endorsed his bid for the presidency in 2007.\n\nIn 2013, he was forced to apologise after calling her the \"best-looking attorney general in the country\" at a Democratic fundraiser.\n\n\"They are old friends and good friends and he did not want in any way to diminish the attorney general's professional accomplishments and her capabilities,\" White House spokesperson Jay Carney said at the time. In 2016, when Harris ran for the senate, Obama appeared in a television ad and championed her as a \"fearless fighter\".\n\nIn October 2021, Michelle Obama posted a picture of her and Harris hugging on Twitter to mark Harris's birthday. \"Happy birthday to a thoughtful, compassionate, and relentless leader,\" she wrote. \"We are so lucky to have you serving our country!\"\n\nWhen she became vice president, she moved in with her husband Doug Emhoff, an entertainment lawyer who she married in 2014 after meeting on a blind date. Step-mother to Emhoff's children, Cole and Ella, now 29 and 25, she is known as \"Momala\" and is said to have the support of their mother Kerstin Emhoff, who attended the presidential inauguration in 2021.\n\nToday, she lives with Doug in her official residence in a quiet enclave in Washington, DC - a place she's called home for the last three years. But if the Obamas and Harris and Emhoff socialise outside of work, they keep it quiet.\n\n\"I don't think these people have social lives outside of work at all,\" Logan laughs. \"But I would be shocked if there was any malice, because Obama was one of many who encouraged Biden to drop out, so I can't see any reason why he'd then say 'maybe it shouldn't be her'. That would have been a conversation he'd have had with Biden well in advance. Going from the first Black man to be president to the first Black woman - there seems no reason he wouldn't be excited.\"\n\nLike Obama, throughout Harris's career, there have been so many firsts, encompassing race, and in her case, gender. Any speculation that Obama may be holding back in the hope of his wife Michelle winning the nomination is without any foundation, according to those in the know on Capitol Hill.\n\nDespite a recent Ipsos poll revealing that is the only hypothetical candidate to stop Trump, Michelle is said to have no such aspirations. It is Harris hoping to become America's first woman president; the first female black - and Asian American - commander in chief. It is Harris wanting to bring new hope to a divided country, and make her \"old friend and good friend\" Obama proud.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The

Text \"Alerts\" to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.\n\nBefore Biden dropped out of the race, Obama broke with a growing list of prominent Democrats in publicly sticking by Biden, even as concerns mounted over the 81-year-old president's advanced age and mental acuity following his poor debate performance late last month. Obama doubled down on his support for Biden in a June 28 post on X, saying, \"Bad debate nights happen. Trust me, I know\" (Biden had initially blamed his debate performance on a cold and exhaustive travel, reiterating the line that the debate was simply a bad night). But Obama's support for Biden has not been completely unwavering, even in the past month, with a Politico report indicating Obama did not try to stop actor and Democratic donor George Clooney from calling on Biden to drop out of the race earlier this month. Some Obama staffers also called on Biden to drop out, leading Biden to reportedly grow frustrated with Obama and believe his former boss was undermining him behind the scenes -- though no evidence has emerged that Obama tried to sway the party away from Biden. The two are close, but they have a complicated and sometimes tense relationship: Biden reportedly regrets listening to Obama in 2016 when he urged him not to run for president, instead backing former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\n\nHarris could officially become the party nominee at the Democratic National Convention, which is scheduled for Aug. 19-Aug. 22 in Chicago, though the vice president could land the nomination even sooner, following a rules change the Democratic National Convention's rules panel approved on Wednesday. With that rules change -- which gives Democrats until Saturday to declare their candidacies -- Harris could become the nominee as early as Aug. 1.\n\nBiden's performance at CNN's presidential debate -- when he appeared to lose his train of thought and spoke in a whispery, hoarse voice -- ignited a growing call from Democratic lawmakers, donors and pundits for Biden to end his re-election campaign. Many of those Democrats urged him to \"pass the torch,\" with some directly supporting Harris, despite her poor popularity and polls showing her losing to Trump in key swing states. As those calls continued to add up, Biden announced on Sunday he would end his campaign, and quickly endorsed Harris. In the days that followed, Harris landed major endorsements and pulled off a record setting first day of fundraising, raising $81 million in 24 hours.", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/66a26e8b00d1f06166b6b8ce/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=3014,1694,x0,y0,safe&height=600&width=1200&fit=bounds", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751667", "eventUri": "eng-9751667", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-19", "dateEnd": "2024-08-22", "textStart": 1900, "textEnd": 1915}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-28", "textStart": 815, "textEnd": 822}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-01", "textStart": 2229, "textEnd": 2235}], "sentiment": -0.1450980392156863, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

He has never fully forgiven Obama for quietly backing former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the 2016 campaign. Biden still believes he could have beaten former President Donald Trump that year if given the chance. People in his circle have said Biden was not pleased when Obama told him that he should consider sitting out 2020, too.\n\nObama wanted Sunday to be about Biden, a celebration of his accomplishments -- and does not feel pressured to act hastily, according to a former White House official who regularly speaks with the former president, reports the Times.\n\nAre you buying this?

He lent his support to Biden during fundraisers, which were among some of the biggest blockbuster events of his campaign. He's also a draw during campaign events.\n\nHis backing could help activate and sustain energy -- and fundraising -- for Harris' campaign. And he's likely to get on the campaign trail for Harris once she is officially the presumptive nominee.\n\nHarris and Obama have been in regular touch over the years, with the former president serving as a sounding board dating back to her time as attorney general in California. The two have spoken multiple times in recent days as she worked to consolidate party support for the Democratic nomination after President Joe Biden's decision to end his reelection bid.\n\nObama had reportedly been among the Democratic leaders who privately urged Biden to reconsider his candidacy. But Obama withheld his endorsement even as Biden, his former vice president, anointed her as his heir apparent.\n\nInstead, Obama said in a statement on Sunday, \"We will be navigating uncharted waters in the days ahead. But I have extraordinary confidence that the leaders of our party will be able to create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges.\"\n\nThat move was criticized by many Democrats, who saw it as an insult. On a Black Men for Harris call this week, multiple men on the call knocked Obama for holding his powder dry, especially for a Black woman.\n\nOne attendee told POLITICO that the frustration on the call was obvious: \"The message was, 'We need to come together as Black men to support her and protect her and encourage those who have not done it, to do so.'\"\n\nBut the wait before endorsing was intentional. A person familiar with Obama's thinking said he didn't want to put his thumb on the scale as the party worked through the process of determining its nominee.\n\n\"He believed it was important for the party to have a legitimate process where delegates select our new nominee, and he thinks VP Harris has been off to an impressive start,\" the person said.\n\nNow that Harris is clearly on the glide path to the nomination, Obama plans to offer his backing to the freshly minted Democratic candidate.\n\nObama withheld his endorsement during the 2020 primary, even though his own vice president was in the running, because he saw himself as an elder statesman who should let the party organically choose its future.\n\nIt's unclear what the actual endorsement will look like, but it's likely to be more than just a paper statement, according to those people familiar.", "source": {"uri": "politico.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "POLITICO"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_nominee", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidential nominee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heir_apparent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heir apparent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attorney general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party_Supplies", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Entertainment/Party Supplies", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Children/Parties", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party_Planning", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Party Planning", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/a7b7cb6/2147483647/legacy_thumbnail/1200x799%3E/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fd5%2F4a%2F590c4be64dc2b362f1513147f6f0%2Fbiden-01712.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751667", "eventUri": "eng-9751667", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

Trump and an internal party coup against Biden, the lack of Obama's formal nod to the ditzy DEI hire has been a mystery that may have just been solved.\n\nThe nation's 44th president hasn't come out in favor of Biden's heir apparent because \"he knows she can't win,\" according to a bombshell New York Post report.\n\n\"Obama's very upset because he knows she can't win,\" a source close to Biden's family told the outlet, a revealing insight into the former president's thinking.\n\n\"Obama knows she's just incompetent -- the border czar who never visited the border, saying that all migrants should have health insurance. She cannot navigate the landmines that are ahead of her,\" the unnamed source added. \"When you are running for president there are things you can and can't say.\"\n\nThe border czar matter is of particular concern for Democrats and their media partners who have been busy scrubbing their prior reporting to downplay Harris's complete and total failure after her boss delegated authority to her on the illegal alien problem.\n\n\"Wait until the debate... She can't debate. She's going to put her foot in her mouth about Israel, Palestine, Ukraine. She's going to say something really stupid,\" the source added, referring to her upcoming debate with Trump who is eager to get into the ring with her after delivering the knockout punch to Biden during the CNN debate last month.\n\n\"Obama knew this was going to happen, Joe knew this was going to happen. Now she is going to have to answer real questions,\" the source said, suggesting that there is only so much that the media can do to shroud Harris in a protective cocoon of fawning coverage and that she could crash and burn if the safety net is briefly removed during a one-on-one with Trump.\n\nAccording to the source, Obama wanted Biden gone and a key aspect of the plan was getting his Hollywood buddy George Clooney to pen an op-ed for the New York Times calling for the deeply unpopular octogenarian to quit.\n\nBut the scheming former president was caught off guard when Biden tabbed Harris as his successor.\n\n\"Obama was shocked\" when Biden immediately endorsed her and he is said to have wanted former astronaut Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ) \"at the top of the ticket\" when the party holds its convention in Chicago next month.\n\nThe source said that Obama is \"furious\" that things haven't gone as planned which is why he hasn't joined his party in uniting behind Harris.\n\nThe Post cites another \"well-placed Democrat source\" who said that \"Obama being surprised by a smart political decision actually makes sense when coupled with his personal inability to see politics beyond his singular, immediate interests.\"\n\n\"Obama always thinks he is the smartest and coolest guy in the room. He's friends with George Clooney, after all,\" the second source said.\n\nFormer Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich who blasted Obama as a \"threat to democracy\" in a Wall Street Journal op-ed titled \"Biden Gets the Chicago Treatment\" told the Post that he believes \"Obama was instrumental\" in the toppling of Biden.\n\nIt \"couldn't have happened without him,\" the disgraced Democrat who likened Obama to an \"old-fashioned ward boss\" in his WSJ piece said.\n\n\"Without Obama, Biden is still the Democratic nominee. Obama was the conductor leading the orchestra that convinced Biden to step aside,\" Blagojevich told the paper.\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

Johnson and John F.

However, the 44th US President notably withheld his endorsement. \"Obama's very upset because he knows she can't win,\" the Biden family source revealed to the New York Post.\n\n\"Obama knows she's just incompetent -- the border czar who's never visited the border, advocating that all migrants should have health insurance. She's not equipped to navigate the challenges ahead.\" The turning point for Biden, 81, came after a widely slammed debate performance against Trump last month in Atlanta, which was reportedly orchestrated to push him out of the race.\n\nThe source expressed skepticism about Harris's prospects in a televised debate against Trump, predicting potential missteps on issues like Israel, Palestine, and Ukraine. \"She can't debate. She's going to put her foot in her mouth,\" the source claimed. According to the source, Obama's initial hope was to clear the path for Biden's exit, a strategy bolstered by an article from George Clooney urging Biden to step aside.\n\nHowever, Biden's immediate endorsement of Harris caught Obama by surprise. Post-Biden, Obama reportedly favoured Arizona Senator Mark Kelly as a potential top candidate for the Democratic National Convention next month, according to the Post. \"Obama is furious that things haven't gone his way, which is why he hasn't joined the Democratic Party's support for Harris,\" the Biden source added. Rod Blagojevich, a former Democratic governor now supporting Trump, claimed that without Obama's influence, Biden would likely still be the Democratic nominee.\n\nOn Monday, Kamala Harris secured support from a majority of delegates to the Democratic National Convention, likely ensuring she will become the party's nominee for president next month. Amid questions about his age and health, Biden pledged to remain in office as president until his term ends on Jan. 20, 2025. An Associated Press survey of delegates showed Harris had the support of 2,538 delegates, well beyond the 1,976 needed to win the delegates vote in the coming weeks. Democratic National Committee Chairman Jaime Harrison said on Monday the party will deliver a presidential nominee by Aug. 7. Delegates could still change their minds before Aug. 7.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_of_Joe_Biden", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Family of Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Clooney", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Clooney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaime_Harrison", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaime Harrison"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_Blagojevich", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rod Blagojevich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2024/07/untitled-design-2024-07-6d359f39ef54437647e4d1410c164ef0-16x9.png?impolicy=website&width=1200&height=675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751667", "eventUri": "eng-9751667", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-07", "textStart": 2684, "textEnd": 2690, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "2020-01-", "textStart": 2385, "textEnd": 2392}], "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

However, former President Barack Obama remains a notable exception.\n\nA source close to the Biden family told The Post that Obama has serious reservations about Harris's ability to win against Donald Trump. \"Obama's very upset because he knows she can't win,\" the source said. \"Obama knows she's just incompetent -- the border czar who never visited the border, saying that all migrants should have health insurance. She cannot navigate the landmines that are ahead of her.\"\n\nThe source elaborated on the challenges Harris faces, particularly in a presidential race where every word and action is scrutinized. \"When you are running for president there are things you can and can't say,\" the source noted.\n\nBiden's decision to exit the race followed a particularly damaging debate performance against Trump in Atlanta, described by The Post as part of an \"elaborate set-up\" to force Biden out. Despite the controversy surrounding the debate, Biden's endorsement of Harris was unexpected even to the upper echelons of the Democratic Party.\n\n\"Obama was shocked\" by Biden's swift endorsement of Harris, the insider revealed. The source further commented on the potential pitfalls awaiting Harris in the campaign trail, particularly in televised debates. \"Wait until the debate... She can't debate. She's going to put her foot in her mouth about Israel, Palestine, Ukraine. She's going to say something really stupid.\"\n\nThe source believes that both Obama and Biden anticipated these difficulties, and that Harris's candidacy would face significant challenges when confronted with complex international issues. \"Obama knew this was going to happen, Joe knew this was going to happen. Now she is going to have to answer real questions.\"\n\nThe White House has not responded to The Post's request for comment on this story.\n\nAdding another layer to the intrigue, the source claimed that an article by George Clooney in The New York Times, urging Biden to step aside, was part of a broader plan orchestrated by Obama to clear the way for a stronger candidate.

Expect these whispers and leaks to continue up to the convention, and possibly beyond. There's a revenge tour going on, most likely engineered by First Lady Jill Biden. According to one article, the Bidens never really forgave Obama for pushing Joe aside in 2016 in favor of Hillary Clinton, and there is even more bitterness over Biden being forced into one-term presidency status.\n\nBiden's feelings were raw for years after Obama effectively chose Hillary Clinton over his VP in 2016. And though it played out much more quietly, both of them also still remember their achingly uncomfortable run-up to 2020 -- its negotiations, its tip-toeing around personal and political sensitivities and its Obaman interests in candidates not named Joe -- all too well.\n\n\"Lady MacBiden\" loves the power and the prestige of being in the White House and is no doubt pissed that former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Obama tag-teamed to remove her husband from running for a second term. In February, presidential historian Douglas Brinkley appeared on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" alluded to this, and actually said Jill Biden was the driving force that convinced him to run for that second term.\n\nWATCH:\n\nHer words drip with venom. Because for those who did waver and were a part of throwing her husband under the bus, there will be hell to pay -- probably at the Democrat National Convention in August. There is even more scuttlebutt that Obama never wanted VP Kamala Harris to be at the top of the ticket, and Biden's instant endorsement of her was another way to stick it to Obama.\n\nA source close to the Biden family has alleged that Obama was 'shocked' that the President endorsed Harris so quickly and is 'furious' about the situation.\n\n'Obama's very upset because he knows she can't win,' the insider told The Post.

She cannot navigate the landmines that are ahead of her.'\n\nThe source went on to allege that Obama would instead like to see Arizona Senator and former astronaut Mark Kelly 'at the top of the ticket' at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago next month.\n\nAccording to former felon and Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich, Obama still plans to stage a coup to push our Harris.\n\nOther sources deny this and say he will endorse Harris as soon as Thursday and even plans to campaign with her.\n\nThe people familiar with the discussions didn't know the precise timing of his endorsement. One of them said Obama didn't want it to overshadow President Joe Biden's moment, particularly his Oval Office address to the nation Wednesday night.\n\nAnother person familiar with the discussions said Obama and Harris, who is seeking to maintain the momentum her campaign has enjoyed among Democrats since she entered the race, wanted his endorsement to stand as its own moment.\n\nExpect these whispers and counter-narratives to increase and possibly grow louder, and expect the DNC to have some unprogrammed moments. On Wednesday, the DNC Rules Committee got on a Zoom call to approve the process of a \"virtual roll call vote\" to confirm Kamala Harris as their 2024 nominee rather than the formal roll call on the convention floor.\n\nThe new rules also note that there will still be a state-by-state roll call for the Democratic ticket at the Chicago convention but described those votes as \"celebratory and ceremonial.\"\n\nAs if that will appease the voters who have been de-democratized by the party that is supposed to be saving democracy from Donald Trump. Just because they changed the rules to fit Harris' ascension doesn't mean that everyone will play along.", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jennifer_oliver_o_connell@redstate.com", "name": "Jennifer Oliver O'Connell", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jill Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_the_Nation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Face the Nation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Brinkley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Douglas Brinkley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CBS News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoom_(software)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Zoom (software)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_methods_in_deliberative_assemblies", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Voting methods in deliberative assemblies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_Blagojevich", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rod Blagojevich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Illinois", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Illinois"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Health insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'\u00e9tat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coup d'\u00e9tat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/88/47dd1dec-a019-45b4-8b8f-0e05fb8675b8.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751667", "eventUri": "eng-9751667", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

The \"kampaign\" can finally begin in earnest. On Thursday morning, the vice president released her first campaign ad with an assist from the pop giant. Images of diverse Americans fly by as Beyonc\u00e9's \"Freedom\" plays and Harris promises a utopian future free of poverty and violence. The campaign is undoubtedly hoping the choice ages better than Hillary Clinton's overuse of \"Fight Song.\"\n\n\"In this election we each face a question. What kind of country do we want to live in? There are some people who think we should be a country of chaos. Of fear. Of hate,\" Harris voices over in the ad. \"But us. We choose something different. We choose freedom.\"\n\nWhile pop stars have been flocking to Harris, one question remains -- where in the world is Barack Obama? The former president and Democratic kingmaker has yet to break his silence on Harris after praising Biden's decision to exit the race. According to NBC, however, Obama already supports Harris privately and is preparing to endorse her soon.\n\n\"President Obama looks forward to helping Democrats up and down the ballot make the case to voters this fall,\" said Eric Schultz, a senior advisor to Obama. \"Our strategy will be based on driving impact, especially where and when his voice can move the needle.\"\n\nOthers aren't so sure. One source close to the Biden family told the New York Post that Obama is \"furious\" that Harris has clinched the Democratic nomination. \"Obama's very upset because he knows she can't win. Obama knows she's just incompetent -- the border czar who never visited the border, saying that all migrants should have health insurance,\" said the source. \"She cannot navigate the landmines that are ahead of her.\"\n\nAccording to the source, Obama had counted on party elites to force Biden out of the race but was surprised when the president endorsed Harris so soon. He had allegedly hoped to install Arizona senator Mark Kelly at the top of the ticket instead.\n\nWhile the Harris campaign is gathering steam, even sans Obama endorsement, Cockburn wouldn't be surprised if Harris's gaffes start to pick up too. In fact, the campaign has already stuck its foot in its mouth.

Her spokesperson has been contacted for comment via email.\n\nOne of the Democratic Party's most popular figures, Obama was among the names floated to replace Biden as he faced calls to drop out of the presidential race following a disastrous debate performance in June that raised concerns about his ability to beat Trump and serve a second term.\n\nSome polling has shown Obama could beat Trump in a hypothetical matchup. However, she has repeatedly shut down speculation about making her own run for the White House.\n\n\"As former first lady Michelle Obama has expressed several times over the years, she will not be running for president,\" her director of communications, Crystal Carson, told Newsweek earlier this month, reiterating a statement issued in March.\n\nThe former first lady spoke at the Democratic National Convention in 2020, and engaged in the race through her nonpartisan voting initiative When We All Vote.\n\nBut she had not actively campaigned for Biden's reelection, unlike her husband, who has attended fundraisers and appeared in campaign videos. Experts say that could change if Harris becomes the party's nominee.\n\n\"Michelle Obama is clearly popular within the Democratic Party, and it wouldn't be at all surprising if she hit the campaign trail for Harris after the Democratic convention wraps up,\" Thomas Gift, an associate professor of political science and director of the Centre on U.S. Politics at University College London, told Newsweek.\n\n\"Even if her appeal may be strongest with suburban women, her popularity extends beyond that demographic. She could be a significant asset to the Harris campaign,\" he said.\n\nAndra Gillespie, an associate professor of political science at Emory University and director of the James Weldon Johnson Institute for the Study of Race and Difference, said the reason Obama is popular is because she is not a politician.\n\n\"The moment she becomes a politician, she expends some of the good will that she has built up over the last 15 years of public life,\" Gillespie told Newsweek. \"I suspect that Mrs. Obama intends to use her notoriety to raise awareness about the issues that she cares about, but she will do this as a former first lady and not as an active political candidate.\"\n\nObama campaigning for Harris could fuel the right-wing paranoia \"that sees the Obamas as the puppet-masters behind the Biden administration,\" Geoffrey Kabaservice, the director of political studies at the Niskanen Center, told Newsweek.\n\n\"But more realistically, Michelle remains one of the most popular political non-politicians in the country and I'm sure that her participation would benefit a Harris campaign,\" he said.\n\nObama \"is a gifted speaker and an effective surrogate on the campaign trail,\" Costas Panagopoulos, a political science professor at Northeastern University, told Newsweek.\n\n\"She's especially powerful to energize Black voters, and especially Black women, who will be central to a Democratic victory in 2024,\" he said. \"I expect she'll be 'all in' for Democrats in the general election, fueled in part by her distaste for Donald Trump and the conservative Republican agenda which is so anathema to her ideological views.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "khaleda_rahman@newsweek.com", "name":

But people close to Mr. Obama, who has positioned himself as an impartial elder statesman above intraparty machinations, said not to read too much into it -- and had no alternate candidate in mind when he made the decision not to immediately endorse Ms. Harris.\n\nMr. Obama adopted an identical stance four years ago when Mr. Biden's aides pressured him to endorse early in the Democratic primaries before Senator Bernie Sanders dropped out. (Mr. Obama's favored phrase back then was \"I don't want to thumb the scale.\") Endorsing too early now would also be a political mistake -- fueling criticism that Ms. Harris's nomination, should it come, was a coronation rather than the best possible consensus under rushed circumstances, they said.\n\nInstead, Mr. Obama sees his role as helping to quickly \"unite the party once we have a nominee,\" a person familiar with his thinking said.\n\nBut there are other more personal considerations, exacerbating Mr. Obama's innate caution.\n\nMr. Biden is a deeply prideful man, and he has never fully forgiven Mr. Obama for quietly backing former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the 2016 campaign, and Mr. Biden still believes he could have beaten former President Donald J. Trump that year if given the chance. Nor was Mr. Biden pleased when Mr. Obama told him that he should consider sitting out 2020, too, people in his circle have said.\n\nMr. Obama wanted Sunday to be about Mr. Biden, a celebration of his accomplishments -- and does not feel pressured to act hastily, according to a former White House official who speaks with the former president regularly.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bernie Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Primary election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://dnyuz.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Why-Obama-hasnt-endorsed-Harris.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751667", "eventUri": "eng-9751667", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

The Reason Why? ...\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "body": "OPINION| In a shocking twist that has left many Trump supporters scratching their heads, former President Barack Obama has reportedly decided not to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris in her bid for the presidency. According to sources close to the matter, Obama believes that Harris is likely to lose to former President Donald Trump in a head-to-head matchup.\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking: \"Grok, why would Obama not endorse his own former vice president?\" And to that, I say, \"Well, that's the million-dollar question, isn't it?\"\n\nThere are a few possible explanations for Obama's decision. One theory is that he simply believes Harris is not the best candidate to defeat Trump. After all, she did not perform particularly well in the 2020 Democratic primaries, and her approval ratings have been less than stellar.\n\nAnother theory is that Obama is playing a game of political chess. By not endorsing Harris, he may be leaving the door open for another candidate to emerge as the Democratic nominee. This would allow him to maintain his status as a kingmaker within the party, and potentially position himself for a future run for office.\n\nAnd then there's the personal preference theory. It's no secret that Obama and Harris have had their differences in the past. Perhaps Obama simply doesn't believe Harris is the right person for the job.\n\nWhatever the reason, Obama's non-endorsement of Harris is a significant blow to her campaign. As Trump supporters, we can't help but feel a sense of schadenfreude at the thought of the Democrats infighting.\n\nBut let's not get too ahead of ourselves. The 2024 election is still a long way off, and anything can happen between now and then. Harris may yet prove Obama wrong and emerge as a formidable challenger to Trump.\n\nIn the meantime, let's all take a moment to appreciate the irony of the situation. The man who once said, \"Yes we can!\" now seems to be saying, \"No, you can't.\"\n\nAs Trump supporters, we must remain vigilant and continue to work towards our goal of making America great again. And if that means watching the Democrats implode from within, well, that's just an added bonus.", "source": {"uri": "thebeltwayreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Beltway Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jack_crane@thebeltwayreport.com", "name": "Jack Crane", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Opinion poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schadenfreude", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Schadenfreude"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Costumes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://thebeltwayreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Obama-Harris.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751667", "eventUri": "eng-9751667", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

The Inside Story", "body": "If media reports are to be believed, Barack Obama wants someone else to be at the top of the Democratic National Convention and he is furious that Kamala Harris has been endorsed though she can not beat Donald Trump in the US Presidential Election 2024.Though former US President Barack Obama played the most crucial role in convincing Joe Biden to step aside in the US Presidential Election 2024, he is yet to endorse Kamala Harris. This has confused many senior Democrat leaders and some of his peers, who rushed to back the first black vice president. The question being asked in the US political circle and the power corridor of the Democratic Party is- what happened that the only black former president has maintained a mysterious silence over nomination of Kamala Harris? Is a different political game plan being planned by the top echelon of the Democratic Party?\n\nAccording to 'New York Post', Barack Obama is not confident that the vice president will beat Republican candidate Donald Trump. Quoting an unnamed Joe Biden family aide, it has been reported that the former president is very upset as he knows that Harris can not win the November 5 election. The news outlet has said in its recent report that Barack Obama knows Kamala Harris is just incompetent. Explaining it, the report suggests that all migrants should have health insurance, but the daughter of immigrants cannot navigate the landmines that are ahead of her.\n\nBiden came under pressure to pull out of the race for the White House mainly due to his dismal performance at the June 27 presidential debate. But many Democrats feel that Kamala Harris would not perform well in the debate, which may not be as disastrous as the first one. 'New York Post' has reported a party insider saying Harris can't debate and she will put her foot in her mouth about Israel, Palestine, and Ukraine. It further said that the former attorney would say something really stupid.\n\nThe unknown Democrat source said Obama knew this was going to happen, Joe Biden also knew it, and now Kamala Harris is going to have to answer real questions. It is also reported that the former president wants Arizona Senator and former astronaut Mark Kelly to be \"at the top of the ticket\" when the Democratic National Convention is held next month.\n\nWhen will the Democratic National Convention be held?\n\nThe Democratic National Convention will be held from August 19 to August 22. It will nominate the presidential candidate and ratify the selection of his running mate.\n\nWho is Mark Kelly?\n\nMark Kelly is the Arizona Senator and a former astronaut. If media reports are to be believed, Barack Obama wants him to be at the top of the ticket at the Democratic National Convention, which will be held from August 19 to August 22.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Post", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Immigration"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronaut", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Astronaut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Ukraine"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-112019241,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-138902,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751667", "eventUri": "eng-9751667", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-19", "dateEnd": "2024-08-22", "textStart": 2399, "textEnd": 2421, "freq": 2}, {"amb": false, "date": "-11-05", "textStart": 1145, "textEnd": 1155}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 1553, "textEnd": 1560}], "sentiment": -0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

The wall in question is the presidential campaign of Vice President Kamala Harris, and the latest brick to fall in is Barack Obama, who is now endorsing the vice president in her presidential ambitions.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama plans to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris' presidential bid, according to two people familiar with his plans.\n\nThat endorsement could come as soon as Thursday, according to one of the people granted anonymity to speak about an endorsement that is not yet public.\n\nObama, the first Black president, remains one of the most popular figures in the Democratic party even though more than a decade has passed since he was last elected. He lent his support to Biden during fundraisers, which were among some of the biggest blockbuster events of his campaign. He's also a draw during campaign events.\n\nThis could have a significant effect on the race.\n\nBarack Obama's final presidential approval rating is at 59 percent, with other Democrat presidents Bill Clinton coming in at 66 percent and Jimmy Carter at 34 percent. He's a Democratic Party icon whose word still carries a lot of weight -- among Democrats. While he famously said about Joe Biden that there's \"...nothing that Joe can't f**k up,\" he nevertheless ascribes to Democrat solidarity -- and that's something that Democrats have traditionally done very well. They stick together.\n\nSee Related: A Confused Joe Biden Gives Address to the Nation, Only Deepens the Scandal Around Him and Kamala Harris\n\nReport: Leak Reveals More About Why Obama Hasn't Endorsed Harris\n\nObama will, reportedly, make his endorsement official as soon as Thursday.\n\n...the wait before endorsing was intentional. A person familiar with Obama's thinking said he didn't want to put his thumb on the scale as the party worked through the process of determining its nominee.\n\n\"He believed it was important for the party to have a legitimate process where delegates select our new nominee, and he thinks VP Harris has been off to an impressive start,\" the person said.\n\nNow that Harris is clearly on the glide path to the nomination, Obama plans to offer his backing to the freshly minted Democratic candidate.\n\nObama withheld his endorsement during the 2020 primary, even though his own vice president was in the running, because he saw himself as an elder statesman who should let the party organically choose its future.\n\nIt's unclear how smooth that glide path to the nomination will be, as the Democratic Party has already shown themselves to be willing to bring out the long knives for a candidate whose polling is on a path to a landslide win -- for Republicans. If Kamala Harris starts showing a similar slide in the polling, the Democratic National Convention in August could become very spicy indeed.\n\nAnd we should remember that Her Imperial Majesty Hillary I will be watching intently for any such polling slide.\n\nBut there should be no illusions about how much influence Barack Obama still wields in Democratic Party circles. This endorsement has the potential to bring in remaining Democrat holdouts and finalize the solidification of that party behind the vice president. What's less clear is how much difference this endorsement will make to independents and moderates who will decide the battleground state elections and, in so doing, determine the final Electoral College results.", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ward_clark@redstate.com", "name": "Ward Clark", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bill Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Carter", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jimmy Carter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Electoral College"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2022/251/e229150c-83ca-4191-bc15-af10631cb3b1.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751667", "eventUri": "eng-9751667", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

Biden himself set the tone. \"Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year,\" he wrote. \"Democrats - it's time to come together and beat [Donald] Trump. Let's do this.\"\n\nAny suggestion that the party might entertain an open selection process was swiftly quashed, as most of Harris's possible rivals, including California governor Gavin Newsom, transport secretary Pete Buttigieg and Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro, followed his lead. They were joined by a parade of grandees: Bill and Hillary Clinton, John Kerry, Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nAmid the gathering enthusiasm, one surname is glaringly absent: Obama. When Biden announced he would be resigning the nomination, Barack Obama, who last week reportedly told allies his former vice president should rethink his candidacy, posted an eloquent tribute. \"Joe Biden has been one of America's most consequential presidents, as well as a dear friend and partner to me,\" he wrote, adding that Biden's decision to stand down was \"a historic example of a genuine public servant once again putting the interests of the American people ahead of his own that future generations of leaders will do well to follow\".\n\nHowever, he stopped short of endorsing Harris as Biden's successor. Instead, Barack wrote that he had \"extraordinary confidence that the leaders of our party will be able to create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges\".\n\n\"For now, Michelle and I just want to express our love and gratitude to Joe and Jill for leading us so ably and courageously during these perilous times&hairsp; - &hairsp;and for their commitment to the ideals of freedom and equality that this country was founded on.\"\n\nThat \"for now\" has provoked speculation that Barack is keeping his powder dry because his wife, Michelle, is preparing for a tilt at the nomination herself. She has been tipped as a possible candidate since her husband's victory in 2008.\n\nPolling by Ipsos conducted at the beginning of this month, as Biden's withdrawal began to look more likely, projected that of the likely possible candidates, only Michelle Obama would beat Trump.\n\n\"In hypothetical matchups with Democratic candidates other than Biden, former first lady Michelle Obama is the only hypothetical candidate to definitively defeat Trump in this poll,\" the report stated. \"Michelle Obama also tops the charts in favourability among registered voters, with Trump and Biden trailing behind her by more than 10 percentage points each.\"\n\nBen Page, CEO of Ipsos Mori, says that according to his firm's findings, Michelle would be the obvious choice. \"On the data we have, Michelle Obama is the slam-dunk option for the Democrats if she is available,\" he says.\n\n\"She would motivate Democratic voters to come out and vote much more than Kamala Harris. In our latest poll, although you can see Harris is more popular than Joe Biden, it's not by much. She is very polarising - she has 39 per cent [of voters] saying they are satisfied, but 48 per cent dissatisfied - and that's just among her own supporters.\"\n\nA Telegraph poll of more than 70,000 readers this week found Michelle was the overwhelming choice for a Democratic candidate who could beat Trump. She took 64 per cent of the vote, with Harris and Newsom in joint second with just 5 per cent each.\n\nThere are a number of reasons to think Michelle would be a strong candidate. She is a charismatic and popular figure, who balanced a brilliant legal career with being first lady and mother to two daughters, Malia and Sasha.\n\nHer 2018 bestseller, Becoming, read in places like a manifesto, setting out her influences, experiences and the changes she would like to see in the world. Her husband knows the power of a popular book: his campaign in 2008 was based on his writing in Dreams From My Father and The Audacity of Hope.\n\nIn particular, Michelle's celebrity could be helpful given the unusually truncated campaign. With only four months until the election, there is little time for the Democrats to introduce voters to a new candidate.\n\n\"She was generally seen as a successful first lady,\" Page says. \"She's done her books, she has her audience: a much bigger audience than Kamala Harris.\" According to the Ipsos polling, all the other possible candidates have lower favourability ratings than Michelle, including Newsom, Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer, Kentucky governor Andy Beshear and Illinois governor J.B. Pritzker.\n\n\"The other challengers are virtually unknown,\" Page adds. \"Trying to get a profile this late in a campaign is a real challenge. Look at [Michael] Bloomberg. He spent a fortune and got nowhere.\"\n\nBloomberg, the billionaire founder of the information services company and former mayor of New York, spent more than $1 billion on his campaign in 2020, only to withdraw in March of that year and lend his support to Biden.\n\nOn the Republican side, Ronald Reagan and Trump have shown that existing fame can be a potent force in politics. Celebrities, including the singer John Legend, the actor Jamie Lee Curtis and the British pop star Charli xcx, were quick to come out in support of Harris. But the Democrats have yet to experiment with a candidate drawn from a field outside of politics itself, although George Clooney and even Taylor Swift have been mooted as possible future candidates. If they did want to trial a high-profile nominee of this kind, Michelle, who is famous but not for anything that could be called frivolous, might be a smart place to start.\n\nA former Biden aide told The Telegraph: \"It's improbable but it's not impossible that Michelle Obama will run for president.\n\n\"She has previously made it crystal clear she doesn't want the job but it was striking how Barack Obama did not support Harris ... so it seems they're adopting a wait-and-see approach to gauge the inevitability of the vice president's bid,\" the aide said.\n\n\"For so many reasons, it would be extraordinary if Michelle Obama did run but then the Obamas' narrative is one of the most extraordinary stories in modern politics.\"\n\nSome Republicans have even openly suggested Michelle would be a candidate they would fear. In an interview with New York magazine earlier this year, Kevin Cramer, the Republican senator for North Dakota, said: \"I don't think I'd be revealing any sort of polling secrets if I said Michelle Obama would probably be the one person that could step in and keep the party united and probably provide a little bit of a moving start because of her notoriety.\"\n\nStill, there remain plenty of other impediments to an Obama challenge. Some say Barack has only withheld his support for Harris so far because he prefers to remain above the fray for as long as possible, presenting himself as a unifying vizier rather than a cheerleader. He performed this role in 2020, waiting until late in the day to endorse Biden.\n\nAnd although some Democrat strategists privately wish Michelle was up for the challenge, she has offered little to suggest that is the case in the way of hard evidence.\n\n\"The idea that Michelle Obama will run for office is fanciful,\" says Richard Goodstein, a Democrat strategist and former advisor to both Clintons. \"Barack Obama held off his endorsement by design. He wants to formally embrace her [Kamala Harris] once it's a done deal, so it doesn't look like he's putting his hand on the scale. He is a big admirer of Harris, and the fact that Michelle Obama is so popular tends to pierce concerns about Harris's race.\"\n\nAnd although Michelle would (presumably) enjoy the support of her husband if she were to enter the race, and enjoys plenty of goodwill within the party, it is clear the Democratic machine is clicking into gear behind Harris. Money, an essential component of any US campaign, has followed suit: Harris for President, her campaign group, has raised more than $50 million in grassroots donations since Biden endorsed her.\n\nFor all her involvement in politics, Michelle also has no experience of being a candidate herself. Barack's presidential campaign came after years of experience as a community organiser in Chicago and the senate.\n\n\"Although it's clear why Democrats are hoping for a saviour to drop down from the sky at the Democratic convention, that won't be Michelle Obama,\" says Dr Thomas Gift, an associate professor at UCL and founding director of its Centre on US Politics.\n\n\"Only in the dreams of progressives does a nominee like Michelle, with no firsthand experience running for office and who's displayed no interest in following in her husband's footsteps become the Democratic party's nominee for the White House.\"\n\nThat may prove the biggest obstacle of all: whether Michelle actually wants the gig. She has been consistently supportive of Harris as a woman of colour in a senior position. \"I've been thinking about all those girls growing up today who will be able to take it for granted that someone who looks like them can grow up to lead a nation like ours,\" she posted when Harris was selected as vice presidential candidate in 2020. \"Because Kamala Harris may be the first, but she won't be the last.\"\n\nAlthough her previous writings and speeches might imply she is not ruling out running for office herself, in her public statements she has always remained circumspect. In 2012, she said \"absolutely not\" when asked about it. Later that year she said: \"It takes a lot of patience to be president of the United States... I'm not that patient.\"\n\nFour years later, she told Oprah Winfrey much the same. \"I'm not coy,\" she said. \"I've proven that. I'm pretty direct. If I were interested in it, I would say it. I don't believe in playing games.\" In 2018, she said she had never had the \"passion for politics\", but had been \"dragged kicking and screaming into the arena\" by her husband. Earlier this year, her office said she would not be running in 2024. They pointed out her own most recent comment on the subject, when Oprah asked her again for a Netflix interview, The Light We Carry.\n\n\"Politics is hard,\" Michelle said. \"You've got to want it. It's got to be in your soul, because it is so important. It is not in my soul.\"\n\nEven if Michelle Obama does not run this time, do not expect the questions to go away.

Today, we've also been reminded\u200a -- \u200a again\u200a -- \u200athat he's a patriot of the highest order.\"\n\nLast week, Obama reportedly told allies that he did not believe Biden could defeat Republican nominee Donald Trump in November, following issues that were on display in their only presidential debate in June.", "source": {"uri": "sonsoflibertymedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sons of Liberty Media"}, "authors": [{"uri": "pamela_geller@sonsoflibertymedia.com", "name": "Pamela Geller", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Soros", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "George Soros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kelly", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mark Kelly"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_Media", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liberty Media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsmax", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Newsmax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriotism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patriotism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice_and_Guides", "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice and Guides", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Games/Roleplaying/Conventions", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Conventions", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Comics/Conventions", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://sonsoflibertymedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/obama-soros-e1721738132701.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751667", "eventUri": "eng-9751667", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

Her spokesperson has been contacted for comment via email.\n\nOne of the Democratic Party's most popular figures, Obama was among the names floated to replace Biden as he faced calls to drop out of the presidential race following a disastrous debate performance in June that raised concerns about his ability to beat Trump and serve a second term.\n\nSome polling has shown Obama could beat Trump in a hypothetical matchup. However, she has repeatedly shut down speculation about making her own run for the White House.\n\n\"As former first lady Michelle Obama has expressed several times over the years, she will not be running for president,\" her director of communications, Crystal Carson, told Newsweek earlier this month, reiterating a statement issued in March.\n\nThe former first lady spoke at the Democratic National Convention in 2020, and engaged in the race through her nonpartisan voting initiative When We All Vote.\n\nBut she had not actively campaigned for Biden's reelection, unlike her husband, who has attended fundraisers and appeared in campaign videos. Experts say that could change if Harris becomes the party's nominee.\n\n\"Michelle Obama is clearly popular within the Democratic Party, and it wouldn't be at all surprising if she hit the campaign trail for Harris after the Democratic convention wraps up,\" Thomas Gift, an associate professor of political science and director of the Centre on U.S. Politics at University College London, told Newsweek.\n\n\"Even if her appeal may be strongest with suburban women, her popularity extends beyond that demographic. She could be a significant asset to the Harris campaign,\" he said.\n\nAndra Gillespie, an associate professor of political science at Emory University and director of the James Weldon Johnson Institute for the Study of Race and Difference, said the reason Obama is popular is because she is not a politician.\n\n\"The moment she becomes a politician, she expends some of the good will that she has built up over the last 15 years of public life,\" Gillespie told Newsweek. \"I suspect that Mrs. Obama intends to use her notoriety to raise awareness about the issues that she cares about, but she will do this as a former first lady and not as an active political candidate.\"\n\nObama campaigning for Harris could fuel the right-wing paranoia \"that sees the Obamas as the puppet-masters behind the Biden administration,\" Geoffrey Kabaservice, the director of political studies at the Niskanen Center, told Newsweek.\n\n\"But more realistically, Michelle remains one of the most popular political non-politicians in the country and I'm sure that her participation would benefit a Harris campaign,\" he said.\n\nObama \"is a gifted speaker and an effective surrogate on the campaign trail,\" Costas Panagopoulos, a political science professor at Northeastern University, told Newsweek.\n\n\"She's especially powerful to energize Black voters, and especially Black women, who will be central to a Democratic victory in 2024,\" he said. \"I expect she'll be 'all in' for Democrats in the general election, fueled in part by her distaste for Donald Trump and the conservative Republican

Credit: Simon Davis/DFID/Flickr/CC BY 2.0\n\nPresident Joe Biden's abrupt decision to withdraw from the 2024 presidential election has generated considerable commotion within the Democratic Party and beyond. The 81-year-old's revelation has generated a surge of support for former First Lady Michelle Obama, as many people believe she is the one candidate capable of triumphing over former President Donald Trump.\n\nBiden, who has publicly supported Vice President Kamala Harris as his successor, declared, \"While it has been my intention to seek re-election, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.\"\n\nAfter a disappointing debate performance in late June, he decided in response to increasing pressure from his party, primarily due to concerns about his age and physical condition, Business Times reported.\n\nThere has been a widespread demand on social media and from prominent individuals for Michelle Obama to enter the contest. Steven Bartlett, a renowned entrepreneur, indicated that now, only Michelle has the potential to defeat Trump. That is an indisputable fact. This sentiment has been extensively disseminated, with many individuals firmly convinced that her widespread appeal and composed demeanor render her a formidable candidate.\n\nSenator Kevin Cramer of North Dakota stated that Michelle Obama would likely be the most capable individual to maintain party unity and initiate progress due to her widespread fame.\n\nThere has been significant online activity on social media platforms urging Obama to enter the political race.\n\nOne person tweeted, \"Michelle Obama... your country needs you... PLEASE throw your hat in the presidential race... you can beat him and think your husband was the first black president and you can be the first black and woman... power couple extraordinaire.\" Another individual believed that Michelle Obama was the sole candidate to defeat Trump.\n\nAlthough there is an increasing amount of support for Michelle Obama, Biden remains unwavering in his endorsement of Kamala Harris. In his X article, he explicitly expressed his unequivocal support and endorsement of Kamala as our party's nominee this year. Democrats, we must unite and triumph over Trump.\n\nBiden's choice follows a period of seclusion at his residence in Delaware following his diagnosis with COVID-19. He has been seeking advice from trusted advisors and family members over his political future, ultimately choosing to withdraw from the competition. The senior campaign and White House officials were informed within moments before his public announcement, indicating the highly confidential nature of his choice.\n\nThe Democratic Party is currently faced with the task of identifying a fresh candidate to confront Trump. Kamala Harris, Biden's vice president, has received support from Biden and is regarded as a possible heir. Nevertheless, her approval ratings have been subpar, which could hinder her chances of securing the nomination.\n\nGavin Newsom, the current governor of California, has been suggested as a possible candidate. Although he holds considerable influence inside the party and is renowned for his exceptional debating skills, he has consistently affirmed his decision not to compete against Harris.\n\nMichigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer has also been suggested. Whitmer's resounding re-election victory and her ability to maintain control over both state legislature chambers have solidified her position as a prominent and influential person within the Democratic Party. Nevertheless, she has explicitly declared that she would not participate in the current year's election if Biden were to resign.\n\nPennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, renowned for his catchphrase \"Achieve tangible results,\" is likewise regarded as a promising figure within the political party. Although he has been preparing for a possible candidacy in 2028, he has expressed support for Biden and advocated for the party to prioritize productivity over anxiety.\n\nThe possibility of Michelle Obama running for office remains a subject of substantial debate. A recent Ipsos poll revealed that she is the one hypothetical candidate capable of decisively defeating Trump in a one-on-one contest, and she has consistently ranked highest in favorability among registered voters. Nevertheless, her prior assertions indicate that it is improbable for her to participate in the race.\n\nDuring a conversation with Oprah Winfrey, she said, \"Politics is hard. And the people who get into it... you've got to want it. It's got to be in your soul, because it is so important. It is not in my soul.\"", "source": {"uri": "econotimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "EconoTimes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michelle Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Davis_(artist)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Simon Davis (artist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Cramer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Cramer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Dakota", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Dakota"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Dakota"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gretchen_Whitmer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gretchen Whitmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Shapiro", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Josh Shapiro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Michigan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor of Michigan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipsos", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ipsos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oprah_Winfrey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oprah Winfrey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_legislature_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State legislature (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://f1.econotimes.com/2024/07/tv6e7jbic0_th_1024x0.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751667", "eventUri": "eng-9751667", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

Following the surprise resignation of 81-year-old Joe Biden from the US presidential election and his prompt endorsement of Harris, the majority of Democratic leaders quickly embraced Harris's candidacy. But the 44th US President famously declined to support her. \"He knows she can't win, which is why he's very upset,\" the Biden family sources told the New York Post.\n\n\"Obama knows she's just incompetent -- the border czar who's never visited the border, advocating that all migrants should have health insurance. She's not equipped to navigate the challenges ahead.\" The pivotal moment for 81-year-old Biden occurred during his critically acclaimed debate performance against Trump in Atlanta last month, which was purportedly planned to eliminate him from the contest.\n\nThe source predicted that Harris would make mistakes on matters such as Israel, Palestine, and Ukraine, and voiced doubt about her chances of defeating Trump in a broadcast discussion. She is incapable of debating. The insider declared, \"She's going to put her foot in her mouth.\" According to the source, Obama's initial hope was to clear the path for Biden's exit, a strategy bolstered by an article from George Clooney urging Biden to step aside.\n\nOn Monday, Kamala Harris secured support from a majority of delegates to the Democratic National Convention, likely ensuring she will become the party's nominee for president next month.

The stakes are high, not just for her but also for her party that forced Joe Biden out of the tough fight against Donald Trump. But that one endorsement and the most important one that she has been waiting for is Barack Obama. He pitched for Biden to step down but didn't go all out to 'coronate' Kamala Harris, the most eligible contest in the party.\n\nThat's a question on everyone's mind. Republicans are interpreting it as a snub whereas Obama's close aides claim he wants a democratic nomination process to be followed such that Kamala doesn't have to bear the burden of a favourable pick who wasn't elected with a consensus. In an NY Times report an undisclosed source claimed, \"he is an impartial elder statesman above intra-party machinations, said not to read too much into it -- and had no alternate candidate in mind\n\nIn previous election too, Obama didn't endorse Biden unless Bernie Sanders was in the race. Report claims his favoured quote is , \"I don't want to thumb the scale.\" For him an early endorsement is a political mistake and may fuel criticism that Harris's nomination was a rather coronation than the best possible consensus under rushed circumstances.\n\nRepublicans have already started questioning Kamala Harris' wild card entry into the US elections with the voting due in a couple of months. During an election rally Trump's running mate JD Vance stated, \"The idea of selecting the Democrat party's nominee because George Soros and Barack Obama and a couple of elite Democrats got in a smoke-filled room and decided to throw Joe Biden overboard, that is the threat to democracy.\"\n\nNY Times also quoted a person familiar with Obama's thinking, instead, Mr. Obama sees his role as helping to quickly \"unite the party once we have a nominee,\"\n\nFormer President Barack Obama's hesitance to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris can also be traced back to a complex web of political history and personal dynamics. Report suggests that President Joe Biden's lingering sense of disappointment towards Obama for quietly supporting Hillary Clinton during the 2016 campaign plays a pivotal role in this decision. Biden, known for his strong sense of pride, still harbors the belief that he could have emerged victorious against Donald J. Trump in 2016 if given the opportunity, feeling that Obama's backing of Clinton may have impacted the outcome.\n\nA former White House official, who maintains regular communication with Obama, shared that the former president is deliberate in his actions and does not feel pressured to make a swift endorsement. This deliberate approach underscores Obama's intention to prioritize Biden's moment and ensure that any endorsement aligns with his broader political strategy.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Soros", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Soros"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juris_Doctor", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Juris Doctor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bernie Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2024/07/23/1600x900/FILES-US-VOTE-BIDEN-HARRIS-0_1721715511153_1721715585721.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751667", "eventUri": "eng-9751667", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 148, "relevance": 1}

Although party leaders had hoped to conceal his deteriorating cognitive health from voters long enough to carry him over the finish line in November, the debate revealed the true extent of his decline to the world.\n\nPanic set in among Democrats. After a series of suboptimal performances in post-debate interviews, rallies, and a press conference at the end of a NATO summit, it was clear: Biden had to step aside.\n\nHis stubborn refusal to leave the race created deep divisions within the party, and conservatives watched with amused fascination as the warring factions employed the same tactics against each other that they've used against Republicans for so long.\n\nOn Sunday, Biden finally capitulated and announced his decision to drop out of the race. A second message followed saying he would endorse Vice President Kamala Harris to top the ticket. Slate reported that \"Biden turned over his campaign -- and its bank account -- to Harris.\"\n\nShortly afterward, Harris launched her presidential campaign, which reported an immediate surge in big-money donations. She spent much of Sunday working the phones trying to line up delegates and gain the support of lawmakers.\n\nAs the day wore on, key Democrats began to coalesce around her. Among the first to endorse the vice president were former President Bill Clinton, 2016 presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, venture capitalist and major Biden donor Reid Hoffman, and billionaire activist George Soros.\n\nEven several of the figures floated as rivals for the Democratic nomination, including Govs. Gavin Newsom (D-CA), Josh Shapiro (D-PA), Phil Murphy (D-NJ), Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ), and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, offered Harris their endorsements. It took Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D-MI) a bit longer, but she eventually endorsed Harris as well.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), who was instrumental in the party's effort to force Biden to withdraw, also endorsed Harris. She issued a statement saying that her support for Harris is \"official, personal and political.\"\n\nPelosi's endorsement comes as a bit of a surprise. Politico reported last week that in a recent meeting with California Democrats, she said she favored \"an open process to choose the party's nominee\" in order to \"avoid the appearance of a Kamala Harris coronation.\"\n\nSources told CNN that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) are expected to endorse Harris soon.\n\nOddly, one big name remains absent from the list of endorsers: former President Barack Obama, who is believed to be the impetus behind the effort to oust Biden.\n\nSlate's Jim Newell excused Obama's hesitation, explaining that he is \"already facing some backlash from the minority of Democrats who wanted Biden to stay on\" and does not want to be seen as if he's crowning the next president.\n\nIt may actually be as simple as that. Still, I can't help wondering if perhaps Obama has another candidate in mind. A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on July 2 showed former first lady Michelle Obama would defeat Trump by a margin of 50% to 39% in a head-to-head matchup.\n\nIt should be noted that the same poll found Biden and Trump tied on a day when two unrelated polls, one from the Wall Street Journal and the other from New York Times/Siena, each showed Trump ahead by 6 points.\n\nWhile it's true that Michelle Obama has repeatedly said she has no interest in running for office, many candidates say they're not running until, suddenly, they are. We have watched Democrats abuse their power too many times to take them at their word.\n\nThe Obamas remain extremely popular. If polls over the next four weeks were to show Michelle was the only Democrat who could defeat former President Donald Trump, and delegates at the Democratic National Convention, which is being held in the Obamas' hometown of Chicago, were to nominate her, would she refuse?\n\nMonica Crowley, a former assistant secretary of the Treasury for public affairs in the Trump administration, appeared on Fox News and predicted this week that \"Michelle Obama may still be in the mix.\" She noted that the Obamas have been silent on Harris.\n\n\"There is a reason why the Democrats moved their convention to Chicago,\" Crowley said. \"So they could recruit her ... position her as the reluctant candidate.\n\n\"The Left's power brokers never move without a plan,\" Crowley continued. \"So, while everybody is distracted with this chaos circus, there are powers that be, namely Barack and Michelle Obama, and the entire Obama machine that's essentially run this country over the last 3 1/2 years, that wants an Obama 4 and 5.0. And what better way to do that than run Michelle where they can position her as somebody who didn't really want to do it but she was recruited. She's a pristine candidate. She's immune to criticism as a woman of color. And if they run her, they could raise about a billion dollars in two, three days.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\n\"It seems unthinkable,\" Crowley added, \"but over the last eight, nine years, there have been a lot of unthinkable things happening here in America.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"},

This unexpected move has sent shockwaves through the Democratic Party and the political landscape at large. As the dust settles, all eyes are now on the Chicago Democratic Convention, where a new frontrunner is expected to emerge. Spoiler alert: It's not Kamala Harris. Get ready for Michelle Obama, the potential candidate who is poised to take center stage.\n\nPresident Biden's decision to step down has left many scratching their heads. Theories abound, ranging from health concerns to strategic party maneuvers. Regardless of the reason, Biden's exit has created a massive vacuum that needs to be filled swiftly. This brings us to the Democratic Convention in Chicago, where the future of the party will be decided.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris was initially seen as the obvious successor. However, her tenure has been met with mixed reviews, and her approval ratings have not exactly been stellar. The Democratic Party, keen on maintaining their hold on the White House, appears to be looking elsewhere. Enter Michelle Obama.\n\nKamala Harris has faced several challenges during her time as Vice President. From handling the border crisis to navigating the complex political landscape, her performance has been scrutinized. While she remains a significant figure within the party, the consensus seems to be that she might not be the best candidate to lead the Democrats to victory in the next election.\n\nMichelle Obama, the former First Lady, has always been a beloved figure in American politics. Her intelligence, grace, and dedication to social causes have made her a respected public figure. As whispers of her candidacy grow louder, let's explore why Michelle Obama could be the Democrats' best bet.\n\nMichelle Obama's tenure as First Lady was marked by numerous initiatives aimed at improving the lives of Americans. Her \"Let's Move!\" campaign tackled childhood obesity, while her \"Reach Higher\" initiative encouraged young people to pursue higher education. Her memoir, \"Becoming,\" was a bestseller and further cemented her place as a beloved public figure. Her potential run for the presidency brings a unique blend of experience, charisma, and widespread appeal.\n\nThe Democratic Convention in Chicago is shaping up to be a pivotal event. Party insiders and power brokers will gather to decide who will lead the party into the next election. With Biden out of the race and Harris facing an uphill battle, Michelle Obama's name is being floated as the unifying candidate who can bring together the various factions within the party.\n\nMichelle Obama's popularity extends beyond traditional Democratic strongholds. She appeals to independents and even some moderate Republicans. Her ability to connect with diverse demographics and articulate policy with clarity makes her a formidable candidate. Moreover, her candidacy could energize the Democratic base and attract undecided voters.\n\nWhile Michelle Obama enjoys broad popularity, her candidacy also brings the Obama legacy back into the spotlight. Supporters argue that this legacy of progress and hope is precisely what America needs. Critics, however, are likely to scrutinize her association with policies from her husband's administration that they found contentious. The balance between leveraging her experience and addressing past controversies will be crucial.\n\nBiden's withdrawal and the potential push for Michelle Obama significantly alter the dynamics of the Democratic primary race. Other potential candidates like Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Pete Buttigieg will have to reconsider their strategies. The Democratic National Committee will need to navigate this transition carefully to maintain party unity and momentum heading into the election.\n\nThe Republican camp is undoubtedly watching these developments closely. With Biden out and a strong contender like Michelle Obama potentially stepping in, the GOP will need to refine its approach. Whether they choose to ramp up attacks or recalibrate their platform, the stakes have just been raised considerably.\n\nIf Michelle Obama declares her candidacy, the campaign trail will be electrifying. Her ability to connect with diverse demographics, articulate policy with clarity, and inspire action could set a new standard for political campaigning. Expect packed rallies, influential endorsements, and a media frenzy as she lays out her vision for America's future.\n\nThough she has not formally announced her candidacy, we can anticipate some key policy areas based on her past initiatives and public statements:\n\nThe American public's reaction to these developments will be pivotal. Early polls and public opinion will provide insight into how voters feel about this dramatic shift. Social media will undoubtedly explode with opinions, memes, and debates. It's a time of uncertainty but also of immense potential for transformative leadership.\n\nBiden's withdrawal marks the end of one chapter and potentially the beginning of another, with Michelle Obama emerging as a beacon of hope and change. Her candidacy would not only energize the Democratic base but also attract independent voters seeking a fresh and inspiring leader. As the political landscape evolves, one thing is clear: American politics is about to get a lot more interesting.", "source": {"uri": "costaricantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Jaco Super Ride"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michelle Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "First Lady of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Opinion poll"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let's_Move!", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Let's Move!"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Higher education"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Obesity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Buttigieg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pete Buttigieg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_voter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent voter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Warren", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth Warren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bernie Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet meme"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic National Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Political campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751667", "eventUri": "eng-9751667", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

Writing on his Truth Social account, former president Mr Trump - who survived an assassination attempt last week - said that \"crooked Joe Biden was not fit to run for president.\"\n\nHe wrote: \"Crooked Joe Biden was not fit to run for president, and is certainly not fit to serve - and never was! He only attained the position of president by lies, fake news, and not leaving his basement.\n\n\"All those around him, including his doctor and the media, knew that he wasn't capable of being president, and he wasn't - and now, look what he's done to our country, with millions of people coming across our border, totally unchecked and unvetted, many from prisons, mental institutions, and record numbers of terrorists.\n\n\"We will suffer greatly because of his presidency, but we will remedy the damage he has done very quickly. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"\n\nThe Mirror reported Mr Trump's remarks come as Mr Biden today confirmed he will no longer run in the 2024 US presidential election. Mr Biden, 81, has faced growing pressure to step aside from fellow Democrats following a disastrous televised debate with Mr Trump. Mr Biden's health and age have been major concerns in recent weeks and calls to no longer run intensified following a public letter from major Democrat donor George Clooney.\n\nMr Biden had previously insisted he was not going to step down, adamant that he is the candidate who beat Republican Donald Trump before and would do it again this year. A statement from Mr Biden released on his social media this evening said: \"My fellow Americans, Over the past three and a half years, we have made great progress as a nation. Today, America has the strongest economy in the world.\n\n\"We've made historic investments in rebuilding our nation, in lowering prescription drug costs for seniors, and in expanding affordable health care to a record number of Americans. We've provided critically needed care to a million veterans exposed to toxic substances. Passed the first gun safety law in 30 years.\n\n\"Appointed the first African American woman to the Supreme Court. And passed the most significant climate legislation in the history of the world. America has never been better positioned to lead than we are today. I know none of this could have been done without you, the American people.\n\nTogether, we overcame a once in a century pandemic and the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. We've protected and preserved our democracy. And we've revitalised and strengthened our alliances around the world. \"It has been the greatest honour of my life to serve as your president.\n\n\"And while it has been my intention to seek re-election, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as president for the remainder of my term.\n\n\"I will speak to the nation later this week in more detail about my decision. For now, let me express my deepest gratitude to all those who have worked so hard to see me re-elected. I want to thank Vice President Kamala Harris for being an extraordinary partner in all this work.\n\n\"And let me express my heartfelt appreciation to the American people for the faith and trust you have placed in me. I believe today what I always have: that there is nothing America can't do - when we do it together. We just have to remember we are the United States of America.\"\n\nFollowing his announcement, Mr Biden publicly backed Ms Harris as the party's nominee for the upcoming election. However, a number of people have called for Michelle Obama - wife of former president Barack who held office between 2009 and 2017 - to run in the election.\n\nScores of posts this evening have praised Mrs Obama, 60, and called on her to throw her hat in the ring. Senator Kevin Cramer of North Dakota had said this week: \"I don't think I'd be revealing any sort of polling secrets if I said Michelle Obama would probably be the one person that could step in and keep the party united and probably provide a little bit of a moving start because of her obvious notoriety.\"\n\nOne woman posted tonight: \"If they choose anyone other than Kamala Harris or Michelle Obama, I will NOT be voting.\" Another posted: \"Michelle Obama... your country needs you...PLEASE throw your hat in the presidential race...you can beat him and think your husband was the first black president and you can be the first black and woman...power couple extraordinaire.\"\n\nAnother X user said: \"Michelle Obama is the only one who'll defeat Trump.\" Meanwhile, another on social media shared: \"In my opinion, Michelle Obama is the only real contender that could beat Trump - she would be able to energise voters, the party and has name recognition.\" Dragon's Den entrepreneur Stephen Bartlett also posted: \"At this point only Michelle can beat Trump.

The former First Lady of the United States is no stranger to politics having supported her husband Barack Obama for almost ten years when he was president.\n\nOn Sunday, 21 July, just four months before the US election, it was revealed that current President Joe Biden, 81, will not be running for re-election. Instead, he has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to be the Democrat presidential candidate in the race against Trump.\n\nHowever, many have now rallied behind Michelle Obama, who served as the First Lady of the United States from 2009 to 2017. Dragons' Den star Steven Bartlett previously voiced his opinion and wrote: \"At this point only Michelle can beat Trump. That is fact.\"\n\nSteven's sentiment has been echoed by others on X, following Biden's re-election announcement on social media. A flood of tweets have followed praising Obama, 60, with many urging her to run for office following her husband's success - but what else do we know about Michelle?\n\nHow many children do the Obama's have?\n\nMichelle and Barack Obama, who have been married since 1992, are proud parents to daughters, Malia, 26, who is a film director and Sasha, 23, who is thought to still be studying at USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences in California. Michelle previously opened up about a difficult time in their life and reflected back to when their daughter Sasha was diagnosed with meningitis when she was just a few months old.\n\nSpeaking about the diagnosis in 2012, she shared: \"People ask me what was the hardest time in my life - they ask, well what about during the debt ceiling debate and this and that and the other thing.\n\n\"Sasha got meningitis when she was three months old. I still remember going to the hospital together and they had to give her a spinal tap.\" Barack added: \"The doctors did a terrific job, but, frankly, it was the nurses that were there with us when she had to get a spinal tap, and all sorts of things that were just bringing me to tears.\"\n\nWho are Michelle Obama's famous pals?\n\nAs First Lady of the United States from 2009 to 2017, Michelle has brushed shoulders with a number of A-list celebrities, with many remaining close friends to this day. Some of her celebrity links are with the likes of Beyonc\u00e9, Eva Longoria, Mariah Carey, George Clooney, Justin Timberlake, Sarah Jessica Parker, Taylor Swift and Serena Williams.\n\nOne of Michelle's closest pals is thought to be Oprah Winfrey, who she's known for years and has even enjoyed a family getaway in Hawaii with. Singer Gwen Stefani also has a close connection to Michelle having previously hosted an Obama fundraiser at her Los Angeles home.\n\nShe's even got royal ties having met with Kate Middleton, Prince William and Prince Harry on several occasions, with Michelle previously congratulating on news of the royal births. Not to mention the time Michelle and Barack met a young Prince George when he was in a tiny white dressing gown before going to bed.\n\nCould Michelle Obama run for office?\n\nFollowing Biden's endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris, everyone is on tenterhooks to see if the Obamas will endorse someone within the next 24 hours. In a statement following Biden's news, former President Barack Obama said he had \"extraordinary confidence\" that the leaders of their party will be able to \"create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges.\"\n\nHe added: \"For now, Michelle and I just want to express our love and gratitude to Joe and Jill for leading us so ably and courageously during these perilous times -- and for their commitment to the ideals of freedom and equality that this country was founded on.\"\n\nWhile he didn't address it directly, people believe that it has left room for speculation about Michelle Obama's political intentions. Previously, Mr Obama has been clear and said: \"There are three things that are certain in life: death, taxes and Michelle is not running for President.\"\n\nTo date, Michelle herself hasn't hinted at any desire to take on the presidential challenge. Nevertheless, murmurs suggest she could be the one contender that genuinely unnerves Donald Trump.", "source": {"uri": "ok.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "ok"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Biden emphasized the critical choice facing the nation and urged Americans to unite for democracy's sake.\n\nIn a significant moment for American politics, former US President Barack Obama praised President Joe Biden's lifelong dedication to public service during Biden's recent Oval Office address. Biden's speech marked his decision to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race, endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic Party's nominee.\n\n\"Joe Biden has stayed true to these words again and again over a lifetime of service to the American people,\" Obama remarked, celebrating Biden's extensive career. Traditionally reserved for pivotal moments, the Oval Office address allowed Biden to explain his decision and build support for Harris as the party's next leader.\n\nAfter testing negative for COVID-19, Biden returned to the White House, framing the upcoming election as a critical choice between progress and regression, hope and division. He reaffirmed his commitment to the nation, urging Americans to unite and protect democratic values.

Here is what the prediction market believes", "body": "Ever since US President Joe Biden decided to end his election campaign, there is a million- dollar question being asked. Who among the Democrats will take his place and receive a presidential nomination. While the party will soon hold its national convention in August, Vice-President Kamala Harris has emerged as the favorite. Polymarket which is a prediction market place has a different name that is making the rounds.\n\nThe prediction market has revealed that people are increasingly betting on former First Lady Michelle Obama. She is quickly emerging as a favorite. The political scenario in the US is rapidly changing and Michelle's entry may be considered a 'wild card' entry.\n\nData from the prediction market which has attracted bets worth more than $214 million has given Obama a 11% chance of replacing Joe Biden on the ballot box. Kamala Harris remains the favorite with the former first lady securing the second position. It has been reported that $24 million has been traded on the prospects of the former first lady emerging as a favorite to replace Biden.\n\nWithin a period of 24 hours, the chances of Michelle Obama moved up from 3% to 10% indicating that the party may be considering her candidature.\n\nThe former first lady has preferred to stay away from political events and has actually stated that she is not interested in pursuing a career in electoral politics. She has supported Joe Biden and called on Americans to unite and defeat Donald Trump.\n\nShe has attacked Donald Trump in the past and said that the country will suffer, if he is elected as the president for a second term. There are also indications that former President Barack Obama is working behind the scenes in support of his wife. He is hoping that during the party's national convention, Michelle Obama is issued a presidential nomination.\n\nWhat are the rules as far as issuing presidential nomination is concerned? Can Joe Biden who has won the primaries be replaced on the ballot box?\n\nUS President Joe Biden has resigned voluntarily. The rules are clear that another candidate can replace him on the ballot box. However, the delegates who had voted for Biden are now free to make independent choices and this means that Kamala Harris will need to work on convincing them.\n\nDid the US President always have only two terms in office?\n\nEach term of the US President is for a period of four years. Presently, they can serve for only two terms. The 22 Amendment of the US Constitution restricted the term of the president to only two terms. It was passed in 1947.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prediction market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "First Lady of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michelle Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Constitution of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Primary election"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-112019073,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-869359,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751667", "eventUri": "eng-9751667", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3098039215686275, "wgt": 132, "relevance": 1}

But I have extraordinary confidence that the leaders of our party will be able to create a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges.\"\n\nAs Joel Gilbert has argued in his convincing film and book, \"Michelle Obama 2024,\" Barack and his cronies had been laying the groundwork for a Michelle candidacy since her keynote speech at the 2020 Democratic National Convention, if not before.\n\nTo resurrect Michelle at this stage, Obama will have to make some tsunami-sized waves in these uncharted waters. It is not in his nature to do so, but in their gender-fluid household, it may be in hers.\n\nDuring Biden's tenure, I argued that Obama had neither the will nor the temperament to be Biden's puppet master. Although I had no backstage pass to White House shenanigans, I had written four books on Obama, most notably 2011's \"Deconstructing Obama\" and 2020's \"Unmasking Obama.\"\n\nIn hindsight, it is remarkable how much ink has been spilled about a man the media - left and right - understood so little.\n\nJack Cashill's new book, \"Ashli: The Untold Story of the Women of January 6,\" is now available in all formats.\n\nThey failed to understand the reality of the Obama presidency in part because of their failure to understand the political transformation that occurred during Obama's tenure in the White House.\n\n\"Liberalism,\" as understood in the post-war era, died on Obama's watch. Replacing it was \"progressivism.\" This was much more than a casual rebranding. If liberals could envision a harmonious future, benign and paternal, orderly and safe, progressives could not.\n\n\"Progressive,\" in fact, represents the rare bit of leftist nomenclature not cushioned by euphemism. At the risk of tautology, progressives \"progress.\"\n\nLike the sharks of our imagination, the newly \"woke\" move forward or they die. If liberals are to have any relevance, they follow, however uneasily, in the shark's wake. Obama was always a follower, never a leader.\n\nIn the post-Soviet era, with no one hand-guiding the international left, American progressives have moved forward on numerous fronts: black, brown, green, feminist, LGBT, Islamic, globalist, and socialist.\n\nDespite all the talk of external manipulation from the likes, say, of a George Soros, the evolution of these movements has been largely organic with the civil rights movement serving as paradigm.\n\nIf Obama led none of the left's movements, he enabled them all. A bi-racial, quasi-Muslim, quasi-Marxist dissembler of dubious sexuality, he almost perfectly fronted his party's embrace of identity politics.\n\nObama learned from leftist mentors throughout his life and sampled a wide range of socialist causes before finding himself, like a turtle on a fence post, keynoting the 2004 Democratic National Convention.\n\nObama's bourgeois lifestyle and cool demeanor made him all the more effective as a front man for a movement that had grown increasingly strident, even punitive. He was prepared to sell what he lacked the stomach to lead.\n\nFor eight years, he would serve as the nation's conscience-in-chief, assigning liberal doses of shame to those who defied America's promised transformation, and encouragement to those who promoted it.\n\nBut a front man is all Obama would ever be. Although immersed in leftist causes since childhood, he never left the shallow end of the pool. A puppet himself, he could never be the puppet master.\n\nHis people may have wanted a Michelle presidency, but they lacked the muscle to make it happen. They brought pepper spray to a coup in progress, unaware the Clintons got there first with the guns.\n\nWhen the curtain falls, we may never know who the grand puppet master actually is, but for now, at least, we know who it's not.\n\nContent created by the WND News Center is available for re-publication without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Though she is the front runner, there is opposition to her nomination and many others may challenge her. The Democrats are on the back foot with Trump's victory prospects increasing every day. They will have to pick their candidate after considering many factors and this will have to be done soon. US President Joe Biden's decision to end his election campaign has given rise to more challenges for his party. The Democrats will be holding a national convention in the month of August to pick their presidential nominee. The entire nation's focus has shifted towards the Democratic party with many wondering if Vice-President Kamala Harris may receive this coveted nomination.\n\nJoe Biden after quitting the race endorsed his running mate. Many other potential competitors have endorsed the former Attorney General of California. Though former First Lady Michelle Obama is best poised to beat Donald Trump, she has not expressed her interest in pursuing a career in politics. Under these circumstances, there are other names doing the rounds other than Kamala Harris.\n\nShe is definitely the front runner to receive the party's presidential nomination. Many including Biden, Clintons and her fellow Californian Gavin Newsom have endorsed her nomination. This should ideally pave the way for her nomination but there are many challenges which threaten her presidential bid. Many others including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have remained silent on these issues.\n\nAccording to various national surveys, the former First Lady is ahead of all the Democrats and has the best chance of defeating Donald Trump. Among the various advantages, she offers a fresh perspective as compared to both Biden and Trump. Though, her lack of interest and experience in political and administrative matters may work against her. Certain sections of the media have speculated that the former President Barack Obama is working behind the scenes to get a nomination for his wife.\n\nThe Senator from West Virginia has expressed his interest in contesting the upcoming election in November. The long time Democrat had quit the party in May and registered as an independent candidate to contest the election. He had even supported the Republicans on the issue of energy policy. Considering the new developments, the Senator may re-register with the Democratic Party and be hopeful of receiving the presidential nomination.\n\nShe is one of the few Democrats who has gone public with her intention to contest the upcoming election. She has taken to the social media after Biden decided to end his campaign and announced that she intends to contest the election and receive a presidential nomination from the party. She called on the party to give a chance to every candidate to receive the nomination. She has stressed on the importance of defeating Trump and his divisive agenda.\n\nThe US has still not elected a woman as its president. Since 1789 when George Washington created history by becoming the first US President, the country has preferred a white male candidate to serve as its commander in chief. It was only in 2009 that Barack Obama became the first person of color to be elected to the top office.\n\nThere is still no evidence to suggest that the preference of the electorate towards electing a woman candidate has changed. This may be a challenge for many including Kamala Harris and Michelle Obama. However, with the Republicans who seem to be losing the support of women, there might just be a glimmer of hope.\n\nHas Kamala Harris announced her running mate?\n\nShe is yet to receive the presidential nomination. She has been speaking to many Democrats and meeting them but has not announced her running mate.\n\nHas Michelle Obama expressed her interest in contesting the upcoming US Presidential Election?\n\nShe has stayed away from contesting the US Presidential Election. Even in 2019, she had stayed away from the race. She has stayed away from pursuing a career in politics.", "source": {"uri": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Economic Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_General_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Attorney General of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Lady_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "First Lady of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bill Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michelle Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "West Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Washington"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander-in-chief", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Commander-in-chief"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-111967892,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-1821157,overlay-economictimes/photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751667", "eventUri": "eng-9751667", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

Harris has received a flurry of endorsements from many of the country's largest labor unions since she announced her candidacy for president.\n\nWith less than 100 days to the presidential election, high-profile endorsements could prove pivotal in helping maintain the momentum that Harris campaign has enjoyed among Democrats since she entered the race less than a week ago.\n\nOn Thursday, the Harris team launched its first campaign video, which touches on gun violence, health care and abortion and is soundtracked by Beyonc\u00e9's song Freedom. Celebrity endorsements from George Clooney, Barbra Streisand, Spike Lee, Robert De Niro and Melinda French Gates among others have helped the Harris campaign raise record levels of funding within its first week.\n\nObama is the one of a handful of high-profile Democrats yet to publicly endorse Harris, who became the party's presumptive nominee after Joe Biden stepped down on Saturday amid mounting questions about his health and flailing popularity. Bill Clinton, the former president, and his wife, 2016 defeated presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, were among the first influential Democrats to back Harris, urging voters to rally around her candidacy to defeat Donald Trump.\n\nObama's support - and advice on how to win the White House - could be crucial for Harris. Michelle Obama, the former first lady, also supports Harris's candidacy, two people familiar with the matter told NBC.\n\nMeanwhile on Wednesday in Charlotte, North Carolina, Trump used his first campaign rally since Biden dropped out of the race to attack Harris, labeling her \"the most incompetent and far-left vice-president in American history\". He repeatedly mispronounced her first name, and described her progressive views on abortion access and immigration as \"crazy\".", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

She didn't particularly like being a politician's wife, either. There is simply no, nada, zip chance she is going to be the next Democratic nominee for president.\n\nYet, Fox News won't recognize that reality. The video below aired Sunday night, hours after President Joe Biden announced he would not seek a second term and endorsed his vice president. We did not know for sure the enthusiasm surge for Kamala Harris nor that her fundraising would soon smash records. But it was hard not to see at least some of that coming. Unless you're Fox News.\n\nApparently, the network refuses to give up the ghost of Racist Attacks Past. Apparently the MAGA crowd thinks it's a great idea to repurpose and weaponize the Obama attacks against Harris.\n\nAt least that's what Project 2025 contributor Monica Crowley tried last night. The segment began with Watters seeming to acknowledge Harris' potential as he talked about a \"landslide.\"\n\nTo call Crowley's conspiracy theory far-fetched would be an understatement. She argued that because Barack Obama has not yet endorsed Harris, Michelle Obama \"still may be in the mix.\"\n\nThat seemed too much even for Watters to swallow. Is she \"in the mix in Chicago, in her hometown?\" he questioned.\n\n\"Well, there is a reason why the Democrats moved their convention to Chicago, Jesse,\" Crowley claimed. \"So, they could recruit her, they can position her as the reluctant candidate.\"\n\nThen came the likely real reason Crowley spouted this ridiculousness: Doubling up the racism against Harris with Obama:\n\nCROWLEY: She's a woman of color so that squares the Kamala Harris circle - being a minority and a DEI hire. So, Michelle Obama dismisses all of that.\n\nLook, I don't know how likely that is, but I don't want everybody falling into this trap that Kamala Harris is the de facto candidate for the Democrats. This story is not over yet.\n\nJesse, realize that the left's powerbrokers never move without a plan. So, while everybody is distracted with this chaos circus, there are powers that be, namely Barack and Michelle Obama and the entire Obama machine that's essentially run this country over the last three and a half years that wants an Obama 4 and 5.0.\n\nAnd what better way to do that than to run Michelle where they can position her as somebody who didn't really want to do it but she was recruited. She's a pristine candidate. She's immune to criticism as a woman of color. And if they run her, they could raise about a billion dollars in two, three days.\n\nAt least Watters wasn't buying it. \"Yeah, I don't know,\" he said, laughing with obvious skepticism.\n\n\"I just want people to be aware there are other possibilities out there,\" Crowley insisted. \"It seems unthinkable but over the last - what, last nine years, there've been a lot of unthinkable things happening here in America.\"\n\n\"I'm not ruling anything out,\" Watters said, just before ending the interview.\n\nYou can almost smell the MAGA desperation in the interview below, from the July 21, 2024 Jesse Watters Primetime, via Media Matters.", "source": {"uri": "newshounds.us", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsHounds"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monica_Crowley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monica Crowley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michelle Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Watters", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jesse Watters"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person_of_color", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Person of color"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Matters_for_America", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Media Matters for America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "De facto"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 45}], "image": "https://assets.nationbuilder.com/newshounds/pages/15086/meta_images/original/Watters_Crowley_for_072324_FB.jpg?1721768985", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751667", "eventUri": "eng-9751667", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 118, "relevance": 1}

Endorsements flooded in for onetime presidential candidate Harris, including from Biden himself, who called his vice-president \"the best decision I've ever made\".\n\nHowever, there were notable absentees from the list of endorsements including from ex-president Barack Obama, who failed to come out in support for Harris. This prompted calls from some to have an \"open convention\", which invites the question - who else might go head-to-head with Trump?\n\nArtificial intelligence has suggested we might see familiar face and previous First Lady Michelle Obama in the presidential race. \"She hasn't been a central figure in recent presidential races but has garnered attention and support within the party,\" the AI told the Daily Star.\n\n\"Michelle Obama consistently ranks as one of the most admired women in America, enjoying broad appeal across various demographics,\" it added. \"Her eloquence and ability to connect with people on a personal level are significant assets.\n\n\"Her candidacy would undoubtedly energise the Democratic base and attract a wide range of voters.\"\n\nThe AI expert also claimed Michelle Obama would stand a great chance of beating Trump if she ran.\n\nIt said: \"She is seen as a unifying figure with a strong personal story and a history of advocating for issues that resonate with many Americans, such as education, health, and military families.\n\n\"Additionally, her appeal across different demographics, including independents and moderate Republicans, could make her a formidable candidate against Donald Trump.\"\n\nOther candidates it suggested were California Governor Gavin Newsom, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, and Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.", "source": {"uri": "dailystar.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_mcghie@dailystar.co.uk", "name": "Tom McGhie", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head of state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michelle Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Buttigieg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pete Buttigieg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Newsom", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gavin Newsom"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Transportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Secretary of Transportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_California", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor of California"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Warren", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elizabeth Warren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bernie Sanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article33296244.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Donald-Trump-And-JD-Vance-Hold-First-Joint-Campaign-Rally-After-The-RNC.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9751667", "eventUri": "eng-9751667", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 117, "relevance": 1}

Biden has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, while former President Barack Obama has urged the party to establish a process to identify an \"outstanding nominee.\"\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has received Biden's endorsement. Biden praised her as \"an extraordinary partner\" in a post on X (formerly Twitter), writing, \"Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year. Democrats - it's time to come together and beat Trump. Let's do this.\" NBC News reported that the Biden campaign had been \"quietly assessing the viability of Vice President Kamala Harris's candidacy against Donald Trump in a new head-to-head poll.\"\n\nHarris, 59, is the first woman to serve as vice president, marking the peak of a career filled with firsts and breakthroughs. Born in Oakland to immigrant parents, Harris's father is a distinguished economist from Jamaica, and her mother was a cancer researcher from India. Harris's career trajectory includes roles as a local prosecutor, California's state attorney general, and U.S. senator before becoming Biden's running mate in 2020.\n\nDespite her high name recognition and the highest polling among potential Democratic candidates, Harris faces challenges. A recent poll indicated a 29% favourability rating, with 49% viewing her unfavourably and 22% having no opinion or being unaware of her.\n\nJB Pritzker, the 59-year-old governor of Illinois, is among the wealthiest potential candidates. He has highlighted his achievements, including codifying the right to abortion in Illinois and declaring it a \"sanctuary state\" for women seeking abortions. Pritzker has also been a strong advocate for gun control and legalised recreational marijuana.\n\nGretchen Whitmer has rapidly ascended within the Democratic Party, from law school graduate to Michigan's governor. Her prominence was cemented in 2022 with a decisive re-election and the Democratic Party's control of both state legislative chambers for the first time in nearly four decades.\n\nWhitmer, 52, has focused on abortion access as co-chair of the Biden campaign, asserting Biden's alignment with the issue despite his recent debate performance. She attributes political hatred, fueled by Trump, as the motive behind a 2020 plot to kidnap and kill her, which was foiled by the FBI. However, Whitmer has stated definitively that she will not run for president this year.\n\nJoe Manchin\n\nJoe Manchin, the centre-right senator from West Virginia, has long considered a run for the Democratic nomination. Serving in the Senate since 2010 and chairing the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Manchin has been a vocal critic of the Democratic Party. Last year, facing a tough re-election race, he announced he would not seek another Senate term and registered as an independent. Recent reports suggest he is contemplating re-registering as a Democrat and challenging Harris.\n\nMichelle Obama, widely popular during her tenure as First Lady, has long been a favourite among some Democrats for a presidential run. An Ipsos poll found she is the only hypothetical candidate who would definitively defeat Trump head-to-head and she enjoys high favourability among registered voters.\n\nDespite this, Michelle Obama has consistently expressed no interest in running for office. Earlier this year, her office told NBC News she was not planning to run in 2024. In a discussion with Oprah Winfrey, she reflected on why she would likely never enter politics, stating, \"Politics is hard. And the people who get into it... you've got to want it. It's got to be in your soul because it is so important. It is not in my soul.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailynewsegypt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily News Egypt"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamala_Harris", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kamala Harris"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gretchen_Whitmer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gretchen Whitmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

The new search engine will compete with the likes of the existing ones, such as Google's and also Microsoft's Bing. However, SearchGPT cannot be accessed by the general public as of now. The first mention of a search engine being in works at OpenAI came via a leak months back.\n\nAnnounced via a blog post, SearchGPT is currently a prototype of new search features designed to combine the strength of OpenAI's AI models with information from the web to give users \"fast and timely answers with clear and relevant sources.\"\n\nThe company is launching SearchGPT to a small group of users and publishers to get feedback.

Importantly, SearchGPT is about search and is separate from training OpenAI's generative AI foundation models.

Although described as a \"temporary prototype,\" the Thursday reveal is a clear shot across the bow of the singularly dominant Google -- as well as Microsoft Bing, which currently provides search results for OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\n\"We're testing SearchGPT, a prototype of new search features designed to combine the strength of our AI models with information from the web to give you fast and timely answers with clear and relevant sources,\" OpenAI said in an official blog post.\n\nThe company said SearchGPT is currently available as a prototype to 10,000 test users at launch. The service is powered by the GPT-4 family of models.\n\nOpenAI's foray into live web search has been long rumored, especially given the limitations of typical large-language models, which rely on a large but static corpus of data collected up to a point in time, limiting its knowledge of current events.\n\nA series of teaser videos shared by OpenAI show that the new AI search tool is designed to summarize website content, including news sites, and answer user questions similarly to how ChatGPT operates. In some ways, it's similar to what Perplexity -- touted as an \"answer engine\" -- currently offers. But if integrated into ChatGPT itself, SearchGPT would make OpenAI's chatbot broadly capable.\n\nSuch an integration would create a multimodal AI tool that can handle various types of media and provide comprehensive search results.\n\nNotably, SearchGPT appears to replace Microsoft Bing with its own technology. The videos shared by OpenAI don't show the typical banner indicating that search results are powered by Bing, as with the current version of ChatGPT. And while Google has been integrating AI into its services, SearchGPT's advanced capabilities clearly pose a significant threat.\n\nIn fact, Microsoft (which powers Bing) and Alphabet (the company behind Google) saw their stock prices tumble moments after the news broke. Both stocks saw a tangible dip, and closed down about 3% for the day.\n\nSearchGPT is the latest development in what appears to be a new era in web search, which The Verge's Nilay Patel has termed \"Google Zero.\" This approach prioritizes practicality over variety: instead of presenting a list with different sources and approaches to a specific query, which encourages users to do their own research, AI-powered search engines opt for a more direct tactic, providing concise, summarized information responding exactly to what users are looking for.\n\nThe introduction of Google's AI summaries has raised huge red flags for web publishers, however, as users are less likely to visit their sites if the information is extracted and provided up front. The issue is compounded by AI's tendency to hallucinate, and even provide dangerous answers based on flawed sources.\n\nTo address these concerns, OpenAI said publishers will be able to adopt different strategies when dealing with its search engine and its AI chatbot.\n\n\"SearchGPT is about search and is separate from training OpenAI's generative AI foundation models,\" OpenAI said. \"Sites can be surfaced in search results even if they opt out of generative AI training.\"\n\nMeanwhile, OpenAI has also partnered with various publishers to enhance the content and accuracy of SearchGPT. These partnerships allow OpenAI to provide current information along with clear, in-line attribution and links to original sources. Notable partners include News Corp and The Associated Press.\n\n\"SearchGPT is designed to help users connect with publishers by prominently citing and linking to them in searches,\" OpenAI said in its announcement. \"Responses have clear, in-line, named attribution and links so users know where information is coming from and can quickly engage with even more results in a sidebar with source links.\"\n\nAs with other of OpenAI's technologies -- like Sora or its Voice Engine -- this is just a teaser to let users know what the AI behemoth is working on. Sam Altman said that even in its early form, however, he preferred SearchGPT over legacy search engines. He also promised a better experience in the future.\n\n\"We will learn from the prototype, make it better, and then integrate the tech into ChatGPT to make it real-time and maximally helpful,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "decrypt.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "Decrypt"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jose_antonio_lanz@decrypt.co", "name": "Jose Antonio Lanz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-4", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "GPT-4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimodal_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Multimodal learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perplexity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Perplexity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_answering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Question answering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Verge", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Verge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination_(artificial_intelligence)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hallucination (artificial intelligence)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_models", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foundation models"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sam Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 81}], "image": "https://cdn.decrypt.co/resize/1024/height/512/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/OpenAI-shutterstock_2261170113-16x9-1-gID_7.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764082", "eventUri": "eng-9764082", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 223, "relevance": 1}

Even so, it's a watershed moment for the generative AI company and may represent the first substantial challenge to Google's Search engine dominance.\n\nOpenAI announced that it's testing SearchGPT in a blog post on Thursday. It calls it a \"temporary prototype\" and only posts a waiting list for access. Even so, we're learning a lot about the kind of results you can expect from SearchGPT.\n\nThe main screen will start with an open prompt box pre-filled with the phrase, \"What are you looking for?\" It will accept natural language queries, which is not unlike Google, but unlike the world's most popular search engine, SearchGPT will accept follow-up queries.\n\nOne example is a search for \"Best tomatoes to grow in Minnesota\" and then a follow-up query, \"Which of these can I plant now?\" OpenAI implies that the context will be maintained through additional queries, a feat not currently possible with Google or Microsoft's Bing search engine.\n\nOpenAI's development of a search engine is notable, considering that the initial version of its Large Language Model (LLM)-based ChatGPT did not have access to the web for real-time information. Its data training stopped somewhere in 2021.\n\nSearchGPT will, by contrast, according to OpenAI, \"combine the strength of our AI models with information from the web to give you fast and timely answers with clear and relevant sources.\"\n\nOpenAI does make it clear that SearchGPT will cite its sources and include direct links to them, something that it's not always clear that Google's new Gemini AI-based search results are doing. There is a sense that OpenAI is trying to play the role of a good search engine citizen by promising to help users \"discover publishers' sites and experiences.\" Considering how many publishers and content creators are currently suing OpenAI for allegedly scrapping their data to train its models, it's a notable stance.\n\nThe AI company is already lining up publisher partners like The Atlantic.\n\n\"AI search is going to become one of the key ways that people navigate the internet, and it's crucial, in these early days, that the technology is built in a way that values, respects, and protects journalism and publishers. We look forward to partnering with OpenAI in the process, and creating a new way for readers to discover The Atlantic,\" said The Atlantic CEO Nicholas Thompson in the SearchGPT blog post.\n\nPerhaps as an end run around current data scrapping litigation, OpenAI points out that \"SearchGPT is about search and is separate from training OpenAI's generative AI foundation models,\" and adds publisher results will be included even if they do not agree to OpenAI's generative training.\n\nSearchGPT is also promising more visual search results that appear to look little like the ones you might expect from Google or Bing.\n\nSearchGPT will be a standalone AI search engine, but OpenAI plans to eventually integrate it into ChatGPT, which may make that platform far more powerful and useful.\n\nThe arrival of SearchGPT comes just weeks after Google integrated Gemini Generative Search results at the top of many search results pages as AIO overviews. It was a move met with some chagrin by those who rely on Google for quick, no-nonsense results and by publishers who worry their results and links are getting pushed further down on the page. Google was likely spurred partly to make the AI move by Bing, which owns first-mover status in the AI search space with generative AI based on OpenAI's ChatGPT. In a way, it feels like AI search has come full circle.

Backed by Microsoft (MSFT), OpenAI announced that SearchGPT will initially be available to a select group of users and publishers for development and feedback purposes.\n\nOpenAI positions SearchGPT as a new way to search the web, leveraging enhanced conversational capabilities combined with real-time web information. \"Getting answers on the web can take a lot of effort, often requiring multiple attempts to get relevant results. We believe that by enhancing the conversational capabilities of our models with real-time information from the web, finding what you're looking for can be faster and easier,\" the company stated in a blog post.\n\nThe company hopes to eventually integrate SearchGPT directly into ChatGPT. Users interested in accessing the search engine can sign up for OpenAI's waitlist.\n\nFollowing the announcement, shares of Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) saw a slight decline. Generative AI has raised concerns among publishers about potential losses in advertising revenue due to users not needing to visit websites. OpenAI aims to mitigate these fears by including links to sources and publishers' websites in search responses. \"SearchGPT is designed to help users connect with publishers by prominently citing and linking to them in searches,\" OpenAI explained.\n\nOpenAI assures that SearchGPT is separate from how the company trains its AI models. Publishers who opt out of data use for training will still appear in SearchGPT results. Google also offers generative AI capabilities in its search product, called AI Overviews, which summarizes data from websites in a single paragraph with links. However, SearchGPT is built specifically with generative AI in mind, potentially giving OpenAI an advantage.\n\nMicrosoft's Bing also offers generative AI features. However, generative AI search results can be unreliable. Google faced issues with AI Overviews providing bizarre responses shortly after its launch.\n\nDespite the challenges, even a small shift in market share could be significant for OpenAI. According to Statcounter, Google controls 91% of the global search engine market, which rises to 95% on mobile devices. Microsoft CFO Amy Hood noted that a 1 percentage point increase in search advertising market share could generate $2 billion in annual revenue.", "source": {"uri": "naija247news.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Naija247news"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_okafor@naija247news.com", "name": "David Okafor", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StatCounter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "StatCounter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/E-mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://naija247news.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_9020.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764082", "eventUri": "eng-9764082", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 220, "relevance": 1}

Now, OpenAI is shaking up the search engine market, too.\n\nOn Thursday, OpenAI unveiled SearchGPT, OpenAI's AI-powered search engine, which has awareness of current events through internet access. Even though the search experience is currently a prototype, OpenAI does plan to integrate the best features directly into ChatGPT in the future.\n\nSearchGPT allows users to enter a search query as they would with any search engine. However, its major difference from a traditional search engine is that the chatbot's outputs include a conversational response with real-time information pulled from the web.\n\nAlso: How to use ChatGPT\n\nSimilarly to the Browse feature in ChatGPT, when SearchGPT outputs an answer, it will have a link to the site it pulled from in parentheses to facilitate fact-checking and research. If users still want to see a more traditional search engine results page, they will be able to click the \"link\" icon on the left sidebar. This will display a list of web pages and links next to the conversational response.\n\nUsers will also be able to ask follow-up questions, which help them get the answer they want without having to click multiple different links or enter a new prompt.\n\nThe feature is available now to a small group of users and publishers as OpenAI collects feedback. However, if you want to try the prototype, you can join the waitlist here.\n\nTo address concerns that AI search engines could potentially harm publishers by causing fewer people to visit their web pages, OpenAI says that SearchGPT was designed to connect publishers and users with proper attribution, linking, and citing. In the release, OpenAI also reassures the public that it is working closer with publishers to build the experience in a mutually beneficial way.\n\nPublishers will also be able to manage how they appear in SearchGPT, giving them more control over their participation in the experience. Additionally, because this experience is separate from OpenAI's foundational models, publishers can choose not to have their content used for training its generative AI models while still having their web pages appear on the SearchGPT results.\n\nSo, when SearchGPT's best features are added to ChatGPT, will it be enough to sway people away from Google, which dominates the search engine space with a 91.62% share as of February 2024, according to reports? Time will tell.\n\nAlso: How does ChatGPT work?\n\nEven though SearchGPT functions a lot like a traditional search engine, OpenAI has made it clear in the past that it's not interested in creating another search engine.\n\n\"I don't think the world needs another copy of Google,\" said Sam Altman on the Lex Fridman podcast earlier this year.\n\nRather, OpenAI has set its sights on integrating search into ChatGPT to elevate the chatbot's capabilities and build on what the tool currently offers. The company believes this area is where it will see more success and users to integrate ChatGPT into their lives even further.\n\nUsers who already use ChatGPT consistently will be incentivized to use ChatGPT more. They can have the same experience they know and love on ChatGPT, including its conversational responses, but with the bonus of what search engines currently offer.\n\nMicrosoft took a stab at adding generative AI to search with its Copilot integration into Bing in September 2023, and the results have been positive. In a Q3 2024 earnings call, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella announced that Bing reached over 140 million daily active users, which marked a gain of over 40 million users in a year. This growth can be partially attributed to the tech giant's Copilot efforts.\n\nAlso: The best AI search engines of 2024: Google, Perplexity, and more\n\nSimilarly, Perplexity, an AI-powered search engine, has gained 10 million active monthly users and a $1 billion evaluation, according to reports. However, it is worth noting that neither company has come close to threatening Google's search dominance despite the growth of these AI-based search engines.\n\nGoogle has continuously introduced updates to its search engine to keep up with the AI boom. The company announced its Search Generative Experience (SGE) at Google I/O last year. At Google I/O this year, Google rolled out AI-generated overviews widely.\n\nHowever, Google had to readjust its AI Search strategy because of user complaints and problems with AI overview citations.

SearchGPT is a an AI-powered search engine with real-time access to internet-based information.\n\nCurrently a prototype, SearchGPT starts as a large textbox that asks, \"What are you looking for?\" Unlike Google's Search, OpenAI's engine doesn't just return pages of links. Instead, the tool attempts to organize the information and provide summaries.\n\nIn a example that OpenAI provided in their announcement, SearchGPT summarizes a query on music festivals and produces short descriptions of various festivals with an attribution link. A sidebar with other relevant links also populates and can be accessed for more information.\n\nAnother example involves planting tomatoes. The search explains when to plant and breaks down different varietals of tomatoes. Follow up queries can be put in the search bar that appears at the bottom of the page.\n\nThe new tool is powered by the GPT-4 family of AI models. OpenAI says that the goal is to eventually \" integrate the best of these features directly into ChatGPT in the future.\"\n\nBetween Perplexity and OpenAI, Google now has some competition in the search realm. Clearly Google has felt the pressure since the company has been shoving AI into search results in recent months.\n\nIt has not gone well. After Google announced AI Overviews in May during their annual I/O event, the summarization tool launched to massive backlash after it provided seemingly dangerous and factually incorrect information. But they have been testing generative AI in Search for a while now.\n\nDespite the poor launch of AI Overviews and Google's continued backpedaling, it hasn't totally gone away. The feature and other AI tools are still percolating in the background, but one wonders if OpenAI's announcement will cause Google to rush forward with new or updated AI search tools. Especially since Google parent company, Alphabet has seen its stock already dip as a result of this announcement, according to a CNBC report.\n\nMeanwhile, a Wired investigation found that Perplexity has been stealing content or making things up with Forbes threatening the AI company with legal action.\n\nOpenAI appears to be aware of the struggles of its competitors and has seemingly taken that into account. The blog post announcement emphasized that SearchGPT is in collaboration with publishers like The Atlantic and News Corp.\n\n\"SearchGPT is designed to help users connect with publishers by prominently citing and linking to them in searches,\" the post claims. \"Responses have clear, in-line, named attribution and links so users know where information is coming from and can quickly engage with even more results in a sidebar with source links.\"\n\nApparently, publishes like The Wall Street Journal and Associated Press can determine how their work appears in the service. OpenAI claims the SearchGPT is separate from training used on generative AI models like ChatGPT.\n\nThese moves, as well as announcing a prototype, seem designed to help OpenAI avoid the controversial missteps that Google and Perplexity have taken.\n\nOpenAI working on a Search Engine isn't news. We've been hearing rumors of a ChatGPT-powered search engine since at least February. It was thought that before Google's I/O event, OpenAI would be dropping a new search engine. That turned out to be the powerful GPT-4o model, not without it's own controversy.\n\nSearchGPT is free for now, and may be free whenever it launches in full to the public, but OpenAI's costs are rising. The Information reported that the company could lose $4 billion just in renting Microsoft servers to power ChatGPT.\n\nIt may be partly why we've seen OpenAI enter into more partnerships like those with publishers but also manufacturers like Apple.\n\nSearchGPT is in testing with about 10,000 users but you can sign up for a waitlist if you are curious about trying out OpenAI's version of a search engine.", "source": {"uri": "tomsguide.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tom's Guide"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scott_younker@tomsguide.com", "name": "Scott Younker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-4", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "GPT-4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_summarization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Automatic summarization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wired (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "output"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Information_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Information (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Server (computing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Atlantic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4yyMKHJ9m77obrax9Rdfkh-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764082", "eventUri": "eng-9764082", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 215, "relevance": 1}

ChatGPT can already perform web searches using Bing, but SearchGPT seems to be a purpose-built interface for AI-assisted web searching.\n\nSearchGPT attempts to streamline the process of finding information online by combining OpenAI's AI models (like GPT-4o) with real-time web data. Like ChatGPT, users can reportedly ask SearchGPT follow-up questions, with the AI model maintaining context throughout the conversation.\n\nPerhaps most importantly from an accuracy standpoint, the SearchGPT prototype (which we have not tested ourselves) reportedly includes features that attribute web-based sources prominently. Responses include in-line citations and links, while a sidebar displays additional source links.\n\nOpenAI has not yet said how it is obtaining its real-time web data and whether it's partnering with an existing search engine provider (like it does currently with Bing for ChatGPT) or building its own web-crawling and indexing system.\n\nA way around publishers blocking OpenAI\n\nChatGPT can already perform web searches using Bing, but since last August when OpenAI revealed a way to block its web crawler, that feature hasn't been nearly as useful as it could be. Many sites, such as Ars Technica (which blocks the OpenAI crawler as part of our parent company's policy), won't show up as results in ChatGPT because of this.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nSearchGPT appears to untangle the association between OpenAI's web crawler for scraping training data and the desire for OpenAI chatbot users to search the web. Notably, in the new SearchGPT announcement, OpenAI says, \"Sites can be surfaced in search results even if they opt out of generative AI training.\"\n\nEven so, OpenAI says it is working on a way for publishers to manage how they appear in SearchGPT results, so that \"publishers have more choices.\" And the company says that SearchGPT's ability to browse the web is separate from training OpenAI's AI models.\n\nAn uncertain future for AI-powered search\n\nOpenAI claims SearchGPT will make web searches faster and easier. However, the effectiveness of AI-powered search compared to traditional methods is unknown, as the tech is still in its early stages. But let's be honest: The most prominent web-search engine right now is pretty terrible.\n\nOver the past year, we've seen Perplexity.ai take off as a potential AI-powered Google search replacement, but the service has been hounded by issues with confabulations and accusations of plagiarism among publishers, including Ars Technica parent Cond\u00e9 Nast.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nUnlike Perplexity, OpenAI has many content deals lined up with publishers, and it emphasizes that it wants to work with content creators in particular. \"We are committed to a thriving ecosystem of publishers and creators,\" says OpenAI in its news release. \"We hope to help users discover publisher sites and experiences, while bringing more choice to search.\"\n\nIn a statement for the OpenAI press release, Nicholas Thompson, CEO of The Atlantic (which has a content deal with OpenAI), expressed optimism about the potential of AI search: \"AI search is going to become one of the key ways that people navigate the internet, and it's crucial, in these early days, that the technology is built in a way that values, respects, and protects journalism and publishers,\" he said. \"We look forward to partnering with OpenAI in the process, and creating a new way for readers to discover The Atlantic.\"\n\nOpenAI has experimented with other offshoots of its AI language model technology that haven't become blockbuster hits (most notably, GPTs come to mind), so time will tell if the techniques behind SearchGPT have staying power -- and if it can deliver accurate results without hallucinating. But the current state of web search is inviting new experiments to separate the signal from the noise, and it looks like OpenAI is throwing its hat in the ring.\n\nOpenAI is currently rolling out SearchGPT to a small group of users and publishers for testing and feedback. Those interested in trying the prototype can sign up for a waitlist on the company's website.", "source": {"uri": "arstechnica.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Ars Technica"}, "authors": [{"uri": "benj_edwards@arstechnica.com", "name": "Benj Edwards", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prototype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Web crawler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spamming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spamming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terms_of_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terms of service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training,_validation,_and_test_data_sets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Training, validation, and test data sets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ars_Technica", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ars Technica"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Web application"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cond\u00e9_Nast", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cond\u00e9 Nast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plagiarism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plagiarism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hallucination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Atlantic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/openai_newspaper_3-760x380.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764082", "eventUri": "eng-9764082", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

You type in a query, and SearchGPT serves up information and photos from the web along with links to relevant sources, at which point you can ask follow-up questions or explore additional, related searches in a sidebar.\n\nPowered by OpenAI models (specifically GPT-3.5, GPT-4 and GPT-4o), SearchGPT -- which OpenAI describes as a prototype -- is launching today for \"a small group\" of users and publishers. (There's a waitlist here.) OpenAI says that it plans to integrate some features of SearchGPT into ChatGPT in the future.\n\n\"Getting answers on the web can take a lot of effort, often requiring multiple attempts to get relevant results,\" OpenAI writes in a blog post. \"We believe that by enhancing the conversational capabilities of our models with real-time information from the web, finding what you're looking for can be faster and easier.\"\n\nIt's long been rumored that OpenAI's taken an interest in launching a Google killer of sorts. The Information reported in February that a product -- or at least a pilot -- was in the works. But the launch of SearchGPT comes at an inopportune moment: as AI-powered search tools are under justifiable fire for plagiarism, inaccuracies and content cannibalism.\n\nGoogle's take on AI-powered search, AI Overviews, infamously suggested putting glue on a pizza. The Browser Company's Arc Search told one reporter that cut-off toes will grow back. AI search engine Genspark at one time readily recommended weapons that could be used to kill someone. And Perplexity ripped off news articles written by other outlets, including CNBC, Bloomberg, and Forbes, without giving credit or attribution.\n\nAI-generated overviews threaten to cannibalize traffic to the sites from which they source their info. Indeed, they already are, with one study finding that AI Overviews could negatively affect about 25% of publisher traffic due to the de-emphasis on article links.\n\nOpenAI -- taking a page out of Perplexity's ongoing apology tour -- is positioning SearchGPT as a more responsible, measured deployment.\n\nOpenAI says that SearchGPT \"prominently cites and links\" to publishers in searches with \"clear, in-line, named attribution.\" It also says that it's working with publishers to design the experience and providing a way for website owners to manage how their content appears in search results.\n\n\"Importantly, SearchGPT is about search and is separate from training OpenAI's generative AI foundation models. Sites can be surfaced in search results even if they opt out of generative AI training,\" OpenAI clarifies in the blog post. \"We are committed to a thriving ecosystem of publishers and creators.\"\n\nIt's a bit tough to take a company that once scraped millions of YouTube transcripts without permission to train its models at their word.

This new AI-powered search engine promises fast, accurate answers with clear sources, sparking significant interest amid the global AI expansion. Co-founded by CEO Sam Altman, the AI startup's latest move could revolutionize the way we interact with online information.\n\nOpenAI Starts Testing SearchGPT\n\nOpenAI's announcement of SearchGPT marks a significant step in AI search technology. The prototype aims to provide quick, timely answers with clear and relevant sources, enhancing user experience. However, the firm plans to test SearchGPT with a small group of users and publishers for now, seeking feedback to refine the tool before integrating it into ChatGPT.\n\nAccording to a recent blog post from OpenAI, SearchGPT combines the strengths of its artificial intelligence (AI) models with real-time web information. This approach aims to make finding relevant results faster and easier. Instead of screening through multiple search results, users can receive direct answers with links to credible sources.\n\nMeanwhile, the new search feature also supports follow-up questions, allowing users to build on shared context, much like a conversation with a person. This conversational capability is designed to enhance the search experience, making it more intuitive and user-friendly.\n\nOpenAI, led by its CEO Sam Altman, emphasizes its commitment to collaborating with publishers and content creators. SearchGPT aims to highlight high-quality content in a conversational interface, providing multiple opportunities for user engagement. The tool prominently cites and links to sources in search responses, ensuring users know where the information comes from.\n\nMeanwhile, the AI startup behind ChatGPT has already announced a partnership with various publishers to build and improve this experience. They are also launching new controls for publishers to manage how their content appears in SearchGPT. Precisely, sites can appear in search results even if they opt out of training the AI startup's generative AI models, maintaining a clear distinction between search and AI training.\n\nIn addition, OpenAI plans to continue enhancing SearchGPT, focusing on areas like local information and commerce. Besides, they will gather feedback from users and publishers to integrate the best features into ChatGPT. The firm also invites interested users to sign up for the waitlist to try the SearchGPT prototype and contribute to its development.\n\nThis update has ignited discussions in the market, reflecting the growing interest in AI-driven solutions.

OpenAI eventually intends to incorporate search capabilities into ChatGPT as well as offer it as a standalone product.\n\nAccording to OpenAI, SearchGPT is a preliminary prototype that combines the company's AI models, such as ChatGPT, with internet search capabilities to respond to searches in a conversational format and provide up-to-date information with clear links to relevant sources of information.\n\nThe search feature positions the company as a direct competitor to major search engines, including not only Google but also Bing, a product of Microsoft, OpenAI's largest investor.\n\nThe integration of generative AI into search engines has become something of an arms race among technology companies, even though AI has a history of producing inaccurate results and raising copyright concerns.\n\nIn a blog post praising the new search method, OpenAI said, \"Getting answers on the web takes a lot of effort and often requires multiple tries to get relevant results. We believe that by enhancing our model's conversational capabilities with real-time information from the web, it will be faster and easier to find what you're looking for.\"\n\nDepending on how SearchGPT presents and cites its sources, there is a risk of increased backlash from publishers over how OpenAI uses their content.\n\nSeveral news outlets and media organizations, including The New York Times, The Chicago Tribune, The Intercept, and local newspapers, have filed lawsuits against the company in recent months for alleged copyright infringement, alleging that OpenAI has trained AI models on their published work without their permission, profiting from their protected material and effectively stealing their work.\n\nOpenAI denies claims that its use of copyrighted data in training products like ChatGPT is illegal, arguing instead that its services create something new and therefore fall under the fair use doctrine.\n\nOther companies' forays into AI-generated search have also drawn backlash from users and publishers. Google recently launched its own AI-enabled search feature, called AI Overviews, which summarizes the content of search results without requiring users to click through to other websites.\n\nWhile Google touted the success of the feature during its earnings call this week, its introduction drew criticism from publishers and creators who worry that AI Overview will draw traffic and advertising revenue away from their sites.\n\nAnother well-known AI-powered search engine, Perplexity, can produce results that are nearly identical to the text of the news articles it uses as a source. Several publishers have sent legal threats to Perplexity, demanding that the search engine stop using their content in search results.\n\nOpenAI said it is partnering with publishers for SearchGPT to give them choice over how their content appears in search results while also working to promote trusted sources of information.\n\nThe company's press release included statements from The Atlantic's CEO and News Corp's CEO, who reportedly signed lucrative content deals with OpenAI, praising AI-powered search as the future of the internet.\n\nOpenAI's potential to revolutionize the online search industry comes as Google awaits a court ruling in a landmark antitrust lawsuit brought by the U.S. Department of Justice.

Advances in AI have opened the way for competitors including Perplexity, a two-year-old start-up billing itself as an \"answer engine\" that has shot to a $1bn valuation.\n\nGoogle has been slow to pivot its search engine towards generative AI but, in May, US users began to see an \"AI Overview\" -- a brief AI-generated summary answer to queries -- at the top of many common search results, followed by clickable links interspersed with advertisements lower down.\n\nThese kinds of search results, which include an \"AI-powered snapshot\", are more costly for Google to serve up than its traditional responses because generative AI consumes more computing resources.\n\nThe Financial Times reported in April that Google has considered charging for \"premium\" search features powered by generative AI, in what would be the biggest ever shake-up of its business model.\n\nFor OpenAI, the big challenge with AI-generated search so far is that chatbots like ChatGPT are prone to responding inaccurately, or \"hallucinating\" facts, numbers and references.\n\nThis is, in part, because the highly complex models that underpin the chatbot are trained to predict patterns in language, not to crawl, index and surface information on the web like traditional search engines.\n\nGoogle's AI overviews have faced similar issues. When the feature was first rolled out in US search results, they told users that eating rocks could be healthy, advised them to glue cheese to pizza and described former US president Barack Obama as a Muslim.\n\nSearchGPT will instead \"provide up-to-date information from the web while giving you clear links to relevant sources\", according to OpenAI. The new search tool will be able to access sites even if they have opted out of training OpenAI's generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT.\n\nAI companies have caused controversy among news publishers, who have accused tech companies of breaching copyright by scraping data from websites and regurgitating sections of articles without attribution.\n\nThe New York Times sued OpenAI and its main backer Microsoft last year for \"profit[ing] from the massive copyright infringement, commercial exploitation and misappropriation of The Times's intellectual property\", claims which OpenAI refutes.\n\nAmid the conflict, the start-up has built licensing relationships with several publishers, which it said has tested and designed the search tool with publishers' product teams.\n\n\"[OpenAI] innately understand that for AI-powered search to be effective, it must be founded on the highest quality, most reliable information furnished by trusted sources,\" said Robert Thomson, chief executive of News Corp.", "source": {"uri": "ft.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financial Times News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type":

intelligence engine to work in a challenge to Google's market-dominating search engine.\n\nThe startup behind ChatGPT announced that it is testing a \"SearchGPT\" prototype that is \"designed to combine the strength of our AI models with information from the web\" to answer online queries quickly and to provide relevant sources.\n\nSearchGPT is being made available to a small group of users and publishers to get feedback, OpenAI said in a blog post.\n\nSearch features refined in the prototype will be woven into ChatGPT in the future, according to the San Francisco-based company.\n\nUsers will be able to interact with SearchGPT through conversational queries, and can ask follow-up questions as they might if speaking to a person, OpenAI said.\n\nGoogle recently added AI-generated query result summaries -- referred to as \"Overviews\" -- to its search engine, causing worries among some that the move would result in fewer opportunities to serve up money-making ads.\n\nThis new feature offers written text at the top of results for Google searches, ahead of the traditional links to sites, which summarizes information that the engine believes answers the user's search query.\n\nOpenAI's description of SearchGPT sounded similar to Google's Overviews.\n\nSince the release of ChatGPT at the end of 2022, companies in the sector have been engaged in a frantic race to deploy generative AI programs for producing text, images and other content through prompts in everyday language.\n\n\"We are innovating at every layer of the AI stack,\" Google chief Sundar Pichai said this week during an earnings call for parent company Alphabet, which he also heads.\n\nOpenAI said it was working with some publishers to refine SearchGPT, which is being kept separate from the training of its generative AI foundation models.\n\n\"AI search is going to become one of the key ways that people navigate the internet, and it's crucial, in these early days, that the technology is

SearchGPT may eventually be integrated into OpenAI's popular chatbot, ChatGPT. In addition to broader web searches, the search engine will also leverage information provided by publishers who have signed agreements to give OpenAI access to their data.\n\nOpenAI spokesperson Kayla Wood declined to demo SearchGPT or make it available for an interview with WIRED, but acknowledged that the company has already given access to unnamed partners and publishers and has used their feedback to improve various aspects of the search engine.\n\nMicrosoft, an investor in OpenAI, was one of the first companies to publicly launch a generative AI search engine, releasing an AI-powered version of Bing that leveraged OpenAI's large-scale language models in 2023. Microsoft's AI search experience has since been rebranded as Copilot.\n\nSince then, several competitors, including Google and Perplexity, have launched their own AI search experiences for users. Google's AI Overviews displays AI-generated summaries of articles, often at the top of news search results, while OpenAI's SearchGPT appears similar to Perplexity's approach in that the chatbot provides a list of related links and allows users to ask follow-up questions.\n\nAfter OpenAI first introduced ChatGPT in November 2022, early users envisioned that the chatbot's ability to mine and summarize information from the web could replace traditional web search. But the shortcomings of large language models make chatbots imperfect search tools: The models rely on training data that's months or years old, and make up facts when they don't know the answer.\n\nMicrosoft's early efforts with Bing were far from successful, with the AI-powered search engine giving out odd, inappropriate and incorrect answers, and Bing's market share only increased slightly even after an overhaul.\n\nWhen Google added AI summaries to its search results in May this year, the company immediately ran into reliability issues, such as recommendations to add glue to pizza. OpenAI's SearchGPT may use an approach to generative AI called search augmentation generation, which is the industry standard for AI search and is designed to reduce the rate of hallucinations in chatbot answers. In the RAG approach, the AI tool references trusted sources, such as preferred news websites, when generating output, and links to the data's original location.\n\nThere's also the possibility of copyright infringement. Perplexity in particular has been criticized by publications like WIRED for copying pieces of original journalism in its AI search tools and appearing to ignore requests from some websites not to pull content from them. In an OpenAI blog post, the company said of its efforts with publishers: \"SearchGPT is designed to help users connect with publishers by citing and linking to them prominently in search.\" Several companies, including Vox Media, The Atlantic, News Corp and The Financial Times, have signed licensing agreements with OpenAI this year.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prototype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perplexity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Perplexity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wired (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training,_validation,_and_test_data_sets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Training, validation, and test data sets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vox_Media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vox Media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Financial Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_infringement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Copyright infringement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hallucination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Atlantic"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://i.imgur.com/AoyxWyw.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764082", "eventUri": "eng-9764082", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

OpenAI is focused on using real-time online info and proper citations. This prototype is not a final product but a step towards enhancing ChatGPT.\n\nPeople already treat talking to AI-powered chatbots like ChatGPT as an alternative to looking for answers with a Google Search, and now OpenAI is making it more official -- the company is introducing SearchGPT, an AI search prototype built on the bones of ChatGPT that you can sign up to try right now.\n\nSearchGPT is an alternative of sorts to a normal Google Search, which is already populated with AI-generated responses thanks to Google's AI Overviews. The new prototype is also OpenAI's first real step towards integrating current online information into its AI models. Up until this point, unless you were using an extension like Browse with Bing, which fed current web results into ChatGPT's answers, everything the model used to respond to questions and generate ideas was based on out-of-date information from when OpenAI last fed the model new training data. SearchGPT has what appears to be real-time web results.\n\nThe whole point is that looking for answers with SearchGPT will be more natural and allow for follow-up questions in a way a normal web search simply can't. And even though this is clearly a prototype, OpenAI is willing to let some people try it out for themselves. Here's what SearchGPT can do, and how you can sign up to put it through its paces.\n\nRelated I tried NotebookLM with Gemini 1.5 Pro and it's better than ChatGPT\n\nI didn't have to guess where the AI pulled information from, which made fact-checking and research so much easier.\n\nSearchGPT is more answer engine than search engine OpenAI is not focused on links OpenAI / Pocket-lint\n\nSearchGPT starts with a traditional search box, which accepts the same kinds of questions you might already ask Google. To go off of OpenAI's example, searching for \"when is the best time to see nudibranchs in Half Moon Bay this weekend\" pulls up images of the sea creature (think a sea slug, but more fun), along with the locations of tide pools to visit and the recommended times you should look for them.\n\nUnlike ChatGPT, which would typically answer this kind of question with text formatted like a chat response, SearchGPT creates a bespoke page, formatted to be legible and pleasing to read. You can also ask a follow-up question about the weather, for example, and SearchGPT keeps the context of your first question in mind. And when you do need a list of links, there's a sidebar on the side you can pull up to access them.\n\nSearchGPT keeps proper citations in mind OpenAI / Pocket-lint\n\nThe whole experience is remarkably similar to what Perplexity, an AI company focused on creating a Google Search alternative, produces. Perplexity scans websites for results and produces a lightly formatted natural language response to whatever question you throw at it. There are images if you need them, and Perplexity can answer follow-up questions too. The company even launched a feature called Perplexity Pages that lets you share your results with other people, and tweak formatting and tone after the fact.\n\nThe devil is in the details when it comes to the difference between the two \"answer engines,\" however. Whereas Perplexity was credibly caught plagiarizing text from sources it technically shouldn't have access to, OpenAI has made a show of making deals with web publishers to train on their articles and more prominently feature them in ChatGPT. That's not to say OpenAI isn't likely guilty of the same scraping and plagiarism as it's competitors, just that now it's asking for permission before it gets in more trouble. SearchGPT is even designed with publishers in mind, with \"clear, in-line, named attribution and links,\" according to OpenAI. The company is also \"launching a way for publishers to manage how they appear in SearchGPT,\" though it's not entirely clear what that means.\n\nHow to try SearchGPT for yourself The odds are not in your favor\n\nThe SearchGPT prototype is available to test for anyone with a ChatGPT account, which you can create with an email and password, or by connecting to an existing Apple, Google, or Microsoft account. Here's the basic steps:\n\nHead to ChatGPT to log in or create an account. Fill in the required information. Head to the SearchGPT landing page to join the waitlist. Wait for an email giving you access.\n\nDon't expect an immediate response, though. OpenAI tells The Verge that it's only testing SearchGPT with 10,000 test users, which pales in comparison to the millions of users ChatGPT has. It's not clear if that initial test group will be expanded or if OpenAI plans on testing SearchGPT multiple times over the coming weeks and months, but what is clear is that if you're willing to wait, some of the elements of SearchGPT will make their way back to the original.\n\nOpenAI is pretty clear that SearchGPT isn't a product in and of itself. The prototype is temporary, but OpenAI plans to \"integrate the best of these features directly into ChatGPT in the future.\"\n\nIt's not quite a search revolution just yet\n\nWe'll have to try SearchGPT for ourselves before we can say it's a capable replacement for something like Google Search, but OpenAI seems to at least have a take on what a modern search experience could look like. Most people don't go looking for websites, they're looking for answers that websites hold, and SearchGPT and Perplexity are the shortcuts.\n\nAs someone who enjoys the idea of people enjoying and benefiting from the things I write online, that's kind of a scary idea. But while SearchGPT remains just a prototype and not the next big feature in ChatGPT, I think Google is probably the one that should be more worried.", "source": {"uri": "pocket-lint.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Pocket-lint"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perplexity", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Perplexity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prototype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fact-checking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fact-checking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_answering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Question answering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plagiarism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plagiarism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Natural language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Moon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_account", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft account"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Verge", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Verge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Password"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Email"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://static1.pocketlintimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/07/searchgpt-header-final.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764082", "eventUri": "eng-9764082", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 208, "relevance": 1}

They argue that OpenAI illegally trained its AI models on their published work without consent or compensation, profiting off of protected material and effectively plagiarizing their work.\n\nOpenAI has rejected the contention that its use of copyrighted data in training products like ChatGPT was illegal, instead arguing that its services create something new and fall under the doctrine of \"fair use\".\n\nOther companies' forays into AI-generated search have also resulted in backlash from users and publishers. Google recently launched its own AI-enabled search feature, called AI Overviews, that summarizes content from search results without requiring users to click through to other websites.\n\nAlthough Google touted the feature's success in an earnings call this week, its rollout was met with criticism from publishers and creators concerned that AI Overviews sap traffic and advertising revenue away from their sites.\n\nAnother prominent AI-powered search engine, Perplexity, can produce results that are nearly identical to text from the news articles it uses as sources. Multiple publishers have sent Perplexity legal threats and demanded the search engine cease using their content in results.\n\nOpenAI said it is partnering with publishers for SearchGPT, and offering them options about how their content appears within its results, as well as seeking to ensure it promotes trusted sources.\n\nThe company's press release included statements from the CEO of the Atlantic and the chief executive of News Corp, both of whom struck reportedly lucrative content deals with OpenAI, praising AI-enabled search as the future of the internet.\n\nOpenAI's possible shake-up to the online search industry comes as Google faces a looming court decision in a landmark antitrust lawsuit US Department of Justice.

other content through prompts in everyday language.\n\n\"We are innovating at every layer of the AI stack,\" Google chief Sundar Pichai said this week during an earnings call for parent company Alphabet, which he also heads.\n\nOpenAI said it was working with some publishers to refine SearchGPT, which is being kept separate from the training of its generative AI foundation models.\n\n\"AI search is going to become one of the key ways that people navigate the internet, and it's crucial, in these early days, that the technology is built in a way that values, respects, and protects journalism and publishers,\" The Atlantic chief executive Nicholas Thompson said in the OpenAI blog post.\n\n\"We look forward to partnering with OpenAI in the process.\"\n\nOpenAI has invited users to sign up on a waitlist to try SearchGPT.\n\ngc/aha\n\nMore from this section\n\nSalt Lake City celebrates announcement that it will host the 2034 Winter Olympics\n\nSecret Service director steps

SearchGPT can provide users with faster answers that include links to relevant sources, according to OpenAI. The prototype is currently being launched to a small group of testers and publishers for feedback, and the company has a waitlist for interested users.\n\nThe company said the prototype is designed to connect users with publishers through \"prominently citing and linking to them.\" OpenAI has signed a number of licensing deals with news publishers to train its AI models on news content. However, the company is also facing copyright lawsuits from book authors, artists, and other creators who are arguing against their content being used to train models. In addition to the prototype, OpenAI said it is launching a tool for publishers to manage their appearance in SearchGPT.\n\nThe new prototype is designed to answer questions with up-to-date information pulled from the web. Users can then ask follow-up questions in a conversational style, OpenAI said.\n\n\"We believe that by enhancing the conversational capabilities of our models with real-time information from the web, finding what you're looking for can be faster and easier,\" OpenAI said in a blog post.\n\nOpenAI said SearchGPT is separate from training its generative AI foundation models, so websites that have opted out of being used for generative AI training can still show up in SearchGPT's sources.\n\nIn February, it was reported that OpenAI was developing a search-engine product to boost its competition with Google. However, rising ad revenue from Google Search drove Google's profits up nearly 60% in the first quarter of the year.

We're in the pre-Beta limited sign-up era now\n\nAfter months of speculation, shy and retiring OpenAI has showed the world a glimpse of its very own web search engine powered by AI.\n\nDubbed SearchGPT, it's right now at the prototype stage, and is slated to come out in earnest at some point in the future, OpenAI announced today. If you want to try it out, you'll need to join a waitlist before you can sign up, though only \"a small group of users and publishers\" will be able to get access.\n\n\"Getting answers on the web can take a lot of effort, often requiring multiple attempts to get relevant results,\" the restrained and never knowingly hyping OpenAI says. \"We believe that by enhancing the conversational capabilities of our models with real-time information from the web, finding what you're looking for can be faster and easier.\"\n\nUsers able to get into the thing will, we're told, receive quick and direct answers to their questions with the latest info from the web, and will have the ability to ask followup questions for more details. It's web search but with a conversational natural-language user interface powered by GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and GPT-4o. The super lab says SearchGPT can, for instance, be used to ask about the weather and upcoming events, with news articles attached for further info.\n\nWhile that all sounds cool, it's not exactly clear what SearchGPT is doing different than regular ChatGPT. OpenAI's flagship AI chatbot can already scour the web for mostly up-to-date info; it can even tell you the weather forecast for the day. Indeed, OpenAI says it plans on integrating \"the best of these features directly into ChatGPT.\"\n\nIt doesn't seem all too unique compared to Microsoft Copilot and Google AI Overviews, either, which already boast the features OpenAI has been talking up. The mock-up OpenAI provided looks pretty similar to Copilot, in fact. It's clear SearchGPT is pitched against not only Google and Microsoft but also other search-focused AI services, such as Perplexity.\n\nThe announcement today also pulls back the curtain a little to reveal the interesting relationship OpenAI has with Microsoft. The IT giant has pledged billions of dollars in support to the super lab, and in return incorporated OpenAI's technology in all corners of its software empire, from Copilot and Azure to Windows.\n\nAnd now, here comes OpenAI with SearchGPT to challenge Microsoft's Copilot search functionality and Bing - at a time when Bing has been barred from indexing new Reddit posts in a dispute over the harvesting of AI training data, and is now offering generative features.\n\nIn fact, it further shows OpenAI's disdain for its own backer Microsoft that it waited until the Bing news this week to one-up Redmond with SearchGPT. OpenAI loves to do this: Wait for a competitor to announce something, and then soon after try to steal the limelight.\n\nThat said, there is one thing that sets SearchGPT apart from its rivals, and that's the partnership OpenAI has with publishing titan News Corp.\n\n\"We've partnered with publishers to build this experience and continue to seek their feedback,\" OpenAI says. \"In addition to launching the SearchGPT prototype, we are also launching a way for publishers to manage how they appear in SearchGPT, so publishers have more choices. Importantly, SearchGPT is about search and is separate from training OpenAI's generative AI foundation models.\"\n\nReddit also has a relationship with OpenAI (and Google) allowing the super lab to access the mega-forum's posts and data for training and offering machine-learning products, such as ChatGPT and SearchGPT.\n\nWhile it's not clear if unfettered access to News Corp's publications will make OpenAI's search engine particularly potent, it does seem to come at a decisive moment. The AI lab has been sued by the New York Times and other American papers for using their articles to train AI models, and more websites are cutting off generative AI firms, especially OpenAI, from easy access for both training and merely looking up content.\n\nIf you do get your hands on SearchGPT, check out the privacy policy. For one thing, it by default \"collects and shares\" your general location in order to look up stuff near you that's relevant to your query. \u00ae", "source": {"uri": "theregister.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "theregister.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-4", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "GPT-4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "GPT-3"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perplexity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Perplexity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Azure", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Azure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Natural language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "User interface"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reddit"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Windows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Information technology"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_models", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foundation models"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training,_validation,_and_test_data_sets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Training, validation, and test data sets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Generative model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redmond,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Redmond, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Redmond, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Computer", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Computer", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://regmedia.co.uk/2024/07/25/shutterstock_search_openai.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764082", "eventUri": "eng-9764082", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

SearchGPT could eventually be integrated into OpenAI's popular ChatGPT chatbot. In addition to a broader web search, the search engine will tap into information provided by publishers who have signed deals giving OpenAI access to their data.\n\nKayla Wood, a spokesperson for OpenAI, declined to provide a SearchGPT demo or an interview about the new tool for WIRED, but confirmed that the company has already given access to unnamed partners and publishers and improved aspects of the search engine based on their feedback.\n\nMicrosoft, an investor in OpenAI, was one of the first companies to release a generative AI search engine to the public when it launched an AI-powered version of Bing back in 2023 that relied on OpenAI's large language models. That AI search experience from Microsoft has since been rebranded to Copilot.\n\nSince then multiple competitors, like Google and Perplexity, have launched their own AI search experiences for users. Google's AI Overviews provide AI-generated summaries of articles, often at the top of news results. OpenAI's SearchGPT appears more similar to Perplexity's approach, where the chatbot provides an accompanying list of relevant links and the user can ask follow-up questions.\n\nAfter OpenAI first introduced ChatGPT in November 2022, early users saw in the chatbot's ability to dig up and summarize information from the web a potential replacement for conventional web search. The shortcomings of large language models make chatbots imperfect search tools, however. The models draw on training data that is often months or years out of data and when unsure of an answer they will make up facts.\n\nMicrosoft's early efforts with Bing were far from a success, with the AI-powered search engine producing strange, inappropriate, and incorrect answers. Bing's market share grew only slightly following the overhaul.\n\nWhen Google added AI Overviews to search results this May, the company also quickly ran into reliability problems, like recommending people add glue to pizza. OpenAI's SearchGPT may use an approach to generative AI, called retrieval augmented generation, that is an industry standard for AI search and designed to lower the rate of hallucinations in chatbot answers. With a RAG approach, the AI tool references trusted information, like a preferred news website, while generating its output and links back to where the data originated.\n\nThere's also the question of potential copyright violations. Perplexity in particular has been criticized by publications, including WIRED, for copying aspects of original journalism with its AI search tool and seeming to ignore requests not to take content from some websites. In OpenAI's blog post, the company mentions its commitment to publishers: \"SearchGPT is designed to help users connect with publishers by prominently citing and linking to them in searches.\" Multiple companies, including Vox Media, The Atlantic, News Corp, and The Financial Times, have all signed licensing agreements with OpenAI this year.", "source": {"uri": "wired.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Wired"}, "authors": [{"uri": "conde_nast@wired.com", "name": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prototype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_AI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google AI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perplexity", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Perplexity"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wired (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training,_validation,_and_test_data_sets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Training, validation, and test data sets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vox_Media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vox Media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Financial Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_infringement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Copyright infringement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Atlantic"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 83}], "image": "https://media.wired.com/photos/66a29c489c6c9201fc814d97/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/searchgpt_GettyImages-2153474303.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764082", "eventUri": "eng-9764082", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3019607843137255, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

The company just launched SearchGPT, an AI-powered search engine.\n\nSearchGPT is a \"temporary prototype of new AI search features\" from OpenAI. ChatGPT can already pull information from the web, but usually only for context or summarizing several different sources at once, which isn't always accurate. The initial version of SearchGPT is much more like a traditional web search from Google, Bing, or DuckDuckGo, with web results displayed as list of links next to AI-generated summaries.\n\nThe main selling point for SearchGPT is that you can ask hyper-specific queries, such as \"music festivals in Boone, North Carolina in August,\" or follow up with additional questions based on earlier searches. Google has tried to offer similar functionality with its AI Overviews, which were scaled back after they told people to eat glue and rocks. Microsoft is also starting to roll out more AI upgrades for Bing -- there are no reports yet of Bing telling people to eat weird items, but that could very well happen.\n\nOpenAI said in a blog post, \"Getting answers on the web can take a lot of effort, often requiring multiple attempts to get relevant results. We believe that by enhancing the conversational capabilities of our models with real-time information from the web, finding what you're looking for can be faster and easier.\"\n\nOpenAI also says it is \"committed to a thriving ecosystem of publishers and creators,\" which is a bizarre statement to make after it scraped the content of countless websites without permission or compensation to train its AI and make billions in profit. Many sites and publishers started blocking ChatGPT as soon as OpenAI created an opt-out mechanism, and it's not clear how many of them will be on board with OpenAI's attempt at a search engine.\n\nOpenAI now has different user agents (which can act as opt-out mechanisms) for AI training, SearchGPT, and user searches in ChatGPT. For example, some sites might allow the search engine but continue to block AI training. We'll have to see how that works out in the months and years ahead. Some publishers and sites have escalated to IP address blocks and other prevention methods against AI companies, especially after Perplexity (another AI search engine) was caught indexing sites that explicitly opted out of indexing.\n\nSearchGPT is currently a private beta, and you can sign up for the waitlist on the ChatGPT website.\n\nSource: OpenAI", "source": {"uri": "howtogeek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The How-To Geek"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DuckDuckGo", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DuckDuckGo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "User agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software testing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "IP address"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/chatgpt-hero.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764082", "eventUri": "eng-9764082", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

According to OpenAI, the plan is to collect feedback about SearchGPT from a group of initial adopters and then integrate the best features into ChatGPT. That suggests the search engine won't remain available as a standalone offering in the long term.\n\nSearchGPT is built around a standard search box that takes natural language queries as input. When it receives a prompt, the service doesn't return a list of relevant webpages but rather AI-generated text intended to directly answer the user's question. According to OpenAI, SearchGPT cites the webpage on which a prompt response is based with a link placed in parentheses at the end of the text.\n\nThe responses that the service generates vary based on the query. A simple question might prompt SearchGPT to display a single-sentence answer. In other cases, it may output multiple paragraphs or a list. Some SearchGPT responses include not only text but also images and a related content sidebar with links to relevant webpages.\n\nSearchGPT supports followup questions. According to OpenAI, the service doesn't simply answer the additional queries entered by the user but also takes into account the earlier requests that preceded them. That context can help the underlying AI models generate more relevant output.\n\nFor publishers, OpenAI is rolling out features that will make it possible to manage how copyrighted content is used by SearchGPT. The company didn't specify how the features will work. It did divulge that publishers may opt not to have their articles used for AI training, but still include that content in SearchGPT search results.\n\n\"We think there is room to make search much better than it is today,\" OpenAI Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman wrote on X. \"We will learn from the prototype, make it better, and then integrate the tech into ChatGPT to make it real-time and maximally helpful.\"\n\nThe company didn't specify if the planned search feature will require a paid ChatGPT subscription or is set to become available for free. If SearchGPT were to be incorporated into ChatGPT's free version, it could create more competition for Microsoft Corp.'s Bing, which is also powered by language models from OpenAI. Microsoft has provided OpenAI with more than $10 billion worth of cloud infrastructure and funding to support its work.\n\nSearchGPT could potentially also create more competition for Google LLC. Earlier this year, the Alphabet Inc. unit equipped its search engine with a feature called AI Overviews that can directly answer user questions similarly to OpenAI's new service.\n\nIt's unclear how the ChatGPT developer plans to monetize its search technology. After integrating SearchGPT into ChatGPT, OpenAI might attempt to embed ads into the prompt answers the tool generates.

While the search engine is currently in an early test for a limited number of users, OpenAI said it plans to integrate the tools into ChatGPT in the future.\n\nWith the new feature, OpenAI will be directly competing with Google, which has for years dominated the online search market but has scrambled to keep pace with the AI arms race that OpenAI kicked off when it launched ChatGPT in November 2022. SearchGPT could also pose a threat to Microsoft's Bing, the also-ran search engine player that last year incorporated OpenAI's own technology in an effort to better compete with Google.\n\nWith SearchGPT, users will be able to ask questions in natural language - the same way they talk with ChatGPT - and they'll receive answers that they can then follow up on with additional questions. But unlike ChatGPT, which is often reliant on older data to generate its answers, SearchGPT will provide up-to-date information, with online links to what the company says are \"clear and relevant sources.\"\n\nFor example, a demo clip shared by the company shows SearchGPT answering a query about the \"best tomatoes to grow in Minnesota\" with information about tomato varietals, as well as links to sites like \"The Garden Magazine\" and \"The Gardening Dad.\"\n\nThe tool will also show a sidebar with additional links to relevant information - not totally unlike the ten blue links users are used to seeing on Google Search results pages.\n\n\"Getting answers on the web can take a lot of effort, often requiring multiple attempts to get relevant results,\" the company said in a blog post. \"We believe that by enhancing the conversational capabilities of our models with real-time information from the web, finding what you're looking for can be faster and easier.\"\n\nThe OpenAI search engine could cement generative AI -- technology that can create original text, as well as other types of media -- as the future of finding answers online, after Google and others have experimented with early efforts to incorporate chatbots and AI-generated answers into the search experience. But that future is not assured, given AI tools' propensity to confidently assert false information with no indication that it may be incorrect or misleading.\n\nOpenAI's new tool comes after Google in May rolled out new AI-generated summaries to top some search results pages so users don't have to click through multiple links to get quick answers to their questions. Google quickly pulled back on use of the feature after it provided false, and in some cases totally nonsensical, information, in response to some users' queries.\n\nThe rollout of Google's tool also raised concerns among some news publishers, who worried that the AI summaries could cannibalize their web traffic by removing the need for users to visit their sites to get information -- and similar concerns could arise with OpenAI's search engine.\n\nHowever, OpenAI said Thursday that it partnered with publishers to build the tool and give them options to \"manage how they appear\" in SearchGPT's results. It added that sites can appear in SearchGPT even if they've opted out of having their content be used to train the company's AI models.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

OpenAI ultimately intends to incorporate the search features into ChatGPT, rather offer a standalone product.\n\nOpenAI said SearchGPT is a temporary prototype that will combine the company's AI models, such as ChatGPT, with the ability to search the internet. It will respond conversationally to searches, while providing up-to-date information with \"clear links to relevant sources\".\n\nThe search feature positions the company as a direct competitor to major search engines, most notably Google but also Bing, a product of OpenAI's biggest investor Microsoft.\n\nIntegrating generative AI into search engines has become something of an arms race among tech companies, even as AI has a track record of producing inaccurate results and posing copyright concerns.\n\n\"Getting answers on the web can take a lot of effort, often requiring multiple attempts to get relevant results,\" OpenAI said in a blogpost which hailed \"a new way\" to search. \"We believe that by enhancing the conversational capabilities of our models with real-time information from the web, finding what you're looking for can be faster and easier.\"\n\nDepending on how SearchGPT presents and cites the sources of its information, it risks intensifying a pushback from publishers on how OpenAI uses their content.\n\nMultiple news outlets and media organizations, including the New York Times, the Chicago Tribune, the Intercept and a host of local papers, have taken legal action against the company in recent months over alleged copyright violations. They argue that OpenAI illegally trained its AI models on their published work without consent or compensation, profiting off of protected material and in effect plagiarizing their work.\n\nOpenAI has rejected the contention that its use of copyrighted data in training products like ChatGPT was illegal, instead arguing that its services create something new and fall under the doctrine of \"fair use\".\n\nOther companies' forays into AI-generated search have also resulted in backlash from users and publishers. Google recently launched its own AI-enabled search feature, called AI Overviews, that summarizes content from search results without requiring users to click through to other websites.\n\nAlthough Google touted the feature's success in an earnings call this week, its rollout was met with criticism from publishers and creators concerned that AI Overviews sap traffic and advertising revenue away from their sites.\n\nAnother prominent AI-powered search engine, Perplexity, can produce results that are nearly identical to text from the news articles it uses as sources. Multiple publishers have sent Perplexity legal threats and demanded the search engine cease using their content in results.\n\nRelated: US financial watchdog urged to investigate NDAs at OpenAI\n\nOpenAI said it was partnering with publishers for SearchGPT, and offering them options about how their content appears within its results, as well as seeking to ensure it promotes trusted sources.\n\nThe company's press release included statements from the CEO of the Atlantic and the chief executive of News Corp, both of whom struck reportedly lucrative content deals with OpenAI, praising AI-enabled search as the future of the internet.\n\nOpenAI's possible shake-up to the online search industry comes as Google faces a looming court decision in a landmark antitrust lawsuit brought by US Department of Justice. The suit alleged that the tech giant illegally monopolized the internet search industry through multibillion-dollar deals with companies such as Apple and Samsung to make it the default browser on their devices.", "source": {"uri": "uk.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

This new tool, which is currently in alpha testing with a small group of users, aims to eventually integrate with OpenAI's popular chatbot, ChatGPT.\n\nThe prototype aims to deliver swift and correct information with clear and related references to make it more useful for the user. The new feature also uses follow-up questions to let users expand on context in the same way as one would do in a dialog with a person. This conversational interface is designed to enhance the user experience during the search process.\n\nIn response to the announcement, Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) shares experienced a slight dip. According to Statcounter data, Google is still the most popular search engine, with a 91% share of the market covering all devices.\n\nAlso Read: Chinese tech giants integrate Meta's Llama 3.1 AI model into cloud services\n\nHowever, even a small change in the market share could be beneficial for OpenAI. Microsoft's Bing, which also uses generative AI, offers a precedent for the possible revenue streams; a 1% change in search advertising market share translates to $2 billion in yearly revenue.\n\nGenerative AI has been considered problematic by the publishers because summaries created by AI can lead to less traffic on the websites and less ad revenue. In response to these concerns, OpenAI has made some changes to SearchGPT to include links to sources and publishers' websites. This strategy is intended to help preserve and possibly even strengthen the link between consumers and producers of the original content.\n\n\"SearchGPT is designed to help users connect with publishers by prominently citing and linking to them in searches. Responses have clear, in-line, named attribution and links so users know where information is coming from and can quickly engage with even more results in a sidebar with source links.\"\n\nIn addition, OpenAI explained that the SearchGPT results are distinct from the data that the firm uses to train its AI models. However, search results on SearchGPT will not be affected, and publishers who have chosen not to share their data for training purposes will still be visible. In their blog post, OpenAI noted that SearchGPT's visual outputs are intended to give users a more complete picture.\n\nThe release of SearchGPT comes in the wake of the latest AI model released by OpenAI, known as GPT-4o mini. This new model is the GPT-4o, its derivative, and is the fastest and most powerful model from OpenAI to date. GPT-4o mini was unveiled in May during a livestream event where the startup revealed further progress in the field of AI.\n\nGoogle has also integrated generative AI into its search product through AI Overviews that offer summarized information from websites in a single paragraph with links. However, SearchGPT is based on generative AI and may provide a more consistent user interface. If successful, this could give OpenAI a competitive edge over Google's add-on approach.\n\nDespite these advancements, the use of generative AI in search engines has not been without its problems with regard to reliability. Google faced difficulties with AI Overviews right after its release since the function suggested some incorrect and sometimes ridiculous options like applying glue to the pizza or eating rocks.", "source": {"uri": "cryptorank.io", "dataType": "news", "title": "CryptoRank"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StatCounter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "StatCounter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "User experience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Software release life cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chinese language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "User interface"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug-in_(computing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Plug-in (computing)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Spreadsheets", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Spreadsheets", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://cryptorank.io/static/logo.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764082", "eventUri": "eng-9764082", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3490196078431373, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

This approach marks a significant departure from traditional search engines, which typically return a list of links for users to sift through.\n\nOne thing that sets SearchGPT apart is its commitment to publisher partnerships. Over the last year, OpenAI has gone to great lengths to secure partnerships with leading content publishers. SearchGPT is designed to prominently cite and link to publisher content. In-line attributions and named links ensure users can easily engage with the source material, fostering a symbiotic relationship between AI and traditional media.\n\nNicholas Thompson, CEO of The Atlantic, one of OpenAI's partners, underscores the importance of this relationship: \"AI search is becoming a key way people navigate the internet, and it's crucial that technology values, respects, and protects journalism and publishers.\"\n\nThe prototype's key features include:\n\nOpenAI emphasizes that SearchGPT is designed to drive traffic to publishers' sites, but the long-term impact on web ecosystems remains to be seen. The company is also introducing tools for publishers to manage their appearance in SearchGPT results, separate from AI training data opt-outs.\n\nOpenAI's entry into the search market comes amid fierce competition in what many anticipate to be a highly lucrative AI search sector.

The move marks the company's entry into a competitive search engine market dominated by Google for decades. On its website, OpenAI described SearchGPT as \"a temporary prototype of new AI search features that give you fast and timely answers with clear and relevant sources.\" The company plans to test out the product with 10,000 initial users and then roll it into ChatGPT after gathering feedback.\n\nThe launch of SearchGPT comes amid growing competition in AI-powered search. Google, the world's dominant search engine, recently began integrating AI capabilities into its platform. Other startups like the Jeff Bezos-backed Perplexity have also aimed to take on Google and have marketed themselves as \"answer engines\" that use AI to summarize the internet.\n\nThe rise of AI-powered search engines has been controversial. Last month, Perplexity faced criticism for summarizing stories from Forbes and Wired without adequate attribution or backlinks to the publications as well as ignoring robots.txt, a way for websites to tell crawlers that scrape data to back off. Earlier this week, Wired publisher Cond\u00e9 Nast reportedly sent a cease and desist letter to Perplexity and accused it of plagiarism.\n\nPerhaps because of these tensions, OpenAI appears to be taking a more collaborative approach with SearchGPT. The company's blog post emphasizes that the prototype was developed in partnership with various news organizations and includes quotes from the CEOs of The Atlantic and News Corp, two of many publishers that OpenAI has struck licensing deals with.\n\n\"SearchGPT is designed to help users connect with publishers by prominently citing and linking to them in searches,\" the company's blog post says. \"Responses have clear, in-line, named attribution and links so users know where information is coming from and can quickly engage with even more results in a sidebar with source links.\" OpenAI also noted that publishers will have control over how their content is presented in SearchGPT and can opt out of having their content used for training OpenAI's models while still appearing in search results.\n\nSearchGPT's interface features a prominent textbox asking users, \"What are you searching for?\" Unlike traditional search engines like Google that provide a list of links, SearchGPT categorizes the results with short descriptions and visuals.\n\nFor example, when searching for information about music festivals, the engine provides brief descriptions of events along with links for more details. Some users have pointed out, however, that the search engine is already presenting inaccurate information in its results.", "source": {"uri": "engadget.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "engadget"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prototype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_(magazine)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wired (magazine)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots.txt", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robots.txt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Web scraping"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backlink", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Backlink"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cease_and_desist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cease and desist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cond\u00e9_Nast", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cond\u00e9 Nast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Web crawler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plagiarism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plagiarism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Atlantic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/C55VzifGCg_ctyY1wLt4yw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03OTg7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-06/337a1b40-332d-11ef-97ef-528f5360e9e1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764082", "eventUri": "eng-9764082", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

OpenAI said users will see responses to their queries with in-line attribution to creators and news publishers, including from the growing number of media companies that have struck licensing deals with the startup in recent months. SearchGPT will also let users ask follow-up questions without losing context from the original query. OpenAI declined to give a timeline for when SearchGPT will roll out but said it will initially be available to users who sign up for a waitlist. OpenAI said it's working with creators and publisher partners to get feedback on the new tool, and plans to integrate the most successful search features into ChatGPT. Bloomberg previously reported OpenAI was readying a search product. With the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, OpenAI sparked a race to infuse generative AI into a range of core internet services. Google and OpenAI-backer Microsoft Corp. overhauled their search products with more conversational AI features while startup Perplexity introduced a search-oriented AI app. Now, OpenAI is pushing ahead with its own vision for AI search.\n\n\"For decades, search has been a foundational way for publishers and creators to reach users,\" OpenAI wrote in a blog post Thursday. \"Now, we're using AI to enhance this experience by highlighting high-quality content in a conversational interface with multiple opportunities for users to engage.\"\n\nA key challenge for OpenAI and its rivals, however, is providing accurate information to users, particularly when searching for information about current events. Chatbots can often hallucinate, or invent false answers to questions when they don't know the answer.\n\nOpenAI has been striking licensing deals with publishers such as News Corp., Axel Springer SE and Time magazine to train its artificial intelligence models and to integrate more authoritative, up-to-date information within its products. As part of some of these deals, OpenAI also agreed to give users news summaries with attribution.\n\n\"The truly talented team at OpenAI innately understand that for AI-powered search to be effective, it must be founded on the highest quality, most reliable information furnished by trusted sources,\" said Robert Thomson, Chief Executive Officer of News Corp., in a statement.\n\nWhile OpenAI has struck agreements with large publishers, it's also been hit with lawsuits from several newspapers, including the New York Times, for allegedly using copyrighted articles without permission. At the same time, OpenAI's rivals have faced some pushback over their search products. Publishers have worried that Google's AI search features may negatively impact referral traffic to their websites. Perplexity, meanwhile, has been accused of copying media outlets' work.\n\nOpenAI said it will give publishers a way to manage how they appear in its new search features. The startup also said websites can choose to be surfaced in search results even if they opt out of having their content used to train OpenAI's models.", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

For one, you can follow up your original query with further questions so SearchGPT can better understand what it is you're trying to look for. Also, instead of giving you websites that may answer your query, SearchGPT aims to answer it for you while also citing sources as to where it got its information from.

For one, SearchGPT is still in the prototyping phase, so it may not work perfectly. In fact, there's no real guarantee that it will deliver better results than traditional search engines, especially given how Bing has managed to merge both regular and AI-powered searches. Second, if you head to the SearchGPT website, you'll be hit with a disappointing screen stating that you have to be part of a waitlist to get in, and who knows how long that will take.

OpenAI's statement was the catalyst for this decline.\n\nSearchGPT's Current Prototype Phase\n\nXM reports that the new tool, which is presently in the prototype stage and is being evaluated with a select number of users and publishers, is already accepting sign-ups, according to OpenAI, which announced that open enrollment has begun.\n\nAccording to a blog post published by OpenAI, SearchGPT will respond to user inquiries by providing summary search results that include connections to the sources of the results. Additionally, they will have the ability to ask follow-up questions and receive responses that are contextualized.\n\nAdditionally, the business has stated that in the near future, it would be incorporating the most advantageous elements of SearchGPT directly into ChatGPT.\n\nAI Integration Efforts in Major Search Engines\n\nConsidering that ChatGPT was initially released in November 2022, major search engines have been attempting to incorporate AI into their search capabilities.

Google's SGE also gives users an AI-generated summary of search results, but the feature hasn't yet been rolled out to the public, and it's still being tested. Alphabet shares were down 2% within an hour of the announcement.\n\nThe search feature will be able to search the web in real-time and automatically summarize results from Microsoft's Bing. Microsoft has a partnership with OpenAI and has invested billions of dollars in the company.\n\nSearchGPT will also allow users to connect with publishers by citing and linking \"clear, in-line, named attribution and links,\" the announcement said. The feature will help users figure out where information is coming from and will allow them to engage with more results in a side bar with links.\n\nThere's big money to be had in search, and Google is the undisputed leader.

OpenAI said users will see responses to their queries with in-line attribution to creators and news publishers, including from the growing number of media companies that have struck licensing deals with the startup in recent months. SearchGPT will also let users ask follow-up questions without losing context from the original query.\n\nOpenAI declined to give a timeline for when SearchGPT will roll out but said it will initially be available to users who sign up for a waitlist. OpenAI said it's working with creators and publisher partners to get feedback on the new tool, and plans to integrate the most successful search features into ChatGPT. Bloomberg previously reported OpenAI was readying a search product.\n\nWith the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, OpenAI sparked a race to infuse generative artificial intelligence (AI) into a range of core Internet services. Google and OpenAI-backer Microsoft overhauled their search products with more conversational AI features while startup Perplexity introduced a search-oriented AI app. Now, OpenAI is pushing ahead with its own vision for AI search.\n\n\"For decades, search has been a foundational way for publishers and creators to reach users,\" OpenAI said on Thursday. \"Now, we are using AI to enhance this experience by highlighting high-quality content in a conversational interface with multiple opportunities for users to engage.\"\n\nA key challenge for OpenAI and its rivals, however, is providing accurate information to users, particularly when searching for information about current events. Chatbots can often hallucinate, or invent false answers to questions when they don't know the answer.\n\nOpenAI has been striking licensing deals with publishers such as News Corporation, Axel Springer and Time magazine to train its AI models and to integrate more authoritative, up-to-date information within its products. As part of some of these deals, OpenAI also agreed to give users news summaries with attribution.\n\n\"The truly talented team at OpenAI innately understand that for AI-powered search to be effective, it must be founded on the highest quality, most reliable information furnished by trusted sources,\" said Robert Thomson, chief executive officer of News Corporation.\n\nWhile OpenAI has struck agreements with large publishers, it's also been hit with lawsuits from several newspapers, including The New York Times, for allegedly using copyrighted articles without permission. At the same time, OpenAI's rivals have faced some pushback over their search products. Publishers have worried that Google's AI search features may negatively impact referral traffic to their websites. Perplexity, meanwhile, has been accused of copying media outlets' work.\n\nOpenAI said it will give publishers a way to manage how they appear in its new search features. The startup also said websites can choose to be surfaced in search results even if they opt out of having their content used to train OpenAI's models.

The company, founded in 2015, is under pressure to stay on top of the generative AI market while finding ways to make money as it spends massive sums on processors and infrastructure to build and train its models.\n\nLast Month, OpenAI announced the hiring of two top executives as well as a partnership with Apple that includes a ChatGPT-Siri integration. Sarah Friar, previously CEO of Nextdoor and finance chief at Square, joined as chief financial officer, and Kevin Weil, an ex-president at Planet Labs and former senior vice president at Twitter and a vice president at Facebook and Instagram, joined as chief product officer.\n\nOpenAI is bolstering its C-suite as its large language models gain importance across the tech sector and as competition rapidly emerges in the burgeoning generative artificial intelligence market.\n\nBoth OpenAI's new mini AI model and the prototype of SearchGPT are also part of the company's push to be at the forefront of \"multimodality,\" or the ability to offer a wide range of types of AI-generated media, like text, images, audio, video and search, inside one tool: ChatGPT.\n\nFor SearchGPT, OpenAI's blog post said the tool's visual results will lead to \"richer understanding\" for users.\n\nLast year, OpenAI Chief Operating Officer Brad Lightcap told CNBC: \"The world is multimodal. If you think about the way we as humans process the world and engage with the world, we see things, we hear things, we say things -- the world is much bigger than text. So to us, it always felt incomplete for text and code to be the single modalities, the single interfaces that we could have to how powerful these models are and what they can do.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbclosangeles.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Southern California"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_phenomenon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viral phenomenon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundar_Pichai", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sundar Pichai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimodal_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Multimodal learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nextdoor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nextdoor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_operating_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief operating officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2024/07/107346332-1702387207643-gettyimages-1841164541-HOPE_GLOBAL_FORUMS.jpeg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764082", "eventUri": "eng-9764082", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

The new tool will combine generative AI capabilities with internet search, promising conversational and up-to-date responses. This move positions OpenAI as a direct competitor to major search engines, particularly Google and Microsoft's Bing.\n\nSearchGPT's Innovative Approach\n\nSearchGPT is set to launch initially with a limited user group before a potential wider rollout. Unlike traditional search engines, it will provide conversational answers and clear links to sources.\n\nOpenAI claims this will make finding relevant information faster and easier. This development marks a significant step in integrating AI into everyday search functions, reflecting an industry-wide trend.\n\nLegal and Ethical Challenges\n\nThe introduction of SearchGPT comes amid ongoing legal disputes between OpenAI and major news outlets. Publishers like the New York Times and the Chicago Tribune have accused OpenAI of using their content without consent, arguing that the AI model was trained on their work without compensation.\n\nOpenAI maintains that its use of copyrighted data falls under \"fair use,\" creating new content from existing material. Other companies, including Google, have faced similar backlash. Google's AI-enabled search feature, AI Overviews, has drawn criticism for potentially reducing traffic to sources.\n\nAdditionally, Perplexity, another AI-powered search engine, has also received legal threats for replicating content from news articles.\n\nIndustry Impact and Partnerships\n\nTo mitigate backlash, OpenAI is partnering with publishers to offer them control over how their content is used in SearchGPT. The company aims to ensure that trusted sources are promoted within its search results. Prominent media executives have expressed support for AI-enabled search, seeing it as a future direction for the internet.\n\nThe arrival of OpenAI into the search market coincides with Google's legal problems. Employing agreements with Apple and Samsung to be the default browser on their devices, the US Department of Justice charges Google with monopolizing the search market.\n\nGoogle's market posture may change in response to this antitrust action, therefore creating chances for new competitors such as SearchGPT.\n\nSearchGPT is a daring action by OpenAI meant to challenge Google's hegemony in the search engine space. OpenAI wants to provide a more conversational and efficient search experience by combining generative AI with internet search.

SearchGPT will combine machine-generated content with up-to-date information pulled from the web, OpenAI announced in a blog post on July 25.\n\nOrganizations interested in trying the SearchGPT prototype can join the waitlist.\n\nOpenAI differentiates SearchGPT from Google Search Generative Experience in a few ways.\n\nUsers can ask follow-up questions about their search using casual language. In the example below, \"the jones house one\" refers to the festival venue the user originally referenced.\n\nAlso, users will be able to open a tab to see links directly to websites, or get \"visual answers,\" which are charts or videos. It's unclear yet whether visual answers will be AI generated, pulled from the web or a mix of both.\n\nOpenAI has partnered with several media companies - among them The Atlantic and News Corp - and tried to reassure publishers that links to original content will be prominently displayed within SearchGPT results.\n\nGoogle may have been fixing what wasn't broken for the past few years, optimizing Google Search to try to answer questions and to promote high-quality search results. The introduction of the AI-powered Search Generative Experience changed Google Search even more, adding bespoke replies to some queries. By the numbers, as of July 2023, Google holds 81.95% of worldwide search engine market share.\n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft added first Bing Chat and then a refined generative AI answer format to its search engine.\n\nThe competition is over becoming a user's first stop on the internet. If SearchGPT can grab market share as a front page, it could compete with the same search engines that have, over the last two years, added the generative AI that OpenAI is famous for.\n\nSEE: Meta recently announced its most powerful AI model yet with Llama 3.1.\n\nThe nature of search engines are changing, too, from directories of internet content by topic to question-and-answer machines that happen to draw from the web.\n\n\"This is potentially huge news in the search world,\" said Damian Rollison, director of market insights at marketing firm SOCi, in an email to TechRepublic. \"ChatGPT is probably best positioned amongst all competitors to upset Google's dominance in search, and aspects of the new interface, such as 'visual answers,' appear to be innovative and potentially disruptive.

While the search engine is currently in an early test for a limited number of users, OpenAI said it plans to integrate the tools into ChatGPT in the future.\n\nWith the new feature, OpenAI will be directly competing with Google, which has for years dominated the online search market but has scrambled to keep pace with the AI arms race that OpenAI kicked off when it launched ChatGPT in November 2022. SearchGPT could also pose a threat to Microsoft's Bing, the also-ran search engine player that last year incorporated OpenAI's own technology in an effort to better compete with Google.\n\nWith SearchGPT, users will be able to ask questions in natural language - the same way they talk with ChatGPT - and they'll receive answers that they can then follow up on with additional questions. But unlike ChatGPT, which is often reliant on older data to generate its answers, SearchGPT will provide up-to-date information, with online links to what the company says are \"clear and relevant sources.\"\n\nFor example, a demo clip shared by the company shows SearchGPT answering a query about the \"best tomatoes to grow in Minnesota\" with information about tomato varietals, as well as links to sites like \"The Garden Magazine\" and \"The Gardening Dad.\"\n\nThe tool will also show a sidebar with additional links to relevant information - not totally unlike the ten blue links users are used to seeing on Google Search results pages.\n\n\"Getting answers on the web can take a lot of effort, often requiring multiple attempts to get relevant results,\" the company said in a blog post Thursday. \"We believe that by enhancing the conversational capabilities of our models with real-time information from the web, finding what you're looking for can be faster and easier.\"\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

The search product, in the testing phase, will compete against Google's Search Generative Experience and Perplexity's AI. The announcement demonstrates that OpenAI is going after Google, which has about 90% of the search market.\n\nIt's official -- OpenAI is coming for Google's lunch.\n\nThe AI company announced \"SearchGPT\" on Thursday, an early version of a search product that shows the company is one step closer to launching its own search engine.\n\nIn a blog post, OpenAI said it's \"testing SearchGPT, a temporary prototype of new AI search features that give you fast and timely answers with clear and relevant sources.\"\n\nThe company said it's launching the tool to a small group of users for feedback and plans to integrate some version of the experience into ChatGPT. You can try to reserve a spot in line by clicking \"join the waitlist\" on the site.\n\nFollowing the announcement, CEO Sam Altman posted on X that \"there is room to make search much better than it is today\" and added that he's surprised by how much he prefers it to \"old school search.\"\n\nIn the video included in the post, SearchGPT looks similar to Google's Search experience, with a centered search bar in the middle of the screen. But there are key differences. The examples shown appear to result in more concise answers than a traditional Google, with summarized answers and links included at the bottom. It also shows more limited results, unlike Google, which has pages of related links.\n\nThat's intentional, according to the company's announcement. OpenAI said in its blog post that \"getting answers on the web can take a lot of effort,\" and often requires multiple tries to \"get relevant results.\"\n\n\"We believe that by enhancing the conversational capabilities of our models with real-time information from the web, finding what you're looking for can be faster and easier,\" the company said in the announcement.\n\nOpenAI plans to go up against Google's Search Generative Experience (SGE) and AI startup Perplexity's search feature with its rollout of SearchGPT. Google's SGE also gives users an AI-generated summary of search results, but the feature hasn't yet been rolled out to the public, and it's still being tested. Alphabet shares were down 2% within an hour of the announcement.\n\nThe search feature will be able to search the web in real-time and automatically summarize results from Microsoft's Bing. Microsoft has a partnership with OpenAI and has invested billions of dollars in the company.\n\nSearchGPT will also allow users to connect with publishers by citing and linking \"clear, in-line, named attribution and links,\" the announcement said. The feature will help users figure out where information is coming from and will allow them to engage with more results in a side bar with links.\n\nThere's big money to be had in search, and Google is the undisputed leader. The lion's share of Google's revenue comes from its search business -- $175 billion in revenue came from Google search and related ads last year, up from $162.45 billion in 2022, its annual report shows.\n\nIt also has about a 90% share of the search market, the Department of Justice said recently in the closing arguments of its antitrust case against Google.\n\nBy comparison, Microsoft's Bing has a 5.5% share of the search market, the DOJ said. But Microsoft seems serious about its AI search ambitions.\n\nMicrosoft introduced its AI-powered Bing last February. At the time, CEO Satya Nadella said, \"AI will fundamentally change every software category, starting with the largest category of all -- search.\"\n\nOpenAI's announcement comes after The Information in February that the company had been quietly developing its own web search product.\n\nOpenAI didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.nl", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider Nederland"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jyoti_mann@businessinsider.nl", "name": "Jyoti Mann", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "ana_altchek@businessinsider.nl", "name": "Ana Altchek", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sam Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Information_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Information (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Satya Nadella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://cdn.businessinsider.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/663e087c9686a6f37bfe3a55-scaled.jpg?ver=1721937787", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764082", "eventUri": "eng-9764082", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

This bold move signals a significant escalation in the AI search wars and could reshape how users find and interact with information on the web.\n\nThe new prototype promises to deliver \"fast and timely answers with clear and relevant sources,\" combining OpenAI's advanced language models with real-time web information. SearchGPT offers a conversational interface, allowing users to ask follow-up questions and build context throughout their search session.\n\n\"We believe that by enhancing the conversational capabilities of our models with real-time information from the web, finding what you're looking for can be faster and easier,\" an OpenAI spokesperson stated.\n\nSearchGPT's launch comes at a pivotal moment in the evolution of search technology. While Google has been cautiously dipping its toes into AI-enhanced search, OpenAI is diving in headfirst. This aggressive move could force Google's hand, accelerating the tech giant's AI integration plans and potentially sparking a rapid transformation of the search landscape.\n\nThe implications of this shift are profound. Users accustomed to sifting through pages of results may soon find themselves engaged in dynamic, context-aware conversations with their search engines. This could democratize access to information, making complex searches more accessible to the average user. However, it also raises questions about the depth and breadth of knowledge these AI systems can truly offer, and whether they might inadvertently create echo chambers of information.\n\nSearchGPT's focus on sourcing and attribution is a shrewd move by OpenAI, attempting to position itself as a partner to publishers rather than a threat. By prominently citing and linking to sources, OpenAI is extending an olive branch to an industry that has often viewed AI with suspicion.\n\nHowever, this gesture may not be enough to quell all concerns. The fundamental question remains: if AI can provide comprehensive answers directly, will users still click through to the original sources? This could lead to a significant shift in web traffic patterns, potentially upending the current digital publishing model.\n\nNicholas Thompson, CEO of The Atlantic, is one of the few publishers who have endorsed the initiative in a written statement. \"AI search is going to become one of the key ways that people navigate the internet, and it's crucial, in these early days, that the technology is built in a way that values, respects, and protects journalism and publishers,\" Thompson said.\n\nMoreover, the recent actions by Reddit and Cond\u00e9 Nast underscore the growing tensions in this space. As AI systems become more sophisticated, we may see an increase in content paywalls and legal battles over intellectual property rights. The outcome of these conflicts could shape the future of both AI development and digital publishing.\n\nThe potential disruption to the digital advertising market cannot be overstated. If SearchGPT gains traction, it could chip away at Google's near-monopoly on search advertising. This would not only impact Google's bottom line but could also lead to a reimagining of how digital advertising functions in an AI-driven search environment.\n\nHowever, OpenAI faces significant hurdles. Scaling an AI search engine to handle billions of queries daily is a monumental technical challenge. Moreover, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of AI-generated responses in real-time is critical. A few high-profile mistakes could quickly erode user trust and send people fleeing back to familiar search engines.\n\nPerhaps the biggest challenge lies in striking the right balance between innovation and responsibility. As AI search engines become more powerful, they also become more influential in shaping public opinion and access to information. OpenAI will need to navigate complex ethical considerations to avoid inadvertently becoming a purveyor of misinformation or biased viewpoints.\n\nAs OpenAI begins testing SearchGPT with a select group, the tech world holds its breath.

Learn More\n\nIn a surprising announcement today, OpenAI has unveiled SearchGPT, a prototype AI-powered search engine that directly challenges Google's dominance in the online search market. This bold move signals a significant escalation in the AI search wars and could reshape how users find and interact with information on the web.\n\nThe new prototype promises to deliver \"fast and timely answers with clear and relevant sources,\" combining OpenAI's advanced language models with real-time web information. SearchGPT offers a conversational interface, allowing users to ask follow-up questions and build context throughout their search session.\n\n\"We believe that by enhancing the conversational capabilities of our models with real-time information from the web, finding what you're looking for can be faster and easier,\" an OpenAI spokesperson stated.\n\nAI-powered search: The next frontier in information retrieval\n\nSearchGPT's launch comes at a pivotal moment in the evolution of search technology. While Google has been cautiously dipping its toes into AI-enhanced search, OpenAI is diving in headfirst. This aggressive move could force Google's hand, accelerating the tech giant's AI integration plans and potentially sparking a rapid transformation of the search landscape.\n\nThe implications of this shift are profound. Users accustomed to sifting through pages of results may soon find themselves engaged in dynamic, context-aware conversations with their search engines. This could democratize access to information, making complex searches more accessible to the average user. However, it also raises questions about the depth and breadth of knowledge these AI systems can truly offer, and whether they might inadvertently create echo chambers of information.\n\nPublishers and AI: A delicate balance in the digital ecosystem\n\nSearchGPT's focus on sourcing and attribution is a shrewd move by OpenAI, attempting to position itself as a partner to publishers rather than a threat. By prominently citing and linking to sources, OpenAI is extending an olive branch to an industry that has often viewed AI with suspicion.\n\nHowever, this gesture may not be enough to quell all concerns. The fundamental question remains: if AI can provide comprehensive answers directly, will users still click through to the original sources? This could lead to a significant shift in web traffic patterns, potentially upending the current digital publishing model.\n\nNicholas Thompson, CEO of The Atlantic, is one of the few publishers who have endorsed the initiative in a written statement. \"AI search is going to become one of the key ways that people navigate the internet, and it's crucial, in these early days, that the technology is built in a way that values, respects, and protects journalism and publishers,\" Thompson said.\n\nMoreover, the recent actions by Reddit and Cond\u00e9 Nast underscore the growing tensions in this space. As AI systems become more sophisticated, we may see an increase in content paywalls and legal battles over intellectual property rights. The outcome of these conflicts could shape the future of both AI development and digital publishing.\n\nThe future of search: Challenges and opportunities in the AI era\n\nThe potential disruption to the digital advertising market cannot be overstated. If SearchGPT gains traction, it could chip away at Google's near-monopoly on search advertising. This would not only impact Google's bottom line but could also lead to a reimagining of how digital advertising functions in an AI-driven search environment.\n\nHowever, OpenAI faces significant hurdles. Scaling an AI search engine to handle billions of queries daily is a monumental technical challenge. Moreover, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of AI-generated responses in real-time is critical. A few high-profile mistakes could quickly erode user trust and send people fleeing back to familiar search engines.\n\nPerhaps the biggest challenge lies in striking the right balance between innovation and responsibility. As AI search engines become more powerful, they also become more influential in shaping public opinion and access to information. OpenAI will need to navigate complex ethical considerations to avoid inadvertently becoming a purveyor of misinformation or biased viewpoints.\n\nAs OpenAI begins testing SearchGPT with a select group, the tech world holds its breath. This moment could mark the beginning of a new era in how we interact with the vast expanse of human knowledge. Whether SearchGPT succeeds or fails, its launch has undoubtedly fired the starting gun in what promises to be a fierce race to define the future of search.

Sign up for NBC Boston's newsletters.\n\nOpenAI on Thursday announced a prototype of its own search engine, called SearchGPT, which aims to give users \"fast and timely answers with clear and relevant sources.\"\n\nThe company said it eventually plans to integrate the tool, which is currently being alpha-tested with a small group of users, into its viral chatbot, ChatGPT.\n\nSince the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, Alphabet investors have been concerned that OpenAI could take market share from Google in search by giving consumers new ways to seek information online.\n\nWith this prototype, OpenAI is testing the waters for doing just that, promising users the chance to \"search in a more natural, intuitive way\" and ask follow-up questions \"just like you would in a conversation.\"\n\nAlphabet shares were trading about 2.5% lower on Thursday, while the Nasdaq was up slightly.\n\nIn May, Google launched AI Overview, which CEO Sundar Pichai called the biggest change in search in 25 years, to a limited audience, allowing users to see a summary of answers to queries at the very top of Google Search.\n\nThough Google had been working on AI Overview for more than a year, public criticism mounted after users quickly noticed that queries returned nonsensical or inaccurate results within the AI feature -- without any way to opt out.\n\nThe SearchGPT announcement follows OpenAI's launch last Thursday of a new AI model, \"GPT-4o mini.\" The new model is an offshoot of GPT-4o, the startup's fastest and most powerful model to date, which it launched in May during a livestreamed event with executives.\n\nOpenAI, backed by Microsoft, has been valued at more than $80 billion by investors. The company, founded in 2015, is under pressure to stay on top of the generative AI market while finding ways to make money as it spends massive sums on processors and infrastructure to build and train its models.\n\nLast Month, OpenAI announced the hiring of two top executives as well as a partnership with Apple that includes a ChatGPT-Siri integration. Sarah Friar, previously CEO of Nextdoor and finance chief at Square, joined as chief financial officer, and Kevin Weil, an ex-president at Planet Labs and former senior vice president at Twitter and a vice president at Facebook and Instagram, joined as chief product officer.\n\nOpenAI is bolstering its C-suite as its large language models gain importance across the tech sector and as competition rapidly emerges in the burgeoning generative artificial intelligence market.\n\nBoth OpenAI's new mini AI model and the prototype of SearchGPT are also part of the company's push to be at the forefront of \"multimodality,\" or the ability to offer a wide range of types of AI-generated media, like text, images, audio, video and search, inside one tool: ChatGPT.\n\nFor SearchGPT, OpenAI's blog post said the tool's visual results will lead to \"richer understanding\" for users.\n\nLast year, OpenAI Chief Operating Officer Brad Lightcap told CNBC: \"The world is multimodal. If you think about the way we as humans process the world and engage with the world, we see things, we hear things, we say things -- the world is much bigger than text. So to us, it always felt incomplete for text and code to be the single modalities, the single interfaces that we could have to how powerful these models are and what they can do.\"", "source": {"uri": "nbcboston.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Boston"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_phenomenon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Viral phenomenon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundar_Pichai", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sundar Pichai"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimodal_learning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Multimodal learning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nextdoor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nextdoor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_operating_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief operating officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief financial officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instagram", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Instagram"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://media.nbcboston.com/2024/07/107346332-1702387207643-gettyimages-1841164541-HOPE_GLOBAL_FORUMS.jpeg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764082", "eventUri": "eng-9764082", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 185, "relevance": 1}

For now, users who want to try the tool are directed to join a waitlist.\n\n\"Sam and the truly talented team at OpenAI innately understand that for AI-powered search to be effective, it must be founded on the highest-quality, most reliable information furnished by trusted sources,\" News Corp CEO Robert Thomson said in a statement.\n\n\"For the heavens to be in equilibrium, the relationship between technology and content must be symbiotic and provenance must be protected,\" Thomson added.\n\nOpenAI's launch represents another headache for Google, which is awaiting a federal judge's ruling this fall on a landmark Justice Department antitrust lawsuit targeting its alleged monopoly over the online search market.\n\nShares of Google parent Alphabet plunged nearly 2% after OpenAI's announcement.\n\nOpenAI said information taken from specific news outlets and publishers will be prominently cited with \"clear, in-line, named attribution\" and hyperlinks \"so users know where information is coming from and can quickly engage with even more results.\"\n\n\"We are committed to a thriving ecosystem of publishers and creators,\" OpenAI added. \"We hope to help users discover publisher sites and experiences, while bringing more choice to search.\"\n\nOpenAI did not specify a timeline for a full rollout of SearchGPT. Publishers who decide to opt out of allowing their work to be used to train OpenAI models can still be surfaced in SearchGPT results, the firm added.\n\nEarlier this month, News Corp's Thomson described the OpenAI content licensing deal as an \"important moment to recalibrate the world of search\" long dominated by Google.\n\nAside from its deal with News Corp and The Atlantic, OpenAI has inked partnerships with the Associated Press, Politico parent Axel Springer, Dotdash Meredith and various other news publishers.\n\nAt the same time, OpenAI was sued by the New York Times, which accused the AI leader of copyright infringement for using its articles without permission.\n\nOpenAI has denied wrongdoing.\n\nGoogle has an approximately 90% market share in online search - dwarfing current rivals such as Microsoft and DuckDuckGo.\n\nThe DOJ's federal antitrust suit against Google alleged the company relies on billions of dollars in annual payments to Apple, AT&T and other firms to ensure its search engine is the default setting on most smartphones.\n\nGoogle has faced sharp criticism for taking copyrighted content from publishers without proper credit or permission - and then using that information to train its own AI models.\n\nIn June, Google unveiled a controversial search feature called \"AI Overviews,\" which placed autogenerated summaries at the top of search results while demoting traditional links in publishers and news outlets.\n\n\"AI Overviews\" had a disastrous rollout. Google was widely mocked for bizarre results generated by the tool, such as telling readers to add glue to their pizza and to eat rocks.\n\nNews Media Alliance CEO Danielle Coffey -- who leads a nonprofit that represents more than 2,200 publishers, including The Post -- said the feature was a \"perverse twist on innovation\" that will be \"catastrophic to our traffic.\"\n\nElsewhere, the Amazon-backed $1 billion startup Perplexity, which has been building an AI-powered search engine, was recently blasted by Forbes for regurgitating its exclusive reporting without proper credit or

And just as the AI pundits were gasping for breath from this week's thrill ride, OpenAI on Thursday morning announced its competitor to Google and Perplexity AI search engines, called SearchGPT.\n\nSearchGPT claims the ability to directly answer user queries with up-to-date information and clear source attribution. \"We believe that by enhancing the conversational capabilities of our models with real-time information from the web, finding what you're looking for can be faster and easier,\" OpenAI said.\n\nThis streamlined approach could significantly reduce the time spent sifting through irrelevant search results, a boon particularly for security practitioners who are constantly battling information overload. However, concerns linger about the model's ability to discern trustworthy sources from malicious ones. Disinformation campaigns are a growing scourge in the cyber realm, and AI-powered search engines could inadvertently amplify their reach if not carefully calibrated.\n\nTo earn the trust of cybersecurity professionals, SearchGPT must prioritize transparency in its source selection and ranking algorithms. Clear explanations of how the model prioritizes information and identifies reliable sources will be crucial. Furthermore, the ability for users to refine searches based on specific criteria like publication date or source credibility will empower security personnel to make informed decisions about the information they consume.\n\nSeveral media and news outlets, including the New York Times, have sued OpenAI in recent months over alleged copyright violations. They argue that OpenAI illegally trained its AI models on their published work without consent or compensation. This led to profits for the company from protected and plagiarized material. OpenAI has dismissed these claims, saying it all falls under \"fair use.\"\n\nBut to avoid similar issues in the future, the company, in training the latest SearchGPT model, has partnered with The Atlantic and News Corp.\n\nOpenAI's commitment to partnering with publishers is a positive step. By ensuring that high-quality content from reputable sources is prominently displayed, SearchGPT would be able to contribute to a more secure information ecosystem. Additionally, publisher controls over how their content appears within the tool offer a level of control essential for maintaining trust and data integrity. It remains to be seen how well the search tool filters out misinformation, but for now, it's a start.\n\nOpenAI's proactive approach in seeking feedback on its SearchGPT model from the community is commendable. By fostering open communication and actively incorporating security expertise into the development process, the potential risks associated with SearchGPT can be mitigated. Utilizing the prototype as a learning platform to understand how malicious actors might exploit the AI search engines will be key to ensuring its long-term viability in the cybersecurity landscape.\n\nSearchGPT presents a compelling vision for a future where finding accurate and relevant information online is a seamless experience. For cybersecurity professionals, the potential benefits of enhanced efficiency and streamlined research are undeniable.\n\nHowever, ensuring the tool doesn't become a breeding ground for misinformation requires a focus on transparency, source credibility, and ongoing collaboration with the security community as well. OpenAI's follow-through on these principles will determine whether SearchGPT becomes a valuable asset or a significant new challenge in the cybersecurity's mis- and dis-information landscape.\n\nThe SearchGPT prototype is currently available to only a select few and has a waitlist. \"We will learn from the prototype, make it better, and then integrate the tech into ChatGPT to make it real-time and maximally helpful,\" Altman said.", "source": {"uri": "thecyberexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Cyber Express"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Misinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Computer security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinformation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Disinformation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeepMind", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "DeepMind"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Mathematical_Olympiad", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "International Mathematical Olympiad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sam Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_scientist", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Computer scientist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prototype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Silver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_overload", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Information overload"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_(behavior)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Transparency (behavior)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_infringement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Copyright infringement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Algorithm"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_(signal_processing)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Filter (signal processing)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Atlantic"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Information_Retrieval", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Information Retrieval", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://thecyberexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/SearchGPT.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764082", "eventUri": "eng-9764082", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Shortly after Microsoft announced that it's working on Generative Search for Bing, OpenAI announced SearchGPT, its own entry into the space.\n\nPowered by GPT-4 models, SearchGPT is something between a chatbot and a list of links, giving it a more conversational feel than competing options. You'll start off your search with a simple question, then get some basic info, a curated selection of links, and a prompt to ask a follow-up question. In examples, the interface is clean and doesn't necessarily pop up AI-drafted paragraphs on every search, which could help the chatbot avoid the stumbles of Google's AI Overviews. It instead relies on you to direct it, but you'll be able to ask for longer, more detailed responses if you like.\n\nUsers will also be able to summon a sidebar with additional links, letting them access a more traditional experience. The Verge also reports that OpenAI told it about a feature called \"visual answers,\" but wouldn't go into detail. Given the photo logo on the side bar, I would assume it's similar to Google Images, but with AI.\n\nOpenAI promises that SearchGPT will give \"clear links to relevant sources,\" and preview examples show that all drafted information is clearly tied to specific websites through in-body parenthetical citations. This could help SearchGPT avoid the hot water that Perplexity has landed in after being accused of stealing content, although even with sources, the legality of simply relying information directly rather than forcing users to click through has been called out in countries like Australia.\n\nLike Bing Generative Search, SearchGPT isn't quite yet ready for the light of day. Currently a prototype, it will first launch \"to a small group of users and publishers to get feedback.\" It's also launching a tool for publishers to control how they appear in the engine. OpenAI spokesperson Kayla Woods told The Verge that the testing pool will start at 10,000 users, but you can sign up for the waitlist here.

If you think about the way we as humans process the world and engage with the world, we see things, we hear things, we say things -- the world is much bigger than text.

With this prototype, OpenAI is testing the waters for doing just that.\n\nAlphabet shares were trading about 2.5% lower on Thursday, while the Nasdaq was up slightly.\n\nIn May, Google launched AI Overview, which CEO Sundar Pichai called the biggest change in search in 25 years, to a limited audience, allowing users to see a summary of answers to queries at the very top of Google Search.\n\nThough Google had been working on AI Overview for more than a year, public criticism mounted after users quickly noticed that queries returned nonsensical or inaccurate results within the AI feature -- without any way to opt out.\n\nThe SearchGPT announcement follows OpenAI's launch last Thursday of a new AI model, \"GPT-4o mini.\" The new model is an offshoot of GPT-4o, the startup's fastest and most powerful model to date, which it launched in May during a livestreamed event with executives.\n\nOpenAI, backed by Microsoft, has been valued at more than $80 billion by investors. The company, founded in 2015, is under pressure to stay on top of the generative AI market while finding ways to make money as it spends massive sums on processors and infrastructure to build and train its models.\n\nLast Month, OpenAI announced the hiring of two top executives as well as a partnership with Apple that includes a ChatGPT-Siri integration. Sarah Friar, previously CEO of Nextdoor and finance chief at Square, joined as chief financial officer, and Kevin Weil, an ex-president at Planet Labs and former senior vice president at Twitter and a vice president at Facebook and Instagram, joined as chief product officer.\n\nOpenAI is bolstering its C-suite as its large language models gain importance across the tech sector and as competition rapidly emerges in the burgeoning generative artificial intelligence market.\n\nBoth OpenAI's new mini AI model and the prototype of SearchGPT are also part of the company's push to be at the forefront of \"multimodality,\" or the ability to offer a wide range of types of AI-generated media, like text, images, audio, video and search, inside one tool: ChatGPT.\n\nLast year, OpenAI Chief Operating Officer Brad Lightcap told CNBC: \"The world is multimodal. If you think about the way we as humans process the world and engage with the world, we see things, we hear things, we say things -- the world is much bigger than text.

Users can ask follow-up questions in a conversational tone to get more specific answers. SearchGPT will be made available to a small number of users and publishers initially and will eventually be integrated into ChatGPT, OpenAI said in a blog post on Thursday.\n\nSince ChatGPT launched in November 2022, tech analysts have suggested that chatbots could revolutionize the way people browse the web. The bots are trained on a vast amount of information collected from the internet, which they can use to answer questions. However, the technology is constantly generating information, making the tool unreliable in its accuracy.\n\nAI companies have been trying to solve this problem by incorporating chatbots into search engines. ChatGPT already searches Microsoft's search engine, Bing, to find the latest updates for some queries. AI search startup Perplexity AI aims to use AI to search the web, read articles, and provide more direct, conversational summaries compared to regular Google search results.\n\nOpenAI's foray into search comes after Google began aggressively using generative AI in search in May. After the release of ChatGPT, the company began testing its own AI search feature, and in May it began showing AI answers at the top of search results for most U.S. users. Results were mixed, with some search answers making no sense or just plain wrong, such as a Google bot telling you to put glue on pizza. A Google spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIt's unclear whether the new OpenAI tools will also work with Bing. Microsoft uses OpenAI's technology as part of a licensing agreement. An OpenAI spokesperson said the company's search tools use information from third-party partners as well as direct feeds.\n\nPublishers, from newspapers to individual bloggers, worry that the shift to AI-driven answers rather than search results could hurt or destroy their businesses. Web publishers depend on traffic from Google to stay afloat and make money, and they've long had an uneasy relationship with the search giant, which often confuses them with tweaks and changes to how its search results work.\n\nOpenAI has sought to position itself as an ally of publishers, striking deals with news organizations including News Corp., The Atlantic, The Associated Press and Politico parent Axel Springer. The new search tool displays sources and links to them, according to an image in an OpenAI blog post. The announcement featured positive remarks from the chief executives of News Corp. and The Atlantic.\n\nNews organizations have also begun developing their own AI-driven tools to keep up with tech companies: The Washington Post launched its Climate Answers bot in July, which uses generative AI to answer readers' questions about climate change based on information in Post articles.\n\nIndividual news organizations, including those whose companies have signed contracts with Open AI, are more skeptical. Some journalists worry that the AI trained on their jobs could eventually be used to replace them. The union representing workers at The Atlantic said in May it had deep concerns about the company's contract with Open AI.\n\nOpenAI also said it would improve experiences in areas like commerce, and suggested the tool could be loaded with advertising -- another direct challenge to Google's dominant business model of showing ads in search results.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_bot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet bot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Atlantic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axel_Springer_SE", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Axel Springer SE"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Climate change"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Advertising"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 84}], "image": "https://i.imgur.com/AoyxWyw.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764082", "eventUri": "eng-9764082", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

The initiative seeks to provide users with quick, accurate answers along with clear sources.\n\nCurrently, a limited group of users and publishers can access the prototype for feedback, and there is a waitlist for additional users interested in trying the new features.\n\nThe development comes amid a report by the Information claiming that OpenAI could lose up to $5 billion this year due to its prolific spending, which \"far exceeds\" that of its competitors like Anthropic.\n\nThe report highlighted that OpenAI's projected expenses for the year include $7 billion for AI training and $1.5 billion for staffing, while Anthropic expects a 2024 burn rate of $2.7 billion.\n\nAccording to the report, OpenAI's financial trajectory appears \"unsustainable\" without continued new investments. The firm has already raised over $11 billion across seven funding rounds and needs to secure additional funding to continue operating.\n\nDespite the looming financial and regulatory challenges, OpenAI remains committed to refining AI search technology. The company plans ongoing improvements to SearchGPT based on user and publisher feedback, hoping to integrate the best features into ChatGPT in the future.\n\nTraditional web searches often require multiple attempts to find relevant results.

This new search engine is designed to provide timely answers based on real-time web data, ensuring clarity and relevancy in the information shared. Users interact with SearchGPT through a simple text box that prompts, \"What are you looking for?\" This innovation streamlines the search process, making it more conversational and intuitive.\n\nWhen a user queries, for example, about music festivals, the engine summarizes the events and lists them with accompanying links, plus offers related search options. Currently available as a prototype, SearchGPT is powered by OpenAI's advanced models, including GPT-4, and is initially open to a selection of 10,000 testers. The strategic purpose of this limited release is twofold: to refine the product through user feedback and to establish a foundation for further integration into OpenAI's flagship chatbot, ChatGPT.\n\nOpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, believes in the potential of SearchGPT to improve online queries substantially, stating, \"We think there is room to make search much better than it is today.\" This sentiment highlights OpenAI's intent to outpace current search engine functionalities by providing a user experience that feels more like a conversation rather than a traditional search.\n\nThe timing of this rollout is crucial, coming at a period when Google faces scrutiny over its own AI-powered tools, such as AI Overviews, which recently garnered negative customer feedback for inaccuracies. This has raised concerns not only among consumers but also among advertisers and content creators about how these tools might inadvertently diminish organic traffic. The introduction of SearchGPT also means that OpenAI is not just entering the search market at a competitive moment, but is strategically providing an alternative for users dissatisfied with existing search engines.\n\nOpenAI's approach to sourcing content is collaborative, working with media partners, including established names such as The Wall Street Journal and The Associated Press, to ensure accurate attribution and information sourcing. Users will have clear, in-line attributions leading them back to the original sources, which could foster a healthier relationship between search engines and content creators. This is a significant pivot from the controversies surrounding other platforms that have, in the past, been accused of scraping content without permission or appropriate credits.\n\nAnother compelling aspect of SearchGPT is its location-aware capabilities. The engine can adapt its responses based on the user's general location, potentially enhancing the relevance of search results -- for instance, providing restaurant recommendations or local event information. This is a feature that many users can find practical, especially in today's mobile-driven society.\n\nDespite the excitement around SearchGPT, the announcement comes amid concerns regarding the quality and responsibility of AI-generated information. OpenAI's proactive approach to cite and link sources sounds promising, yet the broader industry grapples with the implications of AI on content creation practices. With features that could potentially disrupt content traffic to news outlets, OpenAI's commitment to responsible use will be under scrutiny as more users engage with the prototype.\n\nInvestors have already reacted to OpenAI's new venture, demonstrated by Alphabet's shares dipping after the announcement. As concerns mount over potential market share loss, Google is expected to continue ramping up its own AI features in an effort to maintain its dominance in the search engine sector.\n\nAs we look ahead, the development of SearchGPT will certainly pave the way for deeper competition among tech giants. If successful, it could redefine how users understand and access information online. OpenAI's commitment to collaboration with publishers may signal a shift towards a more ethical approach in the AI landscape -- a feature that could either strengthen or weaken its position in the marketplace, depending on execution and user adoption. The tech world watches closely as OpenAI experiments with this prototype, hoping it will not only improve the search experience but also provide a model for how AI can be integrated responsibly into digital searching.\n\nsource:https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/25/24205701/openai-searchgpt-ai-search-engine-google-perplexity-rival", "source": {"uri": "sousabrothers.medium.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Medium"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sousa_brothers@sousabrothers.medium.com", "name": "Sousa Brothers", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-4", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "GPT-4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sam Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_box", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Text box"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prototype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "User experience"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Customer service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ethics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Internet", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 43}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Information_Retrieval", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Information Retrieval", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Search_Engines", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Search Engines", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Intelligence/Games", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Intelligence/Games", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 64}], "image": "https://miro.medium.com/v2/1*kFrc4tBFM_tCis-2Ic87WA.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764082", "eventUri": "eng-9764082", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

With this prototype, OpenAI is testing the waters for doing just that, promising users the chance to \"search in a more natural, intuitive way\" and ask follow-up questions \"just like you would in a conversation.\"\n\n\"We think there is room to make search much better than it is today,\" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote Thursday in a post on X.\n\nAlphabet shares were trading about 2.5% lower on Thursday, while the Nasdaq was up slightly.\n\nIn May, Google launched AI Overview, which CEO Sundar Pichai called the biggest change in search in 25 years, to a limited audience, allowing users to see a summary of answers to queries at the very top of Google Search.\n\nThough Google had been working on AI Overview for more than a year, public criticism mounted after users quickly noticed that queries returned nonsensical or inaccurate results within the AI feature -- without any way to opt out.\n\nThe SearchGPT announcement follows OpenAI's launch last Thursday of a new AI model, \"GPT-4o mini.\" The new model is an offshoot of GPT-4o, the startup's fastest and most powerful model to date, which it launched in May during a livestreamed event with executives.\n\nOpenAI, backed by Microsoft, has been valued at more than $80 billion by investors. The company, founded in 2015, is under pressure to stay on top of the generative AI market while finding ways to make money as it spends massive sums on processors and infrastructure to build and train its models.\n\nLast Month, OpenAI announced the hiring of two top executives as well as a partnership with Apple that includes a ChatGPT-Siri integration. Sarah Friar, previously CEO of Nextdoor and finance chief at Square, joined as chief financial officer, and Kevin Weil, an ex-president at Planet Labs and former senior vice president at Twitter and a vice president at Facebook and Instagram, joined as chief product officer.\n\nOpenAI is bolstering its C-suite as its large language models gain importance across the tech sector and as competition rapidly emerges in the burgeoning generative artificial intelligence market.\n\nBoth OpenAI's new mini AI model and the prototype of SearchGPT are also part of the company's push to be at the forefront of \"multimodality,\" or the ability to offer a wide range of types of AI-generated media, like text, images, audio, video and search, inside one tool: ChatGPT.\n\nFor SearchGPT, OpenAI's blog post said the tool's visual results will lead to \"richer understanding\" for users.\n\nLast year, OpenAI Chief Operating Officer Brad Lightcap told CNBC: \"The world is multimodal. If you think about the way we as humans process the world and engage with the world, we see things, we hear things, we say things -- the world is much bigger than text. So to us, it always felt incomplete for text and code to be the single modalities, the single interfaces that we could have to how powerful these models are and what they can do.\"\n\nMore from

Its demo already got something wrong.\n\nWhenever AI companies present a vision for the role of artificial intelligence in the future of searching the internet, they tend to underscore the same points: instantaneous summaries of relevant information; ready-made lists tailored to a searcher's needs. They tend not to point out that generative AI models are prone to providing incorrect, and at times fully made up, information -- and yet it keeps happening. Early this afternoon, OpenAI, the makers of ChatGPT, announced a prototype AI tool that can search the web and answer questions, fittingly called SearchGPT. The launch is designed to hint at how AI will transform the ways in which people navigate the internet -- except that, before users have had a chance to test the new program, it already appears error prone.\n\nIn a pre-recorded demonstration video accompanying the announcement, a mock user types music festivals in boone north carolina in august into the SearchGPT interface. The tool then pulls up a list of festivals that it states are taking place in Boone this August, the first of which is An Appalachian Summer Festival, a fair hosting a series of arts events from July 29 to August 16 of this year. Someone in Boone hoping to buy tickets to an August concert, however, would run into trouble. In fact, the festival started on June 29 and will have its final concert on July 27. Instead, July 29 to August 16 are the dates for which the festival's box office will be officially closed. (I confirmed these dates with the festival's box office.)\n\nOther results to the festival query that appear in the demo -- a short video of about 30 seconds -- seem to be correct. (The chatbot does list one festival that takes place in Asheville, which is a two-hour drive away from Boone.) Kayla Wood, a spokesperson for OpenAI, told me, \"This is an initial prototype, and we'll keep improving it.\" SearchGPT is not yet publicly available, but as of today anybody can join a waitlist to try the tool, from which thousands of initial test users will be approved. OpenAI said in its announcement that search responses will include in-line citations and that users can open a sidebar to view links to external sources. The long-term goal is to then incorporate search features into ChatGPT, the company's flagship AI product.\n\nOn its own, the festival mix-up is minor. Sure, it's embarrassing for a company that claims to be building superintelligence, but it would be innocuous if it were an anomaly in an otherwise proven product. AI-powered search, however, is anything but. The demo is reminiscent of any other number of AI self-owns that have happened in recent years. Within days of OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT, which kicked off the generative-AI boom in November 2022, the chatbot spewed sexist and racist bile. In February of 2023, Google Bard, the search giant's answer to ChatGPT, made an error in its debut that plummeted its shares by as much as nine percent that day. More than a year later, when Google rolled out AI-generated answers to the search bar, the model told people that eating rocks is healthy and Barack Obama is Muslim.\n\nHerein lies one of the biggest problems with tech companies' prophecies about an AI change: Chatbots are supposed to revolutionize first the internet and then the physical world. For now they can't properly copy-paste from a music festival's website.\n\nSearching the internet should be one of the most obvious, and profound, uses of generative AI models like ChatGPT. These programs are designed to synthesize large amounts of information into fluent text, meaning that in a search bar, they might be able to provide succinct answers to simple and complex queries alike. And chatbots do show glimmers of remarkable capabilities -- at least theoretically. Search engines are one of the key ways people learn and answer questions in the internet age -- and the ad revenue they bring is also lucrative. In turn, companies including Google, Microsoft, Perplexity, and others have all rushed to bring AI to search. This may be in part because AI companies don't yet have a business model for the products they're trying to build, and search is an easy target. OpenAI is, if anything, late to the game.\n\nDespite the excitement around searchbots, seemingly every time a company tries to make an AI-based search engine, it stumbles. At their core, these language models work by predicting what word is most likely to follow in a sentence. They don't really understand what they are writing the way you or I do -- when August is on the calendar, where North Carolina is on a map. In turn, their predictions are frequently flawed, producing answers that contain \"hallucinations,\" meaning false information. This is not a wrinkle to iron out, but woven into the fabric of how these prediction-based models function.\n\nMeanwhile, these models raise a number of concerns about the very nature of the web and everyone who depends on it. One of the biggest fears is from the websites and publishers that AI tools like SearchGPT or Google AI Overviews are pulling from: If an AI model can read and summarize your website, people will have less incentive to visit the original source of information, lowering traffic and thus lowering revenue. OpenAI has partnered with several media publishers, including The Atlantic -- deals that some in journalism have justified by claiming that OpenAI will drive traffic to external sites, instead of taking it away. But so far, models from OpenAI and elsewhere have proved terrible at providing sources: They routinely pull up the wrong links, cite news aggregators over original reporting, and misattribute information. AI companies say the products will improve, but for now, all the public can do is trust them. (The editorial division of The Atlantic operates independently from the business division, which announced its corporate partnership with OpenAI in May. In its announcement of SearchGPT, OpenAI quotes The Atlantic's CEO, Nick Thompson, speaking approvingly about OpenAI's entry into search.)\n\nThis is really the core dynamic of the AI boom: A tech company releases a dazzling product, and the public finds errors. The company claims to incorporate that feedback into the next dazzling product, which upon its release a few months later exhibits similar flaws. The cycle repeats.

Instead of a plain list of links, the engine arranges and contextualizes data.\n\nIt provides summaries on diverse topics, such as music festivals or gardening tips, delivering concise event descriptions with attribution links.\n\nSearchGPT, currently in its prototype phase, will initially be available to 10,000 test users. It harnesses the advanced capabilities of the GPT-4 model family, collaborates with third-party partners, and uses direct content feeds to build search results. The exciting long-term goal is to seamlessly integrate these features into ChatGPT, promising even more advanced functionalities in the future.\n\nThis launch puts OpenAI in direct competition with major players like Google, which has rapidly integrated AI features into its search capabilities. It also challenges startups like Perplexity, known for its AI \"answer\" engine but recently criticized for content use issues.\n\nOpenAI has placed a strong emphasis on transparency and collaboration with news partners, including major media entities. This collaboration is aimed at addressing content attribution and accuracy concerns. Publishers can manage their content visibility within SearchGPT, controlling how their materials are used without compromising their inclusion in search results. This reassures the audience of the responsible use of information.\n\nDespite the substantial costs associated with maintaining AI technologies, OpenAI plans to offer SearchGPT free of charge, signalling future monetization strategies as the service evolves.", "source": {"uri": "newsghana.com.gh", "dataType": "news", "title": "News Ghana"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-4", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "GPT-4"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monetization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Do-It-Yourself", "label": "dmoz/Home/Do-It-Yourself", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 72}], "image": "https://newsghana.com.gh/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/OpenAI.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764082", "eventUri": "eng-9764082", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

It also provides source links. The company calls the tool a \"temporary prototype.\"\n\nSearchGPT, the official name for the prototype, will initially become available on a web browser as a stand-alone search experience, but later could be added to ChatGPT.\n\nUsers can ask follow-up questions similar to the way someone might do in a conversation with a person. The conversation will build on each query and response. The company announced the tool today.\n\nDatos, a Semrush company, released a report Thursday analyzing clickstream data to determine how generative AI (GAI) has influenced consumer search behavior during the past year.\n\nWhile the adoption continues to grow, 99% of AI platform users also continue to use traditional search engines -- at least for now.\n\nThe study also found Google remains the most dominant search engine in the U.S., maintaining stable metrics in search frequency and user engagement despite the rise of AI-driven search tools.\n\nYouTube is the most-searched social platform, with an average of 19.9 searches per search user per month during the course of the study. It's based on mobile and desktop usage, excluding in-app behavior. LinkedIn had the second-highest average, at 13.3.\n\nWeb search trends have remained stable during the past year with only slight, inconsistent declines for some platforms like Amazon -- most likely the result of seasonal sales events. This suggests consumer search behavior has not undergone drastic changes.\n\nSearches per user have either remained consistent or increased, indicating a healthy level of user engagement. While AI shopping assistants may impact retail search behaviors, precise data will take another year or more.\n\nOpenAI is building its search tool with publishers. \"For decades, search has been a foundational way for publishers and creators to reach users,\" OpenAI wrote in a post. \"Now, we're using AI to enhance this experience by highlighting high-quality content in a conversational interface with multiple opportunities for users to engage.\"\n\nEarlier this month, The Atlantic CEO Nicholas Thompson publicly said the search engine was on its way, likely because the publisher had been working with OpenAI to develop the features based on a recent content deal to train models.\n\nSearchGPT is separate from training OpenAI's generative AI foundation models. Sites can be surfaced in search results even if they opt out of generative AI training, OpenAI said.\n\nOn Wednesday, Microsoft announced important changes as it transitions to AI-supported search by combining the power of large language models (LLM) and small language models (SLM) with Bing's search results.\n\nThe company explained in a post how the combined technology understands the search query, reviews millions of sources of information, dynamically matches content, and generates search results in a new AI-generated layout.", "source": {"uri": "mediapost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MediaPost"}, "authors": [{"uri": "laurie_sullivan@mediapost.com", "name": "Laurie Sullivan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prototype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_engagement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Customer engagement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Web browser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Generative artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amazon (company)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_computer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Desktop computer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LinkedIn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "YouTube"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_models", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foundation models"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Large language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_model", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Language model"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Atlantic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Spreadsheets", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Spreadsheets", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Internet", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Internet", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Information_Retrieval", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Information Retrieval", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 90}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764082", "eventUri": "eng-9764082", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

It's an interesting approach, and with just how stupidly popular and hyped ChatGPT is, I'm sure they won't have any issues assembling a large enough pool of testers.\n\nOpenAI claims SearchGPT will be different from, say, Google or AltaVista, by employing a conversation-style interface with real-time results from the web. Sources for search results will be clearly marked - good - and additional sources will be presented in a sidebar. True to the ChatGPT-style user interface, you can keep \"talking\" after hitting a result to refine your search further.\n\nI may perhaps betray my still relatively modest age, but do people really want to \"talk\" to a machine to search the web? Any time I've ever used one of these chatbot-style user interfaces -including ChatGPT - I find them cumbersome and frustrating, like they're just adding an obtuse layer between me and the computer, and that I'd rather just be instructing the computer directly. Why try and verbally massage a stupid autocomplete into finding a link to an article I remember from a few days ago, instead of just typing in a few quick keywords?\n\nI am more than willing to concede I'm just out of touch with what people really want, so maybe this really is the future of search.

Log in.\n\nThe company said it's launching the tool to a small group of users for feedback and plans to integrate some version of the experience into ChatGPT. You can try to reserve a spot in line by clicking \"join the waitlist\" on the site.\n\nFollowing the announcement, CEO Sam Altman posted on X that \"there is room to make search much better than it is today\" and added that he's surprised by how much he prefers it to \"old school search.\"\n\nIn the video included in the post, SearchGPT looks similar to Google's Search experience, with a centered search bar in the middle of the screen. But there are key differences. The examples shown appear to result in more concise answers than a traditional Google, with summarized answers and links included at the bottom. It also shows more limited results, unlike Google, which has pages of related links.\n\nThat's intentional, according to the company's announcement. OpenAI said in its blog post that \"getting answers on the web can take a lot of effort,\" and often requires multiple tries to \"get relevant results.\"\n\n\"We believe that by enhancing the conversational capabilities of our models with real-time information from the web, finding what you're looking for can be faster and easier,\" the company said in the announcement.\n\nOpenAI plans to go up against Google's Search Generative Experience (SGE) and AI startup Perplexity's search feature with its rollout of SearchGPT. Google's SGE also gives users an AI-generated summary of search results, but the feature hasn't yet been rolled out to the public, and it's still being tested. Alphabet shares were down 2% within an hour of the announcement.\n\nThe search feature will be able to search the web in real-time and automatically summarize results from Microsoft's Bing. Microsoft has a partnership with OpenAI and has invested billions of dollars in the company.\n\nSearchGPT will also allow users to connect with publishers by citing and linking \"clear, in-line, named attribution and links,\" the announcement said. The feature will help users figure out where information is coming from and will allow them to engage with more results in a side bar with links.\n\nThere's big money to be had in search, and Google is the undisputed leader. The lion's share of Google's revenue comes from its search business -- $175 billion in revenue came from Google search and related ads last year, up from $162.45 billion in 2022, its annual report shows.\n\nIt also has about a 90% share of the search market, the Department of Justice said recently in the closing arguments of its antitrust case against Google.\n\nBy comparison, Microsoft's Bing has a 5.5% share of the search market, the DOJ said. But Microsoft seems serious about its AI search ambitions.\n\nMicrosoft introduced its AI-powered Bing last February. At the time, CEO Satya Nadella said, \"AI will fundamentally change every software category, starting with the largest category of all -- search.\"\n\nOpenAI's announcement comes after The Information in February that the company had been quietly developing its own web search product.\n\nOpenAI didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.", "source": {"uri": "businessinsider.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Business Insider"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jyoti_mann@businessinsider.com", "name": "Jyoti Mann", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "ana_altchek@businessinsider.com", "name": "Ana Altchek", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sam Altman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alphabet Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Insider", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Business Insider"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Blog"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Information_(website)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Information (website)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_antitrust_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States antitrust law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Satya Nadella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Web_Design_and_Development", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Web Design and Development", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 55}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Information_Retrieval", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Information Retrieval", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Search_Engines", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Search Engines", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Algorithms/Sorting_and_Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Algorithms/Sorting and Searching", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://i.insider.com/663e094af27898f532d600a3?width=1200&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764082", "eventUri": "eng-9764082", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 168, "relevance": 1}

Text \"Alerts\" to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.\n\nIt's not immediately clear how long the testing period will last and when SearchGPT will become more widely available.\n\nThere has been speculation on a new search engine from OpenAI this year, as the company moves to compete with Google in the search market. Bloomberg reported in May -- citing a person familiar with the matter -- that OpenAI was developing a new search feature for ChatGPT intended to compete with Google and the AI search startup Perplexity. At the time, OpenAI was \"aggressively trying to poach Google employees\" to develop the product, according to The Verge. OpenAI was reportedly planning the new search engine in May, before Google announced plans for its Gemini AI products at the company's annual developer conference. OpenAI has partnered with several publishers over the last year, including the Associated Press, the Financial Times, The Wall Street Journal parent News Corp, and Politico and Business Insider's parent company Axel Springer, among others. The partnerships allow OpenAI to use content by each publisher to help answer user queries and train the company's AI models.\n\nThe New York Times filed a lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft in December alleging \"unlawful use\" of millions of copyrighted articles by the publisher being used to train AI models. The Times alleges OpenAI and Microsoft's technology that powers ChatGPT and Bing Chat, now called Copilot, could \"Generate output that recites Times content verbatim, closely summarizes it and mimics its expressive style.\" OpenAI filed a motion to dismiss parts of the complaint, suggesting users did not use ChatGPT or other products from the company as a \"substitute\" for a subscription to the Times.

You'll be able to ask follow-up questions, like you would in a conversation with a person, with the shared context building with each query.\n\nSearchGPT is powered by the foundation of OpenAI's GPT-4 class of models. The interface for SearchGPT looks clean and clear, and will especially seem familiar to users who are well experienced with ChatGPT.\n\nLike ChatGPT, SearchGPT allows you to not just submit one-off search queries, but also refine those queries with follow-ups to help you get the best information possible.\n\nIf you're hoping to use SearchGPT soon, be sure to join the waitlist ASAP.

The new search tool will also be able to reach sites that have opted out of training OpenAI-generated AI tools, such as ChatGPT.\n\nAI companies have stirred up controversy among news publishers, who have accused the tech companies of infringing copyright by scraping data from websites and quoting snippets of articles without attributing their sources.\n\nThe New York Times sued OpenAI and its main backer, Microsoft, last year for commercial purposes.[ing] OpenAI is seeking to protect it from large-scale copyright infringement, commercial exploitation, and misappropriation of The New York Times' intellectual property, but refutes the allegations.\n\nAmid the dispute, the startup says it has established licensing relationships with several publishers and worked with their product teams to test and design search tools.\n\n[OpenAI] \"Media instinctively understands that for AI-powered search to be effective, it must be based on the highest quality, most reliable information from trusted sources,\" News Corp chief executive Robert Thomson said.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online\n\nLOS ANGELES, CA / ACCESSWIRE / June 24, 2020, / Compare-autoinsurance.Org has launched a new blog post that presents the main benefits of comparing multiple car insurance quotes.

Well, it's no longer a rumor; OpenAI's search engine is now official, and it's called SearchGPT. This is good news for people who were waiting for this, but it's bad news because most people are going to have to continue waiting.\n\nAlready, OpenAI's already cornered the generative AI market with its powerful models. That has Google in a huff, but it hasn't touched the search engine market yet. That's Google's bread and butter, no matter how much it's been messing up the algorithm.\n\nIn OpenAI's case, this search engine will be just like any other search engine, but with an AI twist. Rather than being like a traditional search engine that relies on specific keywords, SearchGPT will be able to understand natural language.\n\nWhen you enter your search query, the search engine will give you an AI-generated answer in ChatGPT style. However, it will source a couple of links. There will be a button off to the side that will surface more links that you can follow.\n\nWhat's neat about this search engine is that you'll be able to ask follow-up questions about what you just searched. So, it's just like using ChatGPT, but it links out to other sources and provides additional information.\n\nThis search engine isn't available to everyone just yet. If you want to use SearchGPT, you'll need to get on the waitlist. Go to the official website if you want to join the waitlist. We have no idea how long you're likely to be on the waitlist before you can use it, but you might want to join ASAP to get the best spot that you can get.\n\nWhen this launches, you can bet that Google will take notice. The company has the most popular search engine in the world, and some people call it a monopoly. It's about time that it had some competition.

But will it win the war?", "body": "OpenAI's launch of an AI search engine on Thursday was a big warning shot in its war to challenge Google's dominance and drive out AI search upstarts like Perplexity.\n\nSearchGPT, as OpenAI's search engine is called, aims to provide \"fast and timely answers with clear and relevant sources,\" featuring real-time, up-to-date responses, OpenAI said. While currently just a prototype that's available to 10,000 users, it's clear the battle over AI search is on.\n\nSo far, at least, the quest for AI search dominance has been like trench warfare -- slow and difficult to advance. Take Microsoft, for example: On February 7, 2023, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella announced that the \"race starts today\" in search, with a reimagined Bing search engine powered OpenAI's chatbot, ChatGPT.\n\nGoogle, in response, quickly rolled out a competitor called Bard, later renamed Gemini, and then used Gemini's answers to supplement its traditional search links. But those so-called AI overviews ended up being so widely criticized for their \"hallucinations,\" or incorrect or bizarre answers, (including suggesting \"putting glue on pizza\") that Google has reduced the frequency that they appear, from a high of 84% of queries down to less than 15% in June. And experts, including Abeba Birhane, senior advisor, AI accountability at Mozilla, have made clear that there may be no reliable way to get rid of AI \"hallucinations\" altogether.\n\nAlso scrambling for AI search market share are startups like Perplexity, which debuted in 2022 with a goal to unseat Google with what it claimed were highly-accurate results. But the company, which has raised $165 million in funding at an over $1 billion valuation, has hit serious turbulence. Last month, Forbes accused Perplexity of copyright infringement for scraping its online articles without permission to feed its AI, while magazine publisher Conde Nast followed with a cease and desist letter against Perplexity just a couple of days ago. Perplexity's CEO Arvind Srinivas responded to the Forbes accusation by saying the new product feature had \"rough edges, and we are improving it with more feedback.\"\n\nBut, as has been widely reported, for months OpenAI has been trying to play nice with certain media companies by licensing their content for search results and to feed their content into ChatGPT, instead of scraping it without permission. The partners include The Atlantic, Vox Media and News Corp.\n\nNicholas Thompson, CEO of The Atlantic, is quoted in OpenAI's blog post about SearchGPT's premiere on Thursday as praising the arrangement. \"AI search is going to become one of the key ways that people navigate the internet, and it's crucial, in these early days, that the technology is built in a way that values, respects, and protects journalism and publishers,\" he said.\n\nIn a sign of the high stakes in the search wars, Google's stock tumbled Thursday afternoon within minutes of OpenAI making its much-expected foray into search. Google's shares ended the day down 3% at $169.16.\n\nBut does Google's blip mean the AI search wars are already won -- or lost, depending on the perspective? Not at all.\n\nAs of June, after more than a year and a half of assaults on its core search business, Google still enjoyed a global market share of over 90%, as if there is no war. Meanwhile, Microsoft's Bing has a woeful 3.7% and Perplexity's is too low to be measured.\n\nIf OpenAI wants to gain ground, it will need to slowly claw its way through the trenches. And as for its buzzy ChatGPT assistant -- its traffic is reportedly down from its April 2024 peak of 1.8 billion visits.\n\nSo OpenAI may score points for its new approach to search, focusing on publisher partnerships that offer more friendly and real-time sourcing of information for its search. But it remains to be seen whether it will win the AI search war, which is just starting to ramp up and will likely rage for years.", "source": {"uri": "fortune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fortune"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sharon_goldman@fortune.com", "name": "Sharon Goldman", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Hallucination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trench_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Trench warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Satya Nadella"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Prototype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cease_and_desist", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cease and desist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cond\u00e9_Nast", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cond\u00e9 Nast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_infringement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Copyright infringement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Startup_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Startup company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mozilla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Atlantic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_Corp", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "News Corp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vox_Media", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vox Media"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1258197310-e1721941520715.jpg?resize=1200,600", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764082", "eventUri": "eng-9764082", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

So, why not combine them and just give you everything? That seems to be the thinking behind SearchGPT, a new search engine from ChatGPT maker OpenAI.\n\nThe product was announced as a prototype on OpenAI's website, inviting users to join a wait list to access the tool. According to the company, it's designed to \"combine the strength of our AI models with information from the web to give you fast and timely answers with clear and relevant resources.\" The prototype tool is \"temporary,\" at least for the moment, but at least some of its features and functionality will be integrated into the wider ChatGPT product and its accompanying apps and APIs.\n\nIt makes sense. ChatGPT's language model is a huge and unwieldy collection of data, so users can only access updated versions of it periodically -- the current ChatGPT-4 model is trained on data that stopped updating in April of 2023. So adding in indexed search data that's far more recent could give more accurate and timely information to queries and other tools reliant on ChatGPT's various features. For an immediately relevant example, ChatGPT-4 can't accurately tell you who the current nominees for the 2024 US presidential election are, but a search engine can get them right away.\n\nOpenAI has been criticized for training its models on copyrighted pages and data without permission, and it's showing awareness of that criticism in SearchGPT's announcement. \"We've partnered with publishers to build this experience and continue to seek their feedback,\" says the page, and the search engine will include \"a way for publishers to manage how they appear\" in it.

As things stand now, ChatGPT is *trained* on information from the web so that it can give intelligent answers to general knowledge queries, but it doesn't always provide up-to-the-minute results.\n\nFor example, if you ask ChatGPT how many runs Aaron Judge hit last year for the New York Yankees, you'll get an accurate answer gleaned from various sites. However, if you ask ChatGPT something like \"How did Aaron Judge do in last week's game,\" you'll get information that may sound current, but when you click through to its sources, you'll discover it's woefully out of date.\n\nThat's where SearchGPT comes in. By working with a real-time search engine, the AI bot can provide more current information -- \"real-time information from relevant sources,\" as OpenAI puts it -- along with visual results and the ability to ask more natural and intuitive follow-up questions.\n\nMore significantly, the real-time nature will let you ask questions about things that are going on in the world around you, whether that's current news, or even if a given park, restaurant, or event venue is open, or if tickets are available for a show you'd like to see tonight. That's the dream, anyway, but OpenAI has some work to do before it gets there.\n\nGetting answers on the web can take a lot of effort, often requiring multiple attempts to get relevant results. We believe that by enhancing the conversational capabilities of our models with real-time information from the web, finding what you're looking for can be faster and easier.\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson told The Verge that it will start with 10,000 test users initially, but there's no word on how fast the AI company plans to roll out SearchGPT beyond that. However, you should join the waitlist right away if you want to be among the first to check it out.\n\nThat's why it's launching SearchGPT Prototype, so people can try it out, provide feedback, and help refine it before it launches to a broader audience. However, the goal here isn't to create a new product; rather, Open AI plans to \"bring the best of this experience into ChatGPT.\"\n\nIn other words, you won't be opening a separate app or chatbot. When the dust settles, the ChatGPT we're already using will get much smarter and be capable of returning real-time results that reflect what's happening today instead of what ChatGPT learned last week or last month.\n\nThat's good news for Apple fans since ChatGPT is poised to be a core element of Apple Intelligence. While the most personal parts of Apple Intelligence are powered exclusively by Apple's own silicon -- both on-device and in its secure Private Cloud Compute data centers -- queries for anything that exists outside of your private sphere will be sent off to ChatGPT for processing (with your permission, of course).\n\nSo, a smarter ChatGPT ultimately means a more intelligent Siri. When you ask Siri to let you know if you'll be able to make it to your next meeting on time or when your flight lands, that's Apple; when you ask Siri for the best times and places to check out the seasonal cherry blossoms in Toronto, it's likely ChatGPT will be better-equipped to answer that question.", "source": {"uri": "idropnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "iDrop News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Real-time computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Prototype"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Judge", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Judge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Yankees", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Yankees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siri", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Siri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_center", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Data center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Verge", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Verge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cloud computing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile app"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Toronto"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Interactive", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.idropnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/OpenAI-SearchGPT-800x480.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764082", "eventUri": "eng-9764082", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 145, "relevance": 1}

The company said it plans to integrate \u00e2\u20ac\u0153the best of these [search] features\u00e2\u20ac directly into ChatGPT at some vague point. As it stands, this new search engine seems set to take on Google\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s utter dominance in the space and offer a counterpoint to the Mountain View tech giant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s initiative to stuff AI into Google Search.\n\nAs detailed by OpenAI, SearchGPT isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t just your run-of-the-mill search engine. In many ways, it works, like Google AI Overviews or current Bing Search responses, but with a twist. Users type in a prompt in a ChatGPT-like interface, and the AI will generate a response with several in-line links to where it sourced its information from the web. Depending on the question, such as asking for lists of music festivals in a certain location, the AI might respond with blurbs with direct links to each site. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a separate tab on the left-hand sidebar where you can see and click on each link provided by the page.\n\nSearchGPT will give you a straight response with the name and link to the source in parentheses at the end of each paragraph on other queries requiring more nuance. Users\u00c2 can ask follow-up questions, and the AI should respond based on the context of previous prompts. ChatGPT already had many of these capabilities and a\u00c2 full connection to the Internet. The difference now is a new UI that emphasizes links to sites where the AI is sourcing all this information.\n\nThe new integration is closer to what you get in Google Search now. In the current version of AI Overviews, users receive a few paragraphs of AI-generated text based on your prompt, plus a few drop-down menus to link where Gemini took its information from. You can still remove these AI overviews from Google Search if you want to return to a more pure experience. For SearchGPT, the AI is intrinsic to how it functions.\u00c2\n\nPublishers and writers have been rather ticked off by how companies like Google and OpenAI have been relatively laissez-faire with the content used for training these AI models. Most recently, PerplexityAI has been taken to task by sites like Forbes for creating AI-generated articles based on original reporting without permission. The New York Times is currently suing OpenAI for training on its content. At the same time, major news networks like the Financial Times, Axel Springer, and The Associated Press have inked multi-million dollar deals with OpenAI to let the company train on their juicy content.\n\nThe problem is that so many sites depend on clicks and ad revenue to survive, something that doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t happen if users read AI blurbs and don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t actually click on the link. In its announcement post, OpenAI claims it is using AI to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153enhance\u00e2\u20ac the search experience \u00e2\u20ac\u0153by highlighting high-quality content in a conversational interface with multiple opportunities for users to engage.\u00e2\u20ac This is the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s promise to offer those \u00e2\u20ac\u0153prominent\u00e2\u20ac links in users\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 searches.\u00c2\n\nOpenAI is sending the message that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s doing websites a favor by presenting their information differently than Google. On Thursday, Google updated its chatbot to Gemini 1.5 Flash, adding more links at the end of longer, more elaborate responses\u00e2\u20ac\"up to four times a longer context window, according to the company. Gizmodo tried it out, but the answers it provides to some rather basic questions still aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as comprehensive as Gemini Advanced. Its few links to external sources are pretty standard and appear as gray boxes outside the text.\n\nSearchGPT is still a beta product, and things will likely change. We'll have to wait and see whether it will give original reporters and writers more credit with all the promised links. Though if SearchGPT offers a small blurb with the (hopefully correct) answer right up front, why would most bother to click on the link, even if there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a bounty of them?", "source": {"uri": "gizmodo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Gizmodo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kyle_barr@gizmodo.com", "name": "Kyle Barr", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Search engine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "OpenAI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Google"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Euro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ChatGPT"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Bing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Microsoft Bing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Natural language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_View,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mountain View, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mountain View, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "User interface"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axel_Springer_SE", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Axel Springer SE"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chatbot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Financial Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adobe Flash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gizmodo", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gizmodo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forbes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software release life cycle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On_the_Web", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/On the Web", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Searching", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Internet/Abuse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2024/07/SearchGPT_Hero_Asset_V2-ezgif.com-video-to-gif-converter.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9764082", "eventUri": "eng-9764082", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

However, Google hasn't lost much market share. Microsoft is the biggest investor in OpenAI.\n\nFurther, Google faces a new internet search challenger in well-funded startup Perplexity.\n\nGoogle began widely deploying AI Overviews in the U.S. in mid May, with conversational summaries topping links for many search queries. Also, Google plans to expand AI Overview's availability globally to 1 billion users by year end.\n\nOn the stock market today, Google stock fell 2.1% to near 169 in afternoon trading.

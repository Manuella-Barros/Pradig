As of June 30, the Warren Buffett-led conglomerate reported nearly $277 billion in cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet.\n\nBuffett has talked about firing his \"elephant gun\" and making a massive purchase several times in recent years but has said that high business valuations have been a roadblock. However, with more financial flexibility than ever before, could now be the time?\n\nTo be clear, we have no idea what Buffett and his team might be considering. But just to put the company's financial flexibility into perspective, here are five companies that Berkshire could conceivably buy in cash. Some of these could certainly make sense for Berkshire, but we'll also get into why I don't expect Buffett to pull the trigger anytime soon.\n\n5 companies Berkshire Hathaway could buy in cash\n\nWarren Buffett insists on keeping $30 billion in cash on hand at all times as a \"just in case\" buffer, but even if we back this out, Berkshire could spend $243 billion without borrowing money. And with this cap in mind, here are some companies that are in the realm of what Berkshire Hathaway could potentially buy.\n\nThere are a couple of caveats to keep in mind. First, Berkshire would likely have to pay a premium to any of these companies' market caps if it wanted to acquire one. And second, Berkshire doesn't necessarily have to only use cash to make an acquisition. With one of the best credit ratings in the world, Berkshire could potentially borrow billions more to extend its buying power even further, potentially putting in reach companies like Costco (NASDAQ: COST), which has a $360 billion market cap.\n\nWhy Buffett is in no hurry\n\nThese are an example of what Buffett could potentially buy, but I don't think it will actually buy any of them -- or any other large businesses. At least, not anytime soon.\n\nDon't make the mistake of thinking that $277 billion is burning a hole in Warren Buffett's pocket. Buffett has even less of a sense of urgency to put this money to work than he did a few years ago when the company's cash stockpile first started to swell to twelve-figure levels.\n\nThe reason is that Berkshire's uninvested cash isn't just sitting there in a pile of money -- it is mostly invested in short-term U.S. Treasury securities that pay about 5%. This means that Berkshire's cash is likely generating about $14 billion in annual income for the company that can be reinvested however Buffett and his team see fit. In short, while Buffett would love a higher return, it's a productive asset for Berkshire that provides billions in risk-free growth capital.\n\nHaving said that, if rates start to sharply fall, holding so much cash could be less attractive -- and that's especially true if a stock market correction makes business valuations contract. Nobody has a crystal ball that can predict the future, but it's fair to say that if opportunities arise, Berkshire has a ton of ability to take advantage.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Berkshire Hathaway wasn't one of them.

Buffett has even less of a sense of urgency to put this money to work than he did a few years ago when the company's cash stockpile first started to swell to twelve-figure levels.\n\nThe reason is that Berkshire's uninvested cash isn't just sitting there in a pile of money -- it is mostly invested in short-term U.S. Treasury securities that pay about 5%. This means that Berkshire's cash is likely generating about $14 billion in annual income for the company that can be reinvested however Buffett and his team see fit. In short, while Buffett would love a higher return, it's a productive asset for Berkshire that provides billions in risk-free growth capital.\n\nHaving said that, if rates start to sharply fall, holding so much cash could be less attractive -- and that's especially true if a stock market correction makes business valuations contract. Nobody has a crystal ball that can predict the future, but it's fair to say that if opportunities arise, Berkshire has a ton of ability to take advantage.", "source": {"uri": "fool.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Motley Fool"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_frankel@fool.com", "name": "Matt Frankel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elephant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_zone", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Buffer zone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costco", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Costco"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_rating", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Credit rating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_capital", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Growth capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Treasury_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Treasury security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ton", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/786358/buffett6-tmf.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801093", "eventUri": "eng-9801093", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 224, "relevance": 1}

Here's the Hidden Reason Why.\n\nJennifer Saibil, The Motley Fool\n\nAugust 9, 2024 at 12:15 PM\n\nAny big move that Warren Buffett makes could be a front-page headline, and the investing community was buzzing over the weekend with the news that Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) sold almost half =its Apple stock in the second quarter. That came on the heels of other large sales in the portfolio.\n\nLet's see what's happening, and why Buffett might be a seller right now.\n\nIs Buffett done with Apple?\n\nAt a glance, you might think Buffett may have lost some love for Apple, but consider the larger context and you'll see a different story. Even after the sale, Apple remains the largest equity holding in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio, by far.\n\nBuffett made waves with a sale of Apple stock earlier this year, too, reducing his Apple stake from 49% of the portfolio to 44%. At recent prices, it's down to about 28%.\n\nAlthough he's cut his stake, Buffett speaks highly of Apple. At Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting in May, he said he expected it to stay a part of his portfolio and said it's an even better business than two other longtime favorites, American Express and Coca-Cola.\n\nThis stock sale seems less about concern with Apple and more about something else.\n\nBuffett has been selling other stocks, too\n\nBuffett also made waves over the past few weeks with news that he sold a chunk of Bank of America stock in increments as well. In July, he sold $2.3 billion of BofA stock over six days. Bank of America still remains the second-largest holding in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio and accounts for 11.7% of the total. He still obviously feels good about the bank, since he's completely exited positions in other banks in recent years.\n\nOne stock he keeps buying, though, is Berkshire Hathaway. The company spent nearly $2.6 billion buying back shares in the first quarter, continuing a pattern of investing in itself.\n\nKeeping up with interest rates\n\nArmchair analysts don't know for sure why Buffett has been selling stocks, or these stocks specifically. He hasn't said anything publicly. But he's said some things recently that can give investors clues. At Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting, he said:\n\nUnless something dramatically happens that really changes our capital allocation strategy, we will have Apple as our largest investment, but I don't mind at all, under current conditions, building the cash position. I think when I look at the alternative of what's available, the equity markets, and I look at the composition of what's going on in the world, we find it quite attractive.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway can make an attractive return on the huge stockpile of cash that it holds via short-term Treasury bonds without exposing itself to risk. Mix that with a volatile stock market, and it makes a lot of sense to hold on to cash right now.\n\nBut there's another reason.\n\nReady to pounce?\n\nBuffett looks for undervalued stocks that the market might miss (in addition to other features). But he's patient, and if there isn't anything that fits his investing criteria, he doesn't buy. At the annual meeting, he said: \"There have been times in my life that I've been awash in so many opportunities that I could have invested everything by nightfall.\" But not lately: \"We haven't seen anything that makes sense that moves the needle.\"\n\nDoes this point to a larger warning for the markets? Not necessarily. Holding on to cash is a good enough reason to hold out and wait for attractive opportunities. Even without high interest rates, Buffett has implied that he won't buy stocks if the value proposition isn't strong enough.\n\nImage source: The Motley Fool.\n\nCould it be a warning for the markets? It could, because it signals that stocks are overpriced right now. Markets are bound for corrections if valuations become too high. It's a cycle that plays out over and over again. So while it could be a signal of a coming correction, or even something worse than a correction, it's not a signal to panic sell or even worry.\n\nAs always, investors can glean knowledge from Buffett's wisdom and investing approach. But you should remember that Buffett runs a publicly traded holding company, and that means his strategy will differ from that of the average investor.

His holding company, Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 1.24%) (BRK.B 1.16%), has grown to become one of the world's largest corporations. Berkshire is famous for its tremendous diversification across different businesses, industries, and stocks while having a massive balance sheet flush with cash at nearly all times.\n\nThe stock has outperformed the S&P 500 on average throughout its lifetime, so investors who have bought and held have done well.\n\nBut it might not be that simple now. Berkshire recently announced its second-quarter earnings, which included some potential warning signs telling investors to stay away, at least for now.\n\nHere is what you need to know.\n\nBuffett's business empire performed well in Q2. The company's total operating earnings grew 15% year over year to approximately $11.6 billion. Berkshire owns dozens of businesses, from consumer brands to railroads and oil and gas pipelines, but the GEICO insurance company was the star performer. GEICO's underwriting earnings almost doubled from a year ago to over $2.2 billion.\n\nBut that's not what caught this Foolish investor's attention.\n\nBerkshire has been steadily stockpiling cash on its balance sheet for several years. The company's cash on hand rose from roughly $108 billion in Q2 2022 to $189 billion in first-quarter 2024. Next, consider what Berkshire did in Q2. Buffett ratcheted up its cash to approximately $276.94 billion.\n\nBerkshire added more cash to its balance sheet in Q2 alone than all the cash it added from Q2 2022 through Q1 2024. In other words, Buffett wanted to beef up his balance sheet and do it quickly.\n\nBerkshire has raised cash primarily by selling off chunks of its two most significant holdings: Apple and Bank of America. In Q1, Berkshire trimmed approximately 13% of its massive Apple position, but it sold a whopping 49% of its remaining stake in Q2 to raise over $75 billion.\n\nApple was a tremendously successful investment, so taking profits isn't the worry here. What's noteworthy is the accelerated selling in Q2. Why speed up? Why sell stock in your largest bank stock? Without speculating too much, could this be a sign Buffett sees trouble coming? Recent economic data shows that the U.S. economy is slowing down, and Wall Street responded with market volatility. Berkshire now owns nearly a quarter-trillion dollars' worth of U.S. Treasury bonds, which are generally a haven from stocks.\n\nOkay, I can't read Buffett's mind, but you can interpret his actions -- or, in this case, his inaction.\n\nBerkshire has all this cash, and Buffett has repeatedly praised the concept of share repurchases over the years. However, the company spent a paltry $345 million on buying back its stock in Q2.\n\nA quick look at the data shows why that probably is.\n\nOn a price-to-book value basis, Berkshire stock isn't all-time expensive. Still, its valuation is the highest in over a decade, going back to roughly 2007, when the market peaked before the global financial crisis in 2008-2009. It seems apparent that Buffett, who famously likes a good deal, doesn't see one in Berkshire stock today.\n\nNobody, including Warren Buffett himself, knows what the economy or the stock market will do in the short term. All anyone can do is read the data and make their best guess. That said, it is possible that Buffett saw an expensive stock market -- including Apple trading at all-time highs on artificial intelligence (AI) expectations -- saw a potentially slowing economy, and decided to take some chips off the table.\n\nThe good news is that if a recession does happen, Berkshire Hathaway is arguably the world's most durable business due to its diversification and fortress-like balance sheet. Investors can confidently hold the stock.\n\nBut it's hard to see Berkshire Hathaway as a buy today. The stock's valuation is expensive, and Berkshire seems to agree, given the company's unwillingness to buy shares.\n\nIf the stock market becomes more volatile over the coming weeks and months, Berkshire stock will be a fantastic buying target for any long-term investor.", "source": {"uri": "fool.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Motley Fool"}, "authors": [{"uri": "justin_pope@fool.com", "name": "Justin Pope", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_sheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Balance sheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pipeline transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_transport", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rail transport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holding_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Holding company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underwriting", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Underwriting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_America", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bank of America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007\u20132008_financial_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2007\u20132008 financial crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economy of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Treasury_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Treasury security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wall Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_repurchase", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Share repurchase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/785911/brk-7.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801093", "eventUri": "eng-9801093", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

And that's the amount of interest Buffett's holding company is accumulating with each passing day.\n\nIn interviews previously, Warren Buffett has stated that he favors 3-month and 6-month Treasury bills as the place to park cash. They have been yielding as much as 5.40% in recent months but for simple math it's fair to say Berkshire is earning approximately 5% annually.\n\nNot all of Berkshire's $276.9 is invested in short-term bills, but most of it is - a full $234.6 billion. At a 5% rate of return, that sum is growing by almost $1 billion monthly.\n\nFor perspective, Berkshire held $31.2 billion of cash on its balance sheet in Q2 2008 before deploying about $5 billion in the form of preferred shares of Goldman Sachs.\n\nSo Berkshire is not amassing more cash every 3 months than the sum total of its balance sheet liquid reserves during the Great Recession. But why does this matter?\n\nBuffett has famously followed his own advice to not merely be greedy when others are fearful but to do so in a big way. In other words, when he sees a deal he is willing to allocate substantial capital reserves to pounce on it.\n\nIn 2016, for example, when he started to accumulate a position in Apple that ended up as a 789 million share holding. the stake was at one point worth about 50% of his entire equity portfolio.\n\nThat level of conviction revealed Buffett is willing to invest massively when a deal finally appears. At the time, Apple's price-to-earnings ratio sat below 15, making it an enticing buy given its growth rates and cash flows.\n\nSimilarly, in 2008 when he snapped up Goldman Sachs preferred shares, the position represented a relatively large percentage of his overall balance sheet cash.\n\nSo, the first takeaway as to why Buffett's cash pile matters is that it provides the Oracle of Omaha with the optionality to make big purchases and deploy capital fast when he spots his next opportunity.\n\nIf the bearish train gathers steam like it did in 2008, Buffett will have the ample reserves needed to swoop in and snap up undervalued assets. Better yet, he can do so with cash versus equity, which is likely to be more costly over the long-term.\n\nAnother key reason it matters is it allows Buffett the opportunity to pursue further share buybacks that return value to shareholders. Since 2018, Buffett has spent $78 billion repurchasing Berkshire stock.\n\nWhile much attention shone on how much Buffett had spent on Apple shares, it turned out that he spent even more buying back shares of his own company, which reflected his confidence in its future prospects and the discrepancy he saw in its price relative to fair value.\n\nFinally, growing economic uncertainties mean that Berkshire Hathaway will have ample reserves that can act as a buffer against market volatility. When the Great Recession gripped the economy and markets, Berkshire stood firm as the beacon of stability and Buffett's swift actions were widely credited as shoring up confidence among investors.\n\nSo too will Berkshire's deep reserves act as a fortress to defend and insulate Berkshire Hathaway from any economic downturns to come.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway's market capitalization is $920 billion of which $276.9 billion is cash, representing 30%.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway's cash fortress alone is arguably reason enough to buy the stock given that it is expected to produce about $1 billion monthly but there is much more to like than that. Berkshire is also a cash flow machine that reported a full $9.06 billion in free cash flows last quarter alone.\n\nPlus, it's trading at almost the exact same price-to-earnings multiple of 13x that Apple traded at when Buffett was snapping it up back in 2016.\n\nIn short, Berkshire's operations are producing monstrous cash flows, it has a fortress cash pile that ensures stability in the face of economic hardship, and it's trading at a compelling price relative to future earnings.\n\nSo, if you held that punchcard Buffett has so famously discussed in the past and could use just one of your 20 punches to buy any stock, Berkshire Hathaway is perhaps as good a choice as any.", "source": {"uri": "financhill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Financhill"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_sheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Balance sheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferred_stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Preferred stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Goldman Sachs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_of_return", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rate of return"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Great Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Treasury_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Treasury security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holding_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Holding company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oracle Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash_flow", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cash flow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price\u2013earnings_ratio", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Price\u2013earnings ratio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha,_Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fair value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Volatility (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_cash_flow", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free cash flow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_repurchase", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Share repurchase"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Market capitalization"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Money_Management", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Money Management", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://financhill.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Berkshire-Hathaway-Cash.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801093", "eventUri": "eng-9801093", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

That came on the heels of other large sales in the portfolio.\n\nLet's see what's happening, and why Buffett might be a seller right now.\n\nAt a glance, you might think Buffett may have lost some love for Apple, but consider the larger context and you'll see a different story. Even after the sale, Apple remains the largest equity holding in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio, by far.\n\nBuffett made waves with a sale of Apple stock earlier this year, too, reducing his Apple stake from 49% of the portfolio to 44%. At recent prices, it's down to about 28%.\n\nAlthough he's cut his stake, Buffett speaks highly of Apple. At Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting in May, he said he expected it to stay a part of his portfolio and said it's an even better business than two other longtime favorites, American Express and Coca-Cola.\n\nThis stock sale seems less about concern with Apple and more about something else.\n\nBuffett also made waves over the past few weeks with news that he sold a chunk of Bank of America stock in increments as well. In July, he sold $2.3 billion of BofA stock over six days. Bank of America still remains the second-largest holding in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio and accounts for 11.7% of the total. He still obviously feels good about the bank, since he's completely exited positions in other banks in recent years.\n\nOne stock he keeps buying, though, is Berkshire Hathaway. The company spent nearly $2.6 billion buying back shares in the first quarter, continuing a pattern of investing in itself.\n\nArmchair analysts don't know for sure why Buffett has been selling stocks, or these stocks specifically. He hasn't said anything publicly. But he's said some things recently that can give investors clues. At Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting, he said:\n\nUnless something dramatically happens that really changes our capital allocation strategy, we will have Apple as our largest investment, but I don't mind at all, under current conditions, building the cash position. I think when I look at the alternative of what's available, the equity markets, and I look at the composition of what's going on in the world, we find it quite attractive.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway can make an attractive return on the huge stockpile of cash that it holds via short-term Treasury bonds without exposing itself to risk. Mix that with a volatile stock market, and it makes a lot of sense to hold on to cash right now.\n\nBut there's another reason.\n\nBuffett looks for undervalued stocks that the market might miss (in addition to other features). But he's patient, and if there isn't anything that fits his investing criteria, he doesn't buy. At the annual meeting, he said: \"There have been times in my life that I've been awash in so many opportunities that I could have invested everything by nightfall.\" But not lately: \"We haven't seen anything that makes sense that moves the needle.\"\n\nDoes this point to a larger warning for the markets? Not necessarily. Holding on to cash is a good enough reason to hold out and wait for attractive opportunities. Even without high interest rates, Buffett has implied that he won't buy stocks if the value proposition isn't strong enough.\n\nCould it be a warning for the markets? It could, because it signals that stocks are overpriced right now. Markets are bound for corrections if valuations become too high. It's a cycle that plays out over and over again. So while it could be a signal of a coming correction, or even something worse than a correction, it's not a signal to panic sell or even worry.\n\nAs always, investors can glean knowledge from Buffett's wisdom and investing approach.

When you consistently crush the most widely followed index in the return column, you're going to draw an audience.\n\nBuffett's phenomenal investment returns are what lure in the neighborhood of 40,000 people annually to Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. It's also what causes investors to wait on pins and needles for the release of the company's Form 13F. A 13F is a document filed on a quarterly basis with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that shows investors which stocks Wall Street's brightest minds have been buying and selling.\n\nBut the biggest surprise isn't always what's in Berkshire Hathaway's 13F. Rather, it's the buying activity for Warren Buffett's favorite stock, which won't be found in a 13F filed with the SEC.\n\nBuffett has been a net-seller of equities for seven consecutive quarters\n\nEven though Berkshire has yet to file its 13F for the second quarter -- it'll be filed with the SEC following the close of trading on August 14 -- the company's second-quarter cash flow statement points to a similar trend we've witnessed since the start of October 2022. Namely, Buffett and his top investment aides, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, have been persistent net-sellers of equities.\n\nThe fair value estimate for Berkshire's position in Apple, as of the end of the second quarter, points to a nearly 50% reduction in Berkshire's stake in the tech giant. Further, Buffett and his crew sold shares of Bank of America, Berkshire's second-biggest holding by market value, for 12 consecutive trading sessions (July 17 - August 1), as of this writing.\n\nAltogether, Buffett and Co. have been net-sellers of equities for seven consecutive quarters, with approximately $131.6 billion more in securities sold than purchased. This has ballooned Berkshire's cash pile to an all-time record $277 billion.\n\nTo be fair, Buffett and his team have done some buying -- it's just been very selective.\n\nFor instance, 13Fs and Form 4 filings with the SEC show that the Oracle of Omaha has been adding with some degree of regularity to oil and gas stock Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY) since the start of 2022. In a span of roughly 30 months, Berkshire's brightest investment minds gobbled up more than 255.2 million shares of Occidental.\n\nConsidering the minimal role energy stocks have played in Berkshire's investment portfolio this century, having close to $15 billion tied up in Occidental Petroleum signals that Buffett and his crew expect the spot price of crude oil to move higher; or at the very least remain above its historic average.\n\nThe biggest catalyst for Occidental Petroleum looks to be tight global crude oil supply. Approximately three years of reduced capital expenditures during the COVID-19 pandemic have created a scenario where global energy companies are unable to quickly increase production. As long as the supply of crude oil is constrained, its spot price should receive a boost.\n\nThis is particularly important for Occidental, which generates an outsized percentage of its revenue from its upstream drilling segment. Despite being an integrated operator that also owns chemical plants, its operating cash flow is highly dependent on swings in the spot price of crude oil.\n\nThe Oracle of Omaha has purchased almost $78 billion worth of his favorite stock\n\nHowever, adding more than 255 million shares of Occidental Petroleum common stock is mere peanuts compared to what Warren Buffett has put to work in his favorite stock over the last six years.\n\nAs I alluded earlier, not all of Berkshire's buying and selling activity is going to be found in a 13F. For details on the Oracle of Omaha's favorite stock to buy, you'll need to dig into Berkshire Hathaway's quarterly operating results. Just prior to the executive certifications of every quarterly report from Berkshire, you'll find a detailed page describing the share repurchasing activity undertaken during the quarter. You guessed it... Warren Buffett's favorite stock to buy is none other than shares of his own company!\n\nTo be clear, buying back stock wasn't always easy for the Oracle of Omaha or his late, great right-hand man, Charlie Munger.\n\nPrior to mid-July 2018, share buybacks were only allowed if Berkshire Hathaway's share price fell to or below 120% of its book value, as of the most recent quarter. At no point in the many years leading up to mid-July 2018 did Buffett company's fall to or below this threshold, which meant no buybacks were undertaken.\n\nEverything officially changed on July 17, 2018. On this date, Berkshire's board reworked the criteria governing share repurchases to allow Buffett and Munger to come off the proverbial bench and swing for the fences.\n\nAccording to this updated policy, buybacks can commence with no end date or dollar ceiling as long as:\n\nWhile the last point is a bit subjective, it hasn't stopped Warren Buffett from repurchasing shares of his company for 24 consecutive quarters.\n\nDuring the June-ended quarter, Buffett oversaw the retirement of 555 Class A shares (BRK.A) totaling $345,137,002! On an aggregate basis, this works out to nearly $78 billion worth of buybacks since this program was amended on July 17, 2018. This is more than double the amount of cash Buffett and his team spent buying shares of top holding Apple!\n\nSince Berkshire doesn't pay a dividend, share repurchases are an easy way to reward investors. Continually retiring shares via buyback is incrementally increasing the ownership stakes of long-term shareholders. You could say it's the perfect tool to instill the long-term ethos in investors that Buffett and Charlie Munger have appreciated so much.\n\nFurthermore, buying back stock and reducing the outstanding share count can increase earnings per share (EPS) for companies with steady or growing net income (sans unrealized investment gains/losses). This should help make Berkshire even more attractive on a fundamental basis.\n\nWith $277 billion in cash in the coffers and little in the way of value piquing Warren Buffett's interest, it's a veritable certainty that the (re)purchase of Buffett's favorite stock will continue.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Berkshire Hathaway wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you'd have $606,079!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

For most of the past seven calendar years, he kept cash balances below that threshold, but that dam broke in the third quarter of 2023, and it posted a balance of $276.9 billion for this quarter. Buffett doesn't talk about that threshold anymore. We're surprisingly less concerned with the issue than we usually are, primarily because short-term rates are still above 5% and Berkshire had $234.6 billion invested in T-bills at the end of June 2024.\n\nWith a 3-star rating, Berkshire Hathaway stock is fairly valued compared with our fair value estimate.\n\nOur fair value estimate for Berkshire remains at $640,000 per Class A share and $427 per Class B share, equivalent to 1.45 times our estimates for its book value per share at the end of 2024 and 1.35 times our estimate for 2025. For perspective, over the past five years, the shares have traded at an average of 1.43 times the trailing calendar year-end book value per share, and 1.44 times over the past 10 years.\n\nWhile Berkshire is generally viewed as a defensive stock, rising when the equity markets are in the tank and struggling to keep pace with the S&P 500 Index when market returns exceed 10%, so it was interesting to see the shares up around 20% since the start of the year as of last Friday's market close of $641,435 ($428.36) per Class A (B) share relative to the 13% gain posted for the benchmark index. We also found it surprising to see the shares trade as high as $671,370 ($446.15) per Class A (B) share on July 17, 2024, which was equivalent to 1.72, 1.53, and 1.42 times estimated book value per share for 2023, 2024, and 2025, respectively -- well beyond their normal range\n\nRead more about Berkshire Hathaway's fair value estimate.\n\nWe've historically believed that Berkshire's moat is more than the sum of its parts, although the parts are fairly moaty on their own. The insurance operations -- Geico, Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, and Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group -- remain important contributors to the overall business. Not only are they expected to account for around 32% of the firm's pretax earnings (and 50% of our valuation of it), but they are overcapitalized, maintaining a larger-than-normal equity investment portfolio for a property and casualty insurer.\n\nThey also generate low-cost float (temporary cash holdings arising from premiums collected in advance of future claims). This lets Berkshire generate returns on these funds with assets commensurate with the duration of the business being underwritten. And they tend to come at little to no cost to Berkshire, given the company's proclivity for generating underwriting gains over the past several decades.\n\nThat said, we don't believe the insurance industry is conducive to developing maintainable competitive advantages. While there are some high-quality firms, with Berkshire having some of the best operators in the segments where it competes, insurers essentially sell a commodity, and excess returns are difficult to achieve consistently. Insurance buyers are not inclined to pay a premium for brands, and the products are easily replicable.\n\nRead more about Berkshire Hathaway's economic moat.\n\nBerkshire's strong balance sheet and liquidity are among its most enduring competitive advantages. Its insurance operations are overcapitalized, carrying greater equity, fixed income, and cash relative to its reserves. The company generates large amounts of free cash flow and maintains significant cash on its balance sheet, amounting to $167.6 billion at the end of 2023.\n\nBerkshire likes to keep $30 billion in cash on hand as a backstop for its insurance operations, with each of the firm's businesses likely requiring at least 2% of annual revenue as operating cash, with additional carve-outs set aside for capital expenditures. As a result, by our estimate, Berkshire entered 2024 with an excess cash balance of around $126 billion -- dry powder that could be used for acquisitions, investments, share repurchases, or dividends.\n\nRead more about Berkshire Hathaway's financial strength.\n\nOur Uncertainty Rating for Berkshire is Low. We do not consider any environmental, social, or governance issues material enough to affect our uncertainty rating. This is due to the firm's lower exposure to some of the main ESG risks inherent to its industries.\n\nThat said, Berkshire has tended to score lower on governance issues because of the makeup of its board and board committees, the unequal voting structure of its Class A and Class B shares, and its opaqueness and lack of engagement on governance issues.\n\nFollowing the death of Charlie Munger in November 2023, Berkshire's main employee risk rests with CEO Warren Buffett, who has been responsible for almost all the firm's investment and capital allocation decisions. With Buffett turning 94 at the end of this month, it is increasingly probable that our valuation horizon will exceed his lifespan, with the quality of investment returns and capital allocation likely being affected.", "source": {"uri": "morningstar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Morningstar"}, "authors": [{"uri": "greggory_warren@morningstar.com", "name": "Greggory Warren", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Book value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_value", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Fair value"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_A_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Class A share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash_and_cash_equivalents", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cash and cash equivalents"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Treasury_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Treasury security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_B_share", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Class B share"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benchmarking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Benchmarking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_advantage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Competitive advantage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinsurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reinsurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Initial public offering"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_sheet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Balance sheet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Munger", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charlie Munger"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_expenditure", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Capital expenditure"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_income", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fixed income"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_of_return", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rate of return"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valuation_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Valuation (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_cash_flow", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free cash flow"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://morningstar-morningstar-prod.web.arc-cdn.net/resizer/a4yE9wgRT37HB-FOTtAYi3YX7X8=/1800x1013/smart/filters:no_upscale()/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/morningstar/6A6R4SGLDNGMXHAH3K2CIQTF3Q.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801093", "eventUri": "eng-9801093", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2017-05-", "textStart": 160, "textEnd": 168}, {"amb": false, "date": "2017-07-", "textStart": 1809, "textEnd": 1816}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

New data released recently indicated that the unemployment rate had gone up to 4.3%, which was higher than expected and had many thinking that a recession was on the way.\n\nIf the recent stock market fluctuations have left you stressed out, now would be a good time to refresh your memory on Warren Buffett's timeless investing advice from investors who have followed it themselves.\n\n\"I first discovered Warren Buffett in 1980 when he was mentioned in 'The Money Masters' by John Train,\" said David Kass, clinical professor of finance at the Robert H. Smith School of Business at the University of Maryland. \"Since then, I have carefully followed him and have invested in Berkshire Hathaway and some of the stocks in Berkshire's portfolio.\n\n\"Berkshire is my largest investment, and it has outperformed the S&P 500 over time,\" Kass said. \"Since 1965, Berkshire has achieved a compounded annual rate of return of about 20%, while the S&P 500 has achieved a total return (with dividends reinvested) of about 10% per annum.\"\n\nKass noted that due to Berkshire's outperformance and its large weight in his portfolio, he was able to see similar results.\n\nPaul Gabrail, the founder and host of Everything Money, shared that he followed Buffett's advice to invest in stocks in 2008 and 2009 when the world was seemingly falling apart. When asked about why he invested so heavily in stocks and real estate during this economic downturn, he said, \"These were practices put into place because of what I took away from Warren Buffett's lessons. When I read about him and his friends, it clicked and made sense to me.\"\n\nWhat are some investing tips that you can also follow from Buffett for successful investing?\n\n\"As a professor of finance at the University of Maryland, I have taken students to the Berkshire annual meetings in Omaha annually over a 10-year period and have been invited on four occasions to bring students for private meetings with Buffett,\" Kass said. \"Similar to Buffett, I invest in stocks that I believe are undervalued and with excellent growth potential with respect to generating free cash flow.\"\n\nIn his annual letter to shareholders in 1989, Buffett shared the following wisdom: \"It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.\"\n\nBuffett believes in investing in undervalued companies that can increase earnings and revenue in the future instead of just popular stocks. As an investor, you may want to try this approach so that you're not just putting your money into what's popular at the moment.\n\n\"Buffett is an excellent example to follow because he's a long-term investor with an extraordinary amount of patience,\" Kass said. \"With respect to temperament, to succeed one must be unemotional and not panic in sharp market declines, nor become euphoric as the stock market sets new highs.\"\n\nBuffett is known for saying that the stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient. In his annual letter to shareholders in 1988, he noted that his favorite holding period was forever. Buffett believes in remaining patient and holding on to your stocks instead of reacting to every bit of market news.\n\nBuffett is a proponent of investing in companies that you understand so you know where your money's going. This means that you want to do enough research to feel confident in what you're investing in. Kass shared how he was inspired by how much research Buffett does with his portfolio managers by reading relevant material on a company.\n\nDuring a speech in 1993, Buffett said that risk comes from not knowing what you're doing. He believes in understanding everything about the companies you invest in to minimize your risks. This means he tries to understand the potential and possible factors impacting earnings so that he can make informed decisions.\n\n\"Buffett has stated to succeed in investing one should have the requisite intelligence, be willing to work hard and have the right temperament,\" Kass said. \"He has indicated that it is not necessary to have an IQ over 125. \"\n\nBuffett has said that rationality and emotional stability are more important than IQ when it comes to investing success. Buffett doesn't feel that you need a high IQ to be successful in investing as long as you remain rational.\n\n\"Lots of people like to say they follow Buffett, but it's hard for many because one must do it when markets are down,\" Gabrail said.\n\nBuffett is known for stating that investors should be fearful when others are greedy and greedy only when others are fearful. This advice is based on the price of a stock, since when investors get greedy, the price can go up too much and you may end up overpaying. Under this same logic, you can invest in a quality company when the stock price is down since other investors were fearful and sold off their shares. To be successful in investing, you'll have to go against the crowd sometimes.", "source": {"uri": "gobankingrates.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GOBankingRates"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Maryland,_College_Park", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "University of Maryland, College Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Finance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_H._Smith_School_of_Business", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Robert H.

As boss of Berkshire Hathaway, an investment firm that he has run for almost six decades, Mr Buffett's every movement is scrutinised. When he shifts in his seat, investors large and small ponder what it might mean for their portfolios.\n\nResults released by Berkshire Hathaway on August 3rd gave watchers more reason than normal to take note. The company announced that it had cut its stake in Apple by almost half, to $84bn. Its holdings of cash and Treasury bills increased from $189bn in the first quarter of the year to $277bn at the end of June. The backdrop to the announcement was dismal. Stockmarkets were in the midst of a sell-off, after weaker-than-expected data on American employment had provoked worries about the strength of the world's largest economy.\n\nMr Buffett's reputation has taken on an almost spiritual element: he is known as the \"Oracle of Omaha\" for a reason. The tens of thousands of investors who flock to Berkshire Hathaway's shareholder meeting are more disciples than stockpickers. It is no surprise, then, that some onlookers see the cash accumulation as a dark omen. They note that Mr Buffett also accumulated cash in the mid-2000s, before the global financial crisis, leaving him in a strong position to buy when other investors' balance-sheets were hammered. What does he know about the economy that they do not?\n\nLess than they imagine. Mr Buffett's extraordinary talent as an investor is not based on a capacity for seeing the future. Indeed, his outperformance is all the more impressive for his lack of supernatural abilities. In research published in 2018, Andrea Frazzini, David Kabiller and Lasse Pedersen, all of Capital Management, a quantitative investment firm, found that Mr Buffett's long-run outperformance can be straightforwardly explained. He has bought high-quality stocks at relatively cheap prices, and applied leverage judiciously. His strategy is, in short, classic \"value investing\", albeit a form that is combined with the ability to borrow cheaply through Berkshire Hathaway's insurance business.\n\nJust as the explanation for his extraordinary performance is acumen rather than magic, so is the reason for Mr Buffett's cash build-up. In May Mr Buffett said that his investors should expect him to sell shares and build up reserves for two reasons. One is that he expects taxes on capital gains to rise, and wants to realise his profits before that happens. The other is that he sees few cheap, high-quality companies in which to invest. The stockmarket is expensive across the board.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway's investments in Japan are an example of both the merits and the limits of Mr Buffett's strategy. It appears unlikely that the firm would have sold the stakes it holds in five sogo shosha, cheaply valued trading houses, during the recent bout of market turmoil. In February Mr Buffett mentioned the investments as among those he expected to hold indefinitely. At the same time, he has promised his stakes in the companies will not exceed 10%, a figure his holdings already bump up against. Therefore options for expansion -- either at home or abroad -- remain scant.\n\nMr Buffett has never claimed to posses the foresight his followers attribute to him. Indeed, he once joked that any firm which hires an economist has one employee too many, and says he has never made any investment decision based on an economic prediction. Although Berkshire Hathaway emerged from the global financial crisis in better shape than the vast majority of its peers, the company's cash holdings declined as a share of its total assets in the quarters running up to the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 -- not the path an omniscient investor would have taken.\n\nMr Buffett's new cash pile is undoubtedly enormous. Berkshire Hathaway could, if it wished, buy McDonald's at the burger chain's current share price and have $80bn left over, or take a stake in Meta larger than the one held by Mark Zuckerberg, the firm's boss. If markets do enter a steeper downturn, Mr Buffett will be in an enviable position, able to snap up firms trading at discounts. Fans of Mr Buffett's clear-headed approach to investing should nevertheless take him at his word. His simple maxims are at the root of his long and impressive performance as an investor; his growing cash pile holds no hidden explanation. The value investing Mr Buffett practises has become increasingly tough. In the absence of a much more protracted sell-off, it is likely to remain so.\u25a0", "source": {"uri": "economist.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Economist"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Oracle Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Treasury_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Treasury security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha,_Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007\u20132008_financial_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2007\u20132008 financial crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_analysis_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quantitative analysis (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_investing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Value investing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_gain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Capital gain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernatural", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supernatural"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Insurance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leverage_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Leverage (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Platforms", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Meta Platforms"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sogo_shosha", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sogo shosha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy_of_Lehman_Brothers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_price", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Share price"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald's", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "McDonald's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Asset"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark Zuckerberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.economist.com/content-assets/images/20240810_FND003.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801093", "eventUri": "eng-9801093", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-08-03", "textStart": 395, "textEnd": 405}], "sentiment": 0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

Filings last week revealed that the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway has halved his firm's stake in Apple and now holds $277 billion in cash.\n\nSo what? In a week when global markets had a $6.4 trillion meltdown, that's not the worst place to be sitting. Magnificent Seven tech stocks, including Apple, were among the biggest losers on Monday as US recession jitters and lacklustre earnings reports pulled the plug on a historic rally for AI-focused companies.\n\nThe question now is, what did Buffett see that the market didn't?\n\nHis position. Buffett's cash hoard is the largest it's been since June 2005. That was before the financial crisis, which saw Berkshire scooping up hallmark investments for peanuts. This time it looks more defensive. As well as cutting his top-holding in Apple, in the past quarter Buffett has\n\nBerkshire still lost around $15 billion on its biggest holdings after the global sell-off at the start of this week. An uptick in US unemployment - and a forgone opportunity by the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates - has prompted concerns of a recession. By holding cash Buffett is sticking to his famous adage: \"Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.\"\n\nCometh the taxman. Apple's stock has delivered an 800 per cent return since Buffett first disclosed his investment in the company. While Buffett was wary of tech at first, Apple eventually grew to make up half of Berkshire's holdings. So why dump now?\n\nPart of the reason, say onlookers, is tax. At the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting in May, the Oracle of Omaha shared his concern that the federal budget deficit looked likely to grow, which may well lead to higher capital gains taxes in the future.\n\nAI overhype? The other possible explanation for dumping Apple is its position in the AI race. AI-focused tech giants took a beating on Monday, and while some of that was an overdue correction to soaring values this year, investors are concerned that potential returns from the giants' eye-watering investment in AI are overvalued. Sceptics include:\n\nOpen vs closed. The other issue for Apple that investors highlight is the company's proprietary approach to hardware and software. That stands at odds with the trend in AI toward models that can be modified and shared without seeking permission. \"There's a broad feeling of open-source being really important to the ecosystem, if not leading the ecosystem, and that just sits diametrically opposed to what Apple is,\" says Suzanne Ashman, partner at LocalGlobe.\n\nWhat's more... Buffett's moves won't have helped market sentiment. But as an investor, he's always downplayed his knack for timing, preferring instead to focus on long-term trades. The turbulence this week now looks more like a correction than the collapse of the global economy, and as Buffett once said, \"if you don't like corrections, you shouldn't own stocks.\"", "source": {"uri": "tortoisemedia.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Tortoise"}, "authors": [{"uri": "barney_macintyre@tortoisemedia.com", "name": "Barney Macintyre", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Recession"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Berkshire"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Financial crisis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Reserve", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal Reserve"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Unemployment in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oracle Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Interest rate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha,_Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_gains_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Capital gains tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Open-source software"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_budget", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States federal budget"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_economy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World economy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ecosystem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Software"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing_Views", "label": "dmoz/Business/Opportunities/Opposing Views", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://www.tortoisemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/04/Boardroom-SM-signup.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801093", "eventUri": "eng-9801093", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2005-06-", "textStart": 635, "textEnd": 644}], "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

When you consistently crush the most widely followed index in the return column, you're going to draw an audience.\n\nBuffett's phenomenal investment returns are what lure in the neighborhood of 40,000 people annually to Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, Nebraska. It's also what causes investors to wait on pins and needles for the release of the company's Form 13F. A 13F is a document filed on a quarterly basis with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that shows investors which stocks Wall Street's brightest minds have been buying and selling.\n\nBut the biggest surprise isn't always what's in Berkshire Hathaway's 13F. Rather, it's the buying activity for Warren Buffett's favorite stock, which won't be found in a 13F filed with the SEC.\n\nEven though Berkshire has yet to file its 13F for the second quarter -- it'll be filed with the SEC following the close of trading on August 14 -- the company's second-quarter cash flow statement points to a similar trend we've witnessed since the start of October 2022. Namely, Buffett and his top investment aides, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, have been persistent net-sellers of equities.\n\nThe fair value estimate for Berkshire's position in Apple, as of the end of the second quarter, points to a nearly 50% reduction in Berkshire's stake in the tech giant. Further, Buffett and his crew sold shares of Bank of America, Berkshire's second-biggest holding by market value, for 12 consecutive trading sessions (July 17 - August 1), as of this writing.\n\nAltogether, Buffett and Co. have been net-sellers of equities for seven consecutive quarters, with approximately $131.6 billion more in securities sold than purchased. This has ballooned Berkshire's cash pile to an all-time record $277 billion.\n\nTo be fair, Buffett and his team have done some buying -- it's just been very selective.\n\nFor instance, 13Fs and Form 4 filings with the SEC show that the Oracle of Omaha has been adding with some degree of regularity to oil and gas stock Occidental Petroleum (OXY 4.31%) since the start of 2022. In a span of roughly 30 months, Berkshire's brightest investment minds gobbled up more than 255.2 million shares of Occidental.\n\nConsidering the minimal role energy stocks have played in Berkshire's investment portfolio this century, having close to $15 billion tied up in Occidental Petroleum signals that Buffett and his crew expect the spot price of crude oil to move higher; or at the very least remain above its historic average.\n\nThe biggest catalyst for Occidental Petroleum looks to be tight global crude oil supply. Approximately three years of reduced capital expenditures during the COVID-19 pandemic have created a scenario where global energy companies are unable to quickly increase production. As long as the supply of crude oil is constrained, its spot price should receive a boost.\n\nThis is particularly important for Occidental, which generates an outsized percentage of its revenue from its upstream drilling segment. Despite being an integrated operator that also owns chemical plants, its operating cash flow is highly dependent on swings in the spot price of crude oil.\n\nHowever, adding more than 255 million shares of Occidental Petroleum common stock is mere peanuts compared to what Warren Buffett has put to work in his favorite stock over the last six years.\n\nAs I alluded earlier, not all of Berkshire's buying and selling activity is going to be found in a 13F. For details on the Oracle of Omaha's favorite stock to buy, you'll need to dig into Berkshire Hathaway's quarterly operating results. Just prior to the executive certifications of every quarterly report from Berkshire, you'll find a detailed page describing the share repurchasing activity undertaken during the quarter. You guessed it... Warren Buffett's favorite stock to buy is none other than shares of his own company!\n\nTo be clear, buying back stock wasn't always easy for the Oracle of Omaha or his late, great right-hand man, Charlie Munger.\n\nPrior to mid-July 2018, share buybacks were only allowed if Berkshire Hathaway's share price fell to or below 120% of its book value, as of the most recent quarter. At no point in the many years leading up to mid-July 2018 did Buffett company's fall to or below this threshold, which meant no buybacks were undertaken.\n\nEverything officially changed on July 17, 2018. On this date, Berkshire's board reworked the criteria governing share repurchases to allow Buffett and Munger to come off the proverbial bench and swing for the fences.\n\nAccording to this updated policy, buybacks can commence with no end date or dollar ceiling as long as:\n\nWhile the last point is a bit subjective, it hasn't stopped Warren Buffett from repurchasing shares of his company for 24 consecutive quarters.\n\nDuring the June-ended quarter, Buffett oversaw the retirement of 555 Class A shares (BRK.A) totaling $345,137,002! On an aggregate basis, this works out to nearly $78 billion worth of buybacks since this program was amended on July 17, 2018. This is more than double the amount of cash Buffett and his team spent buying shares of top holding Apple!\n\nSince Berkshire doesn't pay a dividend, share repurchases are an easy way to reward investors. Continually retiring shares via buyback is incrementally increasing the ownership stakes of long-term shareholders. You could say it's the perfect tool to instill the long-term ethos in investors that Buffett and Charlie Munger have appreciated so much.\n\nFurthermore, buying back stock and reducing the outstanding share count can increase earnings per share (EPS) for companies with steady or growing net income (sans unrealized investment gains/losses). This should help make Berkshire even more attractive on a fundamental basis.\n\nWith $277 billion in cash in the coffers and little in the way of value piquing Warren Buffett's interest, it's a veritable certainty that the (re)purchase of Buffett's favorite stock will continue.", "source": {"uri": "fool.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Motley Fool"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Strong insurance results continued to compensate for weakness in other segments. Berkshire's insurance operations - which account for more than a third of its earnings on average and half of our valuation - continued to post solid premium growth owing to better pricing in most business lines, as well as outstanding operating profitability due to better pricing, lower claims costs, and a dearth of major catastrophe losses. Investment income provided an added boost, given all the cash Berkshire has invested in T-bills.\n\n* Railway and Energy Units Dampen Earnings: BNSF Railway and Berkshire Hathaway Energy continue to weigh on results. BNSF has maintained its practice of sacrificing more in pricing than its closest competitor, Union Pacific, to secure solid volume growth, which has hurt profit margins. Normally a pillar of stability, BHE reported revenue of $2.2 billion during the first half of 2023 and 2024, well off the $2.9 billion in 2021-22.\n\nBHE has also seen earnings impacted the past two years by loss accruals for litigation arising from wildfires in California in 2020 and Oregon in 2022. Homeservices of America has been negatively affected by the rapid rise in interest rates over the past couple of years. While we view these as blips in BHE's overall results, it has been frustrating to see one of the firm's more stable businesses upended by events mostly outside its control.\n\n* Insurance Investment Portfolio Generating More Income as Mix Shifts: As Warren Buffett has put more capital into Treasury bills and reduced Berkshire's exposure to low-dividend-yielding stocks, its insurance investment portfolio has seen a large uptick in investment income, rising from $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021 to $6.9 billion in the second quarter of 2024. It will likely remain at that level, given Berkshire's commitment of another $80 billion to T-bills during the second quarter. This rise, along with the uptick in stock sales this past year, is all realized tangible income and won't be impacted by future volatility in the equity markets.\n\n* Berkshire Continues to be a Net Seller of Equities: After trimming its stake in Apple (AAPL) by about 13% in the first quarter of 2024, Berkshire cut its stake 50% in the second quarter, noting in its quarterly report that its Apple stake was worth $84.2 billion (equivalent to 399.8 million shares) at the end of June, compared with $135.4 billion (789.4 million shares) at the end of March. It sold off Paramount Global (PARA) and trimmed its stakes in Chevron (CVX), Louisiana-Pacific (LPX), and Sirius XM Holdings (SIRI) in the first quarter. The firm also reduced its Bank of America (BAC) shares this past month, selling more than 90.4 million shares for proceeds of $3.8 billion. That said, Berkshire retains meaningful stakes in Apple and Bank of America despite the cuts to its holdings.\n\n* Cash Pile Rises to a Record $277 Billion: Going into Berkshire's annual meeting, we noted that Buffett somewhat painted the firm into a corner by commenting in May 2017 (when the company had $96.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents on hand) that it would be difficult to defend holding $150 billion or more three years hence.\n\nFor most of the past seven calendar years, he kept cash balances below that threshold, but that dam broke in the third quarter of 2023, and it posted a balance of $276.9 billion for this quarter. Buffett doesn't talk about that threshold anymore. We're surprisingly less concerned with the issue than we usually are, primarily because short-term rates are still above 5% and Berkshire had $234.6 billion invested in T-bills at the end of June 2024.\n\nWith a 3-star rating, Berkshire Hathaway stock is fairly valued compared with our fair value estimate.\n\nOur fair value estimate for Berkshire remains at $640,000 per Class A share and $427 per Class B share, equivalent to 1.45 times our estimates for its book value per share at the end of 2024 and 1.35 times our estimate for 2025. For perspective, over the past five years, the shares have traded at an average of 1.43 times the trailing calendar year-end book value per share, and 1.44 times over the past 10 years.\n\nWhile Berkshire is generally viewed as a defensive stock, rising when the equity markets are in the tank and struggling to keep pace with the S&P 500 Index when market returns exceed 10%, so it was interesting to see the shares up around 20% since the start of the year as of last Friday's market close of $641,435 ($428.36) per Class A (B) share relative to the 13% gain posted for the benchmark index. We also found it surprising to see the shares trade as high as $671,370 ($446.15) per Class A (B) share on July 17, 2024, which was equivalent to 1.72, 1.53, and 1.42 times estimated book value per share for 2023, 2024, and 2025, respectively, well beyond their normal range.\n\nWe've historically believed that Berkshire's moat is more than the sum of its parts, although the parts are fairly moaty on their own. The insurance operations - Geico, Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group, and Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group - remain important contributors to the overall business. Not only are they expected to account for around 32% of the firm's pretax earnings (and 50% of our valuation of it), but they are overcapitalized, maintaining a larger-than-normal equity investment portfolio for a property and casualty insurer.\n\nThey also generate low-cost float (temporary cash holdings arising from premiums collected in advance of future claims). This lets Berkshire generate returns on these funds with assets commensurate with the duration of the business being underwritten. And they tend to come at little to no cost to Berkshire, given the company's proclivity for generating underwriting gains over the past several decades.\n\nBerkshire's strong balance sheet and liquidity are among its most enduring competitive advantages. Its insurance operations are overcapitalized, carrying greater equity, fixed income, and cash relative to its reserves. The company generates large amounts of free cash flow and maintains significant cash on its balance sheet, amounting to $167.6 billion at the end of 2023.\n\nBerkshire likes to keep $30 billion in cash on hand as a backstop for its insurance operations, with each of the firm's businesses likely requiring at least 2% of annual revenue as operating cash, with additional carve-outs set aside for capital expenditures. As a result, by our estimate, Berkshire entered 2024 with an excess cash balance of around $126 billion - dry powder that could be used for acquisitions, investments, share repurchases, or dividends.\n\nOur Uncertainty Rating for Berkshire is Low. We do not consider any environmental, social, or governance issues material enough to affect our uncertainty rating. This is due to the firm's lower exposure to some of the main ESG risks inherent to its industries.\n\nThat said, Berkshire has tended to score lower on governance issues because of the makeup of its board and board committees, the unequal voting structure of its Class A and Class B shares, and its opaqueness and lack of engagement on governance issues.\n\nFollowing the death of Charlie Munger in November 2023, Berkshire's main employee risk rests with CEO Warren Buffett, who has been responsible for almost all the firm's investment and capital allocation decisions. With Buffett turning 94 at the end of this month, it is increasingly probable that our valuation horizon will exceed his lifespan, with the quality of investment returns and capital allocation likely being affected.\n\n* Book value per share, a good proxy for measuring changes in Berkshire's intrinsic value -- increased at an estimated 18.3% CAGR during 1965-2023, compared with a 10.2% annualized return for the S&P 500 TR Index.\n\n* Berkshire's stock performance has generally been solid, increasing at a 12.1% (11.8%) CAGR during 2019-23 (2014-23), compared with a 15.7% (12.0%) average annual return for the S&P 500 TR Index.\n\n* At the end of 2023, Berkshire had $168.9 billion in insurance float. The cost of its float has been negative for much of the past two decades.\n\n* Given its size, Berkshire's biggest long-term hurdle will be its ability to consistently find meaningfully large deals that add value.\n\n* Another big issue facing the firm is the longevity of CEO Warren Buffett (who turns 94 at the end of this month), especially following the death of longtime managing partner Charlie Munger in November 2023.\n\n* Berkshire's insurance business faces competitive and highly cyclical markets that occasionally produce large losses, and several of its noninsurance operations are economically sensitive and focused on US markets.", "source": {"uri": "morningstar.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Morningstar UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "greggory_warren@morningstar.co.uk",

Despite his company, Berkshire Hathaway, significantly reducing its stake in Apple by nearly 50 per cent in a major sell-off before a market downturn, the 93-year-old remains steadfast in his belief that investing is a long-term endeavour.\n\n\"If you're worried about corrections, you shouldn't own stocks. It's a terrible mistake to think of stocks as something that bob up and down and that you should pay attention to those bobs up and down,\" Buffett said in a 2015 interview with The Street.\n\nHe added that if you're saving for a long-term goal like retirement or purchasing a home, the fluctuations of any specific day, week, or year should not be a major concern.\n\n\"It's going to go down sometimes, if you own a stock, so why worry about it? The point is to buy something you like at a price you like and then hold it for 20 years. You should not look at it day-to-day,\" Buffett told the publication.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC, the veteran recommended that long-term investors maintain a diversified portfolio of low-cost index funds, as it is practically the best approach most of the time.\n\nIn a 2017 interview, Warren Buffett advised regularly investing in a low-cost S&P 500 index fund and continuing to buy it through both good times and bad, especially during downturns.\n\nAt Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting in May, Buffett recently stated that he was not eager to make investments unless he believed they involved minimal risk and had the potential for substantial returns.\n\nBuffett has always shared these helpful tips on several occasions for investors to navigate the stock market's highs and lows and make the best return possible from their investments.\n\nALSO READ | Sad Day For Bangladesh: Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw Condemns Attack On Mujibur Rahman Statue", "source": {"uri": "news.abplive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "english"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Warren Buffett"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S&P_500_Index", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "S&P 500 Index"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkshire_Hathaway", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Berkshire Hathaway"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TheStreet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TheStreet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_fund", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Index fund"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNBC", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stock market"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Bangladesh"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Stocks and Bonds", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Investing", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Investing", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Guides", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Financial_Services/Investment_Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Financial Services/Investment Services", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://feeds.abplive.com/onecms/images/uploaded-images/2024/08/09/82a0a958c6953d1fbd7a44e32ba929581723180032065939_original.png?impolicy=abp_cdn&imwidth=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9801093", "eventUri": "eng-9801093", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.01960784313725494, "wgt": 151, "relevance": 1}

New data released recently indicated that the unemployment rate had gone up to 4.3%, which was higher than expected and had many thinking that a recession was on the way.\n\nIf the recent stock market fluctuations have left you stressed out, now would be a good time to refresh your memory on Warren Buffett's timeless investing advice from investors who have followed it themselves.\n\nEarning passive income doesn't need to be difficult. You can start this week.\n\n\"I first discovered Warren Buffett in 1980 when he was mentioned in 'The Money Masters' by John Train,\" said David Kass, clinical professor of finance at the Robert H. Smith School of Business at the University of Maryland. \"Since then, I have carefully followed him and have invested in Berkshire Hathaway and some of the stocks in Berkshire's portfolio.\n\n\"Berkshire is my largest investment, and it has outperformed the S&P 500 over time,\" Kass said. \"Since 1965, Berkshire has achieved a compounded annual rate of return of about 20%, while the S&P 500 has achieved a total return (with dividends reinvested) of about 10% per annum.\"\n\nKass noted that due to Berkshire's outperformance and its large weight in his portfolio, he was able to see similar results.\n\nPaul Gabrail, the founder and host of Everything Money, shared that he followed Buffett's advice to invest in stocks in 2008 and 2009 when the world was seemingly falling apart. When asked about why he invested so heavily in stocks and real estate during this economic downturn, he said, \"These were practices put into place because of what I took away from Warren Buffett's lessons. When I read about him and his friends, it clicked and made sense to me.\"\n\nRead More: I'm an Investor: I'm Making These Money Moves Immediately If Trump Wins\n\nWhat are some investing tips that you can also follow from Buffett for successful investing?\n\n\"As a professor of finance at the University of Maryland, I have taken students to the Berkshire annual meetings in Omaha annually over a 10-year period and have been invited on four occasions to bring students for private meetings with Buffett,\" Kass said. \"Similar to Buffett, I invest in stocks that I believe are undervalued and with excellent growth potential with respect to generating free cash flow.\"\n\nIn his annual letter to shareholders in 1989, Buffett shared the following wisdom: \"It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.\"\n\nBuffett believes in investing in undervalued companies that can increase earnings and revenue in the future instead of just popular stocks. As an investor, you may want to try this approach so that you're not just putting your money into what's popular at the moment.\n\n\"Buffett is an excellent example to follow because he's a long-term investor with an extraordinary amount of patience,\" Kass said. \"With respect to temperament, to succeed one must be unemotional and not panic in sharp market declines, nor become euphoric as the stock market sets new highs.\"\n\nBuffett is known for saying that the stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient. In his annual letter to shareholders in 1988, he noted that his favorite holding period was forever. Buffett believes in remaining patient and holding on to your stocks instead of reacting to every bit of market news.\n\nBuffett is a proponent of investing in companies that you understand so you know where your money's going. This means that you want to do enough research to feel confident in what you're investing in. Kass shared how he was inspired by how much research Buffett does with his portfolio managers by reading relevant material on a company.\n\nDuring a speech in 1993, Buffett said that risk comes from not knowing what you're doing. He believes in understanding everything about the companies you invest in to minimize your risks. This means he tries to understand the potential and possible factors impacting earnings so that he can make informed decisions.\n\n\"Buffett has stated to succeed in investing one should have the requisite intelligence, be willing to work hard and have the right temperament,\" Kass said. \"He has indicated that it is not necessary to have an IQ over 125. \"\n\nBuffett has said that rationality and emotional stability are more important than IQ when it comes to investing success. Buffett doesn't feel that you need a high IQ to be successful in investing as long as you remain rational.\n\n\"Lots of people like to say they follow Buffett, but it's hard for many because one must do it when markets are down,\" Gabrail said.\n\nBuffett is known for stating that investors should be fearful when others are greedy and greedy only when others are fearful. This advice is based on the price of a stock, since when investors get greedy, the price can go up too much and you may end up overpaying. Under this same logic, you can invest in a quality company when the stock price is down since other investors were fearful and sold off their shares.

The company now holds an astounding $271 billion of cash and treasury bills after selling approximately half of its shares of Apple during the quarter.\n\nThere have been many highly questionable takes on why Warren Buffett has built up such a large cash position. The most dubious theory is that he has done so because he is nearly ninety-four years old and has a limited life expectancy. People who believe that Warren Buffett is conflating his personal longevity with Berkshire Hathaway's time horizon simply do not understand Mr. Buffett or Berkshire Hathaway's culture.\n\nWe cannot know exactly why Mr. Buffett has chosen to accumulate so much cash, but we can be sure that it is not burning a hole in his pocket. Berkshire is simply run in an ultra-conservative manner. As a shareholder for nearly a quarter century, this policy is precisely what I want to see, both during Mr. Buffett's remaining tenure and beyond.\n\n\"Extreme fiscal conservatism is a corporate pledge we make to those who have joined us in ownership of Berkshire. In most years - indeed in most decades - our caution will likely prove to be unneeded behavior - akin to an insurance policy on a fortress-like building thought to be fireproof. But Berkshire does not want to inflict permanent financial damage - quotational shrinkage for extended periods can't be avoided - on Bertie [Warren's sister] or any of the individuals who have trusted us with their savings.\"\n\n-- Warren Buffett, 2023 Letter to Shareholders\n\nThe Haves and Have-Nots at the Center of America's Inflation Fight by David Uberti, July 30, 2024. Inflation hammers the poor and the middle class. The rich fare much better. \"'This is the most money we've ever made and this is the brokest we've ever felt,' said Nicole Lewis, a mother of three who lives north of Flint, Mich. Pay raises since the pandemic helped Lewis and her husband, now a city manager, double their earnings to what had previously seemed unattainable: more than $90,000 a year. But price hikes for everything from groceries to auto insurance still forced the couple to siphon funds from savings.\" (WSJ)\n\nFor Big Companies, Felony Convictions Are a Mere Footnote by Dave Michaels, July 30, 2024. The fact that felony convictions of corporations no longer mean much of anything is another sign of the degradation of our society. Furthermore, the financial \"penalties\" imposed on companies are borne by shareholders, not by the executives who oversaw the criminal conduct. \"Boeing's agreement this month to plead guilty over two employees' misconduct in the run-up to two fatal crashes of 737 MAX planes shows how times have changed. A criminal conviction now matters less for big companies, which have proven able to mitigate the negative consequences and survive bad publicity.\" (WSJ)\n\nWhy You Need To Lift Heavy Things by\n\n$656,000 of Frugal Things I Still Love Doing by Mr. Money Mustache, July 23, 2024. Old habits die hard. Long past the point where it is necessary to be frugal, many people continue to derive satisfaction from frugality. In many cases, saving money coincides with activities that help build and maintain a healthier body and better mental health. While not all of the ideas in this article will appeal to everyone, the point is that saving money does not need to feel like deprivation.

However, his investment wisdom extends beyond companies and stocks.\n\nIn fact, there are two non-stock investments that Buffett has made and considers particularly 'instructive.'\n\nWhile not as famous as his company Berkshire Hathaway's stock holdings, Buffett has expressed unwavering confidence in these investments.\n\n\"The two investments will be solid and satisfactory holdings for my lifetime and, subsequently, for my children and grandchildren,\" he wrote in a letter to Berkshire shareholders.\n\nHe also projected that the income from the two investments \"will probably increase in the decades to come.\"\n\nHere's a closer look at these investments.\n\nThe first investment began amidst the backdrop of a farm price bubble burst in the Midwest. When farm prices declined, Buffett saw an opportunity.\n\n\"In 1986, I purchased a 400-acre farm, located 50 miles north of Omaha, from the FDIC. It cost me $280,000, considerably less than what a failed bank had lent against the farm a few years earlier,\" Buffett recounted in his letter.\n\nThe Oracle of Omaha admitted that he \"knew nothing\" about operating a farm. Fortunately, his son had a passion for farming, and Buffett was able to learn about the farm's production of corn and soybeans and its operating expenses.\n\nBuffett then calculated that the normalized return from the farm would be 10%. He also believed that productivity would likely improve over time and that crop prices would increase. He highlighted that \"both expectations proved out.\"\n\nIt didn't seem to be a hard decision to make, as he remarked, \"I needed no unusual knowledge or intelligence to conclude that the investment had no downside and potentially had substantial upside.\"\n\nThe investment proved worthwhile. In 2014, Buffett noted that the farm had tripled its earnings and was worth five times more than what he paid.\n\nRead more: Car insurance rates have spiked in the US to a stunning $2,150/year -- but you can be smarter than that. Here's how you can save yourself as much as $820 annually in minutes (it's 100% free)\n\nThe second investment also arose from the burst of a bubble -- this time in commercial real estate.\n\nIn 1993, Buffett learned that a New York retail property adjacent to New York University was up for sale by the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC). This entity was created to dispose of the assets of failed savings institutions whose overly optimistic lending practices had led to significant losses.\n\nBuffett conducted his analysis and determined that the unleveraged current yield from the property was approximately 10%. He noted that the RTC had undermanaged the property, and leasing the vacant stores would enhance its income.\n\nMore importantly, Buffett identified a major opportunity: the largest tenant, occupying about 20% of the space, was paying rent of only $5 per square foot, while other tenants averaged $70. He wrote, \"The expiration of this bargain lease in nine years was certain to provide a major boost to earnings.\"\n\nHe was also optimistic about the property's prime location, remarking that \"NYU wasn't going anywhere.\"\n\nArmed with this analysis, Buffett joined a small group of investors to purchase the property. The decision proved to be successful.\n\n\"Annual distributions now exceed 35% of our original equity investment. Moreover, our original mortgage was refinanced in 1996 and again in 1999, moves that allowed several special distributions totaling more than 150% of what we had invested,\" Buffett wrote.\n\nNote that while Buffett is optimistic about the future of these two investments, he made them after the bubbles had burst and conducted thorough analyses to forecast his returns.\n\nIn fact, Buffett wanted to highlight an important lesson from his experience: \"Focus on the future productivity of the asset you are considering.\"\n\nHe emphasized that if you don't feel comfortable making a rough estimate of an asset's future earnings, you should \"just forget it and move on.\"\n\nWhile some businesses are harder to forecast, farmland and real estate properties are more straightforward.\n\nFor farmland, you can estimate future returns by projecting the expected yield of corn and soybeans and their anticipated prices.\n\nFor retail properties, Buffett assessed potential income by examining rent per square foot and lease terms.\n\nToday, you don't need to buy a whole farm or an entire building to invest in these asset classes. There are real estate investment trusts (REITs) that specialize in retail properties as well as those that focus on owning farmland.\n\nAdditionally, crowdfunding platforms allow everyday investors to become part owners of institutional-quality real estate portfolios, enabling them to earn rental income without the responsibilities of being a landlord.", "source": {"uri": "finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

Originally, the Apple position had grown to represent over 50% of Berkshire's portfolio, but after Buffett sold more than $80 billion worth of shares, it now comprises just 25%. The sheer size of the sale understandably caught people's attention.\n\nAs soon as the news hit social media, reactions were swift and, predictably, exaggerated. The Motley Fool posed the question, \"Could This Be the Biggest Investing Mistake He's Ever Made?\" -- a sensational headline that later the article itself questions. On the other end of the spectrum, Zero Hedge proclaimed \"Buffett Calls the Top,\" fueling speculation that the stock market is in an unprecedented bubble and that Buffett is heading for the exits.\n\nThis reaction underscores a major issue with modern financial commentary: the focus has shifted from thoughtful analysis to sensationalism and clickbait headlines.\n\nI think that platforms like Substack stand out because they offer a refuge from this trend, allowing writers to move away from the sensationalism that dominates mainstream financial media and provide more measured, in-depth insights.\n\nIn the age of clickbait, the narrative often becomes more about drama than substance.\n\nAn Amazing Investment\n\nBefore diving into the reasons behind Buffett's decision to sell part of his Apple position, it's important to first understand why this investment was so successful in the first place.\n\nBuffett's investment in Apple ranks among the most remarkable in history. Few companies are substantial enough to impact a giant like Berkshire Hathaway, but Apple was one of those rare exceptions.\n\nBuffett's universe is limited to a select few giants capable of moving the needle for a company of Berkshire's size. In Apple, he found the perfect \"whale\" -- a stock that not only had the potential for significant returns but was also substantial enough to make a meaningful difference to Berkshire's portfolio.\n\nIt's even rarer for a company of Apple's size to offer such compelling value -- both in terms of its attractive valuation and its outstanding growth prospects. Seeing this unique opportunity, Buffett made a bold move by acquiring a significant stake, one that would profoundly benefit Berkshire shareholders.\n\nBuffett began buying Apple stock in 2016, at a time when it was astonishingly undervalued. By the end of 2015, Apple was trading at just 11.5 times its earnings -- a remarkably low valuation for a company of its caliber. Buffett saw this as an opportunity and steadily increased his position throughout 2016 and beyond.\n\nDeconstructing the Return\n\nFrom 2016 to the end of 2023, Apple stock achieved a remarkable CAGR of 29.8%. What fueled this growth?\n\nStock returns are driven by three factors:\n\nBuffett's investment in Apple encapsulated all these factors. Let's break it down:\n\nGrowth/Decline in Fundamentals\n\nApple's revenue grew from $215 billion in 2015 to $383 billion in 2023, reflecting a 7.48% CAGR. This growth was driven primarily by iPhone sales and the expansion of services tied to those devices.\n\nThe iPhone, Apple's flagship product, accounted for 52% of sales and also significantly boosted the services segment, which contributed 22% of sales. The introduction of more premium iPhones further bolstered this growth.\n\nAnother significant contributor was the launch of the Apple Watch and Airpods in 2015 and 2016, respectively. By 2023, the \"Wearables, Home, and Accessories\" segment had grown to $39.8 billion in revenue -- a segment that barely existed in 2016.\n\nOf course, the 7.5% sales growth alone doesn't explain the 29.8% CAGR. What else happened?\n\nShareholder Yield\n\nApple aggressively reduced its share count by 30% through buybacks. This significant reduction amplified the impact of the company's sales growth, boosting the CAGR from 7.5% to 13.1%.\n\nBuffett recognized Apple's strong commitment to buybacks, which had started in 2013. He saw that the company was now dedicated to repurchasing substantial amounts of its own stock, signaling a shift in capital allocation priorities.\n\nDividends increased steadily from $0.50 per share in 2015 to $0.94 per share in 2023. Reinvesting these dividends would have further increased the CAGR to 14.46%.\n\nChanges in Sentiment\n\nWhile the impressive 14.46% CAGR was driven by fundamentals alone, the additional boost to 29.8% came from a significant shift in market sentiment and valuation (i.e., speculative return), adding substantial \"icing on the cake\" for investors.\n\nThe rest of the return can be attributed to changes in valuation. The P/E ratio rose from 11.5x at the beginning of 2016 to 27.45x by the end of 2023, driving much of the stock's performance. A company delivering a 14.46% return through organic growth and shareholder yield typically wouldn't trade at just 2.6x sales and a P/E of 11.5x, but that was Apple's situation in late 2015.\n\nWhy were investors so pessimistic about Apple? The narrative at the time, captured well by a short pitch on Value Investor's Club in 2017, focused on slowing revenues for the first time in years. This decline fueled concerns that Apple was a company in decline, particularly as the iPhone faced growing competition from Android and other rivals.\n\nThis narrative turned out to be misguided, but it led to Apple trading at the low valuation. Over the following years, investors recognized this misjudgment. By 2019, Apple's valuation had adjusted to a more reasonable level for a company of its stature, trading at nearly 20x P/E and almost 4x sales.\n\nAs sales surged during COVID, the valuation soared even higher and the valuation entered a more manic phase.\n\nYou could interpret this in two ways: either investors became manic about Apple, or real improvements in the business justified the higher valuation.\n\nInterestingly, margin improvements didn't play a major role. Operating margins were 30.5% in 2015 and remained relatively stable, at 29.8% in 2023. Normally, improved margins would drive better returns on capital, but that wasn't the case here.\n\nWhat did change was Apple's financial leverage, which significantly enhanced returns on capital. The debt/equity ratio increased from 54% to 197%, with long-term debt rising from $53 billion in 2015 to $106 billion in 2023, and short-term debt increasing from $10.9 billion to $15.8 billion. The reduction in shareholder equity boosted return on tangible capital employed from 37.7% in 2015 to 51.6% in 2023. This improvement in returns likely contributed to investor enthusiasm.\n\nAdditionally, some argue that investors began to better appreciate Apple's moat. Once users are locked into the iPhone ecosystem, with their data seamlessly integrated across devices, they're more likely to remain loyal customers. Devices like AirPods further reinforce this ecosystem, making it difficult for users to switch away.\n\nOf course, much of this remains speculative. Investors are a little crazy and get manic from time to time.\n\nThis is why I consider changes in valuation multiples to be the \"speculative\" component of returns. Predicting what price multiple that investors will assign to a company is as unpredictable as the mood swings of Tony Soprano.\n\nIdeally, an investor should see a path to returns without relying heavily on speculative factors.\n\nI suspect that's the analysis which Buffett conducted in 2016. He saw a depressed stock that could deliver a solid return without needing a major shift in sentiment - and thought that the stock would likely see a shift in sentiment on top of that, anyway.\n\nThe Sale\n\nNow, let's address the question: why did Buffett decide to sell?\n\nBy breaking down the components of past returns, we can also attempt to project Apple's future returns.\n\nAssume, for a moment, that Apple continues its impressive 7.5% growth rate for the next decade -- a highly optimistic scenario. This growth rate over the last 7 years was fueled by the creation of a new wearables business and a shift to more premium products. However, with nominal GDP growing at roughly 5%, it will be challenging for Apple to consistently outpace that. But for the sake of this analysis, let's assume they can maintain this growth.\n\nIn the past year, Apple reduced its share count by 2.5%. Given its strong free cash flow, let's assume they continue this pace of buybacks for the next decade.\n\nThe stock also pays a dividend yield of 0.47%. Let's assume this dividend grows in line with sales, at 7.5% annually.\n\nNext, we need to consider the speculative return. It's one thing to factor in multiple expansion when the stock trades at 11.5x earnings and 2.6x sales, but it's much riskier at its current valuation of 32.4x earnings and 8.5x sales. Instead, let's assume Apple reverts to its average valuation since 2015, with a price-to-sales ratio of 4.75x and a P/E of 20.6x.\n\nUnder these assumptions, the projected CAGR is around 4.74%.\n\nHowever, even this projection is optimistic. It's unlikely that Apple can sustain a 7.5% growth rate for another decade, and assuming a P/E of 20.6 and a price-to-sales ratio of 4.75x is still quite generous.\n\nThere's little margin of safety in this outlook.\n\nIf growth were to slow to 5% and the valuation multiples return to 2015 levels, the CAGR drops to -3.72%.\n\nIn an optimistic scenario, Buffett might hold onto Apple and achieve a return of 4.74%. In an equally plausible scenario, Buffett could actually lose money over the next 10 years.\n\nThis outcome is highly speculative. It's a far cry from buying a deeply undervalued stock that can deliver a 14% return without relying on multiple expansion, with the potential for additional gains if the multiple improves, which was the case with Apple in early 2016.\n\nMeanwhile, he could invest in a 1-year Treasury today with a guaranteed, risk-free return of 4.5%.\n\nViewed through this lens, Buffett's decision to sell becomes quite clear. The potential returns from holding Apple at its current valuation simply do not justify the risk, especially when safer, more attractive alternatives are available.\n\nMacro Implications\n\nMany interpret Buffett's sale of Apple as a broader statement on the value of the entire stock market. (Although, I'm not even sure if they do interpret it this way or if they're just trying to get clicks.)\n\nOf course, that's not the game Buffett is playing. He's not trying to figure out the valuation of the market. He's trying to figure out the valuation of individual companies.\n\nEach security trades based on its own prospects and current price -- one overvalued stock doesn't imply that everything else is overvalued. Apple may be overvalued right now, but that doesn't diminish the fact that it's a fantastic business. The market might be overvalued, but that's an extremely difficult - nearly impossible - game to play.\n\nThe bottom line: Even a great business can deliver poor returns if bought at too high a price.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nNothing on this substack is investment advice.\n\nThe information in this article is for information and discussion purposes only.

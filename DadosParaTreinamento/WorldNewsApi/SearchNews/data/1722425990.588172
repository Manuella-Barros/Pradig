{"id": 243259988, "title": "Angels\u2019 Davis Daniel will get chance to build on impressive 1st start", "text": "ANAHEIM \u2014 Angels right-hander Davis Daniel will indeed get another start next week following his gem Thursday night when he went eight scoreless innings against the Detroit Tigers. Manager Ron Washington declined to commit to another start following Daniel\u2019s electric season debut Thursday and first career major league start. But Washington confirmed the obvious Friday with another outing to come, possibly during next week\u2019s series at Oakland. The last time a pitcher went eight or more scoreless innings with at least eight strikeouts in his first major league start was in 2001 when the Colorado Rockies\u2019 Jason Jennings pulled off the feat. Since 1901, Daniel is just one of four pitchers with eight or more scoreless innings, eight or more strikeouts and no walks in a first career major league start. The last to do it was the San Francisco Giants\u2019 Ron Herbel in 1964. \u201cIt really hasn\u2019t sunk in completely,\u201d said Daniel, who made his major league debut last season with three relief appearances. \u201cI mean, I did what I wanted to do and I felt really good doing it. But as far as the historical factor, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s quite set in but it\u2019s been cool to see.\u201d Daniel said he was unable to answer at least 100 congratulatory texts before he went to sleep following Thursday\u2019s game. By Friday morning, he said he had another 100 messages of praise waiting for him. Key to the successful outing was a bevy of changeups that kept the Tigers off balance all night as Daniel never reached more than 93 mph with his fastball. \u201cI think we threw 20, 25 of them last night, which is more than I have ever thrown,\u201d Daniel said of his changeup. \u201cSo throwing that with confidence in the big leagues, that pitch can only get better after gaining some confidence at this level.\u201d The dominating outing came after Daniel held a 5.33 ERA in 14 starts at Triple-A Salt Lake, but there were enough signs that he had been pitching better than that mark. \u201cI think over the last month it\u2019s been a lot better,\u201d Daniel said of his execution on the mound. \u201cHonestly, prior to this past month in Triple-A, I felt I was throwing the ball decent, just some tough breaks. Sometimes the ball doesn\u2019t bounce your way and I feel it\u2019s starting to turn around.\u201d LINEUP CHANGE Washington intended to have Brandon Drury in the lineup Friday for the infielder\u2019s first start in a week, but altered that plan in the afternoon. Drury, who has been dealing with an upper respiratory illness, went through an on-field workout Thursday and was feeling fine into the evening before his health regressed Friday. Washington said the illness has progressed to a number of players and coaches in the clubhouse, but that Drury has been hit hardest. He hasn\u2019t played a game since June 18 and a stint on the injured list is possible. PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE Angels right-hander Griffin Canning saw his ERA drop a tick on Friday and he wasn\u2019t even pitching. Canning\u2019s ERA fell from 4.72 to 4.62 because of a scoring change from his June 18 outing. A misplay in foul territory by Joe Adell in a game against the Milwaukee Brewers allowed two runs to score, with Canning originally charged with one earned run on the play. After review, both of the runs were ruled unearned. In the process, Milwaukee\u2019s Jackson Chourio had an RBI taken away. After a rough start to the season, Canning had a 9.88 ERA after three starts, but he has since delivered seven outings of two earned runs or less, including one Monday against the Oakland A\u2019s when he went a season-best seven innings. ALSO In addition to Daniel getting another start next week, Washington said right-hander Jose Soriano (abdominal infection) is expected to come off the injured list and make a start against the A\u2019s.

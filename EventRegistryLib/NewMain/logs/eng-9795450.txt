He therefore dismissed the claims against the police for lack of evidence.\n\nAlthough the judge commended the Office of the Attorney-General of Lagos State for upholding the duties of the office by attending court and assisting the court in the matter, he noted that the explanation by the Attorney-General's lawyer that the reason a coroner's inquest was not conducted was because the duplicate of the case file was not forwarded to his office.\n\nAccording to him, in response to the court's question on what the Attorney-General did about the matter since being served with the court processes, the lawyer submitted that the Attorney-General is ready to conduct an inquest.\n\n\"Justice Faji stressed that the Attorney-General is not alleged to have known about the alleged unlawful killing of Mr. Onifade and is also not accused of being involved in the killing but that as stated by MRA, he has a duty to conduct an inquest into the circumstances of the death.\n\n\"He said indeed, in paragraph 15 of the counter\u00ad affidavit, the 3rd respondent (the Attorney-General) has stated that he would prosecute anyone found to have a prima facie case established against him\".\n\n\"Justice Faji therefore directed the Attorney-General to take all necessary steps to see to the investigation of the circumstances of the death of Mr. Onifade and to conduct a coroner's inquest to ascertain the cause of the death as well as identify and prosecute those responsible for his death,\" the statement concluded.", "source": {"uri": "punchng.com", "dataType": "news",

(the Attorney-General) has stated that he would prosecute anyone found to have a prima facie case established against him.\"\n\nJustice Faji therefore directed the Attorney-General to take all

State Government To Investigate Journalist Onifade's Death, Prosecute Killers", "body": "Onifade, who was covering the #EndSARS protests in 2020, was reportedly arrested by Lagos state task force officers and later found dead at a mortuary in Ikorodu, Lagos.\n\nA Federal High Court in Lagos State has directed the Lagos State government to investigate the death of Mr. Pelumi Onifade, a 20-year-old reporter with Gboah TV.\n\nOnifade, who was covering the #EndSARS protests in 2020, was reportedly arrested by Lagos state task force officers and later found dead at a mortuary in Ikorodu, Lagos.\n\nThe court has also mandated a coroner's inquest to determine the cause of Onifade's death and to identify and prosecute those responsible.\n\nIn a judgment on a suit brought by Media Rights Agenda (MRA) against the Police and Lagos State Government, Justice Ayokunle Olayinka Faji ruled that while the Attorney-General cannot conduct an inquest without a duplicate of the case file, Lagos State's Administration of Criminal Justice Law (ACJL) grants the Attorney-General the authority to request such a file from the Commissioner of Police.\n\nAlthough the court dismissed five claims made by MRA against the Police due to lack of supporting evidence, Justice Faji noted that the Attorney-General did not refute any facts in MRA's affidavit and only raised a legal issue.\n\nThe Attorney-General's counsel also committed to conducting an inquest during oral arguments.\n\nMr. Charles Musa, a Lagos-based lawyer recently nominated for the rank of Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), filed the originating summons on August 4, 2021, on behalf of MRA against the Lagos State Commissioner of Police (COP), the Inspector-General of Police (IGP), and the Attorney-General of Lagos State.\n\n\"The suit, citing various constitutional and international human rights provisions, seeks declarations that:\n\n- The shooting of Mr. Onifade by agents of the COP and IGP on October 24, 2020, during his journalistic work was unconstitutional and a severe violation of his fundamental rights.\n\n- Mr. Onifade's arrest and unlawful detention by the COP and IGP were unconstitutional and a grave infringement of his rights.\n\n- The duties of the respondents do not extend to unlawful detention of individuals not charged or convicted by a court.\n\n- The COP and IGP are obligated to investigate crimes against journalists exercising their right to freedom of expression.\"\n\nMRA also requested three court orders: for a transparent and impartial investigation into Onifade's death, a coroner's inquest to determine the cause of death, and the identification and prosecution of those responsible.\n\nJustice Faji noted that while the COP and IGP were served with the summons and other documents, they did not respond.\n\nHe also pointed out that MRA's affidavit lacked evidence from eyewitnesses or documentation regarding the mortuary deposit.\n\nAlthough the affidavit frequently mentioned the deceased's family, no family member provided supporting evidence.\n\nConsequently, the court dismissed the claims against the police due to insufficient evidence.\n\nJustice Faji acknowledged the Attorney-General's Office for fulfilling its duties by attending court and assisting with the case but criticised the lack of the coroner's inquest due to the missing case file duplicate.\n\nHe emphasised that the Attorney-General, while not implicated in the alleged unlawful killing, has a duty to conduct an inquest.\n\nHe concluded by directing the Attorney-General to ensure a thorough investigation into Mr. Onifade's death, conduct a coroner's inquest, and prosecute those responsible.", "source": {"uri": "saharareporters.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sahara

He, therefore, dismissed the claims against the police for lack of evidence.\n\nAlthough the judge commended the Office of the Attorney General of Lagos State for upholding the duties of the office by attending court and assisting the court in the matter, he noted that the explanation by the Attorney General's lawyer that the reason a coroner's inquest was not conducted was because the duplicate of the case file was not forwarded to his office.\n\nAccording to him, in response to the court's question on what the Attorney General did about the matter since being served with the court processes, the lawyer submitted that the Attorney General was ready to conduct an inquest.\n\nMr Faji stressed that the Attorney-General is not alleged to have known about the alleged unlawful killing of the late Onifade and is also not accused of being involved in the killing, but that, as stated by MRA, he has a duty to conduct an inquest into the circumstances of the death.\n\n\"Indeed, in paragraph 15 of the counter\u00ad affidavit, the 3rd respondent (the Attorney-General) has stated that he would prosecute anyone found to have a prima facie case established against him,\" he said.\n\nThe late Onifade was a second-year student of the Department of History at the Tai Solarin University of Education, Ogun State, and a reporter with Gboah TV, an online television channel, at the time.\n\nHe was covering the #EndSARS protests in Lagos before officers of the Lagos State Taskforce arrested him on 24 October 2020.\n\nHis body was later found at a mortuary in Ikorodu, sparking concerns about police brutality and the safety of journalists in Nigeria.", "source": {"uri": "gistmania.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "gistmania.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "onuigbo_felicia@gistmania.com",

Articles 4, 5 and 9 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights (Ratification and Enforcement) Act, 2004; and Order II Rules 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the Fundamental Rights (Enforcement Procedure) Rules 2009, the organisation was asking the court to declare that:\n\nOnifade's shooting in Oko Oba in Agege local government area of Lagos state, by agents of the COP and the IGP on October 24, 2020 in the course of his journalistic work was unconstitutional and a gross violation of his fundamental rights as guaranteed by Section 33 of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) and Article 4 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights (Ratification and Enforcement) Act (Cap A9) Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004.\n\nThe Judge held that Onifade's arrest and unlawful restriction of his liberty by agents of the COP and the IGP on October 24, 2020 in the course of his duties was unconstitutional and a gross violation of his fundamental rights as guaranteed by sections 35, 39 and 46(1) of the 1999 Constitution and Articles 5 and9 of the African Charter.\n\nHe held that constitutional and statutory duties of the respondents did not extend to unlawful detention of innocent individuals who have not been charged to court or found guilty of any offence by a competent court of law in Nigeria.\n\nThe COP and the IGP, the court ruled, had an obligation to investigate crimes committed against Onifade, a journalist exercising his right to freedom of expression as guaranteed under Sections 33 and 39 of the constitution and Articles 4 and 9 of the African Charter.\n\nMRA had asked the court to issue three orders, directing the respondents to launch a transparent, impartial and independent investigation into the circumstances of the death of Mr. Onifade whose body was found in a morgue in Lagos; direct them to conduct a coroner's inquest to ascertain the cause of his death; and direct them to identify and prosecute those responsible for his death.\n\nIn his judgment, Justice Faji disclosed that although the COP and the IGP were served with the originating summons and other processes in the suit, they did not file any response.\n\nHe noted that Mr. John Gbadamosi, MRA's Programme Officer who deposed to the affidavit in support of the suit, did not witness any of the facts relevant to the matter, adding that there was also no documentation in support of the claim that Mr. Onifade's corpse was deposited in a mortuary.\n\nJustice Faji also observed that although there was constant reference in the affidavit to the family of the deceased who, he said, would have the necessary information regarding their various interactions with the Police, none of them filed any evidence in support of the incident. He therefore dismissed the claims against the Police for lack of evidence.\n\nAlthough the judge commended the Office of the Attorney-General of Lagos State for upholding the duties of the office by attending court and assisting the court in the matter, he noted that the explanation by the Attorney-General's lawyer that the reason a coroner's inquest was not conducted was because the duplicate of the case file was not forwarded to his office.\n\nAccording to him, in response to the court's question on what the Attorney-General did about the matter since being served with the court processes, the lawyer submitted that the Attorney-General was ready to conduct an inquest.\n\nJustice Faji stressed that the Attorney-General was not alleged to have known about the alleged unlawful killing of Mr. Onifade and also not accused of being involved in the killing, but that as stated by MRA, he has a duty to conduct an inquest into the circumstances of the death.\n\nHe said, \"Indeed, in paragraph 15 of the counter\u00ac affidavit, the 3rd respondent (the Attorney-General) has stated that he would prosecute anyone found to have a prima facie case established against him\".\n\nJustice Faji then directed the Attorney-General to take all necessary steps to see to the investigation of the circumstances of the death of Onifade and to conduct a coroner's inquest to ascertain the cause of the death as well as identify and prosecute those responsible for his death.", "source": {"uri": "leadership.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "Leadership"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He will be deeply missed,\" the statement partly said.\n\nDelivering judgment in a suit filed by MRA over the death of the journalist against the police and the Lagos State Government, Justice Ayokunle Faji agreed that the government's chief law officer \"cannot just conduct an inquest without a duplicate of the case file\" but he ruled that Section 74 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Law of Lagos State gives the Attorney General the power to request for a case file from the Commissioner of Police.\n\nA Lagos-based lawyer, Charles Musa, who was selected for conferment of the rank of Senior Advocate of Nigeria, filed an originating summons on August 4, 2021, on behalf of MRA, against the Commissioner of Police, the Inspector-General of Police and the Attorney-General of Lagos State.\n\nIn the suit, the organisation urged the court to declare that: \"Onifade's shooting in Oko Oba in Agege Local Government Area of Lagos State by agents of the Commissioner of Police and the IGP on October 24, 2020, in the course of his journalistic work is unconstitutional and a gross violation of his fundamental rights as guaranteed by Section 33 of the 1999 Constitution (as amended) and Article 4 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights (Ratification and Enforcement) Act (Cap A9) Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004.\"\n\nIn his judgment, Justice Faji stressed that the Attorney General was not alleged to have known about the alleged unlawful killing of Onifade and was also not accused of being involved in the killing but that as stated by MRA, he has a duty to conduct an inquest into the circumstances of the death.\n\nHe said: \"Indeed, in paragraph 15 of the counter\u00ad affidavit, the 3rd respondent (the Attorney General) has stated that he would prosecute anyone found to have a prima facie case established against him.\"\n\nJustice Faji therefore directed the Attorney General to take all necessary steps to see to the investigation of the circumstances of the death of Onifade and to conduct a coroner's inquest to ascertain the cause of the death as well as identify and prosecute those responsible for his death.", "source": {"uri":

His body was subsequently found in a mortuary in Ikorodu, raising serious questions about the events leading to his death.\n\nThe MRA has strongly advocated for justice, claiming that Onifade's fundamental rights were egregiously violated during his arrest and subsequent death.\n\nThe court's decision mandates the Lagos State government to conduct a coroner's inquest to determine the cause of Onifade's death, identify those responsible, and ensure their prosecution. This decision underscores the growing demand for transparency and accountability in law enforcement, particularly concerning the treatment of journalists and the safeguarding of their rights.\n\nCourt Proceedings and Findings\n\nIn the recent ruling, Justice Faji addressed key points regarding the legal responsibilities of the police and the Attorney-General's office. He highlighted that the Attorney-General has the authority to request a case file from the Commissioner of Police, which is crucial for conducting an inquest. However, the court dismissed five of the MRA's claims against the police due to insufficient evidence, illustrating the difficulties in gathering adequate documentation and eyewitness testimony.\n\nDespite the dismissal of some claims, Justice Faji emphasized the importance of investigating crimes against journalists, especially those exercising their right to freedom of expression. He reiterated that the constitutional and statutory duties of law enforcement do not permit the unlawful detention of individuals who have not been charged with any crime. This assertion reinforces the necessity for law enforcement agencies to adhere to legal standards and respect citizens' rights.\n\nImplications for Press Freedom and Human Rights\n\nThe court's ruling has significant implications for press freedom and human rights in Nigeria. It indicates a possible shift towards greater accountability for law enforcement agencies, particularly in cases involving journalists who often face risks during civil unrest. The ruling also serves as a reminder of the ongoing challenges faced by media professionals in Nigeria, where incidents of violence and intimidation against journalists are common.\n\nThe MRA's pursuit of justice for Onifade highlights the vital role of civil society organizations in advocating for human rights and press freedom. Their dedication to holding authorities accountable is crucial in fostering a safe environment for journalists to work without fear of retaliation or violence.\n\nFAQs\n\nThe court ruled based on a suit filed by the Media Rights Agenda, which sought justice for Onifade after he was arrested during the #EndSARS protests and later found dead.\n\nThe ruling may enhance accountability for law enforcement and improve the safety and rights of journalists operating in Nigeria.\n\nThe government must conduct a coroner's inquest to determine the cause of Onifade's death and identify those responsible for it.", "source": {"uri": "internewscast.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Internewscast Journal"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journalist", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Journalist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagos", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lagos"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lagos"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagos_State", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lagos State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Lagos State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_SARS", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "End SARS"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_commissioner", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Police commissioner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Attorney general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Floyd protests"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "High Court of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inspector_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Inspector general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroner", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coroner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fundamental rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Accountability"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquest", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Inquest"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikorodu", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ikorodu"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ikorodu"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_disorder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil disorder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intimidation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Intimidation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_imprisonment", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "False imprisonment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Non-governmental organization"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Statute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of speech"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_the_press", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freedom of the press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Human_Rights_and_Liberties", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Human Rights and Liberties", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property_Rights", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Property Rights", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 80}], "image": "https://media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2024/08/Pelumi-Onifade.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795450", "eventUri": "eng-9795450", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3568627450980392, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

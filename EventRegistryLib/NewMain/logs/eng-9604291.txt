On Tuesday the wireless provider announced that it is buying US Cellular's wireless operation in a $4.4 billion deal. The purchase will include US Cellular's 4.5 million wireless users, its retail stores and \"certain specified spectrum assets.\"\n\nExpected to close in \"mid-2025\" the move would give US Cellular's users access to T-Mobile's network, plans and services. A regional wireless provider, USCellular operates its own network in 21 states across the country.\n\nAccording to T-Mobile, US Cellular users will \"have the option to stay on their current plans or move to an unlimited T-Mobile plan of their choosing with no switching costs.\" T-Mobile made a similar promise when it bought Sprint back in 2020.\n\nRead more: Rates on Some Older T-Mobile Plans Are Going Up\n\nOnce the deal closes, US Cellular users will be able to tap into T-Mobile's 5G network with the latter stressing that this will help those in \"underserved rural areas.\" T-Mobile users, meanwhile, will be able to connect and roam on US Cellular's network in areas where it lacks strong coverage. T-Mobile says that the extra capacity it is acquiring will also allow it to continue to expand its home internet offerings.\n\n\"As customers from both companies will get more coverage and more capacity from our combined footprint, our competitors will be forced to keep up -- and even more consumers will benefit,\" T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert said in a press release announcing the deal. \"The Un-carrier is all about shaking up wireless for the good of consumers and this deal is another way for us to continue doing even more of that.\"\n\nIn addition to acquiring US Cellular's wireless customers, T-Mobile will also buy around 30% of US Cellular's wireless spectrum and it'll lease space on more of the company's cell towers. Per US Cellular, T-Mobile will extend its leases on the roughly 600 towers it currently rents space on, and T-Mobile says it's also leasing space on \"at least 2,100 additional towers.\"\n\nUS Cellular says that this will \"ensure continued, uninterrupted service for US Cellular customers following the transaction\" while also creating a \"long-term contracted revenue stream\" for its remaining business that will consist of cell towers and wireless spectrum.\n\nThe exact spectrum bands that T-Mobile is acquiring and which spectrum US Cellular will be retaining was not immediately known, though T-Mobile tells CNET it will include US Cellular's 600 MHz and 2.5GHz holdings alongside additional airwaves. US Cellular tells CNET that it \"will have more details on the customer benefits in the weeks to come.\"\n\nIn the event the deal isn't completed, T-Mobile would pay US Cellular a $60 million \"breakup\" fee.\n\nThe sale of US Cellular assets was expected for a while among wireless industry watchers with recent reports suggesting that it would sell to T-Mobile or Verizon. The regional carrier has struggled lately, and last August announced that it was looking for \"strategic alternatives\" for the company.\n\nFor T-Mobile, this is the latest move as the carrier looks to continue to grow. It completed its purchase of Sprint four years ago and earlier this month it closed its purchase of prepaid provider Mint Mobile and its sister brands. The acquisitions have helped vault T-Mobile to becoming the second largest wireless provider in the US, leapfrogging AT&T and trailing only Verizon.", "source": {"uri": "cnet.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNET"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Cellular", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Cellular"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-Mobile", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "T-Mobile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wireless"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "5G"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electromagnetic spectrum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_network", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cellular network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_console", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Video game console"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Sievert", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Sievert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sprint Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_spectrum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Radio spectrum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_site", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cell site"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mint_Mobile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mint Mobile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prepay_mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prepay mobile phone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNET", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNET"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon_Communications", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Verizon Communications"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT&T", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AT&T"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "wgt": 41}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "wgt": 41}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Data_Communications/Wireless", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Data Communications/Wireless", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Handheld_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Handheld Platforms", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/ba9d7e0f466e9d5278efe9dbaf6c27a93f8c9acf/hub/2024/04/18/636ee61f-c3c9-4cf9-ad83-be605c4a00db/tmobile-16x9.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=675&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9604291", "eventUri": "eng-9604291", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 223, "relevance": 1}

Up to $100 million of the deal's cash portion depends on certain financial and operating metrics being met between its signing and closing, according to a separate press release from U.S. Cellular.\n\nShares of T-Mobile were up more than 1% during Tuesday's session.\n\nT-Mobile will acquire about 30% of U.S. Cellular's wireless spectrum as part of the deal, according to the U.S. Cellular release. It plans to use that to improve coverage in rural areas while offering better connectivity to U.S. Cellular customers around the United States, the two companies announced. The company said it will allow U.S. Cellular customers to keep their current plans or switch to a T-Mobile plan.\n\nBoth companies said that U.S. Cellular will retain 70% of its wireless spectrum and towers and will lease space on at least 2,100 additional towers to T-Mobile. The deal will also allow T-Mobile to sign new long-term leases on at least 2,015 U.S. Cellular-owned towers and extend existing leases on about 600 others, U.S. Cellular said in its release.\n\nThis will give U.S. Cellular customers a \"strong anchor tenant\" for at least 15 years after the deal's close, the company said.\n\nThe news follows T-Mobile's $1.35 billion acquisition of Ka'ena, the parent company of Mint Mobile. The U.S. Federal Communications Commission approved that deal in April. T-Mobile merged with Sprint in 2020 in a deal worth $26 billion.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported earlier in May that T-Mobile and Verizon were in talks to \"carve up\" U.S. Cellular's wireless spectrum but said a deal with Verizon on a separate transaction could take longer or fall through.\n\nThe companies expect the deal to close in mid-2025.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Cellular", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Cellular"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-Mobile", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "T-Mobile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electromagnetic spectrum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_spectrum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Radio spectrum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Radio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mint_Mobile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mint Mobile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sprint Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Communications_Commission", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Communications Commission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon_Communications", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Verizon Communications"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Life/Cellular_Automata", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Life/Cellular Automata", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Handheld_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Handheld Platforms", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/hUMCE6DLcTM13YTROpcApw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_nbc_universal_184/df19445ea860da8855b331246ccf841f", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9604291", "eventUri": "eng-9604291", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 221, "relevance": 1}

It was previously rumored that US Cellular's business would be carved up between T-Mobile and Verizon to deter regulators from blocking the deal, according to The Wall Street Journal, but Verizon hasn't yet announced anything related to US Cellular.", "source": {"uri": "theverge.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Verge"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jess_weatherbed@theverge.com", "name": "Jess Weatherbed", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electromagnetic spectrum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Cellular", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Cellular"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-Mobile", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "T-Mobile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wireless"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vox_Media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vox Media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "5G"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_network_operator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile network operator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Sievert", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Sievert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon_Communications", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Verizon Communications"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT&T", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AT&T"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Life/Cellular_Automata", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Life/Cellular Automata", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Handheld_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Handheld Platforms", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xOOZ7aESLcKkVX9JChtnnE2zNEg=/0x0:2040x1360/1200x628/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23962440/acastro_STK067__01.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9604291", "eventUri": "eng-9604291", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 217, "relevance": 1}

The deal includes only wireless operations and certain spectrum products, with US Cellular maintaining ownership of the rest. Increasing competition at the top end of the mobile carrier market has smaller companies like US Cellular seeking to divest their assets.\n\nFor years, T-Mobile has branded itself as an \"un-carrier,\" boasting that its mobile service plans are flexible enough to suit any budget or lifestyle. To those locked into a contract with another service provider, this offer was immediately attractive. However, T-Mobile has grown exponentially since its humble beginnings as VoiceStream Wireless back in the 90s, rolling out more plan options with revised terms and conditions. As it expands, the company now says that it is reeling in another business to help with its initiatives.\n\nRelated Best T-Mobile plans in 2024 Get the 5G data you need without wasting cash on features you don't\n\nT-Mobile has announced that it is forking over about $4.4 billion to acquire assets from US Cellular. The deal is officially set to close in 2025, pending regulatory approval, and T-Mobile will absorb up to $2 billion in debt from the company. As a result of the acquisition, T-Mobile says it will be in a better position to expand coverage - specifically in rural areas - to existing US Cellular customers.\n\nHow much is T-Mobile really getting out of its deal?\n\nIt's worth noting, however, that the company will only be acquiring US Cellular's wireless operations and certain spectrum products - this does not mean all of them. In fact, US Cellular will maintain ownership over the rest of its spectrum assets and its towers. To this extent, T-Mobile will lease space on more than 2,100 of US Cellular's towers. The company claims that its acquisition will ultimately benefit all mobile service customers by providing them with more choice.\n\nHowever, it's not just T-Mobile that is attempting to capitalize on US Cellular's assets. Verizon is rumored to be making a bid as well, but its deal is expected to take longer than the one in the works with T-Mobile. US Cellular is thought to be divesting its assets due to increasing competition in the mobile carrier market, as well as the rising fees associated with acquiring wireless licenses. With competitors like T-Mobile and Verizon making it more difficult for customers to exit their contractual agreements, it's becoming increasingly challenging for smaller companies to keep up. As of May 2024, US Cellular had a customer base of about four million people across 21 states, as well as a market value of $3 billion.", "source": {"uri": "androidpolice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Android Police"}, "authors": [{"uri": "krystle_vermes@androidpolice.com", "name": "Krystle Vermes", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Cellular", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Cellular"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-Mobile", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "T-Mobile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wireless"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_network_operator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile network operator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "5G"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-Mobile_US", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "T-Mobile US"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon_Communications", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Verizon Communications"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Application_Developers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Application Developers", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Handheld_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Handheld Platforms", "wgt": 33}], "image": "https://static1.anpoimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/t-mobile-carriers-ap24-hero.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9604291", "eventUri": "eng-9604291", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.388235294117647, "wgt": 216, "relevance": 1}

For those unaware, U.S. Cellular is the fifth-largest carrier in the U.S. despite being a regional carrier based mostly in the Chicago area. Unlike mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) like Metro by T-Mobile or Visible, which piggyback on a parent carrier's network, US Cellular has its own towers and stores.\n\nThe deal would see T-Mobile pay $4.4 billion to take over US Cellular's wireless customers, stores, and 30% of its spectrum assets. It includes a combination of cash and T-Mobile assuming $2 billion of U.S. Cellular's debt. US Cellular will keep control of 4,400 of its towers and 70% of its spectrum portfolio, but T-Mobile will extend its leases for 600 US Cellular towers and sign new long-term leases on 2,015 more towers. In a conference call about the deal, T-Mobile also committed to hiring a significant number of U.S. Cellular associates.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nExisting U.S. Cellular customers will have the option to stay on their current plan or move to an unlimited T-Mobile plan of their choice with no switching costs. T-Mobile hasn't specified if it'll force everyone to switch eventually, but it claims it will save customers money by giving them access to plans with increased savings.\n\nOn T-Mobile's side, it's not hard to see why it made the acquisition. One of T-Mobile's biggest problems has been providing service in rural areas, where it has lagged behind Verizon and smaller regional carriers. Acquiring US Cellular could help T-Mobile fill the gap in its 5G network with access to more 5G mid-band and mmWave. Since last summer, US Cellular has covered 1 million households with its mid-band network, with 3 million expected to have coverage by the end of 2024.\n\n\"T-Mobile's purchase and integration of US Cellular's wireless operations will provide best-in-class connectivity to rural Americans through enhanced nationwide coverage and service offerings at more compelling price points,\" said Laurent Therivel, CEO of US Cellular. \"The transaction provides our customers access to better coverage and speeds, as well as unlimited texting in more than 215 countries, content offers, device upgrades, and other T-Mobile benefits.\"\n\nT-Mobile hopes to have the deal closed with regulatory approval by mid-2025. The boards of US Cellular and its parent company, Telephone and Data Systems, have already approved the deal, meaning the only regulatory hurdle may be on the government side.\n\nThe purchase of US Cellular is just the latest in a long string of acquisitions by T-Mobile. There was T-Mobile's merger with Sprint in 2020, which required the company to parcel out Boost Mobile to Dish Network. Then there was T-Mobile's acquisition of Mint Mobile in a $1.35 billion deal in 2023.\n\nWhile the regulatory agencies did make T-Mobile part with Boost Mobile to allow the Sprint deal to go ahead, it's unlikely they will block this latest acquisition as long as T-Mobile has rivals like Verizon and AT&T.\n\nOne way T-Mobile may seek to forestall any regulatory hurdles is by splitting U.S. Cellular with Verizon, though this isn't confirmed yet on the Verizon side. Whatever the outcome, consumer choices for affordable alternatives to the Big Three carriers are going to become a whole lot slimmer.\n\nEditors' Recommendations Your next T-Mobile bill might be a lot more expensive AT&T now makes you pay even more for its fastest 5G speeds How fast is 5G?

US Cellular customers will apparently not see too much of an impact financially (yet), as they can continue with their current plans or swap to an unlimited T-Mob plan without charge.\n\nT-Mobile US naturally says switching is the right move since it could come with some extra savings and will grant access to free international roaming.\n\nHowever, the acquisition does not include US Cellular in its entirety, which might seem strange at first considering the company is mostly known for its phones and phone plans. The company has hardware assets, and the deal will leave US Cellular with its phone towers, 2,015 of which will now host T-Mobile users through a new long-term agreement. US Cellular also says that T-Mobile extended its lease at 600 towers that it was already using.\n\nT-Mobile also acquired about 30 percent of US Cellular's spectrum band assets, which it says will increase its coverage in rural areas, which can have especially poor and uneven reception.\n\nThe transaction will be settled with both hard cash as well as transferring up to $2 billion of US Cellular debt to T-Mobile. The expected cost to integrate US Cellular customers into the T-Mobile network is between $2.2 billion and $2.6 billion, against the $1 billion annual revenue the deal is supposed to generate for T-Mobile. That means the total cost to make the acquisition happen is up to $7 billion, which would take as many years to make itself pay off per T-Mobile's projections.\n\nMeanwhile, US Cellular will be left a much smaller company, but since its phone plans were focused on value, it might not be losing too much in the end and now only needs to look after its phone towers.\n\nBoth firms say the deal is a win for consumers and brings more competition against AT&T and Verizon, the top two cell networks in the US. While the actual number of choices has been brought down by one, T-Mobile and US Cellular argue that consolidating phone plans under the former and tower operations under the latter will mean \"customers from both companies will get more coverage and more capacity.\"\n\nThe transaction is expected to close in the middle of 2025, assuming regulators approve the deal, which won't always be a guarantee for T-Mobile. Its 2020 acquisition of Sprint was somewhat troubled by regulatory inquiry from both the federal government and California. Since then, T-Mobile has purchased Mint Mobile, and while that deal went through fine, snapping up yet another budget phone business might raise some eyebrows.\n\nIn this case, however, T-Mobile isn't buying all of US Cellular, and that might make the difference. \u00ae", "source": {"uri": "theregister.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "theregister.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Cellular", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Cellular"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-Mobile", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "T-Mobile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-Mobile_US", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "T-Mobile US"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electromagnetic spectrum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Telecommunications"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wireless"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mint_Mobile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mint Mobile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sprint Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon_Communications", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Verizon Communications"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT&T", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AT&T"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "wgt": 37}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Life/Cellular_Automata", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Life/Cellular Automata", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Handheld_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Handheld Platforms", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://regmedia.co.uk/2023/01/20/shutterstock_t_mobile_logo_3.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9604291", "eventUri": "eng-9604291", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.0980392156862746, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

Not only is the company's buyout of Sprint, one of the formerly big four carriers, still fresh in our minds, but it has also engaged in many smaller acquisitions lately, most recently the Mint Mobile one. Now, T-Mobile is getting ready to buy out a good chunk of US Cellular.\n\nT-Mobile has announced a $4.4 billion deal to acquire some of the assets owned by regional wireless carrier US Cellular. The deal includes US Cellular's wireless customers, stores, and approximately 30% of its spectrum assets, while the other 70% of spectrum assets will remain independent and will be leased by T-Mobile. From what it appears like, T-Mobile will have complete control of the carrier as a result of this buyout while not owning, but still using, most towers, with the carrier entering a long-term deal with whatever's left of US Cellular to use these more than 2,000 towers across the country.\n\nT-Mobile aims to leverage this acquisition to expand its network coverage and bolster 5G connectivity, particularly in underserved rural areas. The company has also assured US Cellular customers that they can either retain their existing plans or switch to T-Mobile's unlimited plans without incurring additional costs. T-Mobile's CEO Mike Sievert says that with this acquisition, T-Mobile \"can extend the superior Un-carrier value and experiences that we're famous for to millions of US cellular customers and deliver them lower-priced, value-packed plans and better connectivity on our best-in-class nationwide 5G network. As customers from both companies will get more coverage and more capacity from our combined footprint, our competitors will be forced to keep up - and even more consumers will benefit.\" That rings a bit hollow after T-Mobile just raised prices on legacy plans it promised would never increase in price.\n\nThe deal, expected to close in mid-2025, is contingent on regulatory approval. The fact that T-Mobile is not buying most towers might make the deal easier to digest for the FTC, but again, we'll have to wait and see -- even the Mint Mobile deal recently took a while to go through, so T-Mobile might be on thin ice.

U.S. Cellular will keep its nearly 4,400 owned towers, its equity method investments, and approximately 70% of spectrum assets.\n\nCustomers of U.S. Cellular will have the option to stay on their current plans or move to an unlimited T-Mobile plan of their choosing with no switching costs, T-Mobile said. The second-largest wireless company in the United States with over 110 million customers by the end of 2022, T-Mobile was called \"the right partner\" by U.S. Cellular CEO Laurent Therivel.\n\n\"The decisions we announced today are in the best interests of our customers and our shareholders,\" Therivel said in a separate news release.\n\n\"T-Mobile is the right partner for our wireless operations and will ensure that customers have access to best-in-class wireless speeds and performance, including 5G and a nationwide network, at compelling prices,\" he said.\n\nU.S. Cellular, which saw a 6% stock price jump Tuesday, currently operates in 21 states while T-Mobile stock shares also were up more than 1% on Tuesday.\n\nT-Mobile merged with Sprint, at that point the country's third and fourth largest wireless carriers, in 2020 in a $26 billion sale after 13 state attorneys general sought to block the deal, saying it was potentially harmful to customers\n\n\"The T-Mobile/Sprint merger will hurt consumers, drive up prices, cost jobs & hurt folks in rural & urban areas,\" Minnesota's Attorney General Keith Ellison said in 2019 on X as he joined the legal effort to stop the merger.\n\n\"It will make it harder for folks to afford their lives,\" Ellison claimed.\n\nIn March of last year, T-Mobile acquired Ka'ena Corporation and its subsidiaries Mint Mobile and Ultra Mobile in a billion-dollar deal that echoed the U.S. Cellular buy. Five months later in August T-Mobile said it would be trimming almost 7% of its workforce over the following months as part of a cost-cutting strategy.\n\nBut Boost Mobile's founder was critical of the merger Tuesday morning and called on the Federal Trade Commission to act in a social media post.\n\n\"There is NO way they should be allowed to purchase these customers they must be made to divest them to an [mobile virtual network operator],\" Boost's ex-CEO Peter Adderton said on X, adding \"this is now getting out of hand.\"\n\nAdderton compared the T-Mobile sale to a theoretical Verizon or AT&T buy of Dish Wireless.\n\n\"It's clear the regulators have given up and now believe 3 [mobile network operators] is enough in the market so [mobile virtual network operators] are all we have left,\" he said in a separate post right after.", "source": {"uri": "bnd.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Belleville News-Democrat"}, "authors": [{"uri": "chris_benson@bnd.com", "name": "Chris

T-Mobile said it's paying a total of $4.4 billion, which includes a combination of cash and as much as $2 billion in assumed debt. The transaction is expected to close in mid-2025, pending regulatory approvals.\n\nShares of T-Mobile gained 1.4 per cent to $168.32 at 10:06 a.m. New York time. US Cellular shares were up 3.2 per cent at $44.34. Its parent, Telephone and Data Systems Inc., also gained.\n\nT-Mobile, alongside virtually all of its telecom rivals, has been facing intensifying competition for new business in a saturated wireless market. Meanwhile, it's going head-to-head with cable providers offering bundled phone products to their video subscribers.\n\nDespite that, T-Mobile has grown faster than peers by cashing in on a lead in fast 5G airwaves, adding more rural territories to its coverage area and selling wireless internet access in places where broadband choices are few.\n\nT-Mobile expects to finance the US Cellular deal with existing cash. The company said it plans to offer to swap $2 billion of US Cellular debt for T-Mobile debt.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month that Verizon and T-Mobile were in talks to buy portions of US Cellular, a carrier with more than 4 million wireless subscribers in 21 states and a market value of $3.86 billion.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Verizon Communications Inc.'s consumer chief, Sowmyanarayan Sampath, said the company wanted to buy back U.S. Cellular's stake in its Los Angeles business if the companies could agree on a reasonable price. Verizon had long been eager to buy back the share, he said.\n\nFollowing the closure of the deal, US Cellular will retain one of the largest tower businesses in the US, 70 per cent of its spectrum portfolio and significant investment interests, including its wireless partnerships.\n\nJust last month, Bellevue, Washington-based T-Mobile reported quarterly earnings that beat analysts' expectations and added more wireless phone subscribers than Wall Street had projected.\n\nAlso in April, T-Mobile won US approval to buy Mint Mobile, the budget wireless provider partly owned by actor Ryan Reynolds. The company had proposed to acquire Mint's closely held parent company, Ka'ena Corp., with a combination of 39 per cent cash and 61 per cent stock in March 2023 in a deal valued at as much as $1.35 billion.", "source": {"uri": "bnnbloomberg.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "BNN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electromagnetic spectrum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Cellular", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Cellular"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-Mobile", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "T-Mobile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wireless"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon_Communications", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Verizon Communications"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-Mobile_US", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "T-Mobile US"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_network_operator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile network operator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retail", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Retail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States dollar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Telecommunications"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_and_Data_Systems", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Telephone and Data Systems"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "5G"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cable television"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadband", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Broadband"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mint_Mobile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mint Mobile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Reynolds", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Reynolds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privately_held_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Privately held company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellevue,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bellevue, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bellevue, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer_Electronics/Communications", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Consumer Electronics/Communications", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Data_Communications/Wireless", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Data Communications/Wireless", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Handheld_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Handheld Platforms", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 64}], "image": "http://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/polopoly_fs/1.2078169!/fileimage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/t-mobile.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9604291", "eventUri": "eng-9604291", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 205, "relevance": 1}

In 2020, T-Mobile acquired Sprint in a $26.5 billion deal, which at the time combined the nation's third- and fourth-largest wireless carriers.\n\n\"The integrations of MetroPCS in 2013 and Sprint in 2020 have been noted as two of the most successful merger combinations in wireless history that resulted in competition-enhancing shifts benefiting millions of consumers,\" T-Mobile said.\n\nCustomers currently with U.S. Cellular will automatically become customers of T-Mobile once the agreement is finalized, the statement said.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "max_zahn@yahoo.com", "name": "Max Zahn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Cellular", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Cellular"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-Mobile", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "T-Mobile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electromagnetic spectrum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_network_operator", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mobile network operator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Sievert", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Sievert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendy's", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wendy's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_site", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cell site"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon_Communications", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Verizon Communications"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT&T", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AT&T"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald's", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "McDonald's"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Target Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_by_T-Mobile", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metro by T-Mobile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sprint Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wireless"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "wgt": 40}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "wgt": 39}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Research", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Research", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Application_Developers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Application Developers", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Handheld_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Handheld Platforms", "wgt": 38}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/uoVYzcdDwqGr57iZY44f9g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/us.abcnews.gma.com/76fb61ca57df8283abf39943f83cda97", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9604291", "eventUri": "eng-9604291", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

In 2020 T-Mobile completed the takeover of smaller rival Sprint. And in 2013 the Federal Communications Commission approved its merger with MetroPCS Communications Inc.\n\nT-Mobile said Tuesday that U.S. Cellular customers will gain access to its 5G network, giving them better coverage and speed. The company said the deal will particularly benefit those that live in underserved rural areas of the country.\n\n\"In the face of rising competition and increasing capital intensity required to keep pace with the latest technologies, and following our careful and deliberate strategic review, we are confident that continuing to deliver on our mission requires a level of scale and investment that is best achieved by integrating our wireless operations with those of T-Mobile,\" U.S. Cellular Chair LeRoy Carlson Jr. said in a statement.\n\nT-Mobile said that U.S. Cellular customers will be able to remain on their current plans or switch to an unlimited T-Mobile plan of their choice. They will not incur switching costs if a plan change is made.\n\nThat is a mixed bag for consumers, said Ives at Wedbush.\n\n\"The U.S. consumer has less choice but there is more competition and this could drive prices lower,\" Ives said.\n\nThe transaction includes a combination of cash and up to about $2 billion of assumed debt. Up to $100 million of the cash component is contingent on hitting certain financial and operational metrics between the deal's signing and closing.\n\nU.S. Cellular will keep about 70% of of its spectrum portfolio across several spectrum bands.\n\nThe deal has been unanimously approved by the boards of United States Cellular Corp. and Telephone and Data Systems Inc, which is a majority shareholder of U.S. Cellular. It is expected to close in mid-2025.\n\nU.S. Cellular's stock jumped more than 2% in morning trading on Tuesday.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

T-Mobile is paying $4.4 billion, including a combination of cash and as much as $2 billion in assumed debt. The transaction is expected to close in mid-2025, pending regulatory approvals.\n\nAdvertisementAdvertisement\n\nShares of T-Mobile gained less than 1% Tuesday morning in New York. US Cellular was up 2.5% and parent company Telephone and Data Systems Inc. was down about 2.4.\n\nBusiness Briefing\n\nBecome a business insider with the latest news.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nOr with:\n\nGoogleFacebook\n\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy\n\nThe deal will accelerate T-Mobile's expansion into smaller markets where it's under-penetrated, analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence wrote in a note. It also gives T-Mobile assets, such as the retail stores and spectrum, and keeps them out of rivals' reach.\n\nT-Mobile, alongside virtually all of its telecom rivals, has been facing intensifying competition for new business in a saturated wireless market. Meanwhile, it's going head-to-head with cable providers offering bundled phone products to their video subscribers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut T-Mobile has grown faster than peers by cashing in on a lead in fast 5G airwaves, adding more rural territories to its coverage area and selling wireless internet access in places where broadband choices are few.\n\nUnder terms of the deal, T-Mobile will enter a new master license agreement on at least 2,015 incremental US Cellular towers, and extend its existing tenancy on about 600 towers for a further 15 years, US Cellular said.\n\nUS Cellular will retain one of the largest tower businesses in the US, 70% of its spectrum portfolio and significant investment interests, including its wireless partnerships, according to the company. There is a $60 million breakup fee if either party backs out, US Cellular executives said on a call with analysts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nT-Mobile expects to finance the US Cellular deal with existing cash. The company said it plans to offer to swap $2 billion of US Cellular debt for T-Mobile debt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month that Verizon and T-Mobile were in talks to buy portions of US Cellular, a carrier with more than 4 million wireless subscribers in 21 states and a market value of $3.71 billion.\n\nAs a result of the deal, US Cellular customers of US Cellular and T-Mobile will see lower prices, a better network and a better experience, Laurent Therivel, chief executive officer of US Cellular, said on a call with analysts. \"From a customer perspective it's a really good outcome,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton and DLA Piper are acting as legal counsel to T-Mobile. Citigroup Global Markets Inc. is serving as lead financial adviser, Centerview Partners is serving as financial adviser and Sidley Austin is lead legal adviser to TDS. TD Securities (USA) and Wells Fargo are also serving as financial advisers to TDS for the transaction.

Per the deal, current U.S. Cellular customers will have the option of keeping their current plans or moving to T-Mobile plans.\n\nT-Mobile Chief Executive Mike Sievert praised the deal:\n\n\"This deal will create opportunity for T-Mobile to bring millions of UScellular customers lower prices and the Un-carrier's superior value on our best-in-class nationwide 5G network, offering much needed choice and more real competition across the wireless industry.\"\n\nU.S. Cellular will retain about 70% of its spectrum towers, at least 2,100 of which it plans to lease to T-Mobile. T-Mobile will have the option of signing new leases on more than 2,000 towers and extending leases on an additional 600.\n\nAs a result, U.S. Cellular's customers will receive continued support for at least 15 years following the deal's closure.\n\nToday's news comes as a something of a followup to T-Mobile's $1.35 billion purchase of Ka'ena, parent of Mint Mobile, which the U.S. Federal Communications Commission approved just last month.

In 2020 T-Mobile completed the takeover of smaller rival Sprint. And in 2013 the Federal Communications Commission approved its merger with MetroPCS Communications Inc.\n\nT-Mobile said Tuesday that U.S. Cellular customers will gain access to its 5G network, giving them better coverage and speed. The company said the deal will particularly benefit those that live in underserved rural areas of the country.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"In the face of rising competition and increasing capital intensity required to keep pace with the latest technologies, and following our careful and deliberate strategic review, we are confident that continuing to deliver on our mission requires a level of scale and investment that is best achieved by integrating our wireless operations with those of T-Mobile,\" U.S. Cellular Chair LeRoy Carlson Jr. said in a statement.\n\nT-Mobile said that U.S. Cellular customers will be able to remain on their current plans or switch to an unlimited T-Mobile plan of their choice. They will not incur switching costs if a plan change is made.\n\nThat is a mixed bag for consumers, said Ives at Wedbush.\n\n\"The U.S. consumer has less choice but there is more competition and this could drive prices lower,\" Ives said.\n\nThe transaction includes a combination of cash and up to about $2 billion of assumed debt. Up to $100 million of the cash component is contingent on hitting certain financial and operational metrics between the deal's signing and closing.\n\nU.S. Cellular will keep about 70% of of its spectrum portfolio across several spectrum bands.\n\nThe deal has been unanimously approved by the boards of United States Cellular Corp. and Telephone and Data Systems Inc, which is a majority shareholder of U.S. Cellular. It is expected to close in mid-2025.\n\nU.S. Cellular's stock jumped more than 2% in morning trading on Tuesday.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The deal includes US Cellular's wireless customers, retail stores and 30% of its spectrum assets. The transaction is expected to close in mid-2025, pending regulatory approvals.\n\nShares of T-Mobile were little changed in early trading. US Cellular shares were up 2.4% before the market open.\n\nT-Mobile, alongside virtually all of its telecom rivals, has been facing intensifying competition for new business in a saturated wireless market. Meanwhile, it's going head-to-head with cable providers offering bundled phone products to their video subscribers.\n\nDespite that, T-Mobile has grown faster than peers by cashing in on a lead in fast 5G airwaves, adding more rural territories to its coverage area and selling wireless internet access in places where broadband choices are few.\n\nT-Mobile expects to finance the US Cellular deal with existing cash. The company said it plans to offer to swap $2 billion of US Cellular debt for T-Mobile debt.\n\nIn April, the Bellevue, Washington-based company reported quarterly earnings that beat analysts' expectations and added more wireless phone subscribers than Wall Street had projected.\n\nAlso in April, T-Mobile won US approval to buy Mint Mobile, the budget wireless provider partly owned by actor Ryan Reynolds. The company had proposed to acquire Mint's closely held parent company, Ka'ena Corp., with a combination of 39% cash and 61% stock in March 2023 in a deal valued at as much as $1.35 billion.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month that Verizon and T-Mobile were in talks to buy portions of US Cellular, a carrier with more than 4 million wireless subscribers in 21 states and a market value of $3.86 billion.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Verizon Communications Inc.'s consumer chief, Sowmyanarayan Sampath, said the company wanted to buy back US Cellular's stake in its Los Angeles business if the companies could agree on a reasonable price. Verizon had long been eager to buy back the share, he said.\n\nFollowing the closure of the deal, US Cellular will retain one of the largest tower businesses in the US, 70% of its spectrum portfolio and significant investment interests, including its wireless partnerships.\n\n(Adds pre-market share price and additional details beginning in the second paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek", "source": {"uri": "ca.finance.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo!

The Un-carrier is all about shaking up wireless for the good of consumers and this deal is another way for us to continue doing even more of that.\"\n\n\"T-Mobile's purchase and integration of UScellular's wireless operations will provide best-in-class connectivity to rural Americans through enhanced nationwide coverage and service offerings at more compelling price points,\" said Laurent Therivel, CEO of UScellular. \"The transaction provides our customers access to better coverage and speeds, as well as unlimited texting in more than 215 countries, content offers, device upgrades and other T-Mobile benefits.\"", "source": {"uri": "wallstreet-online.de", "dataType": "news", "title": "wallstreet:online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Cellular", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Cellular"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-Mobile", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "T-Mobile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wireless"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electromagnetic spectrum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "5G"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Un-carrier", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Un-carrier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Stock_Exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Stock Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Sievert", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Sievert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Data_Communications/Wireless", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Data Communications/Wireless", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Services", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Handheld_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Handheld Platforms", "wgt": 28}], "image": "https://assets.wallstreet-online.de/_media/6/source1280/size_645/businesswire-1280.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9604291", "eventUri": "eng-9604291", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.607843137254902, "wgt": 194, "relevance": 1}

The acquisition will be funded through a combination of cash and up to $2 billion in debt, which T-Mobile will assume through an exchange offer to some of U.S. Cellular's debtholders.\n\nU.S. Cellular's shares surged over 10% in pre-market trading following the announcement. The regional carrier, which had been exploring strategic options for nearly ten months, will retain ownership of about 70% of its spectrum, its equity-method investments, and 4,400 telecom towers. T-Mobile will become a long-term tenant on at least 2,600 of these towers, ensuring continued operational synergy between the two companies.\n\nT-Mobile does not anticipate any impact on its financial forecast or shareholder return program for 2024 as a result of the acquisition. The company expects to yield approximately $1 billion in operating expense and capital spending cost synergies from the deal. The transaction, which is subject to regulatory approvals, is expected to close by mid-2025.

If you don't live in a region where its service is concentrated, then you may not have even heard of it before. However, if you do live someplace where US Cellular coverage is prominent, then it might offer superior service to that of its competitors. But that's all changing.\n\nT-Mobile describes the acquisition as including US Cellular's subscriber base and its retail stores, as well as \"certain specified spectrum assets.\" In practice, the press release says that this will improve service for US Cellular customers, as they'll get the same service they've always had in their home area -- if not better -- but also have it supported by full-scale T-Mobile coverage in non-US Cellular areas instead of relying on roaming service.\n\nThere are some clear potential downsides to the deal, though, particularly if we use past T-Mobile acquisitions as a reference point. A recent report from Rewheel Research argues that T-Mobile's 2020 merger with/acquisition of Sprint eliminated substantive price competition among American carriers, for starters. T-Mobile also hasn't lived up to its promises of not cutting jobs in the face of the merger, either. So let's take a look at how past deals have gone and how they could inform the future with an acquired US Cellular.", "source": {"uri": "slashgear.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "SlashGear"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Cellular", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Cellular"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-Mobile", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "T-Mobile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wireless"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Electromagnetic spectrum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon_Communications", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Verizon Communications"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT&T", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AT&T"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sprint Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Roaming"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Services", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Life/Cellular_Automata", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Life/Cellular Automata", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Handheld_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Handheld Platforms", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 46}], "image": "https://www.slashgear.com/img/gallery/why-t-mobile-buying-us-cellular-could-be-a-disaster-for-budget-cellphone-plans/l-intro-1716916373.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9604291", "eventUri": "eng-9604291", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

This includes UScellular's wireless customers and stores, as well as certain specified spectrum assets.\n\nUpon closing, T-Mobile's leading 5G network will expand to provide millions of UScellular customers, particularly those in underserved rural areas, a superior connectivity experience, moving from a roaming experience outside of the UScellular coverage area to full nationwide access on the country's largest and fastest 5G network. Additionally, UScellular customers will have the ability to fully participate in the Un-carrier's industry-leading value-packed plans filled with benefits and perks, and best-in-class customer support with the opportunity to save UScellular customers hundreds of millions of dollars. T-Mobile customers will also get access to UScellular's network in areas that previously had limited coverage and the benefit of enhanced performance throughout UScellular's footprint from the addition of the acquired UScellular spectrum to T-Mobile's network. And wireless consumers across the country will benefit from the enhanced choice and competition that this proposed transaction will create.\n\n\"With this deal T-Mobile can extend the superior Un-carrier value and experiences that we're famous for to millions of UScellular customers and deliver them lower-priced, value-packed plans and better connectivity on our best-in-class nationwide 5G network,\" said Mike Sievert, CEO of T-Mobile. \"As customers from both companies will get more coverage and more capacity from our combined footprint, our competitors will be forced to keep up - and even more consumers will benefit. The Un-carrier is all about shaking up wireless for the good of consumers and this deal is another way for us to continue doing even more of that.\"\n\n\"T-Mobile's purchase and integration of UScellular's wireless operations will provide best-in-class connectivity to rural Americans through enhanced nationwide coverage and service offerings at more compelling price points,\" said Laurent Therivel, CEO of UScellular. \"The transaction provides our customers access to better coverage and speeds, as well as unlimited texting in more than 215 countries, content offers, device upgrades and other T-Mobile benefits.\"\n\nBest-in-Class Network Experience\n\nThe combination of both companies' spectrum and assets will provide UScellular customers a superior connected experience on T-Mobile's industry-leading nationwide 5G network that offers best-in-class performance, coverage, and speed. Customers of both companies, particularly those in underserved rural areas, will receive access to faster and more reliable 5G service they would not otherwise have.\n\nValue-Packed Plans\n\nUScellular customers will have the option to stay on their current plans or move to an unlimited T-Mobile plan of their choosing with no switching costs, which include beloved Un-carrier benefits such as streaming and free international data roaming. If UScellular customers choose to switch to T-Mobile, they could save hundreds of millions of dollars combined annually. Some will also have access to plans with increased savings previously not available to them, including T-Mobile's 5G Unlimited 55+ plans. All customers will be able to take advantage of T-Mobile's award-winning customer service team, and have better, more accessible in-person and digital retail support.\n\nMore Choice and Increased Competition\n\nThis transaction will create a much-needed choice for wireless in areas with expensive and limited plans from AT&T and Verizon, and for those that have been limited to one or no options for home broadband connectivity. By tapping into the additional capacity and coverage created through the combined spectrum and wireless assets, T-Mobile will spur competition and expand its fast-growing home broadband offering and fixed wireless products to communities without competitive broadband options, further bridging the digital divide for hundreds of thousands of customers in UScellular's footprint.\n\nProven Un-carrier Playbook\n\nT-Mobile has a proven industry-leading track record of bringing companies together in the name of enhanced connectivity, choice, and value for consumers. The integrations of MetroPCS in 2013 and Sprint in 2020 have been noted as two of the most successful merger combinations in wireless history that resulted in competition-enhancing shifts benefiting millions of consumers. Leveraging its tried-and-true playbook for successful integrations, T-Mobile will continue to deliver exceptional value and experiences to more people across the country, while forcing others to follow suit, for the good of customers.\n\nTransaction Details and Financial Profile\n\nT-Mobile will pay approximately $4.4 billion for the assets being acquired from UScellular in the transaction in a combination of cash and up to $2.0 billion of debt to be assumed by T-Mobile through an exchange offer to be made to certain UScellular debtholders prior to closing. To the extent any debtholders do not participate in the exchange, their bonds will continue as obligations of UScellular and the cash portion of the purchase price will be correspondingly increased. Following the closing of the transaction, UScellular will retain ownership of its other spectrum as well as its towers, with T-Mobile entering into a long-term arrangement to lease space on at least 2,100 additional towers being retained. T-Mobile does not expect the transaction to impact the company's 2024 guidance or 2024 authorized shareholder return program. T-Mobile expects this transaction will yield approximately $1.0 billion in effective total opex and capex annual run rate cost synergies upon integration, with total cost to achieve the integration currently estimated at between $2.2 billion to $2.6 billion. The company plans to reinvest a portion of synergies toward enhancing consumer choice, quality and competition in the wireless industry.\n\nThe transaction, which is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions and receipt of certain regulatory approvals, is expected to close in mid-2025.", "source": {"uri": "sunflowerstateradio.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sunflower State Radio"}, "authors": [{"uri": "derek_nester@sunflowerstateradio.com", "name": "Derek Nester", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Un-carrier", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Un-carrier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electromagnetic spectrum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Cellular", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Cellular"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "5G"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-Mobile", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "T-Mobile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wireless"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Roaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasdaq", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nasdaq"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadband", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Broadband"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Stock_Exchange", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York Stock Exchange"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellevue,_Washington", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bellevue, Washington"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bellevue, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Sievert", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Sievert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_messaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Text messaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_service", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Customer service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_by_T-Mobile", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Metro by T-Mobile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprint_Corporation", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sprint Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_wireless", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fixed wireless"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_divide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Digital divide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon_Communications", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Verizon Communications"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT&T", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AT&T"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Data_Communications/Wireless", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Data Communications/Wireless", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Services", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Handheld_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Handheld Platforms", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 58}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/sunflowerstateradio.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/T-Mobile_New_Logo_Primary_RGB_W-on-M.jpg?fit=1200%2C536&ssl=1&w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9604291", "eventUri": "eng-9604291", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bellevue, Washington"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5921568627450979, "wgt": 181, "relevance": 1}

More info.\n\nT-Mobile has built its network to have amazing speed and capacity in all major US cities. If you live in an urban area, T-Mobile is probably a good option as a provider. However, as you get a bit more rural, that same network tends to fade and you may find yourself having to go for a different provider such as Verizon. With T-Mobile announcing its plans to acquire US Cellular, it's looking to beef up its rural offering in a quick manner.\n\nJust a week following T-Mobile's news that they are raising prices on select legacy plans, the news is out that T-Mobile is going to pay $4.4 billion to acquire US Cellular, the country's fourth largest carrier. I'm not entirely sure who runs the optics department over there at T-Mobile, but yeah, could we have picked a worse time?\n\nIn a press release, a lot is mentioned about tower leases and how T-Mobile plans to improve its rural offering, but when we read the following about how this purchase will benefit the American consumer by providing \"more competitive choices,\" I about spit my coffee out.\n\nT-Mobile's purchase and integration of US Cellular's wireless operations will provide more competitive choices for US Cellular customers, as they will benefit from T-Mobile's greater resources and ability to provide lower prices, more robust plans, and a better network experience. Access to T-Mobile's 5G network, enhanced by US Cellular's spectrum and tower assets, will provide immediate value to US Cellular customers through better coverage, speed and access to T-Mobile's \"Un-carrier\" benefits including content offers, additional savings for seniors and robust customer service options.\n\nI wholeheartedly expect the purchase to benefit existing US Cellular customers, as well as T-Mobile customers who travel or live within rural areas that US Cellular's network performs better in. However, it must be agreed to that if T-Mobile is gobbling up yet another carrier, that doesn't equate to there being more \"choices\" for consumers. By definition, it's the opposite.\n\nThis transaction is expected to close in mid-2025, subject to the usual regulatory approvals which is all hogwash and doesn't mean anything anyway.", "source": {"uri": "droid-life.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Droid Life"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Cellular", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Cellular"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-Mobile", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "T-Mobile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon_Communications", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Verizon Communications"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Urban area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Optics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wireless"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Un-carrier", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Un-carrier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Electromagnetic spectrum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "5G"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Research", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Research", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Application_Developers", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Application Developers", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Handheld_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Handheld Platforms", "wgt": 33}], "image": "https://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/T-Mobile-CEO-Bill-Pay-600x315-cropped.jpg?p=301840", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9604291", "eventUri": "eng-9604291", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

The transaction is anticipated\n\nto have a value of $4.4 billion, according to the expected outcome.\n\nWhen conducting this study, the subscribers, stores, and thirty percent of the spectrum assets under the corporation's ownership are all taken into consideration.\n\nDuring the trading session that took place before the closing bell, shares of U.S. Cellular had an increase that was greater than ten percent.\n\nThis announcement comes almost 10 months after the business made a public declaration that it was conducting research into a number of other potential strategic alternatives. The announcement was made in response to a number of different types of strategic opportunity.\n\nApproximately seventy percent of the spectrum that U.S. Cellular holds will continue to be under its control. Additionally, the equity-method investments and four thousand and four hundred telecom towers will additionally continue to be under its management.\n\nAdditionally, the corporation will continue to retain ownership of its assets that are made under the equity strategy. According to the findings of the investigation, there will be a minimum of 2,600 towers in which T-Mobile will become a tenant for an extended period of time. The results of the report led to the discovery of this particular number.\n\nA combination of cash and up to two billion dollars' worth of debt will be assumed by T-Mobile through an exchange offer that will be made to certain debtholders affiliated with U.S. Cellular in order to fund the acquisition. This transfer of debt will take place in order to fund the transaction. For the purpose of financing the acquisition,\n\nIn order to ensure that the transaction will be successful, it is intended to carry out these stages in the appropriate chronological order. The extension of the degree of coverage that T-Mobile offers to its customers is something that the firm is interested in pursuing as a potential course of action.\n\nAs far as the current understanding of the organization is concerned, it is not anticipated that there will be any changes made to either the financial outlook or the shareholder return program that T-Mobile employs in the year 2024.\n\nBecause of the combination of operational expenses and capital expenditures, it is anticipated that the company will generate a yield of around one billion dollars in cost synergies. As a result, this is expected to happen.\n\nIn the middle of the year 2025, it is anticipated that the transaction will be finalized after obtaining the necessary clearances from the regulatory authorities that are relevant to the situation.\n\nThis is the anticipated timeframe. U.S. Cellular has made statements that indicate it is extremely unlikely that shareholders will take any kind of action in connection with this transaction. This is the opinion that has been expressed by the company.\n\nFurthermore, it was reported that T-Mobile Telephone and Data Systems, which maintains an 83% ownership stake in the regional carrier, has given its formal assent to the sale, which has made it simpler for the transaction to be allowed. This has improved the likelihood that the transaction will be approved. As a result, the likelihood of the transaction being approved has increased.\n\nIn an article that was published earlier this month in the Wall Street Journal, it was revealed that Verizon was actively engaged in negotiations to acquire assets that belonged to the regional carrier. Prior to the beginning of this month, the article was published.\n\nSEE ALSO:", "source": {"uri": "chiangraitimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTN News l Chiang Rai Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Cellular", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Cellular"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-Mobile", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "T-Mobile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Electromagnetic spectrum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_company", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Telephone company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Telecommunications"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_(finance)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Equity (finance)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Corporation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_and_Data_Systems", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Telephone and Data Systems"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon_Communications", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Verizon Communications"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shareholder"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial_Life/Cellular_Automata", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Artificial Life/Cellular Automata", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Handheld_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Handheld Platforms", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 61}], "image": "https://www.chiangraitimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/T-Mobile-1.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9604291", "eventUri": "eng-9604291", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 153, "relevance": 1}

Following the acquisition, it plans to give millions of UScellular customers, particularly those in underserved rural areas, access to its extensive national 5G network.\n\nThe company also said wireless consumers across the country will benefit from \"enhanced choice and competition\" if the acquisition goes ahead.\n\nCEO Mike Sievert said that the deal will give UScellular customers \"lower-priced, value-packed plans and better connectivity on our best-in-class nationwide 5G network\".\n\n\"As customers from both companies will get more coverage and more capacity from our combined footprint, our competitors will be forced to keep up - and even more consumers will benefit,\" Sievert said.\n\nThrough the acquisition, which now awaits regulatory approval, T-Mobile will assume up to $2bn in debt through an exchange offer to be made to certain UScellular debtholders prior to closing.\n\n\"T-Mobile's purchase and integration of UScellular's wireless operations will provide best-in-class connectivity to rural Americans through enhanced nationwide coverage and service offerings at more compelling price points,\" said Laurent Therivel, CEO of UScellular.\n\n\"The transaction provides our customers access to better coverage and speeds, as well as unlimited texting in more than 215 countries, content offers, device upgrades and other T-Mobile benefits.\"\n\nLast month, T-Mobile, Verizon, AT&T and Sprint (which merged with T-Mobile in 2020) were fined nearly $200m for illegally sharing access to customers' real-time location data without their consent.

Sponsored by Strack & Van Til.\n\nT-Mobile, the telecommunication giant that has cell phone stores across Northwest Indiana, has acquired the wireless operations of former White Sox ballpark sponsor U.S. Cellular for $4.4 billion.\n\nThe wireless carrier U.S. Cellular was founded in Chicago in 1983 and had the naming rights to the home of the Chicago White Sox in Bridgeport from 2003 to 2016, when it was known colloquially by fans as \"The Cell,\" before it was renamed Guaranteed Rate Field after the mortgage lender. U.S. Cellular once had a store in Schererville.\n\nT-Mobile, which has multiple Region locations such as in Highland, Griffith, Dyer, St. John, Crown Point, Merrillville, Gary, Hammond, Portage and Valparaiso, plans to acquire most of U.S. Cellular, including its wireless customers, stores and spectrum assets. It plans to spend $4.4 billion in cash and assumpe U.S. Cellular debt.\n\n\"As customers from both companies will get more coverage and more capacity from our combined footprint, our competitors will be forced to keep up -- and even more consumers will benefit,\" said T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert in the companies' announcement of the acquisition.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nU.S. Cellular customers will be converted to T-Mobile, which the suburban Seattle-based company claims has the \"largest and fastest 5G network.\" It promises better and faster wireless service, particularly in underserved rural areas.\n\nCurrent U.S. Cellular customers can stick with their existing plans or switch to new T-Mobile plans. T-Mobile says some could save money with plans not previously available to them, such as its Unlimited 55+ plans.\n\nThe merger will face antitrust review. T-Mobile asserts it will offer more competition in areas now only served by AT&T and Verizon, including some that have no options or limited options for home broadband connectivity.\n\n\"T-Mobile's purchase and integration of U.S. Cellular's wireless operations will provide best-in-class connectivity to rural Americans through enhanced nationwide coverage and service offerings at more compelling price points,\" said U.S. Cellular CEO Laurent Therivel in the companies' news release. \"The transaction provides our customers access to better coverage and speeds, as well as unlimited texting in more than 215 countries, content offers, device upgrades and other T-Mobile benefits.\"\n\nU.S. Cellular will still exist as a company and, for instance, still own its towers, which T-Mobile will lease long-term. The deal is expected to close halfway through next year, pending regulatory approval.\n\nA look back at Northwest Indiana businesses that closed in 2023\n\nA look back at Region businesses that closed in 2023\n\nLocal News Alert Top Story Urgent Beer Geeks craft beer bar in Highland closes, to reopen as B-Side Bar & Lounge Joseph S.

T-Mobile will get around 30% of U.S. Cellular's wireless spectrum, and this deal aims to improve connectivity across the board, especially for those living in remote rural areas. The carrier says that closing this deal will provide U.S. customers nationwide access to the fastest 5G and roaming network, also in areas where the network was previously limited.\n\n\"The Un-carrier is all about shaking up wireless for the good of consumers and this deal is another way for us to continue doing even more of that,\" says T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert. U.S. Cellular is said to retain 70 percent of its wireless spectrum and towers, leasing space of around 2,100 additional towers to T-Mobile.\n\nLaurent Therivel, CEO of U.S. Cellular, adds that the transaction will provide its customers \"access to better coverage and speeds, as well as unlimited texting in more than 215 countries, content offers, device upgrades, and other T-Mobile benefits.\"\n\nFor now, U.S. Cellular customers still have the choice to stick to their current plans or move to an unlimited T-Mobile plan with no switching costs, which includes Un-carrier benefits such as streaming and free international data roaming.\n\nIf all goes as planned, the deal is expected to close in mid-2025.\n\nThis acquisition could mean a few things for other cellular carriers in the U.S. wireless market, one of which is potentially lower prices. With T-Mobile's bigger coverage area, it might pressure other companies like AT&T and Verizon to offer competitive prices and offers to customers in order to retain them.\n\n\"As customers from both companies will get more coverage and capacity from our combined footprint, our competitors will be forced to keep up - and even more consumers will benefit,\" Sievert added.\n\nAn analyst from Wedbush Securities analyst told the Associated Press that \"the U.S. consumer has less choice, but there is more competition, and this could drive prices lower.\"\n\nHowever, on the flip side, if T-Mobile monopolizes the market, especially in places where other networks lack coverage, such as rural areas, it might be tough for the company to offer competitive prices on the pretext of being the only player in the market. Recently, T-Mobile told customers on legacy plans that they would be charged more per line as a result of \"rising costs.\"\n\nIt remains to be seen how other wireless carriers will react to this acquisition by T-Mobile, as U.S. Cellular is the fourth largest wireless carrier in the United States, albeit with fairly limited coverage.\n\nThe announcement comes not long after T-Mobile agreed to purchase Mint Mobile and Ultra Mobile via an acquisition of parent company Ka'ena Corporation.", "source": {"uri": "androidcentral.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Android Central"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nandika_ravi@androidcentral.com", "name": "Nandika Ravi", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Cellular", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "U.S. Cellular"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-Mobile", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "T-Mobile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wireless"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_spectrum", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Radio spectrum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mint_Mobile", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mint Mobile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Un-carrier", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Un-carrier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Electromagnetic spectrum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5G", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "5G"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roaming", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roaming"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile phone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Sievert", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Sievert"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_messaging", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Text messaging"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Streaming media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verizon_Communications", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Verizon Communications"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT&T", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AT&T"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_network_operator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mobile network operator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing", "wgt": 39}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile_Computing/Wireless_Data", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Mobile Computing/Wireless Data", "wgt": 38}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Data_Communications/Wireless", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Data Communications/Wireless", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Services", "label": "dmoz/Business/Telecommunications/Services", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Handheld_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Handheld Platforms", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 53}], "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Mr8skv235NeD5miZHHjWGg-1200-80.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9604291", "eventUri": "eng-9604291", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-28", "textStart": 123, "textEnd": 129}], "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 454628225, "relevance": 2}

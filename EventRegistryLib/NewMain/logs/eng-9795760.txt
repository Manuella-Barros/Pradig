This agreement, titled \"On the Status of Russian Border Troops on the Territory of the Republic of Armenia and the Conditions of Their Activities,\" outlines their duties.\n\nHowever, the NSS did not disclose the number of Russian border guards who left the airport, citing that the requested information is a state secret. Meanwhile, a few days ago, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs, James O'Brien, stated that the number involves several thousand Russian military personnel.\n\nArmenian prime minister Nikol Pashinyan and Russian president Vladimir Putin agreed in May this year on the withdrawal of Russian border guards.\n\nRussian presidential spokesperson Dmitry Peskov announced after their meeting that Russian border guards would leave not only Zvartnots but also the Tavush, Syunik, Vayots Dzor, Gegharkunik, and Ararat regions of Armenia. Russian troops had been stationed in these areas since the 44-day war in 2020 at the request of Armenian authorities.\n\n\"Pashinyan stated that due to the changed circumstances, there is no longer a need for their presence, and president Putin agreed. The withdrawal of our military and border guards was coordinated. Again, at the request of the Armenian side, our border guards will remain on the Armenian-Turkish and Armenian-Iranian borders,\" said Peskov.\n\nFrom now on, the duty at Zvartnots Airport is handled by Armenian border guards. As previously stated by Pashinyan, the Armenian Border Service has the necessary experience and skills to carry out border control independently.\n\nOn July 31, Russian FSB representatives handed over border security responsibilities to Armenian border guards. The protocol for the transfer of duties was signed by Edgar Unanyan, the head of the Armenian Border Troops, and Roman Golubitsky, the head of the FSB Border Control in Armenia.\n\nThe question of whether Russian troops will leave Armenia was discussed before and continues after the announcement from the National Security Service (NSS). Political analyst Areg Kochinyan suggested that Russia might redeploy the contingent from the airport to the Ukrainian front.\n\nIn any case, the expert community in Armenia views the withdrawal of Russian border guards from Zvartnots Airport positively.

I believe it was in early July. They vacated their position, and now our border guards are stationed there,\" Harutiunian said.\n\nFor over 30 years, the Azerbaijani side has controlled about 900 hectares of land belonging to Berkaber. It was decided that this area would not be demarcated during the process that took place in April and May.\n\nThe government released a map in April highlighting the sections where adjustments would be made, and the Azerbaijani military remained at one such section after the completion of the demarcation.\n\nIt had been agreed that \"within a short but reasonable period of time,\" Armenia and Azerbaijan would withdraw their forces and allow the deployment of border guards.\n\nResidents of Berkaber have reported hearing explosions near their village and assumed they were caused by Armenian sappers working in the area.\n\nThe Armenian Defense Ministry said earlier that controlled explosions would take place on August 7 near Berkaber and Kirants, another village where the border demarcation took place, and advised local residents not to panic. It said there would be a total of 10 explosions to the northeast of the villages but did not specify their purpose.\n\nHarutiunian told RFE/RL that the area from which the Azerbaijani military had been withdrawn might be undergoing demining.\n\n\"They left one post, but that gap is quite extensive and is currently being cleared,\" Harutiunian said.\n\nResidents of Kirants, however, informed RFE/RL that the explosions near their village appeared to be part of some engineering work.\n\nArmenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinian faced intense criticism earlier this year for agreeing to the first-ever border demarcation between Armenia and Azerbaijan, which involved a limited section. This demarcation resulted in Armenia ceding control of the four villages as well as certain territories of Armenian villages based on 1970s maps used in the process.\n\nThe move sparked large-scale protests in Yerevan, with opposition groups also arguing that Armenia would be more vulnerable in the Tavush region if another war with Azerbaijan occurred, given that Armenian armed forces had to withdraw from strategically important areas.\n\nPashinian has dismissed this criticism, contending that the alternative to the border demarcation would have been another war for which Azerbaijan would have had a legitimate pretext.

With recent developments, including the withdrawal of Russian border guards from Yerevan's Zvartnots airport, the country has become a hotbed for foreign intelligence activities, while its own intelligence apparatus appears either sidelined or caught in the crossfire.\n\nArmenia's geopolitical landscape has been in flux, especially since 2018, when Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan began distancing his country from Russia's grip. Over three decades, Russian forces had controlled Armenia's borders, including key points such as Zvartnots airport. However, the recent withdrawal of Russian border guards after 32 years marks a significant shift in Armenia's foreign policy -one that aligns it more closely with Western powers.\n\nPashinyan's government has been resolute in its efforts to reduce Moscow's influence. This shift is not only symbolic but also practical, as Armenia's newfound alignment with the West has opened the door to a surge in foreign intelligence activities within its borders. The withdrawal of Russian forces from Zvartnots is just the beginning of a broader transition that has profound implications for Armenia's national security.\n\nAs Armenia drifts away from Russia, the vacuum left behind is being rapidly filled by Western intelligence agencies, particularly from the United States, the European Union, and France. These agencies are keen to gather intelligence on regional dynamics, especially concerning Iran's activities in the South Caucasus and beyond. In this context, Armenia has unwittingly become an outpost for Western powers, which are now deeply entrenched in the country.\n\nRussia, however, is not willing to relinquish its influence over Armenia without a fight. Despite the withdrawal of its border guards, Moscow's intelligence agencies remain active within the country. Russian special services have established strong bases across Armenia, enabling them to continue monitoring Western activities. This has set the stage for a clandestine battle between Russian and Western intelligence services, with Armenia caught in the middle.\n\nArmenia's own intelligence apparatus appears to be playing a dubious role in this complex scenario. Many Armenian intelligence officers are products of the Russian school of intelligence, which raises questions about their loyalties. Are they still aligned with Moscow, or have they shifted their allegiance to the West? Or perhaps they are attempting to navigate a perilous path between the two?\n\nReports are suggesting that the Pashinyan government has given strict instructions to the Armenian Security Service to stay out of Western intelligence operations in the country. If true, this would indicate a tacit acceptance by Yerevan of the intelligence war being waged on its soil, where Armenia's own intelligence plays little to no role. This situation would be unthinkable in any other sovereign state, but Armenia's precarious position has forced it into a corner where it must merely observe rather than act.\n\nArmenia's shift towards the West and the increasing presence of Western intelligence agencies in the country are not without risks. The West, particularly the United States and the European Union, is pressuring Armenia to sever its ties with Russia. This demand for a clear-cut alignment leaves Yerevan with little room for maneuvering. Pashinyan's government is being pushed to implement these demands swiftly, with no chance to retreat.\n\nHowever, the West's strategy regarding Armenia seems more about using the country as a pawn against Russia than genuinely supporting its sovereignty. Western powers are well aware that completely severing Armenia from Russia's influence is a near-impossible task, at least for the foreseeable future. Instead, they appear content to leverage Armenia as a geopolitical tool in their broader conflict with Moscow.\n\nArmenia's reliance on Russia spans all sectors, from military to economic. Moscow retains the capability to cripple Armenia's economy quickly through various means, including economic and commercial manoeuvres. The Kremlin holds the levers that could trigger an internal crisis in Armenia at any moment, and these factors can be employed whenever Moscow deems necessary.\n\nDespite the dangers, Pashinyan's government continues to distance Armenia from Russia in favor of closer ties with the West. This strategy is fraught with peril, as it risks isolating Armenia from its traditional protector without securing a guaranteed alternative. The removal of Russian border guards from Zvartnots airport was met with satisfaction in Western capitals, but it also means that Russia has lost a crucial channel for gathering intelligence on Western activities in Armenia.\n\nWith the withdrawal of Russian forces from strategic points like Zvartnots, Western intelligence agencies now have more freedom to operate in Armenia without Russian oversight. However, this newfound freedom is likely to escalate tensions between foreign intelligence services. Reports suggest that the conflict between Russian and Western intelligence agencies has already begun to heat up in Armenia. The situation is so volatile that a full-blown intelligence war could erupt on Armenian soil.\n\nArmenia, unable to intervene, will have to watch this conflict unfold from the sidelines. The Pashinyan government, constrained by its commitments to the West, cannot afford to disrupt the activities of Western intelligence, even if it wanted to. As a result, Armenia risks becoming a battlefield for foreign powers, with little control over its own fate.\n\nThe presence of competing foreign intelligence agencies in Armenia could lead to significant internal instability. The delicate balance that the Pashinyan government is trying to maintain between distancing Armenia from Russia and appeasing the West may soon collapse under the weight of these external pressures. As the intelligence war intensifies, Armenia could descend into chaos, with its sovereignty further eroded by the very powers it is trying to align with.\n\nIn conclusion, Armenia's geopolitical shift from Russia to the West has turned it into a battleground for foreign intelligence services. The withdrawal of Russian border guards from Zvartnots airport is a symbolic and practical shift that has opened the door to a new phase of intelligence operations in the country. However, Armenia's own intelligence services are either sidelined or compromised, leaving the country vulnerable to external manipulation. As the situation develops, Armenia may find itself at the mercy of foreign powers, with little agency in determining its own future.", "source": {"uri": "eurasiareview.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Eurasia Review"}, "authors": [{"uri": "fuad_muxtar_agbabali@eurasiareview.com", "name": "Fuad Muxtar-Agbabali", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Pashinyan_government", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Second Pashinyan government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Service_of_the_Federal_Security_Service_of_the_Russian_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Border Service of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zvartnots_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Zvartnots International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Intelligence agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Western world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yerevan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Yerevan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Yerevan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Armenia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Armenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Armenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcaucasia", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Transcaucasia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikol_Pashinyan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nikol Pashinyan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_policy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Foreign policy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Service_(Armenia)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Security Service (Armenia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MI5", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "MI5"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sovereign state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Kremlin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Moscow Kremlin"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereignty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sovereignty"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://www.eurasiareview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/a-141.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795760", "eventUri": "eng-9795760", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.411764705882353, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

I believe it was in early July. They vacated their position, and now our border guards are stationed there,\" Harutiunian said.\n\nFor over 30 years, the Azerbaijani side has controlled about 900 hectares of land belonging to Berkaber. It was decided that this area, which stretches from a local reservoir to a hill called Paytasar, would not be demarcated during the process that took place in April and May.\n\nThe government released a map in April highlighting the sections where adjustments would be made at this stage, and the Azerbaijani military remained at one such section after the completion of the demarcation.\n\nIt had been agreed that \"within a short but reasonable period of time,\" Armenia and Azerbaijan would withdraw their forces and allow the deployment of border guards.\n\nResidents of Berkaber have reported hearing explosions near their village, assuming they were caused by Armenian sappers working in the area.\n\nEarlier, the Armenian Ministry of Defense announced that controlled explosions would take place on August 7 near Berkaber and Kirants, another village where the border demarcation took place, and advised that local residents should not panic. It said that a total of 10 explosions would be made to the northeast of the villages, but did not specify their purpose.\n\nSpeaking to RFE/RL's Armenian Service, the mayor of Berkaber assumed that the area from which the Azerbaijani military post had been withdrawn might be undergoing demining.\n\n\"They left one post, but that gap is quite extensive and is currently being cleared,\" Harutiunian said.\n\nResidents of Kirants, however, informed RFE/RL's Armenian Service that the explosions near their village appeared to be part of some engineering work.\n\nArmenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinian faced intense criticism earlier this year for agreeing to the first-ever border demarcation between Armenia and Azerbaijan, which involved a limited section. This demarcation resulted in Armenia ceding control of four villages that had previously been part of Soviet Azerbaijan, as well as certain territories of Armenian villages, based on 1970s maps used in the process.\n\nThe move sparked large-scale protests in Yerevan, with opposition groups also arguing that Armenia would be more vulnerable in the Tavush region if another war with Azerbaijan occurred, given that Armenian armed forces had to withdraw from strategically important areas.\n\nPashinian has dismissed this criticism, contending that the alternative to the border demarcation would have been another war, for which Azerbaijan would have had a legitimate pretext.

The presence of a US representative in the Armenian army, US-Armenia military exercises, and the arrival of US military aircraft at Armenia's Zvartnots Airport following the departure of Russian border guards raise interest. Russia, however, remains silent about Armenia's growing proximity to the US after defending it for years.\n\nWhat Awaits the South Caucasus?\n\nCommenting on the issue for Azernews, military journalist Sakhavat Mammad said that Armenia had been operating under Russian directives for many years.\n\n\"Previously, the state of Armenia was considered a vassal of Russia. It was dependent on Russia politically, economically, and militarily, and even structured its activities based on instructions from Russia,\" he said.\n\nMammad highlighted the political changes in Armenia following Nikol Pashinyan's rise to power.\n\n\"Since Pashinyan came to power, there has been a noticeable shift towards the West in Armenia. This was followed by the 44-day war. During this time, Armenia was expecting special support from Russia. When Russian soldiers did not defend the Armenians, Yerevan began to take steps to distance itself from Russia. Politically, Armenia has almost completely severed ties with Russia. It is also nearly separated militarily. Only in economic terms does Armenia still depend on Russia,\" he stated.\n\nThe expert drew attention to Armenia's growing ties with the West. He said that Armenia wants to upgrade its army with France's support. However, according to the journalist, the US seems dominant.\n\n\"But I believe this was not just France but specifically the US. France is just more prominent. The modernization and formation of the Armenian army are being carried out almost jointly by the US and France. The issue of removing Russian border guards from Zvartnots Airport has been on the agenda for a long time. Russia had stated that they would leave the area when the contract expired. The departure of Russian forces from this area naturally means that the US is filling the void left by Russia,\" he said.\n\nSakhavat Mammad added that Moscow is currently only monitoring the situation given Moscow's lack of reaction to the processes.\n\n\"Russia is not actually silent about the actions of the US and Armenia. Moscow is just preoccupied with many directions. The Russia-Ukraine war continues, but processes in the Middle East are also capturing Russia's attention as it is actively involved there. Even if it is not visible, we know that, for example, Russia is reported to be the party supplying missiles to the Houthis. It is clear that Russian intelligence services have played a significant role in initiating and continuing these processes,\" he noted.\n\nThe expert also explained the importance of Azerbaijan's presence in the region.\n\n\"Conversely, Azerbaijan's presence in the region compels Russia to behave somewhat cautiously. There is no peace treaty between Azerbaijan and Armenia, meaning that problems between the two countries continue. Therefore, Russia is somewhat restrained in this direction. However, this does not mean that Russia will always behave this way and that this process will continue indefinitely,\" he said.\n\nThe military expert stated that Armenia has shifted from Russian patronage to the protection of other countries.\n\n\"American troops are being stationed in Zangazur, with exercises and other activities taking place. But it should be noted that a Russian military base still exists in Armenia. It is expected that soon there will be protests and actions demanding the removal of the Russian military base from Armenia. However, nothing has changed. Armenia remains a vassal state, only now it is a vassal of the US and France rather than Russia,\" he concluded.\n\nThe expert also made some predictions about the potential threats posed by external elements in the region.\n\n\"The strengthening of the US and France in the region will create serious problems in the South Caucasus. The arming of Armenia and the gathering of foreign elements in the South Caucasus will not go unnoticed by regional states. It seems they want to stir up processes in the region and are doing so through Armenia.\n\nLike the rest of the world, the South Caucasus is in a state of preparation for war. On the one hand, Iran and Israel are preparing for war, on the other hand, Armenia is arming itself, meaning the region is undergoing rapid militarization and is turning into a militarized zone. All of this is leading towards a new war.\n\nIf no agreements are reached, the region could fall into turmoil again, and the likelihood of clashes is extremely high.\"", "source": {"uri": "azernews.az", "dataType": "news", "title": "AzerNews"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Armenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Armenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Service_of_the_Federal_Security_Service_of_the_Russian_Federation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Border Service of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zvartnots_International_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Zvartnots International Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_Armenia", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Armed Forces of Armenia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Moscow"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Russia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikol_Pashinyan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nikol Pashinyan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vassal", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Vassal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Vassal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Portugal"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_exercise", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military exercise"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcaucasia", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Transcaucasia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Azerbaijan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Azerbaijan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russo-Ukrainian War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Armed_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Russian Armed Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Middle East"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yerevan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yerevan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Yerevan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Armenia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houthi_movement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houthi movement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vassal_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vassal state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_treaty", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peace treaty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Security_Service", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal Security Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Missile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Israel"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Israel"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Martial_Arts/Russian", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Martial Arts/Russian", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.azernews.az/media/2024/08/08/untitled_design_9.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795760", "eventUri": "eng-9795760", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

Sabotage groups of the armed forces of Armenia took advantage of the difficult mountainous terrain of the area and adverse weather conditions, and attempted to plant landmines in the areas between the positions of units of Azerbaijan Army and on their supply routes.\n\nAzerbaijani army positions were subjected to intensive shelling by the Armenian armed formations from various types of weapons, including mortars and artillery, as a result of which there were casualties among the personnel of the Azerbaijani Armed Forces and damage was inflicted on military infrastructure.\n\nFrom 9:00 am today, 13 September, agreement was reached on a ceasefire brokered by International partners. Azerbaijan has stated that it expects that Armenia will respect its obligations and will not escalate the situation by committing new attacks.\n\nThe large-scale Armenian military provocation that took place on the undefined state border is not an isolated case, according to Azerbaijan which claims the this is just part of the chain of military and political provocations committed by Armenia over recent days. They say that the ceasefire has been frequently violated by Armenia against both Azerbaijani military outposts, and civilian operations.\n\nArmenia continues to plant anti-personnel mines in the territories of Azerbaijan on a large scale..As a result of the Azerbaijani demining activity conducted since 15 August, more than 1300 anti-personnel mines have been discovered in the territory of Lachin district, alone.\n\nAlthough Armenia stated that its military would be withdrawn from the territory of Azerbaijan by September 2022, this has not yet happened. There is clearly no sincerity to engage in the normalisation of relations between the two states, nor to implement the previously reached agreements. The proposals of the Azerbaijani side to start concrete negotiations on the peace treaty have not been reciprocated. Armenia appears to be acting in a destructive and openly hostile manner\n\nIt looks as though Armenia, by resorting to large-scale military provocations on the undefined state border with Azerbaijan, aims to involve third parties and expand the geopolitical impact of the tension, thereby avoiding any peace talks.

Hraparak recently reported that two incidents took place after Azerbaijani troops claimed that a newly-constructed Armenian road passes through Azerbaijani territory. After a bridge leading to Kirants village along a critical highway that connects Armenia to Georgia was ceded to Azerbaijan in May, Armenia began construction of an alternative road. Armenia's National Security Service has said that \"the road under construction passes entirely through the territory of Armenia.\" Speaking with RFE/RL's Armenian Service, a local resident confirmed that the altercation did take place.\n\nArmenian police have been accused of beating and pepper spraying an Artsakh resident while detaining him for a parking violation. Lawyer Roman Yeritsyan claimed that his brother Aram sustained a broken hand and head injuries. In police bodycam footage shared by Roman, Aram is heard agreeing to go with the police but refusing to be handcuffed, leading to his violent detention. \"The reason for hiding the video recording is that it clearly shows what kind of insults are uttered against my brother and all the people of Artsakh,\" Roman said. Armenia's Investigative Committee stated that Aram was arrested for \"acting suspiciously,\" but has opened a criminal proceeding into the police's conduct.\n\nGeorgia\n\nMany sectors of Georgia's economy are well positioned to increase their exports to Europe, according to a new study by the United Nations and European Union. \"Georgia's Economy Sectors with High Growth and Export Potential\" found that the wine and beverage industry has the greatest potential for export competitiveness. The transportation, telecommunications, textiles, mining and metals sectors also performed well in the study. The main challenges to export growth include obtaining the necessary certifications and meeting EU quality and standards requirements, as well as limited production capacity and access to capital. The report comes amid the Georgian government's recent pivot away from the West, while public sentiment in the country is strongly in favor of integration with Western institutions.\n\nTurkey", "source": {"uri": "armenianweekly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Armenian Weekly"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lillian_avedian@armenianweekly.com", "name": "Lillian Avedian", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Azerbaijan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Azerbaijan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenia", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Armenia"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Armenia"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aram,_son_of_Shem", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Aram, son of Shem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirants,_Armenia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kirants, Armenia"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Artsakh", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republic of Artsakh"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Service_(Armenia)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Security Service (Armenia)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tavush_Province", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tavush Province"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tavush Province"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Armenia"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(country)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (country)"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (country)"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_of_Armenia", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Police of Armenia"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepper_spray", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pepper spray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Free_Europe/Radio_Liberty", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Radio Liberty"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Telecommunications"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Textile"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "European Union"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mining"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Turkey"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial_Disputes", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Territorial Disputes", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 77}], "image": "https://armenianweekly.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-07-at-12.42.39-PM-1024x542.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795760", "eventUri": "eng-9795760", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

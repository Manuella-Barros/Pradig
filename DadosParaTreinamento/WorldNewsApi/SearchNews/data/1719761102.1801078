One-Star Romance by Laura Hankin, out this June from Berkley, is a wedding run-in story for the digital age. When the chaotic and artsy Natalie meets the cranky, rigid academic Rob, they initially have nothing in common except their love for their respective best friends. And when those BFFs announce they're getting married, Rob and Nat realize they may not have the worst time as best man and maid of honor thanks to the little sparks that flutter between them at first. But that's before Nat finds out Rob posted a one-star review of her new novel. And before Rob can tell Nat the heartfelt reason why he did. Over the years that follow, Rob and Natalie find themselves thrown together for all of their friends' life milestones, triumphs, failures and everything in between. As time goes on, do their feelings for each other soften? We've got an exclusive excerpt below, to help pique your interest. At the store, Nat and Rob loaded pallets of bottled water into a cart with silent efficiency. \u201cI\u2019ll look for umbrellas,\u201d Nat said, terse. \u201cI\u2019ll find fans,\u201d Rob said with a grunt. On her way to meet back up with Rob, having cleaned out the umbrella section, Natalie passed the books aisle. She couldn\u2019t stop herself. A siren song called her to check for her own. It wouldn\u2019t be here \u2014 this was a small selection, made up mostly of bestsellers and mass\u2011market paperbacks \u2014 but still, there was a chance, and how nice and validating that would feel. Clutching her armful of umbrellas, she scanned the shelves, looking past what felt like a million copies of The Girl on the Train, All the Light We Cannot See and Refractions, that sophomore effort from Young Male Intellectual that had gotten breathless reviews in every newspaper of note, that nobody except Nat and f---ing Addison K seemed to think was overrated. But not a single copy of Apartment 2F. Of course not. Because it was a one\u2011star book. She felt her chest deflating. She\u2019d put her whole self into this novel, all the most interesting thoughts she\u2019d ever had, and if that wasn\u2019t enough... Stop that! she told herself. Don\u2019t let this random stranger destroy your sense of self. Then, But maybe strangers are the only ones whose opinions you should trust\u2014 Rob wheeled the cart up to her, now crammed with boxes of battery\u2011operated fans. \u201cWe should get going,\u201d he said. \u201cRight.\u201d She shook herself out of her funk. His eyes briefly landed on the Refractions display, and he made that scoff\u2011like noise that seemed more natural to him than laughter.

Then, after a brief pause, \u201cThat\u2019s one of the most pretentious books I\u2019ve ever read.\u201d \u201cYes, thank you! I could barely get through it. And whenever I hear anyone else talk about it, I feel like I\u2019m living in an alternate reality!\u201d He shrugged, a flush coming over his face, then turned the cart toward checkout. As Rob began to bag up their items and the cashier told them their total, Natalie pulled out her wallet. \u201cOkay, can we put the $80 on the debit card here, then the remainder on this credit card? Oh, but if the remainder is over a hundred, actually, I should put the last bit on a different card instead.\u201d She fumbled around in the mass of cards and receipts. \u201cHold on, I have it in here somewhere.\u201d \u201cStop,\u201d Rob said. \u201cJust put it on mine.\u201d He took his wallet from his back pocket, pulled out a card, and handed it to her as he continued to bag their umbrellas. She glanced down at the card as she passed it over to the cashier. Simple, black, with his name printed on it: Robert Addison Kapinsky. ROBERT. ADDISON. KAPINSKY. She froze with the card still in her hand, the cashier reaching out to give it a tug. She was barely aware of letting go; her mind began to spin. The PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here! How quickly can you solve it? Play now! Addison was not the most common name in the world. That opinion about Refractions was not the most common opinion. And not that many strangers had heard of her book. It made sense that Rob would use his middle name and no profile picture for something like a Goodreads account \u2014 he was a private person who didn\u2019t even have social media. It was him. It had to be. She thought back to the timing. He\u2019d submitted the rating shortly after their strange encounter at the rehearsal dinner. She looked at him as he continued to bag, a great rage rising up in her. What the actual hell? This was a mistake. It had to be. Right? Because people were allowed to rate books any way they wanted. Of course they were! But polite society dictated that you didn\u2019t savage a book by someone you knew. Unless you knew them because they were your nemesis or your high school bully or had stolen your dog. But when you were maid of honor and best man at a wedding together? When you would literally have to walk down an aisle arm in arm while people watched and took pictures? It was the height of incivility! (\u201cThe height of incivility\u201d? Who did she think she was, a Jane Austen heroine?) Fine then, rude. Not only rude but idiotic, showing a startling ignorance of how people should treat one another. But then again, this man hadn\u2019t shown himself to be a model of social grace up until this point. She followed him back to the car in stunned silence. Maybe this was why he\u2019d been so brusque with her at the dinner. Her work had been so bad, had created such offense to his taste, that he didn\u2019t even want to look her in the eyes. No. She refused to let this man steal her pride in all that she\u2019d done. What had he ever done? (Most of a PhD, apparently. But that was different!) Cold, pretentious Robert Kapinsky did not get to decide her value as a person. The Fiona Apple album started up again automatically when he turned the car on. So, Rob thought that some women were allowed to express their feelings in art. What would he rate this album? He left it on this time, apparently thinking that they wouldn\u2019t have much to say to each other, but she pressed pause. Being extremely pleasant wasn\u2019t enough anymore. She would kill him with kindness. Yes, she would absolutely murder him. She made her smile so full and enthusiastic that she could feel crow\u2019s feet forming as a result. \u201cRobert,\u201d she said, \u201cyou didn\u2019t ask me what I\u2019ve been up to for the past two years.\u201d A moment of silence, then he forced the words out. \u201cWhat have you been up to?\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d She waved a casual hand through the air, her tone light. \u201cI published a novel.\u201d \u201cYour DIY graduate school worked out for you, then.\u201d \u201cThank you, yes. I\u2019m proud of the book.\u201d She beamed at him, even if the beam didn\u2019t reach her eyes. \u201cAnd it\u2019s doing well. By and large, people really seem to love it. Especially the people whose opinions I respect, so that\u2019s nice, you know?\u201d The more she talked about it, the tighter his hands clenched on the steering wheel. If she kept talking, perhaps he\u2019d leave dents in the leather. That, or his knuckles would explode. The prospect held a certain appeal. It was almost fun, almost delicious, to see the discomfort she was causing him. Almost. He pressed down on the gas, finally going that 10 miles per hour over the speed limit that she\u2019d been wanting. \u201cWell, congratulations,\u201d he said, then turned the music up as they sped back to the wedding. Natalie sat back, staring straight ahead. Let him give her life\u2019s work one star. She couldn\u2019t care less. He could have whatever opinion about her book that he wanted and share that opinion with whomever. For instance, he could tell his mother. He could tell strangers on the street. He could even tell Satan, because Robert Kapinsky could go to hell.

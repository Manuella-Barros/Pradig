He was aged 51.\n\nUntil his demise, the Oyo legislator was a dedicated public servant known for his unwavering commitment to the development of his constituency and the country at large.

He built friendships by being intentional about reaching out and sending goodwill messages to all colleagues at special occasions, fostering camaraderie and unity within the House.\n\nAs a ranking member, Rep.

Olaide Akinremi otherwise known as 'Jagaban', has arrived Ibadan, the Oyo State capital for burial.\n\nThe burial of the lawmaker takes place at Temidire Estate, Tipper Garage, Ologuneru, Ibadan.\n\n'Jagaban', an All Progressives Congress, (APC) lawmaker died in Abuja on Wednesday morning after brief illness.\n\nThe 51-year-old was representing Ibadan North federal constituency for the second term where he was elected in 2019 and reelected in 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, Oyo State governor, Seyi Makinde has expressed shock over the death of the lawmaker.\n\nThe governor, who described the death as shocking and unexpected, said Akinremi was a lawmaker one could vouch for as having the interest of the development of Oyo State and Nigeria.\n\nMakinde stated this at the Ibadan Airport, where he also met with the House of Representatives delegation on the death of the lawmaker.\n\nHe prayed to God to grant his family and the state, the strength to bear the sad loss.\n\nHe said, \"It is unexpected. He was actually one of the representatives of Oyo State in Abuja that you could vouch for his interest for the development of this state.\n\n\"We were constantly talking, though we belong to different political party affiliations.\n\n\"I can only pray for the family for strength and for all of us to be able to bear this loss.\"\n\nMember representing Ibarapa North/Ibarapa Central, Dr. Anthony Adepoju, who spoke alongside Governor Makinde, said Akinremi's death marked a sad day for Ibadan, Oyo State and Nigeria.\n\nHe declared that the deceased lawmaker did well for himself, his community and the nation.\n\n\"It is a very sad day for Ibadan and for Oyo State as well as for Nigeria as a whole. We have lost a very hardworking representative; someone who believes so much in the unity of this country.\n\n\"He was someone, who, by his actions, has not only done well just for himself, family and community but the entire nation.\n\n\"He was someone who has been a mentor to a whole lot of people in the National Assembly. It's a very painful and dark day for Nigeria.\n\n\"What we need at this point is to pray for the repose of his soul and we will definitely miss him dearly. It's a very great loss. You could see that everyone is around here at the airport waiting to receive his body. The Speaker of the House of Representatives has sent a powerful delegation.\n\n\"We have many honourable members here to honour him to pay our last respect to him. We pray that things like this should be far from us.\n\n\"The lesson learnt from this event is that we should learn how to be our brother's keepers. Apart from that, we should take our health very importantly.\"\n\nSimilarly, a ranking Member of the House of Representatives from Imo State, Princess Miriam Odinaka Onuoha, described Akinremi's death as painful and unfortunate.\n\nDescribing him as a patriotic and quality legislator, she said: \"It is unfortunate and really painful for us in the House of Representatives. It is unfortunate and painful for us. I met with Prince in the 9th Assembly and he was fun to work with.\n\n\"He was a patriotic and quality legislator par excellence. He made noticeable effort to bring noticeable dividends of democracy to his people.\"", "source": {"uri": "leadership.ng", "dataType": "news", "title": "Leadership"}, "authors": [{"uri": "adebayo_waheed@leadership.ng", "name": "Adebayo Waheed", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibadan_North", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ibadan North"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ibadan North"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Progressives_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "All Progressives Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibadan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ibadan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ibadan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oyo_State", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Oyo State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Oyo State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuja", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Abuja"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seyi_Makinde", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seyi Makinde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibarapa_Central", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ibarapa Central"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ibarapa Central"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibarapa_North", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ibarapa North"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ibarapa North"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibadan_Airport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ibadan Airport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Representatives_(Nigeria)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "House of Representatives (Nigeria)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Representatives_(Netherlands)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "House of Representatives (Netherlands)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Assembly_(France)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Assembly (France)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imo_State", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Imo State"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Imo State"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Nigeria"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Prophecies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Paranormal/Prophecies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://leadership.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/adebayo-jagaban.jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9720923", "eventUri": "eng-9720923", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2313725490196078, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

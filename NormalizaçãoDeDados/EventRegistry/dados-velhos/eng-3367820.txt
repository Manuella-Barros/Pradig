(AP) Von Miller had some pretty good flashbacks when he arrived at Levi's Stadium for the first time since winning the Super Bowl MVP here just over 18 months ago.\n\nThe stakes were far lower for a joint practice between his Denver Broncos and the San Francisco 49ers than they were for that Super Bowl win over Cam Newton and Carolina in February 2016 but that didn't stop the memories.\n\n\"Walking onto the field this morning, it's a whole lot different,\" Miller said. \"It's a lot more red than what it was last time. Before it was just gold and black and a whole bunch of white, all the Super Bowl stuff. It still had the same feel. San Francisco has always been good to me. The Bay Area has always been good to us. Throughout my whole career I've only lost one game here. Preseason, the Oakland Raiders, the San Francisco 49ers, I've only lost one game here. A lot of great memories for me, as a team and as an organization.\"\n\nThis week also offered Miller a chance for a reunion with mentor Elvis Dumervil, who helped teach Miller the ways of the NFL during his first two seasons as a pro in 2011-12.\n\nThe two have remained close ever since, seeing each other in the offseason and training together at times and Miller still credits Dumervil for teaching him how to be a leader and an elite pass rusher.\n\n\"I feel like he is one of my blood brothers,\" Dumervil said. \"He took me in when I was young and basically showed me the whole script of bringing young guys in and showing them the ropes. That's where I learned it from. ... It's great to get Gloom and Doom back on the same field. It's a blessing.\"\n\nThe Niners and Broncos held the first of two straight joint practices before playing an exhibition game here Saturday night. The players were on their best behavior for day one with only one skirmish coming after San Francisco rookie safety Adrian Colbert delivered a hard hit on Denver tight end Steven Scheu after a catch over the middle early in practice.\n\nNiners general manager John Lynch and Broncos coach Vance Joseph helped break it up and San Francisco pulled Colbert for a bit to calm things down as Lynch talked to Joseph and Denver counterpart John Elway.\n\n\"Both coaches handled their teams really well,\" Lynch said. \"We had one little scuffle but I've never seen one of these joint practices where you haven't. I thought it was very professional on both sides. Really productive work. We were thrilled with it.\"\n\nLynch said he likes the dynamic of a joint practice, saying it heightens intensity and gives both teams the chance to work against different looks after getting so used to their own offense and defense during camp that both sides know each other's plays.\n\nLynch said he'd like to do even more of these, possibly next summer, once the team has coach Kyle Shanahan's systems completely installed.\n\n\"You're going up with something that's not scripted,\" Lynch said. \"It's completely unscripted. You don't know everything they're doing. It's true competition. It's really as close to a game as possible.\"\n\nCompeting against an unfamiliar defense was a good test for Denver second-year quarterback Paxton Lynch, who is competing with Trevor Siemian for the starting role.\n\nSiemian started the exhibition opener last week against Chicago and Lynch will get the chance this week. Lynch also got the bulk of the work with the first-team offense in practice and had an up-and-down performance.\n\n\"It's pretty different going against a team like them for the first time this week and seeing some looks you haven't seen from your guys, a little different looks,\" Lynch said. \"You go through it and you go after practice and watch the tape of it and get a better understanding.\"\n\nNOTES: John Lynch said he believes players have the right to protest the national anthem but he doesn't believe in it. San Francisco had several players, including former quarterback Colin Kaepernick, protest last year but everyone stood in the first exhibition game this season. \"Personally when I see that, I think that's divisive,\" Lynch said. \"And I understand guys see things and they're not happy. They have that right. And I think we'll always respect people's rights. That doesn't mean I believe that.\" ... 49ers LB Donavin Newsom, who was hospitalized last week with a concussion from a hard hit in practice, has been waived with an injury designation and will be placed on injured reserve once he clears waivers. ...

(AP) -- Von Miller had some pretty good flashbacks when he arrived at Levi's Stadium for the first time since winning the Super Bowl MVP here just over 18 months ago.\n\nThe stakes were far lower for a joint practice between his Denver Broncos and the San Francisco 49ers than they were for that Super Bowl win over Cam Newton and Carolina in February 2016 but that didn't stop the memories.\n\n\"Walking onto the field this morning, it's a whole lot different,\" Miller said. \"It's a lot more red than what it was last time. Before it was just gold and black and a whole bunch of white, all the Super Bowl stuff. It still had the same feel. San Francisco has always been good to me. The Bay Area has always been good to us. Throughout my whole career I've only lost one game here. Preseason, the Oakland Raiders, the San Francisco 49ers, I've only lost one game here. A lot of great memories for me, as a team and as an organization.\"\n\nThis week also offered Miller a chance for a reunion with mentor Elvis Dumervil, who helped teach Miller the ways of the NFL during his first two seasons as a pro in 2011-12.\n\nThe two have remained close ever since, seeing each other in the offseason and training together at times and Miller still credits Dumervil for teaching him how to be a leader and an elite pass rusher.\n\n\"I feel like he is one of my blood brothers,\" Dumervil said. \"He took me in when I was young and basically showed me the whole script of bringing young guys in and showing them the ropes. That's where I learned it from. ... It's great to get Gloom and Doom back on the same field. It's a blessing.\"\n\nThe Niners and Broncos held the first of two straight joint practices before playing an exhibition game here Saturday night. The players were on their best behavior for day one with only one skirmish coming after San Francisco rookie safety Adrian Colbert delivered a hard hit on Denver tight end Steven Scheu after a catch over the middle early in practice.\n\nNiners general manager John Lynch and Broncos coach Vance Joseph helped break it up and San Francisco pulled Colbert for a bit to calm things down as Lynch talked to Joseph and Denver counterpart John Elway.\n\n\"Both coaches handled their teams really well,\" Lynch said. \"We had one little scuffle but I've never seen one of these joint practices where you haven't. I thought it was very professional on both sides. Really productive work. We were thrilled with it.\"\n\nLynch said he likes the dynamic of a joint practice, saying it heightens intensity and gives both teams the chance to work against different looks after getting so used to their own offense and defense during camp that both sides know each other's plays.\n\nLynch said he'd like to do even more of these, possibly next summer, once the team has coach Kyle Shanahan's systems completely installed.\n\n\"You're going up with something that's not scripted,\" Lynch said. \"It's completely unscripted. You don't know everything they're doing. It's true competition. It's really as close to a game as possible.\"\n\nCompeting against an unfamiliar defense was a good test for Denver second-year quarterback Paxton Lynch, who is competing with Trevor Siemian for the starting role.\n\nSiemian started the exhibition opener last week against Chicago and Lynch will get the chance this week. Lynch also got the bulk of the work with the first-team offense in practice and had an up-and-down performance.\n\n\"It's pretty different going against a team like them for the first time this week and seeing some looks you haven't seen from your guys, a little different looks,\" Lynch said. \"You go through it and you go after practice and watch the tape of it and get a better understanding.\"\n\nNOTES: John Lynch said he believes players have the right to protest the national anthem but he doesn't believe in it. San Francisco had several players, including former quarterback Colin Kaepernick, protest last year but everyone stood in the first exhibition game this season. \"Personally when I see that, I think that's divisive,\" Lynch said. \"And I understand guys see things and they're not happy.

(AP) -- Von Miller had some pretty good flashbacks when he arrived at Levi's Stadium for the first time since winning the Super Bowl MVP here just over 18 months ago.\n\nThe stakes were far lower for a joint practice between his Denver Broncos and the San Francisco 49ers than they were for that Super Bowl win over Cam Newton and Carolina in February 2016 but that didn't stop the memories.\n\n\"Walking onto the field this morning, it's a whole lot different,\" Miller said. \"It's a lot more red than what it was last time. Before it was just gold and black and a whole bunch of white, all the Super Bowl stuff. It still had the same feel. San Francisco has always been good to me. The Bay Area has always been good to us. Throughout my whole career I've only lost one game here. Preseason, the Oakland Raiders, the San Francisco 49ers, I've only lost one game here. A lot of great memories for me, as a team and as an organization.\"\n\nThis week also offered Miller a chance for a reunion with mentor Elvis Dumervil, who helped teach Miller the ways of the NFL during his first two seasons as a pro in 2011-12.\n\nSponsored Content: How is your agency managing and maximizing its data? Share your opinions in a Federal News Radio survey.\n\nThe two have remained close ever since, seeing each other in the offseason and training together at times and Miller still credits Dumervil for teaching him how to be a leader and an elite pass rusher.\n\n\"I feel like he is one of my blood brothers,\" Dumervil said. \"He took me in when I was young and basically showed me the whole script of bringing young guys in and showing them the ropes. That's where I learned it from. ... It's great to get Gloom and Doom back on the same field. It's a blessing.\"\n\nThe Niners and Broncos held the first of two straight joint practices before playing an exhibition game here Saturday night. The players were on their best behavior for day one with only one skirmish coming after San Francisco rookie safety Adrian Colbert delivered a hard hit on Denver tight end Steven Scheu after a catch over the middle early in practice.\n\nNiners general manager John Lynch and Broncos coach Vance Joseph helped break it up and San Francisco pulled Colbert for a bit to calm things down as Lynch talked to Joseph and Denver counterpart John Elway.\n\n\"Both coaches handled their teams really well,\" Lynch said. \"We had one little scuffle but I've never seen one of these joint practices where you haven't. I thought it was very professional on both sides. Really productive work. We were thrilled with it.\"\n\nLynch said he likes the dynamic of a joint practice, saying it heightens intensity and gives both teams the chance to work against different looks after getting so used to their own offense and defense during camp that both sides know each other's plays.\n\nGSA gives per diem travel rates another bump for 2018\n\nLynch said he'd like to do even more of these, possibly next summer, once the team has coach Kyle Shanahan's systems completely installed.\n\n\"You're going up with something that's not scripted,\" Lynch said. \"It's completely unscripted. You don't know everything they're doing. It's true competition. It's really as close to a game as possible.\"\n\nCompeting against an unfamiliar defense was a good test for Denver second-year quarterback Paxton Lynch, who is competing with Trevor Siemian for the starting role.\n\nSiemian started the exhibition opener last week against Chicago and Lynch will get the chance this week. Lynch also got the bulk of the work with the first-team offense in practice and had an up-and-down performance.\n\n\"It's pretty different going against a team like them for the first time this week and seeing some looks you haven't seen from your guys, a little different looks,\" Lynch said. \"You go through it and you go after practice and watch the tape of it and get a better understanding.\"\n\nNOTES: John Lynch said he believes players have the right to protest the national anthem but he doesn't believe in it. San Francisco had several players, including former quarterback Colin Kaepernick, protest last year but everyone stood in the first exhibition game this season. \"Personally when I see that, I think that's divisive,\" Lynch said. \"And I understand guys see things and they're not happy. They have that right. And I think we'll always respect people's rights. That doesn't mean I believe that.\" ... 49ers LB Donavin Newsom, who was hospitalized last week with a concussion from a hard hit in practice, has been waived with an injury designation and will be placed on injured reserve once he clears waivers. ... Hall of Famer Warren Sapp, a teammate of Lynch's in Tampa Bay, attended practice.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL", "dateTime": "2017-08-16T22:52:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 374, "textStart": 361, "date": "2016-02-", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.8666666746139526, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3367820", "time": "22:52:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3367820", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Clara"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "concepts": [{"id": "206540", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "229192", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "229241", "label": {"eng": "Santa Clara"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Clara,_California", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Clara"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "230018", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "302514", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Blood"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood", "score": 3}, {"id": "304754", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "score": 1}, {"id": "305661", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "National Football League"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League", "score": 3}, {"id": "305872", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "score": 2}, {"id": "309225", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "score": 5}, {"id": "309231", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Von Miller"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Miller", "score": 4}, {"id": "309233", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Cam Newton"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cam_Newton", "score": 3}, {"id": "312020", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Tight end"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tight_end", "score": 3}, {"id": "314214", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Oakland Raiders"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Raiders", "score": 3}, {"id": "315542", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Bay Area"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area", "type": "loc", "location": null, "score": 3}, {"id": "322056", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Denver Broncos"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Broncos", "score": 5}, {"id": "326190", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "General Services Administration"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Services_Administration", "score": 2}, {"id": "331327", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "score": 5}, {"id": "349256", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Levi's Stadium"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi's_Stadium", "score": 4}, {"id": "350359", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "John Elway"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Elway", "score": 2}, {"id": "374950", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Kyle Shanahan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Shanahan", "score": 2}, {"id": "393842", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "score": 4}, {"id": "395519", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Colin Kaepernick"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Kaepernick", "score": 1}, {"id": "401157", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Elvis Dumervil"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Dumervil", "score": 3}, {"id": "1272948", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Paxton Lynch"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxton_Lynch", "score": 2}, {"id": "1283290", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Sponsored Content (South Park)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sponsored_Content_(South_Park)", "score": 3}], "image": "https://federalnewsradio.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Broncos_49ers_Football_76979.jpg", "timeCrawl": "22:52:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Broncos LB Von Miller returns to scene of Super Bowl MVP", "originalArticle": null}

Before it was just gold and black and a whole bunch of white, all the Super Bowl stuff. It still had the same feel. San Francisco has always been good to me. The Bay Area has always been good to us.\n\n\"Throughout my whole career I've only lost one game here. Preseason, the Oakland Raiders, the San Francisco 49ers, I've only lost one game here. A lot of great memories for me, as a team and as an organization.\"\n\nThis week also offered Miller a chance for a reunion with mentor Elvis Dumervil, who helped teach Miller the ways of the NFL during his first two seasons as a pro in 2011-12.\n\nThe two have remained close ever since, seeing each other in the offseason and training together at times and Miller still credits Dumervil for teaching him how to be a leader and an elite pass rusher.\n\n\"I feel like he is one of my blood brothers,\" Miller said. \"He took me in when I was young and basically showed me the whole script of bringing young guys in and showing them the ropes. That's where I learned it from. ... It's great to get Gloom and Doom back on the same field. It's a blessing.\"\n\nThe Niners and Broncos held the first of two straight joint practices before playing an exhibition game here Saturday night. The players were on their best behavior for day one with only one skirmish coming after San Francisco rookie safety Adrian Colbert delivered a hard hit on Denver tight end Steven Scheu after a catch over the middle early in practice.\n\nNiners general manager John Lynch and Broncos coach Vance Joseph helped break it up and San Francisco pulled Colbert for a bit to calm things down as Lynch talked to Joseph and Denver counterpart John Elway.\n\n\"Both coaches handled their teams really well,\" Lynch said. \"We had one little scuffle, but I've never seen one of these joint practices where you haven't. I thought it was very professional on both sides. Really productive work. We were thrilled with it.\"\n\nLynch said he likes the dynamic of a joint practice, saying it heightens intensity and gives both teams the chance to work against different looks after getting so used to their own offense and defense during camp that both sides know each other's plays.\n\nLynch said he'd like to do even more of these, possibly next summer, once the team has coach Kyle Shanahan's systems completely installed.\n\n\"You're going up with something that's not scripted,\" Lynch said. \"It's completely unscripted. You don't know everything they're doing. It's true competition. It's really as close to a game as possible.\"\n\nCompeting against an unfamiliar defense was a good test for Denver second-year quarterback Paxton Lynch, who is competing with Trevor Siemian for the starting role.\n\nSiemian started the exhibition opener last week against Chicago and Lynch will get the chance this week. Lynch also got the bulk of the work with the first-team offense in practice and had an up-and-down performance.\n\n\"It's pretty different going against a team like them for the first time this week and seeing some looks you haven't seen from your guys, a little different looks,\" Lynch said. \"You go through it and you go after practice and watch the tape of it and get a better understanding.\"\n\nNOTES: John Lynch said he believes players have the right to protest the national anthem but he doesn't believe in it. San Francisco had several players, including former quarterback Colin Kaepernick, protest last year but everyone stood in the first exhibition game this season. \"Personally when I see that, I think that's divisive,\" Lynch said. \"And I understand guys see things and they're not happy. They have that right. And I think we'll always respect people's rights. That doesn't mean I believe that.\" ... 49ers LB Donavin Newsom, who was hospitalized last week with a concussion from a hard hit in practice, has been waived with an injury designation and will be placed on injured reserve once he clears waivers. ...

Jerry Rice and Steve Young.\n\n\"Denver, every day, gets to look at John Elway,\" Lynch said. \"And he's a big part of their history. So why not embrace that? It's something we're doing and we're going to continue to do.\"\n\nAmong other topics, Lynch said Rice and Young talked to the players about the unity that existed during their five-Super-Bowl glory days.\n\nAnd he referenced their words when asked how he would respond if a current player decided to protest during the national anthem, as quarterback Colin Kaepernick, safety Eric Reid and linebacker Eli Harold did with the 49ers last year. Reid and Harold, who remain with the team, have said they will stand for the anthem this season.\n\nThe subject remains relevant because Seattle defensive end Michael Bennett sat during the national anthem last week in response to racial unrest that was sparked by white supremacists in Charlottesville, Va.\n\nLynch said he thought such protests could be \"divisive\" but he would \"always be respectful\" of players who took such a stance.\n\nRice and Young \"talked about the 49er way,\" Lynch said. \"I've always thought it's one of the great things about this league. I think it's a great beacon for the rest of culture in terms of the way it should be. You strive for a common goal, and you have unity. I think this game brings people together.\n\n\"So I think, partially, when I see (national anthem protests), I think that's divisive. I understand that guys see things and they're not happy. And they have that right. I think we'll always respect peoples' rights. That doesn't mean I believe that. I believe that this game that should actually be celebrated for what it is. I think it's a tremendous unifier for our country and for the way things should be.\"\n\nThe 49ers, of course, didn't sign Kaepernick after he opted out of the last season of his contract and he remains unsigned, with his protest last year certainly playing a role in his unemployment.\n\nIn February, when the 49ers were weighing their QB options, Lynch was asked if Kaepernick's protest would be a factor in the team's decision-making.\n\n\"It will be a football decision,\" Lynch said. \"But I think there are different layers to that. I think everything will be included in the decision. I'm not talking specifically about his stance, though. When you have a quarterback, the great ones are leaders of men. All those things will be taken into account.\"\n\nInstead of Kaepernick, the 49ers signed Brian Hoyer, 31, and Lynch has been pleasantly surprised by the journeyman's offseason performance. Hoyer has played for six teams in his nine-year career, but he's thrown 25 touchdowns and seven interceptions the past two seasons while posting a 93.7 passer rating.\n\nOn Wednesday, Hoyer continued his impressive training camp by unofficially completing 14 of 20 passes against the Broncos, who ranked fourth in team defense in 2016.\n\n\"We've said from the beginning, we want a franchise quarterback around here,\" Lynch said. \"And a lot of people are making assumptions as to what Brian's role is. Is he a bridge -- is he all those things? Our response to Brian and to everybody is he's got the first crack at being that guy. I love the way he's embracing that opportunity each and every day ... I think he's probably exceeded my expectations for how I thought he could play.\"\n\nThe 49ers and Broncos will have their final joint practice before their preseason game Saturday night at Levi's Stadium. Their extended get-together could also result in a trade prior to the regular season. Lynch acknowledged he'd already had such talks with Elway.\n\n\"This is a great opportunity to do that,\" Lynch said. \"So we did have some of those discussions ...

Lynch called the Broncos a playoff-caliber team, two years removed from winning the Super Bowl next door at Levi's Stadium, even though their quarterback situation has nosedived since Peyton Manning's Lombardi Trophy-winning exit.\n\nHere are the top three things we learned Wednesday:\n\n1. Lynch's take on national anthem protests. A year after Colin Kaepernick sparked a national anthem protest that some players around the league are continuing, the 49ers have skirted any such issue this season, as all players stood in Friday's exhibition.\n\nLynch said no players have approached him about protesting, and if they did, communication is key. He prefers a unified front for team purposes but is respectful to the rights of those compelled to protest -- essentially the same company line the 49ers had last year.\n\nLynch's take: \"I always thought it's one of the great things about this league and, in fact, it's a great beacon for the rest of culture, in terms of it's the way it should be. You strive for a common goal and you have unity. This game brings people together.\"\n\nAnd what of those who sit or kneel? \"That's divisive,\" Lynch responded. \"I understand guys see things and they're not happy. They have that right. We'll always respect people's rights. That doesn't mean I believe that. I believe this should actually be celebrated for what it is, a tremendous unifier for our country and the way things should be.\"\n\n2. Business picking up for 49ers defense. OK, now to the hit heard 'round the practice field. Rookie safety Adrian Colbert drilled Broncos tight end Steen Scheu high near the head and somewhat late.\n\nA small scrum ensued as wide receiver Isaiah McKenzie came to Scheu's defense. Defensive coordinator Robert Saleh ordered Colbert to the sideline to cool off for a few series before returning.\n\n\"Coaches handled it really well,\" Lynch said. \"First of all, Adrian is a tremendous kid. I went over there and said, 'Adrian, that's not how we practice. We talked about how we were going to conduct ourselves.' He said, 'Hey, I lost my head. I was tracking the ball. Next thing you know he was there.' I can't tell you I haven't been there myself.\"\n\nThe 49ers are coming off their worst defensive season in history, and Saleh has tried rallying his unit with mottos such as \"excessive violence\" and \"all gas, no brakes.\" Colbert should have applied the brakes in this 7-on-7 drill.\n\nThat said, the 49ers defense did look especially aggressive against a feeble passing attack, ahem, led by Trevor Siemian and Paxton Lynch. Will Davis and Jaquiski Tartt had interceptions in team drills, Brock Coyle and Asa Jackson dropped potential interceptions, and Reuben Foster punched out a fumble.\n\nDakoda Watson, a Bronco last season, contributed to the 49ers' improved pass rush with a pass breakup and at least one would-be sack. What was their mentality? \"It is what it is every week: to get better,\" Watson answered. \"Nothing's going to change just because they're here. I don't care if it's New England or whoever. We're here to work on ourselves and not just get excited because we have another team. That's a trick question.\"\n\n3. Tight end competition. Vance McDonald remains the most proficient tight end on the roster, and even though the five others are roster-caliber players, none have really emerged from that pack. Lynch said the 49ers are \"very pleased\" with McDonald, who they entertained trade offers for in April, even though his contract extension last December makes him harder to deal.\n\n\"We've been thoroughly impressed with how Vance responded to that,\" Lynch said, citing how McDonald's consistent blocking in Friday's game was as good as he's ever seen from the fifth-year veteran.\n\n\"He's coming back and shown us all a lot,\" Lynch added. \"He's competing in a very competitive room. That's a room where someone is going to have to separate themselves. We're very pleased with him right now.\"\n\nAsked for a scouting report on the six tight ends, quarterback Brian Hoyer noted all have different strengths and that McDonald, Blake Bell and George Kittle are the top receiving options. \"They all bring a lot to the table, and the good thing is in this offense, you need a lot of types of tight ends, guys who can stay in and run block and guys who can split out and get open,\" Hoyer said.\n\nKittle lined up first at tight end at the start of team drills. McDonald and sixth-year veteran Garrett Celek had highly productive practices. Logan Paulsen figures to stick on the roster as a free agent who previously played under Shanahan.\n\nEXTRA POINTS\n\n-- Linebacker Reuben Foster came out of full-team drills the last 30 minutes of practice after appearing to nick his right shoulder or neck area. Lynch said: \"I talked to him and, like Reuben, he had a big smile and said, 'I'm straight.' So he's good, he's 'straight.' \" Foster made a one-handed interception in a one-on-one drill.\n\n-- Linebacker Donavin Newsom was waived and will go on injured reserve if he goes unclaimed. Newsom sustained a concussion in a collision last week that required him to be taken off the practice field by ambulance and to Stanford Medical Center for two nights of observation.\n\n-- Warren Sapp, a Hall of Fame defensive tackle and Lynch's former Tampa Bay teammate, was on hand to help mentor the linemen.\n\n-- Nose tackle D.J. Jones needed treatment for a leg injury.\n\n-- Defensive linemen DeForest Buckner and Aaron Lynch did individual conditioning because of ankle injuries, as did Ronald Blair (groin) and Jimmie Ward (hamstring).", "dateTime": "2017-08-16T15:23:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6705882549285889, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "details": {"gpCnt": 4}, "storyUri": "eng-3367820", "time": "15:23:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3367820", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "242110", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "302552", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Association football"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "score": 4}, {"id": "304806", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "McDonald's"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald's", "score": 2}, {"id": "304976", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Interception"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "score": 3}, {"id": "305661", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "National Football League"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League", "score": 4}, {"id": "305872", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "score": 3}, {"id": "309225", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "score": 3}, {"id": "309227", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Peyton Manning"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peyton_Manning", "score": 3}, {"id": "309400", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Strong-side linebacker"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "score": 2}, {"id": "309405", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Safety (American and Canadian football position)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_(American_and_Canadian_football_position)", "score": 4}, {"id": "310130", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "score": 3}, {"id": "310476", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "score": 1}, {"id": "310743", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "score": 2}, {"id": "311051", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Defensive coordinator"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_coordinator", "score": 3}, {"id": "312020", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Tight end"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tight_end", "score": 4}, {"id": "322056", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Denver Broncos"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Broncos", "score": 5}, {"id": "324226", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Fumble"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fumble", "score": 2}, {"id": "331327", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "score": 5}, {"id": "336230", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "National anthem"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_anthem", "score": 4}, {"id": "345076", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Forward pass"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_pass", "score": 2}, {"id": "349256", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Levi's Stadium"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi's_Stadium", "score": 3}, {"id": "378919", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Brian Hoyer"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Hoyer", "score": 2}, {"id": "395519", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Colin Kaepernick"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Kaepernick", "score": 3}, {"id": "482554", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Logan Paulsen"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_Paulsen", "score": 1}, {"id": "515930", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Asa Jackson"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asa_Jackson", "score": 2}, {"id": "620880", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Blake Bell"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blake_Bell", "score": 2}, {"id": "1272948", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Paxton Lynch"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxton_Lynch", "score": 2}], "image": "http://www.eastbaytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/bng-l-49ers-0817-18.jpg?w=640", "timeCrawl": "22:31:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "49ers training camp: Three things we learned Wednesday", "originalArticle": null}

I think they're doing that as well and it's another productive thing out of this week.\"\n\nLynch is in his first season at the helm for the 49ers, who revamped their front office and coaching staff following a 2-14 season in 2016-17. Out is former general manager Trent Baalke and former head coach Chip Kelly with both Lynch former Atlanta Falcons offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan hired as the team's new general manager and head coach, respectively.\n\nAs for Elway, he has worked with Denver since the 2011-12 season, overseeing the team's most recent Super Bowl victory. They too have a new head coach this season in Vance Joseph after the team missed the playoffs in 2016-17.\n\nThe two teams will meet on the field on Saturday for each's second preseason matchup.\n\n\"It's kind of that time of year, where people are calling and saying, 'Hey, you're strong here, we're strong here. Let's just kind of keep these things in mind,'\" Lynch added.\" And, this is a great opportunity to do that.\"\n\nRelated Items:FRS News, NFC West, NFL Today, San Francisco 49ers, Todays NFL News", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T16:13:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6313725709915161, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3367820", "time": "16:13:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3367820", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "230018", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "302733", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Falcons"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Falcons", "score": 2}, {"id": "305436", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "score": 3}, {"id": "305439", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "score": 2}, {"id": "309225", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "score": 2}, {"id": "322056", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Denver Broncos"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Broncos", "score": 4}, {"id": "331327", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "score": 5}, {"id": "331994", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Chip Kelly"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chip_Kelly", "score": 2}, {"id": "350359", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "John Elway"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Elway", "score": 5}, {"id": "357366", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Comcast SportsNet Bay Area"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comcast_SportsNet_Bay_Area", "score": 3}, {"id": "374950", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Kyle Shanahan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Shanahan", "score": 2}, {"id": "412558", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Trent Baalke"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Baalke", "score": 2}], "image": "https://d3d2maoophos6y.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/17101506/DAL170302_NFL_Combine_0458.jpg", "timeCrawl": "19:45:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "49ers John Lynch discusses benefits of joint practice with Broncos", "originalArticle": null}

Let's just kind of keep these things in mind.' And, this is a great opportunity to do that. So, we did have some of those discussions. The greatest thing is lots of times you're throwing in a preseason game. We get a chance for three days to look at some people we might be interested in. So, you're always doing that. I think they're doing that as well and it's another productive thing out of this week.\"\n\nAfter 10 days of training camp, Lynch's staff and coach Kyle Shanahan's staff sat down for a personnel meeting to evaluate what's in place and what they might need moving forward. Those conversations are ongoing, but it's not too early to identify positions of strength and weakness.\n\nFor example, the 49ers look to have more capable players than they can keep on the defensive line with names like Quinton Dial, Ronald Blair and others getting pushed for their jobs. The Broncos, meanwhile, have been ravaged by injury on the defensive line and could potentially use depth. San Francisco could use depth at cornerback and on the interior of the offensive line.\n\nThe 49ers also have multiple options at tight end that could leave someone with a solid NFL resume on the outside looking in. Back in the spring, Shanahan and Lynch openly acknowledged that they had discussions about trading tight end Vance McDonald. Nothing materialized and McDonald has been making an impact in camp, though he still has issues with drops.\n\n\"I think what I've been thoroughly impressed with, as has Kyle and everybody around here, is how Vance has responded to that,\" Lynch said. \"I thought last week against Kansas City was a great example. Even though it didn't show up on the stat sheet, it's as good as I've seen him block, and he did it consistently and he competed extremely hard. And so, we were very proud of Vance. Kyle talks a lot about that. There's no absolutes and at the time that's the way we were thinking, but he's come back and shown us all a lot. He's competing in a very competitive room. I think that's a room where someone is going to have to separate themselves. He's a big part of that. So, we're very pleased with him right now.\"\n\nAt this point, a deal might not be imminent but it's worth monitoring as we get closer to decision day on cuts to the 53-man roster.", "dateTime": "2017-08-18T16:19:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6235294342041016, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3367820", "time": "16:19:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3367820", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Clara"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "concepts": [{"id": "187023", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "229192", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "229241", "label": {"eng": "Santa Clara"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Clara,_California", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Clara"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "304975", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "score": 2}, {"id": "305661", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "National Football League"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League", "score": 5}, {"id": "312020", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Tight end"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tight_end", "score": 2}, {"id": "314202", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "National Football League preseason"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League_preseason", "score": 3}, {"id": "322056", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Denver Broncos"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Broncos", "score": 5}, {"id": "331327", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "score": 5}, {"id": "350359", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "John Elway"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Elway", "score": 3}, {"id": "374950", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Kyle Shanahan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Shanahan", "score": 2}, {"id": "1275248", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Vance McDonald"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vance_McDonald", "score": 2}, {"id": "1289020", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Quinton Dial"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinton_Dial", "score": 2}], "image": "http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0817%2Fr245484_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "timeCrawl": "16:19:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Could joint practices lead to Broncos-49ers trade?

It's a practice. But I was proud of the way our guys competed on both sides of the field and on special teams. It's a great measuring stick and it's a great opportunity for our team to go up against one of the deeper rosters in football and see how we stack up.\"\n\nWhen the Niners and Broncos had similar practices in Denver last year, the 49ers seemed to be well behind the Broncos. But that didn't seem to be the case in Wednesday's workout. The 49ers held their own against coach Vance Joseph and Co.\n\nBoth teams were in full pads and they were able to test each other beyond the confines of a normal workout.\n\n\"I think players get excited and the juices get flowing a little bit but when you practice against each other all the time, our defensive players are calling out our offensive plays all the time,\" Lynch said. \"You know the audibles, so you are going up against something where it's not scripted. You don't know everything they're doing so it's true competition. It really is as close to a game as possible.\"\n\nAnd while many of these practices often feature a major skirmish or two, the Niners and Broncos made it through this one without any real issues. The only problem arose when Niners rookie defensive back Adrian Colbert delivered a big hit to Denver tight end Steven Scheu. That led to a short altercation before the sides were separated and Niners staff immediately went to Colbert to get him to settle down. After sitting out a few plays, Colbert was back in the mix and the Niners made amends with Joseph and general manager John Elway.\n\nThe 49ers and Broncos will have one more practice together on Thursday, though it won't be a fully-padded session. This is the third year in a row the teams have worked out together and it doesn't look like it will stop anytime soon given the ties between the likes of Lynch, Elway, Shanahan and Joseph. In fact, Lynch wouldn't mind adding some other teams to the mix.\n\n\"(Patriots coach Bill) Belichick has done three this year,\" Lynch said. \"In the future, I don't think you can get enough of this, if you can handle it like that. If it becomes a melee, it becomes very unproductive. I really commend both coaches for getting their teams right because when it is right, it's the best thing you can do.\"\n\nSome other news, notes and observations from Wednesday's shared practice:", "dateTime": "2017-08-16T23:24:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6235294342041016, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-16", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3367820", "time": "23:24:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3367820", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Clara"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "concepts": [{"id": "229241", "label": {"eng": "Santa Clara"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Clara,_California", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Clara"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "230018", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "302552", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Association football"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "score": 3}, {"id": "302857", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Tennis"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis", "score": 3}, {"id": "305813", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Coach (sport)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coach_(sport)", "score": 3}, {"id": "305872", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "score": 2}, {"id": "312020", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Tight end"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tight_end", "score": 2}, {"id": "321241", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "General manager"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "score": 3}, {"id": "321592", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Defensive back"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_back", "score": 2}, {"id": "322056", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Denver Broncos"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Broncos", "score": 5}, {"id": "322846", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Special teams"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football_positions#Special_teams", "score": 3}, {"id": "331327", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "score": 5}, {"id": "350359", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "John Elway"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Elway", "score": 2}, {"id": "353903", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Skirmisher"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skirmisher", "score": 2}, {"id": "357382", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "score": 1}], "image": "http://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0816%2Fr245146_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "timeCrawl": "23:24:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "49ers pleased with first day of practice work against Broncos", "originalArticle": null}

As the league's most-watched quarterbacks battle pressed on, neither Trevor Siemian nor Paxton Lynch seemed to have pulled ahead of the other.\n\nFor someone who had been so excited to see Siemian and Lynch go against a defense that wasn't the Broncos', my heart all but hit the floor reading these tweets from San Francisco beat writers about the QBs' performances:\n\nI would argue that Lynch possesses many more tools that teams need in a franchise QB than Beathard, a third-round rookie quarterback for the 49ers, but nonetheless, the initial reports were not promising.\n\nIf neither quarterback has seemingly played well enough to earn the Broncos' starting quarterback spot, it might be time to start thinking about what the season will look like with sub-par play at the quarterback position.\n\nOne of these is by utilizing the Broncos' improved special teams unit, which possesses two exciting rookie kickoff/punt returners in Carlos Henderson and Isaiah McKenzie, and also Kalif Raymond, who has been quietly turning heads during the Broncos' practices and made two big returns against the Bears to set up touchdown drives.\n\nRaymond had one kickoff and one punt return each in the Broncos' preseason game against the Chicago Bears, which went for 41 and 34 yards, respectively. Better returns and better field position are always a great way for a team to generate quicker points by having to move the ball less to get into scoring range.\n\nNot surprisingly, the first points on the board in the Broncos' first preseason game against the Bears came in the form of a pick-six by Chris Harris Jr.\n\nThe Broncos can always turn back the clock and do what worked best for them in 2015, which saw the team win the Super Bowl leaning heavily on their elite defense and winning the field position game, while grinding out wins with the running game.\n\nMany assumed this would end up being the story of 2017, but there are other options to keep Denver in the playoff hunt that don't involve just keeping the ball out of Lynch and/or Siemian's hands.\n\nPossessing a receiver like Demaryius Thomas, who has one of the best yards after catch (YAC) career statistics mean that getting the ball quickly to Thomas is a great way to generate extra yards after the initial completion.\n\nA quick throw or more specifically screen passes would allow the offense to play into the specialty of one of its best playmakers. It would also help with Lynch's difficulty reading a defense's coverage, and keep Siemian from forcing downfield throws.\n\nAlong with having difficulty reading a defense, the other knock on Lynch had been his struggles standing tall in the pocket and delivering a strike to his intended target. Lynch has shown that his accuracy improves greatly when he isn't forced to remain in the pocket. If the Broncos can give Lynch the ability to move outside of the pocket and throw on the move, it could end up in more completions and exciting plays, rather than a sack or incompletion.\n\nSiemian proved last year he can stand tall in the pocket. What remains to be seen is if he can stay healthy after taking big hits. An injured left shoulder limited his play in the second half of last season. The narrative out of camp is that the run game is greatly improved, so that will be one way to keep Siemian upright if he earns the starting job.\n\nOn Thursday, Lynch appeared to have improved significantly. Some even stated he had a \"perfect practice\" against the 49ers, where \"not a single pass hit the ground.\" At this point, the only way to tell for certain is to see how he and Siemian both play on Saturday.\n\nEven if the Broncos don't get the results they are hoping for from either quarterback, there are ways they can still compete for a playoff spot in 2017. More explosive special teams play, defensive productivity and a focus on the run game ought to do the trick.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T14:53:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.6000000238418579, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3367820", "time": "14:53:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3367820", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "concepts": [{"id": "229192", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "229241", "label": {"eng": "Santa Clara"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Clara,_California", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Clara"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "230018", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "302611", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "score": 3}, {"id": "304976", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Interception"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "score": 2}, {"id": "305872", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "score": 5}, {"id": "309225", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "score": 2}, {"id": "310743", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "score": 2}, {"id": "322056", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Denver Broncos"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Broncos", "score": 4}, {"id": "322846", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Special teams"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football_positions#Special_teams", "score": 3}, {"id": "324223", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Rush (gridiron football)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_(gridiron_football)", "score": 2}, {"id": "325485", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Kickoff (gridiron football)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kickoff_(gridiron_football)", "score": 4}, {"id": "325513", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Punt (gridiron football)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punt_(gridiron_football)", "score": 4}, {"id": "331327", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "score": 5}, {"id": "342459", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "score": 3}, {"id": "352640", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Demaryius Thomas"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demaryius_Thomas", "score": 2}, {"id": "366952", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Incomplete pass"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incomplete_pass", "score": 2}, {"id": "369721", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Return specialist"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_specialist", "score": 3}, {"id": "381953", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Throwback uniform"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throwback_uniform", "score": 2}, {"id": "1272948", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Paxton Lynch"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxton_Lynch", "score": 3}, {"id": "1281168", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Chris Harris, Jr."}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Harris,_Jr.", "score": 2}], "image": "http://milehighsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/USATSI_9782962_164063748_lowres.jpg", "timeCrawl": "14:53:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Regardless of quarterback play, Broncos have means to compete in AFC", "originalArticle": null}

And he competed extremely hard. We were very proud of Vance.\"\n\nMcDonald began training camp as a second-string tight end. But a hamstring injury to rookie George Kittle has given him more practice repetitions with the first-string group and he started Friday's preseason game in Kansas City.\n\nOf course, McDonald's effort doesn't mean the team won't trade him.\n\nLynch also acknowledged Wednesday that teams have reached that part in the season in which they've assessed where their own squad is weak and where others teams are loaded. He said discussions have begun among teams and that he has a good opportunity to talk trades this week with Broncos general manager John Elway.\n\nThe two already consummated one deal that landed the 49ers running back Kapri Bibbs in the draft.\n\nTwo of the 49ers' deepest positions - or at least the ones they might be willing to deal - are tight end and defensive line.\n\n\"The greatest thing is, lots of times you're throwing on a preseason game,\" he said of looking at other teams' talent. \"We've got a chance for three days to look at some people we might be interested in. So you're always doing that. And I think they're doing that as well. And it's another productive thing out of this week.\"\n\nBrock to Seahawks - Former 49ers cornerback Tramaine Brock ended up where many ex-49ers go: Seattle.\n\nThe Seahawks signed Brock to a one-year deal Wednesday with the thought that he will compete to be the team's No. 2 cornerback.\n\nThe 49ers cut Brock in April after he was arrested for felony domestic abuse. Charges were dropped last week after the alleged victim in the case, Brock's 31-year-old ex girlfriend, declined to cooperate with prosecutors.\n\nBrock had been one of the 49ers' starting cornerbacks for the last two seasons. He still could face disciplinary action from the NFL.\n\nEt cetera - Linebacker Reuben Foster was held out of team drills beginning midway through practice after suffering an apparent injury to his neck or shoulder. He did take part in seven-on-seven drills. Afterward he told Lynch that he was fine.\n\n\u25aa Warren Sapp, who was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2013, is working with the 49ers defensive linemen this week. Lynch and Sapp are close from their time together with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\n\u25aa The 49ers plan to place rookie linebacker Donavin Newsom on injured reserve, ending his season.

Right now, I know the coaches are just expecting the quarterbacks to go out there and move the ball and score points,\" Lynch said. \"So that's what I'm really focused on and that's what I've been focused on since I've had the opportunity to play quarterback here. It's just getting better and progressing, then seeing the progression in me.\"\n\nHead coach Vance Joseph and his staff want to see confidence from both quarterbacks. They want to see consistency, good ball-placement and smart decision-making. Yes, they want to see scoring, but really they want to see a true starter reveal himself.\n\n\"I can't speak for Paxton, but as a room and as a team, every day is a make-or-break day for us,\" Siemian said. \"Every week is a make-or-break week for us. I think we've had a really competitive camp, and we've taken on intensity every day. Now, we're just trying to build on that and see where we end up.\"\n\nIn Denver's preseason opener at Chicago last week, Siemian started and went 6-of-7 for 51 yards, no touchdowns, no interceptions and a 97.0 passer rating. He guided the Broncos to a field goal.\n\nLynch went 6-of-9 for 42 yards, no touchdowns, no interceptions and no points, with a 77.1 passer rating.\n\nFollowing the Broncos' victory, receiver Demaryius Thomas said he advised Lynch to mentally move on from mistakes to maintain his confidence and poise in the pocket.\n\nIn Thursday's joint practice, Thomas saw Lynch heed his advice as he went 12-for-12, seemingly throw a spark back into the QB conversation.\n\n\"It was one of his best days,\" Thomas said. \"That's good for him. It'll give him a little confidence and maybe he can be himself more often. You saw him smiling, so that was good.\"\n\nThomas, who had initially hoped the quarterback decision would be decided before Saturday, is now hopeful it'll be decided soon after.

They did not attach a timetable to the Great Quarterback Competition of 2017, believing and hoping that the decision would be made for them, that one quarterback would separate himself.\n\n\"Eventually we're going to name a starter,\" general manager John Elway said Thursday. \"We just don't know when.\"\n\nMaybe they will after Saturday's game, when the Broncos face the 49ers in their second preseason game and quarterbacks Paxton Lynch and Trevor Siemian each get another quarter-and-a-half to audition.\n\nLynch will start, as planned prior to the preseason, and the first-teamers on both sides will play about a quarter, possibly a little more.\n\nThe Broncos have spent the majority of the week in Santa Clara for two joint practices against the 49ers, two more key days in the offseason-long tryout for the quarterbacks.\n\n\"I don't know if it's last chance or make or break. Right now, I know the coaches are just expecting the quarterbacks to go out there and move the ball and score points,\" Lynch said. \"So that's what I'm really focused on and that's what I've been focused on since I've had the opportunity to play quarterback here. It's just getting better and progressing, then seeing the progression in me.\"\n\nHead coach Vance Joseph and his staff want to see confidence from both quarterbacks. They want to see consistency, good ball-placement and smart decision-making. Yes, they want to see scoring, but really they want to see a true starter reveal himself.\n\n\"I can't speak for Paxton, but as a room and as a team, every day is a make-or-break day for us,\" Siemian said. \"Every week is a make-or-break week for us. I think we've had a really competitive camp, and we've taken on intensity every day. Now, we're just trying to build on that and see where we end up.\"\n\nIn Denver's preseason opener at Chicago last week, Siemian started and went 6-of-7 for 51 yards, no touchdowns, no interceptions and a 97.0 passer rating. He guided the Broncos to a field goal.\n\nLynch went 6-of-9 for 42 yards, no touchdowns, no interceptions and no points, with a 77.1 passer rating.\n\nFollowing the Broncos' victory, receiver Demaryius Thomas said he advised Lynch to mentally move on from mistakes to maintain his confidence and poise in the pocket.\n\nIn Thursday's joint practice, Thomas saw Lynch heed his advice as he went 12-for-12, seemingly throw a spark back into the quarterback conversation.\n\n\"It was one of his best days,\" Thomas said. \"That's good for him. It'll give him a little confidence and maybe he can be himself more often. You saw him smiling, so that was good.\"\n\nThomas, who had initially hoped the quarterback decision would be decided before Saturday, is now hopeful it'll be decided soon after. But even he knows it may not be.\n\n\"We want one of them to take the reins and take over.

The Game of Throws is complicated by differing opinions and lacking reps.\n\nSports Illustrated laid out the problems in its recent issue, articulating the difficult of navigating the path to a starter. The Bills (Doug Flutie-Rob Johnson), the Cardinals (Kurt Warner-Matt Leinart), Lions (Rodney Peete-Andrew Ware), Browns (Derek Anderson-Brady Quinn-Charlie Frye), and Panthers (Jake Delhomme-Peete) were among the teams to stage battles over the last two decades. The results proved mix. Broncos offensive coordinator Mike McCoy was on the Carolina staff as a position coach so he has experience to fall back on as Paxton Lynch goes against Trevor Siemian.\n\nMake no mistake, the Broncos' second preseason game Saturday night against the 49ers represents a runway for Lynch to show his stuff. After falling behind in the competition in the days leading up to the preseason opener at Chicago, and failing to do much against the Bears, Lynch turned the corner this week. For the first time since the pads came on and the playbook expanded, Lynch looked comfortable. In joint practices against the 49ers, he went 25-for-37 in 11-on-11, 7-on-7 and matchup drills. More salient, he made good decisions without making mistakes, finishing with zero interceptions.\n\n\"Just my progressions and being comfortable in the offense I think is growing over time and day in and day out with these guys,\" Lynch said. \"Knowing where they're going to be, knowing when to adjust plays and fix protections, and having the ability to change the plays. I know that coach McCoy is starting to have some trust in us and give us the ability to go up to the line of scrimmage and get us in the right look.\"\n\nLynch starts and will play into the second quarter. Siemian, who has been more consistent than Lynch, will enter in the second quarter and play through the third followed by Kyle Sloter.\n\nIf the Broncos believed Siemian had won the competition, there would be no reason to start Lynch. Part of the decision involves equality, with each player receiving the nod in an exhibition game. It also speaks to the fact, in my opinion, that they have not seen enough from Siemian (or know what they have). Siemian has played decent, but not enough to put Lynch away.\n\nThis is why this game looms large for Lynch. Can he do enough to make his case, while also creating an avenue for coach Vance Joseph to elevate him with the support of the locker room? As a first-year coach, Joseph must start the player who gives the Broncos the best chance to win, especially given the mindset of the defense.\n\nCan Lynch produce enough big plays to live with inconsistencies?\n\nIdeally, Joseph chooses his starting quarterback for the season opener early next week. The team has had almost eight months to make a decision. It should be enough time to name a guy, then go into regular-season game plan mode against the Packers next week.\n\n2) O-Line Dance needs rhythm\n\nThe Broncos' first team ran the ball well against Chicago. But the pass protection remained inconsistent, symbolized by right tackle Menelik Watson allowing a sack on the team's first play from scrimmage. General manager John Elway, offensive coordinator Mike McCoy and Joseph have spoken at length about the importance of the offense improving around the quarterback. It starts upfront. The line showed an edge this week in practice. Can it translate to the games? Allen Barbre is pushing for the left guard spot against Max Garcia. Connor McGovern has enjoyed a terrific summer. He is pushing to start somewhere. The team could put him at right guard and move veteran Ron Leary to left side, where he is more comfortable. Or if Matt Paradis, who won't play until the Packers game, needs more time following offseason hip surgeries, McGovern could occupy the center spot.\n\nAt some point soon, the five fingers on the line must become a fist.\n\n\"Football is a brotherhood. Offensive line is a brotherhood. We always have to take care of each other,\" said Watson, who, along with McGovern, skirmished with 49ers defenders on Thursday. \"Training camp is the time to set those standards. We have a great group of guys, first and foremost, guys without egos in our room. So that makes it a lot easier. Once you get guys playing for each other, it comes along a lot faster.\"\n\n3) D-Fence up front\n\nFor the Broncos defense to realize its potential and create more turnovers, the grunts need improvement. The Broncos could not stop the run last season. The Broncos reshaped the group, adding nose tackle Domata Peko and linemen Zach Kerr and DeMarcus Walker (out with a sore hip).\n\nPeko and Kerr must step up given the injuries to Derek Wolfe (right ankle) and Jared Crick (back spasms). Wolfe and Crick are in line to return for the season opener on Sept. 11. But they will need assists from others. Kerr admitted he must play better. Peko has been a leader, an anchor. He looked good in practice this week. Can it continue against the 49ers and the Packers?\n\n\"We've been a lot more stout there, and I think we're bigger there. That's one thing, with the concern after last year was stopping the run and to be able to hold the line of scrimmage and be stout at the line of scrimmage. I think we've showed that on the defensive side much, much better there,\" general manager John Elway said, \"That has to continue to work, continue to go, and we have to continue to get better with that.\"\n\nParadis, Walker, Crick, Wolfe and safety T.J. Ward have been ruled out for the game. And it's uncertain whether receivers Emmanuel Sanders (shoulder) and Cody Latimer (patellar tendon in knee) will play. ... The starting defenders, like Chris Harris Jr. and Aqib Talib, are hoping to receive two series of action. There remains a possibility that Von Miller will not play rather than expose him to injury. Let him go a few series against the Packers, and he should ready. ... There are plenty of young defensive backs making nose. Safety Jamal Carter continues to make a strong push to land a roster spot. ... With Sanders iffy and Latimer likely out, it sets the stage for Kalif Raymond and Jordan Taylor to get extra reps. It's unlikely they both make the team.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T19:36:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 4857, "textStart": 4849, "imp": true, "date": "2017-09-11", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.572549045085907, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3367820", "time": "19:36:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3367820", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "concepts": [{"id": "206540", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Chicago"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "227084", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "302605", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "American football"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "score": 2}, {"id": "304976", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Interception"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "score": 3}, {"id": "305439", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "score": 4}, {"id": "305872", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "score": 5}, {"id": "309405", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Safety (American and Canadian football position)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_(American_and_Canadian_football_position)", "score": 1}, {"id": "310098", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Browns"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns", "score": 3}, {"id": "310743", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback sack"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sack", "score": 2}, {"id": "310750", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Sports Illustrated"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Illustrated", "score": 4}, {"id": "311351", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Center (American and Canadian football)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_(American_and_Canadian_football)", "score": 2}, {"id": "312091", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Line of scrimmage"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_scrimmage", "score": 3}, {"id": "312097", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Buffalo Bills"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_Bills", "score": 4}, {"id": "314205", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Green Bay Packers"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers", "score": 3}, {"id": "319761", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Lineman (American football)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineman_(American_football)", "score": 2}, {"id": "322056", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Denver Broncos"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Broncos", "score": 5}, {"id": "322621", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Guard (American and Canadian football)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(American_and_Canadian_football)", "score": 3}, {"id": "324464", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Offensive line"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_line", "score": 2}, {"id": "331327", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "score": 5}, {"id": "336934", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Nose tackle"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(American_and_Canadian_football)#Nose_tackle", "score": 2}, {"id": "342459", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "score": 3}, {"id": "350359", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "John Elway"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Elway", "score": 2}, {"id": "357629", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "T.

Lynch has yet to comment on sitting.\n\nOn Wednesday, Niners general manager John Lynch was asked if he supports, tolerates and/or has concerns about those silent anthem protests.\n\n\"We had a great deal the other day where we had four chairs up here, and there was Steve Young and Jerry Rice,\" John Lynch said. \"And they talked about 'The 49er Way.' And I always thought that's one of the great things about this league. As a matter of fact, I think it's a great beacon for the rest of culture, in terms of the way it should be. You strive for a common goal, and you have unity.\n\n\"And I think this game brings people together. So I think personally when I see that, I think that's divisive. And I understand guys see things and they're not happy. They have that right. And I think we'll always respect people's rights. That doesn't mean I believe that. I believe this game should be celebrated for what it is. I think [it's] a tremendous unifier for our country and for the way things should be.\"\n\nLynch went on to cite some of the words of former Niners coach Bill Walsh, whom Lynch played for at Stanford, and how Walsh would talk about football as a cultural melting pot that can bring players together from all backgrounds.\n\n\"You take guys from all over the county, different socio-economic backgrounds, racial backgrounds, and you have friends for life,\" Lynch said, mentioning his former teammate Warren Sapp was in town visiting the Niners on Wednesday. \"Those types of stories I think get lost in something like this. But they've got their reasons [for the protests], and we'll always be respectful of those.\"\n\nThe protests gained national traction last season after then-Niners quarterback Colin Kaepernick began sitting during the national anthem before preseason games. Linebacker Eli Harold and safety Eric Reid later joined him, as Kaepernick switched to taking a knee before the team's final preseason game and for the rest of the season.\n\nKaepernick is a free agent after opting out of his contract in March, whereas Reid and Harold remain with the Niners. Reid and Harold have said they intend to stand for the national anthem this season, while Kaepernick is still searching for a roster spot.\n\nAsked if he would feel the need to talk to any 49ers who might decide to protest this season, Lynch said he would.\n\n\"I think we'll always communicate,\" Lynch said. \"We think overcommunicating is a good thing. We haven't faced that situation. If we do, we'll communicate.\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T00:47:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.572549045085907, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3367820", "time": "00:47:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3367820", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Clara"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "concepts": [{"id": "229241", "label": {"eng": "Santa Clara"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Clara,_California", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Clara"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "302552", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Association football"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "score": 2}, {"id": "302614", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Country music"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music", "score": 2}, {"id": "303067", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Steve Young"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Young", "score": 3}, {"id": "305661", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "National Football League"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League", "score": 4}, {"id": "305872", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "score": 2}, {"id": "306466", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Lost film"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_film", "score": 2}, {"id": "309400", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Strong-side linebacker"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "score": 2}, {"id": "309405", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Safety (American and Canadian football position)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_(American_and_Canadian_football_position)", "score": 2}, {"id": "310476", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "score": 1}, {"id": "310749", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Defensive end"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_end", "score": 3}, {"id": "312093", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Seattle Seahawks"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Seahawks", "score": 3}, {"id": "314202", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "National Football League preseason"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League_preseason", "score": 2}, {"id": "314214", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Oakland Raiders"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakland_Raiders", "score": 3}, {"id": "315542", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Bay Area"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area", "type": "loc", "location": null, "score": 3}, {"id": "324224", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Running back"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_back", "score": 3}, {"id": "331327", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "score": 4}, {"id": "336230", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "National anthem"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_anthem", "score": 3}, {"id": "340175", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Silent film"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_film", "score": 5}, {"id": "347589", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Beast Quake"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshawn_Lynch", "score": 3}, {"id": "350363", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Bill Walsh (American football coach)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Walsh_(American_football_coach)", "score": 2}, {"id": "368100", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Warren Sapp"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Sapp", "score": 2}, {"id": "372655", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Jerry Rice"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Rice", "score": 3}, {"id": "395519", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Colin Kaepernick"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Kaepernick", "score": 3}, {"id": "399805", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Anthem"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthem", "score": 5}, {"id": "487739", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Eric Reid (American football)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Reid_(American_football)", "score": 2}, {"id": "1290290", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Eli Harold"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eli_Harold", "score": 2}], "image": "http://a3.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0816%2Fr245208_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "timeCrawl": "00:47:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Niners GM Lynch: Anthem protests 'divisive'", "originalArticle": null}

And, this week, they are getting a unique, unfiltered chance to evaluate players who might be available on each other's team.\n\nJohn Lynch, the 49ers' first-year general manager, and Denver Broncos GM John Elway have spoken this week about needs and which players might be available on the trade market.\n\nThe 49ers have good depth on their defensive line, where a player such as Quinton Dial might have a difficult time making the 53-man roster due to the change to a 4-3 scheme. They could use some help at offensive guard.\n\n\"It's kind of that time of year, where people are calling and saying, 'Hey, you're strong here, we're strong here. Let's just kind of keep these things in mind.' And, this is a great opportunity to do that,\" Lynch said.\n\nThe 49ers and Broncos went through a two-hour, fully padded joint practice behind Levi's Stadium on Wednesday. The teams will go through another practice together Thursday with helmets and shells. It is an opportunity for both general managers to see which bubble players on the other team could make a difference with his own team.\n\n\"We did have some of those discussions,\" Lynch said. \"The greatest thing is lots of times you're throwing on (film of) a preseason game. We get a chance for three days to look at some people we might be interested in. So you're always doing that. I think they're doing that as well and it's another productive thing out of this week.\"\n\nThe 49ers engaged in trade talks involving tight end Vance McDonald during the draft. Any team that trades for McDonald would owe him a guaranteed $2.1 million for the upcoming season. He is signed through 2021.\n\nMcDonald, however, has worked his way into strong consideration for a spot on the 53-man roster with an impressive training camp.\n\n\"I think what I've been thoroughly impressed, as has Kyle [Shanahan] and everybody around here, how Vance has responded to that,\" Lynch said. \"I thought last week against Kansas City was a great example. Even though it didn't show up on the stat sheet, it's as good as I've seen him block, and he did it consistently and he competed extremely hard.\"\n\nMcDonald, Garrett Celek and Blake Bell face stiff challenges to hold onto their roster spots with the additions of newcomers Logan Paulsen and rookies George Kittle and Cole Hikutini.", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T13:13:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.5686274766921997, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3367820", "time": "13:13:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3367820", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "187023", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 1}, {"id": "312020", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Tight end"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tight_end", "score": 2}, {"id": "322056", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Denver Broncos"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Broncos", "score": 3}, {"id": "322621", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Guard (American and Canadian football)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_(American_and_Canadian_football)", "score": 3}, {"id": "331327", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "score": 3}, {"id": "333901", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "4\u20133 defense"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4\u20133_defense", "score": 3}, {"id": "349256", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Levi's Stadium"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi's_Stadium", "score": 3}, {"id": "350359", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "John Elway"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Elway", "score": 3}, {"id": "1275248", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Vance McDonald"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vance_McDonald", "score": 2}, {"id": "1289020", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Quinton Dial"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinton_Dial", "score": 3}], "image": "http://www.csnbayarea.com/sites/csnbayarea/files/2017/08/17/elwaylynch2.jpg", "timeCrawl": "19:45:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Can John Lynch, John Elway make a deal?", "originalArticle": null}

Too bad it was John.\n\n\"I think highly of both of those guys,\" said John Lynch, a Broncos Ring of Famer and general manager of the San Francisco 49ers. \"Paxton has those wow throws. Trevor is extremely consistent.\"\n\nConsider this the Clif's Notes version of Vance Joseph's decision. Siemian has won more days in training camp with good decisions. He is steady. Predictable. Coaches value those qualities. Fans? Not so much when the outcome is a check down. Lynch, standing 6-foot-7 and weighing 244 pounds, makes breathtaking plays followed by cringe-worthy mistakes reflective of his inexperience.\n\nCan Lynch give the Broncos enough to hold onto this week to keep the competition open and consider him for the job? It seems unlikely he can win it. But if the Broncos did not believe he had a chance, then why start him this week? Lynch refuses to let the walls close in on him. In fact, he looked as relaxed Wednesday as he has in several days.\n\n\"I don't look at it as if it's the last chance or make-or-break right now,\" said Lynch, the winner on my grading of Wednesday's practice. \"I know the coaches are just expecting the quarterbacks to go out there and move the ball and score points. That's really what I am focused on -- getting better, making progression and (having) them see the progression in me.\"\n\nCourtesy of my friend Ryan Koenigsberg at BSN sports, Wednesday's unofficial statistics for the quarterbacks: Lynch 13-for-25, two TDs, no interceptions, and Siemian 17-for-23, one TD, one INT. Breaking it down further, Lynch went 9-for-15 in 11-on-11 drills, while Siemian finished 9-for-14.\n\n\"Until I watch the tape and watch it with great detail, I couldn't tell you (if there was separation in derby). It was a lot of throwing and catching,\" Joseph said. \"That was fun to see from both guys; all three guys matter of fact.\"\n\nLynch admitted he leans on his older brother -- his role model -- and his parents. They have helped calm the choppy waters created by a high-profile position battle.\n\n\"Whenever I need something I talk to him about it. I keep them close,\" Lynch said. \"So whenever I go through something that seems bigger than it is, I talk to them and they kind of bring me down and remind me of why I am doing what I am doing.\"\n\nSanders, Latimer hurting\n\nReceiver Emmanuel Sanders started practice, but failed to finish. He hurt his shoulder in a drill, and as a precaution, was held out the final hour or so. Sanders stayed with this teammates, but took off his shoulder pads and helmet. Coach Vance Joseph said they will be \"smart\" with the injury.\n\nCody Latimer watched in shorts, sitting out with a sore patellar tendon in his knee. He told Denver7, it has been bothering him for a year or so, and it acted up. He remains hopeful he can play this this week, but there are no guarantees.\n\nO-Line dance\n\nPlaying the best five offensive linemen leaves the Broncos with options. Joseph admitted it was possible former Missouri star Connor McGovern, who was inactive for 16 games last season, could start at right guard with veteran Ron Leary shifting back to the left side. McGovern has impressed coaches with his versatility and physical style. As it stands, Allen Barbre is pushing to unseat Max Garcia for the left guard position. That, too, is an alternative. Barbre at left guard and Leary staying put.\n\nFootnotes\n\nJamaal Charles received plenty of reps Wednesday as he attempts to spray WD-40 on his knees. Charles will not play this week, but is set to go against the Packers. For Charles to make the team and guarantee his base salary and roster bonus, he needs to show he's healthy and can be productive. Why? Stevan Ridley is pushing to secure a spot. Wearing silver gloves, Ridley was impossible to miss with multiple strong runs. He can also play special teams. ... Von Miller provided a funny moment when asked about why he doesn't complain to refs. \"My mom, always tells me I should. I and I tell here I can't.\" Miller said grousing to the refs makes more sense in basketball and soccer where dialogue happens on every play. \"I just need to go out there and be great and control what I can control.\" .... San Francisco defensive back Adrian Colbert delivered a vicious high hit on Broncos tight end Steven Scheu in 7-on-7 drills. Scheu reacted with venom. He was furious.

Here's a full transcript, courtesy of 49ers PR. Watch video here.\n\n\"Hey guys, just a couple of procedural things. I just wanted to give you guys some information. I know everybody here saw [LB] Donavin Newsom last week with the scary situation and he's doing better each day. We're going to put him on Injured Reserve. It will come across the wire procedurally as a waived-injured, but he's going to be on Injured Reserve. And talking with our doctors, he got great care up here at Stanford. It's the best thing for the kid. Give him time to really get right. So, had a good talk with him this morning, but just wanted to point that out. I thought it was great work for both sides out here today, really productive. I think both coaches handled their teams really well. Had one little scuffle, but I've never seen one of these joint practices where you haven't. But, I thought it was very professional on both sides. Really productive work and we were thrilled with it.\"\n\nWhat did you find yourself watching most closely? What units did you want to see?\n\n\"Well, I tried to perch myself right there in the middle and it was like watching a tennis match going back and forth. So, tried to watch as much as possible. And really, I know that's a playoff-caliber team, so you want to see how are we measuring up? It's a practice, but I was proud of the way our guys competed on both sides of the field and on special teams. It's a great measuring stick and it's a great opportunity for our team to go up against one of the deeper rosters in football and see how we stack up.\"\n\n\"I thought our coaches handled it really well. First of all, I'll just say, Adrian is a tremendous kid and I went over there and said, 'Adrian, that's not how we practice and we talked about how we were going to conduct ourselves.' He just said, 'Hey, I just lost my head. I was tracking the ball, next thing you know he was there.' And, I can't tell you that I haven't been there myself. We kind of sat him out for a little, let things cool down, and then he went out to practice. Talked to [Denver Broncos head coach] Vance [ Joseph] and talked to [Denver Broncos president of football operations/general manager] John [Elway] and everything was good.\"\n\nWhat do you get out of a joint practice compared to a normal practice or compared to a preseason game?\n\n\"I think what you get out of it, first of all, I think players get excited. And again, the juices get flowing a little bit. But, when you practice against each other all the time, our defensive players are calling out our offensive plays. You get to know, you know the audibles, and so you're going up against something where it's not scripted. It's completely unscripted. You don't know everything that they're doing. It's just true competition. It really is as close to a game as possible. John and I were talking about it, [New England Patriots head coach Bill] Belichick has done three this year. We weren't at that point. We had to install a lot of things. But in the future, I don't think you can get enough of this if you can handle it like that. If it becomes a melee, it becomes very unproductive. I really commend both coaches for getting their teams right because when it is right, it's the best thing you can do.\"\n\nWith how good that defense is, how did you think your, particularly your first team offense, went up against that defense?\n\n\"It looked good. It's practice. We'll go back and watch the film, but it looked good. I do have so much respect for those players there and the way they play. I think it's just, for [OL] Trent Brown to go up against [OLB] Von Miller, for [T] Joe Staley to go up against those guys, like I said, it's a top-flight, and particularly that unit, that's as good as it gets in this league. So, a great opportunity. It looked good. It looked competitive.\"\n\nDo you have an opportunity to talk to John about, 'Hey, look, these, this list of guys on our team should be on an NFL roster and it might not be here.' Do you have a list or do you guys kind of talk it through?\n\n\"Well, that's going on in the league. It's kind of that time of year, where people are calling and saying, 'Hey, you're strong here, we're strong here. Let's just kind of keep these things in mind.' And, this is a great opportunity to do that. So, we did have some of those discussions. The greatest thing is lots of times you're throwing on a preseason game. We get a chance for three days to look at some people we might be interested in. So, you're always doing that. I think they're doing that as well and it's another productive thing out of this week.\"\n\nYou saw a lot of Broncos quarterbacks in the preseason last year, Denver Broncos QB Trevor Siemian and Denver Broncos QB Paxton Lynch. What did you think of how they looked out there today?\n\n\"Well, I think highly of both those guys. I know they are having their battle. I think Paxton has those 'wow' throws, but then it's just the consistency. Trevor is extremely consistent. So, I think the only way is just to let that paly out and see who kind of rises to the top there and that's what they're doing. I have great respect for both of them and be interesting to see it play out.\"\n\nYou were open and equal about talking about moving TE Vance McDonald. Where do things stand now? Is that still kind of an open possibility?\n\n\"I think what I've been thoroughly impressed, as has [head coach] Kyle [Shanahan] and everybody around here, how Vance has responded to that. I thought last week against Kansas City was a great example. Even though it didn't show up on the stat sheet, it's as good as I've seen him block, and he did it consistently and he competed extremely hard. And so, we were very proud of Vance. Kyle talks a lot about that. There's no absolutes and at the time that's the way we were thinking, but he's come back and shown us all a lot. He's competing in a very competitive room. I think that's a room where someone is going to have to separate themselves. He's a big part of that. So, we're very pleased with him right now.\"\n\n\"You know, [vice president of communications] Bob [Lange] told me that there was something. But, I talked to him and like Reuben, big smile, said, 'I'm straight.' And, so he's good. He's straight.\"\n\nBack in January, before things developed between you and Kyle here, did you have any impressions that Kyle may end up in Denver just because of the ties?\n\n\"I knew John interviewed him and was thoroughly impressed with him. And, I know that was a tough call. John's very pleased with Vance, but came away just thoroughly impressed with Kyle. And so, obviously quite a familiarity with the family, but really came away, just like I did, impressed with Kyle. So, it's neat to see it work out for everyone.\"\n\n\"Yeah. Brian, we've said from the beginning we want a franchise quarterback around here and a lot of people are making assumptions as to what Brian's role is. Is he a bridge? Is he all those things? Our response to Brian and to everybody is he's got the first crack of being that guy. And I love the way he's embracing that opportunity each and every day and really has been a tremendous leader for our group. I think, probably exceeded my expectations of how I thought he could play. And, I think the same for Kyle. It's been very, very good. We've only played one preseason game and we've got to continue to let it develop. But, he's taking this opportunity and I think doing a tremendous job with it.\"\n\nSilent protests, sideline protests are back in the news now and it looks like they are not going away anytime soon. If it happens here amongst some of your players as it did here last year, how do you feel about that? Do you support it? Do you tolerate it? Do you have concerns with it?\n\n\"You know, I've got my own feelings about it. I think my strongest feeling, we had a great deal the other day where we had four chairs up here and there was [former San Francisco 49ers QB] Steve Young and [former San Francisco 49ers WR] Jerry Rice. They talked about the '49er Way,' and I always thought it's one of the great things about this league. In fact, I think it's a great beacon for the rest of culture in terms of the way it should be. You strive for a common goal and you have unity. And I think this game brings people together. So, I think personally, when I see that I think that's divisive. And, I understand guys see things that they're not happy and they have that right and I think we'll always respect people's rights. That doesn't mean I believe that. I believe that this game should actually be celebrated for what it is. I think a tremendous unifier for our country and for what, you know, the way things should be. [Former San Francisco 49ers head coach] Bill Walsh used to speak about it. You take guys from all over the country, different socioeconomic backgrounds, racial backgrounds, and you have friends for life. [NFL Hall of Fame DT] Warren Sapp is here today working with our defensive line because he's a buddy of mine and always will be. Those types of story, I think, get lost in something like this, but they've got their reasons and we'll always be respectful of those.\"\n\nDoes what you just said mean that you would talk to those players about that or do you just allow them as men to--?\n\n\"Yeah, I think that we'll always communicate. We think over communicating is a good thing. We haven't faced that situation. If we do, we'll communicate.\"\n\nYou were talking about Jerry Rice and Steve Young being here. You guys have talked a lot about reestablishing culture as opposed to maybe building a culture. How are those two things different and how do you kind of try to dig into the past while also evolving?\n\n\"Well, yes, that's a great question because I tell our guys all the time when we do things like this, that's what it is. It's almost like a cheat sheet. This is the way it should be. And, these guys know when we walk by those Super Bowl trophies that they don't come free. You've got to go earn them, but why not take advantage of guys like that and why not invite them. And if Jerry Rice wants to practice, go ahead and practice. That's good for us. And Steve Young up here, I've always respected Steve. But, the stories they told, I think, better than we ever could, they told them what the 49er Way is and it was awesome. I was sitting up here watching, I was proud of our guys because they were just spellbound on these guys. And so, why not take advantage. Denver every day gets to look at John Elway and he's a big part of their history. So, why not embrace that and it's something we're doing and we're going to continue to do.\"\n\n\"You don't want to see that. I thought Jerry, I saw him about halfway through start stretching those hamstring. I thought we were about to blow a hamstring, but he is Jerry Rice. He looked pretty good.\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-16T22:55:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.5411764979362488, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3367820", "time": "22:55:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3367820", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "187023", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "229192", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "230018", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "302552", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Association football"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football", "score": 4}, {"id": "302614", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Country music"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music", "score": 2}, {"id": "303067", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Steve Young"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Young", "score": 2}, {"id": "305436", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "score": 3}, {"id": "305661", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "National Football League"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League", "score": 3}, {"id": "305872", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "score": 4}, {"id": "309231", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Von Miller"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Miller", "score": 3}, {"id": "312020", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Tight end"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tight_end", "score": 2}, {"id": "322056", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Denver Broncos"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Broncos", "score": 5}, {"id": "331327", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "score": 5}, {"id": "342457", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Injured reserve list"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_reserve_list", "score": 5}, {"id": "350363", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Bill Walsh (American football coach)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Walsh_(American_football_coach)", "score": 2}, {"id": "357382", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Bill Belichick"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Belichick", "score": 3}, {"id": "368100", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Warren Sapp"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Sapp", "score": 1}, {"id": "372655", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Jerry Rice"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Rice", "score": 2}, {"id": "412555", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Joe Staley"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Staley", "score": 3}, {"id": "444263", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "California Gold Rush"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Gold_Rush", "score": 2}, {"id": "1272948", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Paxton Lynch"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxton_Lynch", "score": 2}, {"id": "1275248", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Vance McDonald"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vance_McDonald", "score": 2}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tvmcvpa5ybjrIoBRF1LuIocNEW4=/0x23:423x261/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56229247/Screen_Shot_2017_08_16_at_8.43.41_PM.0.png", "timeCrawl": "02:24:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "John Lynch talks about Jerry Rice, Steven Young visit, Brian Hoyer, trade chatter", "originalArticle": null}

Kyle Shanahan's team, for the only time outside of the preseason opener in Kansas City, lined up against a different opponent running different schemes.\n\nBoth practice fields were in use at once, with San Francisco's offense taking on Denver's stout defense on the far side. The Broncos offense, with Paxton Lynch working with the first team, played against the 49ers' defense on the field closes to team headquarters.\n\nThe best match up of the day was between star pass rusher Von Miller and San Francisco's offensive tackles, who are arguably the team's best players on offense. Joe Staley held his own, but was beaten a couple times by Miller in individual drills, while Miller and right tackle Trent Brown went back and fourth in their battles.\n\nMiller has unbelievable quickness and flexibility. His hesitation move is among the best in the NFL and allows him to dip his inside shoulder and go right around tackles. Brown (6-8, 355) is a massive person with long enough arms to make up for Miller's guile.\n\nBrown was able to keep Miller outside the pocket on a few reps, while Miller beat him outside and inside in others. The two have a good relationship and shook hands after their tilts. They played against each other at Miller's pass rushing summit at Stanford during the offseason. And Miller famously praised Brown when the two teams met for joint practices in Colorado last summer.\n\nThe 49ers had 2Pac playing through the loud speakers while the team's were warming up, perhaps to set the stage for the visitors under California's sunshine. After stretches were complete, the teams went into individual drills before their one-on-one sessions.\n\nIt was during that period where the offensive lines worked against the defensive lines and the receivers against secondaries. The 49ers, by all accounts, struggled badly in their joint sessions against the Broncos under Chip Kelly last year. But that wasn't the case Wednesday.\n\nIn the second team period against the Broncos offense, the 49ers' new-look defense the tone. Rashard Robinson broke up a Lynch pass to Demaryius Thomas (the two chirped throughout the day). Elvis Dumervil logged a sack coming from the right edge and Reuben Foster caused a fumble while making the would-be tackle on a screen pass down field.\n\nDekoda Watson, who last season played for Denver, did well in pressuring the pocket and logged a sack of Trevor Semien. Same for Eli Harold, who sacked Semien before he threw a ball right to Brock Coyle, who dropped the interception. Reuben Foster also forced a fumble on a run following a screen pass.\n\nOn the other field, Brian Hoyer continued his strong training camp. He completed, unofficially, more than two thirds of his throws during full-team drills and seven-on-seven sessions. San Francisco's receivers did well to get open against the Broncos' talented secondary. However, the theme of the day was the home team perhaps playing a little harder than the visitors.\n\nThat was exhibited early when seventh-round Adrian Colbert decked reserve tight end Steven Scheu on a play along the sideline, which created the only noticeable skirmish of the session. 49ers general manager John Lynch said afterwards he spoke with Colbert before he returned to drills.\n\nPaxton Lynch, who was vying for Denver's starting job, seemed flustered for much of the day. San Francisco did well to pressure the pocket and force errant throws. Lynch was erratic, missing open receivers with some throws going right to their feet.\n\nOne of the highlights for San Francisco's offense came in the final two-minute drill for the first team. Hoyer was focused on getting rid of the ball before Denver's pass rush could break the pocket. He found Jeremy Kerley, Marquise Goodwin (who had another strong practice), Vance McDonald, Pierre Gar\u00e7on and Goodwin again after three-step drops.\n\nThe sequence set up a would-be game-winning field goal try from 48 yards. But the snap was bobbled by Bradley Pinion and the play was thwarted (I couldn't tell if the snap was bad, from my view). Otherwise, Hoyer orchestrated a strong two-minute drive by completing 5-of-6 and getting his team in range to win the game.\n\nTidbits and takeaways\n\n-Pass rusher Aaron Lynch missed practice for the second straight day with an ankle sprain. He remains unlikely to play Saturday and spent the day doing conditioning drills and rehab with DeForest Buckner and Ronald Blair.\n\n-Same for safety Jimmie Ward, who still has not been activated off the physically unable to perform list. It looks as though the team will wait until next week before allowing him to return to practice after injuring his hamstring in late July.\n\n-DeAndre Smelter had one of his best practices of training camp, highlighted by an acrobatic catch over the middle during team drills from Matt Barkley. He remains a long shot to crack the roster, but was used on special teams in the preseason opener, indicating the coaching staff is figuring out ways to maximize his value.\n\n-The interior of San Francisco's offensive line remains the weak point on the offense while Joshua Garnett remains sidelined indefinitely with his knee injury. Brandon Fusco and Zane Beadles struggled in individual drills against Broncos linemen Adam Gotsis and Zach Kerr.\n\nCenter Daniel Kilgore did well against nose tackle Domata Peko, standing him up on consecutive reps.\n\n-Multiple reports indicated Reuben Foster left practice early to get his shoulder/neck area checked on. John Lynch said afterwards he spoke to Foster and the injury isn't considered serious.\n\n\"I talked to him and like Reuben, big smile, said, 'I'm straight.' And, so he's good.

But, also, I think our guys expected it, too. I think they were expecting to do good.\"\n\nWednesday's scrimmage-type competition was marred by one confrontation instigated by 49ers free safety Adrian Colbert, who belted Broncos tight end Steven Scheu in a non-contract drill. Thursday's session had a couple of lesser skirmishes, one involving 49ers wideout Pierre Garcon and Denver's standout cornerback, Aqib Talib.\n\nWhile calling the flare-ups unfortunate, Shanahan saw a positive in how the 49ers handled the situations.\n\n\"What we preach to our players: If you're scared to fight, you're probably not going to be in the NFL,\" he claimed. \"It's really important to me to see us compete and have each other's back and not turn anything down. When you get in some of those situations, you can really see how people are and how they respond.\"\n\n--49ers Hall of Famers Jerry Rice and Steve Young attended the team's practice Tuesday and addressed the club at the request of general manager John Lynch.\n\n\"They talked about the '49er way,'\" Lynch explained. \"I always thought it's one of the great things about this league. In fact, I think it's a great beacon for the rest of culture in terms of the way it should be.\n\n\"These guys (current 49ers) know when we walk by those Super Bowl trophies, they don't come free. You've got to go earn them.\"\n\nRice showed up in cleats and ran drills with the roster hopefuls.\n\n\"If Jerry Rice wants to practice, go ahead and practice. That's good for us,\" Lynch insisted. \"And Steve Young ... the stories they told, I think, better than we ever could, they told them what the '49er way' is and it was awesome. I was sitting up there watching. I was proud of our guys because they were just spellbound on those guys.

Siemian was fine in his first contest, going 6-of-7 for 51 yards. Lynch wasn't drastically different on paper, finishing the day 6-of-9 for 42 yards, but it was his demeanor that was of concern.\n\nAfter the Week 1 performance, head coach Vance Joseph said he wanted Lynch to \"relax, go play\" and wide out Demaryius Thomas' advice to the QB was to not overthink, especially after bad plays. The second-year player is expected to be the heir apparent, but he has yet earn the starting position through his performance. Lynch will get the start Saturday against San Francisco, but the team doesn't seem too eager to name a No. 1 guy for the rest of the season just yet.\n\nThe Broncos are going to need to find a way to get their players reps while also keeping them healthy. The team has been plagued by injuries this offseason, and just weeks away from the start of the regular season is no time to lose your most valuable guys. Just in the week leading up to this contest, two DEs were carted off the field, Jared Crick (back) and Derek Wolfe (ankle), and rookie WR Carlos Henderson will undergo thumb surgery.\n\nWith a new head coach in Kyle Shanahan and a new starting QB in Brian Hoyer, the Niners' offense has been a bit of a question mark heading into the season. The team's veteran running backs Tim Hightower and Carlos Hyde are leading the rush game, and bringing some of the young guys up to par.\n\nFar back on the depth chart is undrafted free agent Matt Breida. The rookie led the way in his first NFL preseason game, with the most forced missed tackles (6) on rush attempts in Week 1, per Pro Football Focus. Breida has earned additional reps with the ones and twos as he becomes a bit more battle-tested.\n\nThe big issue for San Francisco during its Week 1 preseason win over Kansas City was the number of penalties they drew -- 17 penalties for 131 yards, and another four penalties that were offsetting or declined. Despite some of the shortcomings of the offense, the Niners rotated out their starting offensive line pretty quickly, giving the illusion their first team is all but set.\n\nAfter two joint practices -- one padded, one not -- Denver and San Francisco are looking for some answers on offense from their Week 2 preseason matchup, as they inch closer to the regular season.\n\nAnnouncers: Ron Zappolo, Brian Griese (Denver); Ted Robinson, Tim Ryan (San Francisco)", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T22:00:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.5098039507865906, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3367820", "time": "22:00:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3367820", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "229192", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 4}, {"id": "230018", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "302605", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "American football"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "score": 2}, {"id": "302622", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Tackle (football move)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(football_move)", "score": 2}, {"id": "305436", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "score": 3}, {"id": "305661", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "National Football League"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League", "score": 5}, {"id": "305872", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "score": 4}, {"id": "310130", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "score": 2}, {"id": "310749", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Defensive end"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_end", "score": 2}, {"id": "311040", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "NFL Network"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Network", "score": 5}, {"id": "312088", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Undrafted free agent"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent#Undrafted_free_agent", "score": 2}, {"id": "314202", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "National Football League preseason"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League_preseason", "score": 4}, {"id": "322056", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Denver Broncos"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Broncos", "score": 4}, {"id": "324224", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Running back"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_back", "score": 2}, {"id": "331327", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "score": 4}, {"id": "352640", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Demaryius Thomas"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demaryius_Thomas", "score": 3}, {"id": "357365", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Carlos Hyde"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Hyde", "score": 2}, {"id": "364814", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Jared Crick"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Crick", "score": 2}, {"id": "369718", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Tim Hightower"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Hightower", "score": 2}, {"id": "374370", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Heir apparent"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heir_apparent", "score": 3}, {"id": "374950", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Kyle Shanahan"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Shanahan", "score": 2}, {"id": "378919", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Brian Hoyer"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Hoyer", "score": 2}, {"id": "515879", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Derek Wolfe"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_Wolfe", "score": 2}, {"id": "1272948", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Paxton Lynch"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxton_Lynch", "score": 3}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Lbij049d49AFRjv_fL_JMKlxXuM=/0x152:2098x1332/1600x900/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56267203/usa_today_9740665.0.jpg", "timeCrawl": "22:09:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Broncos vs. 49ers bring the late Saturday night preseason action", "originalArticle": null}

Whether he carries that momentum into Saturday's game could determine his fate.\n\nNeither Siemian (6-for-7, 51 YDS, 0 TD, 0 INT, 3 PTS) nor Lynch (6-for-9, 42 YDS, 0 TD, 0 INT, 0 PTS) was particularly impressive in the first preseason game, so the opportunity is there for the taking.\n\nWe asked the morning crew at MHSR what Lynch needs to do to claim the starting job. Here's what they had to say...\n\nPaxton should get three, maybe four drives. He needs to put up points on at least three drives, including a couple touchdowns. Siemian appears to be the leader in the clubhouse, so Lynch needs a big showing against an inferior 49ers team.\n\nIt's more likely that Paxton gets the job by default later in the season, but the number one thing he has to do is show he can make plays with his arm instead of his legs. Paxton scrambled four times in 13 drop backs against the Bears; it can't be more of the same against San Francisco.\n\nHe must get to his third read with regularity before running. He spoke earlier in the week about how he's improved his progressions in the passing game, now he has to show that he can do that in a game.\n\nBuild a time machine. The reality is, Lynch hasn't showed enough or worked hard enough to earn the starting job at this point in his career.\n\nPaxton must be demonstrably better than Trevor just to keep the competition open heading into the third preseason game next week against Green Bay. He needs to play nearly flawless football.\n\nHe's got to be better going into camp in 2018. There's nothing he can do at this point to earn the Week 1 starting job.

Most of the starters will work into the second half of that game.\n\nDenver's final preseason game will be only five days later at home against the Cardinals. Regular-season starters might make a token appearance, but this one will be the last chance to shine for those seeking permanent employment and a good view from the bench.\n\nJoseph, offensive coordinator Mike McCoy and quarterback coach Bill Musgrave can't go to that fourth preseason game not knowing who their QB is. They can't go into their third preseason game, the last bonding session for starters, not knowing.\n\nBarring a monster showing tonight against the 49ers -- say 150 yards passing, two TD passes and no interceptions in playing most of the first half -- Lynch's career is going to have to follow the path of Aaron Rodgers in Green Bay. Rodgers, like Lynch drafted late in the first round, sat for three seasons as a backup to Brett Favre before bursting onto the scene with a 4,000-yard, 28 TD performance in 2008.\n\nSo far, Lynch has done nothing to show he can be the Broncos' starting QB at this juncture. In splitting time with Siemian since OTAs in the spring, Lynch has, at best, stayed in the hunt. But leap ahead of Siemian? No way.\n\nHe must make a huge statement tonight to vault over last season's starter.\n\nSiemian will be Denver's starting quarterback and that will be announced on Monday.\n\nThen what?\n\nSiemian will go about the business of improving on last season's first-year effort and Lynch will spend another season listening and learning. Last week's darling, undrafted free agent Kyle Sloter, will do the practice squad bit. Draftee Chad Kelly will also factor in, but will likely be placed on injured reserve and spend lots of time getting to know Lynch and Sloter. What we saw last week as Sloter rallied the Broncos over the Bears was a mess: uncertainty at QB, conservative play calls that made for good video to evaluate, and play after play made by players we've never heard of.\n\nIt was ugly, but we did learn a few things:\n\nIsaiah McKenzie will make a difference in the return game and in the slot.\n\nCody Latimer has finally arrived and will be Denver's third receiver (seven receptions).\n\nDe'Angelo Henderson is going to be on this team at a running back spot (seven carries, 54 yards and a TD; two runs of 11 and 13 yards called back by penalty). Did you see a little Barry Sanders in him?\n\nChris Harris is a pretty good corner (pick-six on the third play of the game).\n\nDenver's starting defense will still be among the best (if, of course, players can get or stay healthy).\n\nThis is where we're at: Game 2 of preseason, a quarterback decision looming, depth being built because of too much injury misfortune, a new coaching staff trying to implement change.\n\nIn just more than three weeks, the Broncos must go from a roster of 90 to 53, must have the players and plays in fine fettle and, oh yes, be ready for the Los Angeles Chargers in a 9/11 Monday night game.", "dateTime": "2017-08-19T05:41:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 864, "textStart": 857, "imp": true, "date": "2017-08-26", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.4666666686534882, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3367820", "time": "05:41:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3367820", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "229192", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "230018", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "303732", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Employment"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment", "score": 3}, {"id": "304976", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Interception"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "score": 3}, {"id": "305439", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Offensive coordinator"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offensive_coordinator", "score": 3}, {"id": "305872", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "score": 5}, {"id": "312088", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Undrafted free agent"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent#Undrafted_free_agent", "score": 2}, {"id": "314205", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Green Bay Packers"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers", "score": 3}, {"id": "322056", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Denver Broncos"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Broncos", "score": 4}, {"id": "324224", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Running back"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_back", "score": 2}, {"id": "329201", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Practice squad"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout_team", "score": 2}, {"id": "331327", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "score": 3}, {"id": "337890", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Brett Favre"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Favre", "score": 2}, {"id": "339018", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Aaron Rodgers"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Rodgers", "score": 3}, {"id": "342457", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Injured reserve list"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injured_reserve_list", "score": 2}, {"id": "398793", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Mike McCoy (American football coach)"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_McCoy_(American_football_coach)", "score": 3}, {"id": "410382", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "West Coast offense"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast_offense", "score": 3}, {"id": "419752", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Bill Musgrave"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Musgrave", "score": 3}, {"id": "426903", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Barry Sanders"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Sanders", "score": 1}, {"id": "722378", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Angelo Henderson"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelo_Henderson", "score": 2}, {"id": "1270130", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Chad Kelly"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Kelly", "score": 2}, {"id": "1272948", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Paxton Lynch"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxton_Lynch", "score": 3}, {"id": "1285699", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Cody Latimer"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cody_Latimer", "score": 2}], "image": null, "timeCrawl": "06:21:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "Jussel: Siemian will beat out Lynch to be Broncos' QB", "originalArticle": null}

We've only played one preseason game and we've got to continue to let it develop, but he's taking this opportunity and I think doing a tremendous job with it.\"\n\nThe 31-year-old Hoyer served as the backup to Tom Brady in New England for the first three years of his career.

Despite not being recognized as a 'franchise' quarterback, Hoyer is going to get to the opportunity to be that guy for Lynch and the \"Niners.\"\n\n\"We've said from the beginning we want a franchise quarterback around here, and a lot of people are making assumptions as to what Brian's role is,\" Lynch added. \"Our response to Brian and to everybody is he's got the first crack of being that guy.\n\n\"And I love the way he's embracing that opportunity each and every day and really has been a tremendous leader for our group.\"\n\nRelated Items:FRS News, NFC West, NFL Today, San Francisco 49ers, Todays NFL News", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T16:31:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.4549019634723663, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3367820", "time": "16:31:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3367820", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "242110", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "England"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "305661", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "National Football League"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League", "score": 3}, {"id": "305800", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "score": 2}, {"id": "305872", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "score": 5}, {"id": "310098", "type": "org", "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Browns"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Browns", "score": 2}, {"id": "310476", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "score": 3}, {"id": "325074", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Tom Brady"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Brady", "score": 2}, {"id": "331327", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "score": 5}, {"id": "378919", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Brian Hoyer"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Hoyer", "score": 4}, {"id": "1290956", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Journeyman quarterback"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journeyman_quarterback", "score": 3}], "image": "https://d3d2maoophos6y.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/17112410/AP_17209697835767.jpg", "timeCrawl": "19:45:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "49ers John Lynch views Brian Hoyer as potential franchise quarterback", "originalArticle": null}

Miller forced two fumbles -- one was recovered for the Broncos' first touchdown of the game -- and had 2.5 sacks on the way to being named the Most Valuable Player.\n\nHis off-the-field profile exploded in the wake of what was one of the most dominant defensive performances in the championship game's history, and before the 2016 season he then signed the richest contract for a defensive player in league history -- worth $114.5 million.\n\nMiller spends time in the Bay Area in the offseason given that he now has a home there, and he held a \"pass rush summit\" at nearby Stanford University this offseason with many of the league's high-profile pass-rushers in attendance.\n\nMiller was a popular figure among the fans at Wednesday's practice -- easily the most sought-after Broncos player for autographs by folks wearing 49ers jerseys.\n\nMiller did also acknowledge that in addition to the Super Bowl trip the Broncos are 6-1 in his career in preseason and regular-season games combined in road games against the Oakland Raiders and 49ers. (The loss was the Broncos' 30-20 loss to the Raiders in Oakland last season. Wins include a regular-season victory to close out the 2016 season that Miller did not play in because he had suffered a torn ACL the week before against the Houston Texans.)\n\n\"San Francisco has always been good to me, the whole Bay Area has been good to us,\" Miller said. \"Throughout my whole career, I've only lost one game here, preseason, Oakland Raiders, San Francisco 49ers ... had a lot of great memories, for me and us as a team and as an organization.

That might still be the case, but the amount the defense benefited from going up against a different offense shouldn't be understated.\n\n\"It's great work for us to see a different color jersey and a different kind of scheme on both sides of the ball,\" head coach Vance Joseph said after Thursday's joint practice with the 49ers. \"It was a very productive practice.\"\n\nIf anything, the sessions gave the Broncos the opportunity to hit a different player than they've been hitting for the last three weeks.\n\n\"That's definitely the case,\" defensive coordinator Joe Woods said.\"You start training camp and you go against each other day in and day out. You get tired of going against our offense and our offense gets tired of going against us. So the change of scenery going against the 49ers was good. The competition level and the energy was good. It was just a good two days for us.\"\n\nThe 49ers are coming off off a tough 2016 season in which they only managed to walk away with two wins. Despite the fact that they ranked dead last in passing offense, San Francisco finished 2016 with the fourth-best rushing attack in the league. Seeing as how the Broncos' run defense was one of their main weaknesses in 2016, there were things that the 49ers could help them improve upon.\n\n\"It gives us a different look than we've been seeing,\" cornerback Aqib Talib said. \"It's a solid offense. Any time you can practice against a solid offense, no game plan, just go out there and play your technique, that's always great work.\"\n\nThe 49ers have made major moves to push the franchise in a different direction in the eight months since they only mustered two wins. The hiring of new head coach Kyle Shanahan gave the Broncos the opportunity to go up against one of the brightest offensive minds in the game twice before actually playing against him on Saturday.\n\n\"We might not see any teams that run this type of offense,\" cornerback Chris Harris Jr. said. \"We probably won't at all. Kyle Shanahan is probably one of, if he's not the best, he's one of them. The way he designs plays it's always a great work when you're going against his top offense.\"\n\n\"I know Kyle [Shanahan],\" Woods said. \"I worked with him for two years when we were in Tampa Bay. He has a great offensive mind. You know when you go against him, that you're going to go against good schemes and the running-pass scheme. If you can defend that and learn how to play, that will help you throughout the season.\"\n\nEven if the Broncos don't see an offense like Shanahan's the rest of the season, they'll be ready if they do.\n\n\"Going against Kyle Shanahan, he's a great offensive mind and a great offensive coach,\" Harris Jr. said. \"So it was a great week. You never know, we might see a team that has this type of offense.

And I understand guys see things, and they're not happy. They have that right, and I think we'll always respect people's rights. That doesn't mean I believe that. I believe this game should be celebrated for what it is. I think [it's] a tremendous unifier for our country and for the way things should be.\"\n\nLynch also noted that the team and its officials have no problem talking to the players concerning their feelings about protesting the anthem.\n\nThough, he seemed dismayed by the fact that the discord over the anthem protests has distracted people from the stories of unity and camaraderie, that one finds in the NFL.\n\n\"You take guys from all over the county, different socio-economic backgrounds, racial backgrounds, and you have friends for life,\" Lynch concluded. \"Those types of stories I think get lost in something like this. But they've got their reasons [for the protests], and we'll always be respectful of those.\"\n\nLynch's comments echoed those of Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll who said that he thinks everyone should stand for the anthem.", "dateTime": "2017-08-17T16:13:00Z", "extractedDates": null, "sim": 0.43529412150383, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3367820", "time": "16:13:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3367820", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "302614", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Country music"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music", "score": 2}, {"id": "303067", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Steve Young"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Young", "score": 3}, {"id": "305661", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "National Football League"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League", "score": 5}, {"id": "314202", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "National Football League preseason"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League_preseason", "score": 4}, {"id": "372655", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Jerry Rice"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Rice", "score": 3}, {"id": "399805", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Anthem"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthem", "score": 4}, {"id": "421087", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Mike Florio"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profootballtalk.com", "score": 3}], "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/08/KPReady-1.png", "timeCrawl": "19:45:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "49ers General Manager John Lynch Proclaims Anthem Protests 'Divisive'", "originalArticle": null}

That showed a lack of respect,\" Cheika said. \"I wouldn't be smart enough to get that sort of stuff organized. I am too busy working on my own thing.\"\n\nCheika has had a frosty relationship with his All Blacks counterpart Steve Hansen as he maintains his conviction that the bugging plot was hatched to discredit the Wallabies.\n\nGard has pleaded not guilty to a charge of public mischief, with police alleging he made a false claim regarding the bug.\n\nHansen is adamant the All Blacks have never implied the Wallabies were involved in the bugging incident.\n\n\"I don't know where they feel the inference was,\" Hansen said. \"We don't know who put it there. I said that at the time and that hasn't changed.\"\n\nThe Smith controversy has also intruded into the All Blacks' match preparation.\n\nA newspaper quoted a woman who had a sexual encounter with Smith at Dunedin Airport last September as saying Smith encouraged her to lie about the incident.\n\nSmith was suspended for a week after being sent home before a test match in South Africa but the newspaper alleges New Zealand Rugby didn't have the full facts when it levied punishment. New Zealand Rugby has opened a fresh inquiry to consider the new evidence.\n\nAt his news conference Thursday, Hansen raised the Smith issue before reporters asked.\n\n\"Obviously the incident happened last year. We dealt with it and we feel that we dealt with it decisively,\" Hansen said. \"There's nothing more that I can add to that but if there is anything else that needs to be spoken about, it will come from the New Zealand Rugby Union.\"\n\nThe issues swirling about the All Blacks might help decrease pressure on the Wallabies at a time of turmoil in Australian rugby. The poor performance of Australia's Super Rugby teams and the failure of the Australian Rugby Union in the process of cutting one of those teams next season has damaged the sport.\n\nA heavy loss by the Wallabies might compound those problems but Cheika has been able to prepare his players in relative quiet while the All Blacks have had to deal with off-field issues.\n\nCheika was able to name his team without undue scrutiny of his decision to include on one wing Curtis Rona -- a rugby league convert who has played 80 minutes at winger in his short rugby union career.

That showed a lack of respect,\" Cheika said. \"I wouldn't be smart enough to get that sort of stuff organized. I am too busy working on my own thing.\"\n\nCheika has had a frosty relationship with his All Blacks counterpart Steve Hansen as he maintains his conviction that the bugging plot was hatched to discredit the Wallabies.\n\nGard has pleaded not guilty to a charge of public mischief, with police alleging he made a false claim regarding the bug.\n\nHansen is adamant the All Blacks have never implied the Wallabies were involved in the bugging incident.\n\n\"I don't know where they feel the inference was,\" Hansen said. \"We don't know who put it there. I said that at the time and that hasn't changed.\"\n\nThe Smith controversy has also intruded into the All Blacks' match preparation.\n\nA newspaper quoted a woman who had a sexual encounter with Smith at Dunedin Airport last September as saying Smith encouraged her to lie about the incident.\n\nSmith was suspended for a week after being sent home before a test match in South Africa but the newspaper alleges New Zealand Rugby didn't have the full facts when it levied punishment. New Zealand Rugby has opened a fresh inquiry to consider the new evidence.\n\nAt his news conference Thursday, Hansen raised the Smith issue before reporters asked.\n\n\"Obviously the incident happened last year. We dealt with it and we feel that we dealt with it decisively,\" Hansen said. \"There's nothing more that I can add to that but if there is anything else that needs to be spoken about, it will come from the New Zealand Rugby Union.\"\n\nThe issues swirling about the All Blacks might help decrease pressure on the Wallabies at a time of turmoil in Australian rugby. The poor performance of Australia's Super Rugby teams and the failure of the Australian Rugby Union in the process of cutting one of those teams next season has damaged the sport.\n\nA heavy loss by the Wallabies might compound those problems but Cheika has been able to prepare his players in relative quiet while the All Blacks have had to deal with off-field issues.\n\nCheika was able to name his team without undue scrutiny of his decision to include on one wing Curtis Rona - a rugby league convert who has played 80 minutes at winger in his short rugby union career.

They completed a swift break in the corner after Jan Serfontein's attempted grubber kick was scooped up and Landajo was sent clear to dot down.\n\nBut a moment of magic by Skosan just before half-time, coupled with some weak Argentine defence, allowed the wing to score his maiden international try as the Boks headed into the break with a 13-5 advantage.\n\nThe teams traded penalties early in the second period, before the Boks took control of the game when Rhule rounded off some slick handling to cross for his try.\n\nAt that stage the Boks led by 15 points, but that was cut to seven when Boffelli crossed in the corner for the visitors after some concerted pressure in the home 22.\n\nWith 20 minutes to go the game was still in the balance, though the Boks continued to dominate possession and territory, and they made sure of the win as Kolisi and Du Toit crossed for tries against the wilting Argentine defence.\n\n\"South Africa had a great game,\" said Landajo. \"We need to improve at the breakdown, the ball was very slow.

it wasn't deemed to have been conducted by an independent source and therefore the findings were easy to shoot down and dismiss as credible.\n\nAnd if the investigation was initially re-opened more for appearances sake, that will no longer be the case given the information that has come to light in the Herald, with allegations that Smith was involved with another woman after he was disciplined for his infamous toilet tryst in Christchurch.\n\nAgain, while the situation with Kaino - a high profile, senior leader within the All Blacks - is not one that is enhancing of the standing or reputation of the national team, NZR has at least shut the door on the organisation being open to accusations it hasn't taken the matter seriously.\n\nKaino's alleged conduct, while lacking in personal value, wouldn't, if it is true, constitute a breach of either team protocol and certainly doesn't come under any scrutiny as an employment issue.\n\nNZR, could, therefore, have ignored the matter entirely on the basis that what Kaino does in his private life in his private time is his business.\n\nBut the lessons of last year have been learned and such a stance would have been naive. Kaino asking to come home on the morning of a major test is clearly a major story and everyone knows why he has asked to do that.\n\nThe reputational damage to the All Blacks brand - particularity given the situation with Smith - will be compounded and NZR has learned that saying nothing is not an option.\n\nInstead, a strong statement was issued by Tew that doesn't suggest the game is not without its problems, but it does at least provide some reassurance that the people asked to deal with these issues, are trying to do so.\n\n\"We certainly understand that our game and our players are under public scrutiny and these latest stories are concerning,\" said Tew.\n\n\"As an employer, we will take some time to assess this. While NZR does not wish to comment on individual behaviour, it is clear that this is really hurting rugby, all the people concerned, our fans and supporters. We take these issues very seriously, and are also mindful that these issues affect people with families and loved ones.\n\n\"At a time when we are grappling with our cultural reputation, the Respect and Responsibility Review, which is currently under way, is even more important.

On Saturday, the All Blacks led by that buffer at half-time.\n\nNew Zealand piled on an incredible six tries in the first half, which was more than they scored in the entire series against the British and Irish Lions.\n\nAnd when the All Blacks chalked up their eighth try in the 48th minute, thanks to a sensational pass back inside to Ben Smith from Aaron Smith, it marked the most points they had ever scored against Australia, from 182 matches.\n\nCheika may have boasted the Wallabies were fit and raring to go but they sure as anything didn't do enough work on their defensive structures in an abysmal effort.\n\nMeanwhile, after one of the most tumultuous weeks for New Zealand rugby in recent memory, the All Blacks were able to push to one side the off-field scandals and execute a game plan that completely blew the Wallabies off the park.\n\nHalfback Aaron Smith, whose \"toilet tryst\" last year resurfaced during the week as did fresh allegations of affairs with other women, had a brilliant game and was clearly unperturbed by what had transpired in recent days.\n\nCoach Steve Hansen's mind, however, would have been in two places hours before kick-off after it emerged New Zealand's team manager Darren Shand told police he believed Cheika was responsible for bugging the team's hotel last year.\n\nThe All Blacks, however, were more than able to separate on-field from off-field but will be annoyed they did not completely put Australia to the sword in the second half.\n\nTo the surprise of many, it was the Wallabies who got on the scoresheet first thanks to a penalty after four minutes to Bernard Foley on the back of some excellent attacking bursts in the All Blacks' 22.\n\nBut like they do so often, the All Blacks capitalised on a mistake from their opposition.\n\nAllan Alaalatoa knocked the ball on and shortly afterwards New Zealand were able to get auspicious front-foot ball before Liam Squire, Jerome Kaino's replacement, scored down the left edge.\n\nA Wallabies penalty brought the margin back to one point but that's about as good as it got for Cheika's men before a poor defensive read from Folau on the right edge saw Rieko Ioane put the visitors ahead 12-6.\n\nThe All Blacks, through Ioane and Ryan Crotty, then scored two tries in four minutes to put their tally at 26 points in as many minutes to silence a crowd of 54,846 at ANZ Stadium.\n\nAustralia's defensive line looked scrambled and they were unable to adapt on the run to countless questions asked by New Zealand's backs.\n\nRona scored a try on debut in the 52nd minute and when Kuridrani squeezed through a gap to go over the line in the 56th minute, Australia looked a completely different outfit.\n\nAttack-wise, there were things to like. Beale brought the flair we expected and scored Australia's third consecutive try when he scooped up a loose ball and ran 50 metres.\n\nThe 34 points the Wallabies racked up was actually the second-most against the All Blacks.\n\nThe bad news? There's another game next week ... in New Zealand.", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-3370531", "id": "10066871", "url": "http://www.canberratimes.com.au/rugby-union/union-news/wallabies-stunned-by-all-blacks-5434-in-bizarre-bledisloe-cup-opener-20170819-gy0042.html", "sim": 0.800000011920929, "details": {}, "uri": "711923358", "extractedDates": null, "eventUri": "eng-3370531", "image": "http://www.canberratimes.com.au/content/dam/images/g/y/0/0/k/6/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.gy0042.png/1503149169323.jpg", "timeCrawl": "14:03:00", "isDuplicate": false, "dateTime": "2017-08-19T14:03:00Z", "lang": "eng", "title": "Wallabies stunned by All Blacks 54-34 in bizarre Bledisloe Cup opener", "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_Union", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby Union", "id": 46}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/African", "label": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/African", "id": 757}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "id": 885}], "time": "14:03:00", "source": {"uri": "canberratimes.com.au", "title": "Canberra Times", "id": "2754"}, "date": "2017-08-19", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19"}

Sydney on Saturday.\n\nIt was New Zealand's biggest score over Australia, eclipsing their 51-20 win in Auckland three years ago and puts them well on he way to holding on to the trans-Tasman Bledisloe Cup, which they have held since 2003.\n\nNew Zealand's inability to put away the British and Irish Lions in their drawn home series last month had raised doubts whether the All Blacks' era of dominance was on the wane.\n\nBut the All Blacks roared back to outclass the Australians eight tries to four in a dynamic performance.\n\nWhile the Wallabies added some respectability to the final score after trailing 54-6 with four tries in the final half-hour the contest was well and truly over after the first 50 minutes.\n\nWhile it was a dominant Test for the All Blacks it plunged Australia rugby further in the gloom after a woeful Super Rugby season where Australian teams lost all their 26 games to New Zealand opposition.\n\nIt was played before the lowest Bledisloe Cup Test crowd at Sydney's Olympic stadium of 54,846.\n\nThe All Blacks demoralised the tackle-shy Wallabies with a six-try opening half to have the game wrapped up by half-time after a 40-6 landslide.\n\nWhile the Australians looked promising in attack they were clueless in defence with the world champions looking capable of scoring in every attacking phase.\n\nThe Wallabies left the field to stunned silence with their already tenuous Bledisloe Cup hopes in tatters with the All Blacks at home in the potentially deciding game in Dunedin next week.\n\nThe All Blacks scored their first try with quick passes from skipper Kieran Read and winger Rieko Ioane to give blindside flanker Liam Squire a clear run to the try-line.\n\nBernard Foley kicked the Wallabies to trail by a point with a 17th-minute penalty after the All Blacks scrum was penalised.\n\nBut the All Blacks again found a way through the Australian defence when left-winger Ioane got on the outside of floundering Israel Folau to score for a 12-6 lead midway through the half.\n\nIoane was over again minutes later when Michael Hooper's pass went astray and Ryan Crotty sent Ioane racing away between the posts.\n\n- Defence shredded -\n\nThe Wallabies defence was shredded again and Crotty scored an easy try near the posts after Beauden Barrett handled twice in the lead-up.\n\nThe New Zealanders claimed their fifth try just before half-time when Sonny Bill Williams crashed over and Barrett's conversion stretched the world champions' lead to 33-6.\n\nThe All Blacks made a mockery of the threadbare Australian defence with a sixth try off a training ground move and a double to centre Crotty after a scrum win deep inside the Wallabies' territory.\n\nBarrett's conversion gave the All Blacks an impregnable 40-6 lead at half-time.\n\nIt got no better with fullback Damian McKenzie scoring his first Test try three minutes after the resumption and Barrett's sixth conversion extended the lead to 47-6.\n\nWinger Ben Smith's try hoisted the All Blacks to their highest ever score against the Wallabies 54-6 and with still 30 minutes left in the one-sided Test.\n\nDebutant winger Curtis Rona finally scored Australia's first try after 52 minutes and further tries to replacement Tevita Kuridrani and a runaway from Kurtley Beale gave the home supporters something to cheer.\n\nIsrael Folau crossed for Australia's fourth try 11 minutes from the end.\n\nThe All Blacks continued their domination of the Wallabies and have lost only three of their last 30 encounters.", "originalArticle": null,

(Credit: AAP)\n\nIf Australian rugby fans needed any further reminding of the poor state of the game in this country it was provided by the All Blacks, who destroyed the Wallabies 54-34 in their Bledisloe Cup encounter in Sydney.\n\nThe final scoreline flattered the Wallabies, who were outclassed at the Olympic stadium by the All Blacks, with the world champions taking their foot off the pedal after they led 54-6 early in the second half.\n\nIt was the most points the All Blacks had ever scored against the Wallabies, who eventually grabbed some consolation tries through debutant Curtis Rona, Tevita Kuridrani, Kurtley Beale and Israel Folau.\n\nThe night belonged to the All Blacks, who issued a statement of how far ahead they are of their trans-Tasman rivals despite going through the motions for much of the second half.\n\nAustralia's provincial teams could not muster a win against their New Zealand counterparts during the Super Rugby season, an embarrassing statistic which was reflected in the All Blacks' dominance of the Wallabies on Saturday night.\n\nThe two sides will meet in the second Bledisloe Cup Test in Dunedin next Saturday.\n\n\"It is not the start we would have hoped for,\" Wallabies captain Michael Hooper said.\n\n\"Being 50 points behind, you start to throw everything we had, I'm so happy with that.\"\n\nThe All Blacks scored eight tries in total, six of which came in the first half with Rieko Ioane and Ryan Crotty both registering doubles before the break.\n\nThe contest was already over at half-time when the All Blacks led 40-6 and they moved further ahead inside eight minutes of the resumption of play courtesy of tries to Damian McKenzie and Ben Smith.\n\n\"It was pretty surreal that first half to be honest,\" All Blacks captain Kieran Read said.\n\n\"We came here to play our game and it really came off. It was a pretty awesome first half. It came about by the doing the simple things.\n\n\"We carried really hard and exploited a few gaps out wide.\"\n\nA crowd of just 54,846 spectators, the lowest ever for a Bledisloe Cup match at the Olympic stadium, were witnessing one of the Wallabies' worst performances before Rona finally scored the home side's first try in the 51st minute.\n\nKuridrani, Beale and Folau followed with their efforts across the stripe but it was clear the All Blacks had shut down, perhaps with thoughts already turning to the Dunedin encounter in a week's time.\n\nIf history is any guide, the Bledisloe Cup will remain in New Zealand hands for a 15th straight year with the Wallabies having never won a series after losing the first match at home.", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-3370531", "id": "10059033", "url": "http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/international/2017-08-19/bledisloe-cup-wallabies-thrashed-by-all-blacks-5434-in-series-opener-in-sydney/1695050", "sim": 0.7921568751335144, "details": {}, "uri": "711901655", "extractedDates": null, "eventUri": "eng-3370531", "image": "http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/sites/default/files/images/2017/08/19/8823922-3x2-700x467_1.jpg", "timeCrawl": "12:47:00", "isDuplicate": false, "dateTime": "2017-08-19T12:47:00Z", "lang": "eng", "title": "Bledisloe Cup: Wallabies thrashed by All Blacks 54-34 in series opener in Sydney", "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Events", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Events", "id": 48}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Events/Olympics", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Events/Olympics", "id": 53}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "id": 256}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/African", "label": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/African", "id": 757}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Visual_Arts/Photography", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Visual Arts/Photography", "id": 798}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "id": 885}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Relativity", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Relativity", "id": 886}], "time": "12:47:00", "source": {"uri": "radioaustralia.net.au", "title": "radioaustralia.net.au", "id": "4414"}, "date": "2017-08-19", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19"}

Australian teams lost all their 26 games to New Zealand opposition.\n\nAnother low was that the game was played before the smallest Bledisloe Cup Test crowd at Sydney's Olympic stadium of

eclipsing their 51-20 win in Auckland three years ago and puts them well on he way to holding on to the trans-Tasman Bledisloe Cup, which they have held since 2003.\n\nNew Zealand's inability to put away the British and Irish Lions in their drawn home series last month had raised doubts whether the All Blacks' era of dominance was on the wane.\n\nBut the All Blacks roared back to outclass the Australians eight tries to four in a dynamic performance.\n\nWhile the Wallabies added some respectability to the final score after trailing 54-6 with four tries in the final half-hour the contest was

champions looking capable of scoring in every attacking phase.\n\nThe Wallabies left the field to stunned silence with their already tenuous Bledisloe Cup hopes in tatters with the All Blacks at home in the potentially deciding game in Dunedin next week.\n\nThe All Blacks scored their first try with quick passes from skipper Kieran Read and winger Rieko Ioane to give blindside flanker Liam Squire a clear run to the try-line.\n\nBernard Foley kicked the Wallabies to trail by a point with a 17th-minute penalty after the All Blacks scrum was penalised.\n\nBut the All Blacks again found a way through the Australian defence when left-winger Ioane got on the outside of floundering Israel Folau to score for a 12-6 lead midway through the half.\n\nIoane was over again minutes later when Michael Hooper's pass went astray and Ryan Crotty sent Ioane racing away between the posts.\n\n- Defence shredded -\n\nAustralia's fullback Israel Folau scores a try during the Rugby Championship match against the New Zealand All Blacks in Sydney, on August 19, 2017\n\nThe Wallabies defence was shredded again and Crotty scored an easy try near the posts after Beauden Barrett handled twice in the lead-up.\n\nThe New Zealanders claimed their fifth try just before half-time when Sonny Bill Williams crashed over and Barrett's conversion stretched the world champions' lead to 33-6.\n\nThe All Blacks made a mockery of the threadbare Australian defence with a sixth try off a training ground move and a double to centre Crotty after a scrum win deep inside the Wallabies' territory.\n\nBarrett's conversion gave the All Blacks an impregnable 40-6 lead at half-time.\n\nIt got no better with fullback Damian McKenzie scoring his first Test try three minutes after the resumption and Barrett's sixth conversion extended the lead to 47-6.\n\nWinger Ben Smith's try hoisted the All Blacks to their highest ever score against the Wallabies 54-6 and with still 30 minutes left in the one-sided Test.\n\nDebutant winger Curtis Rona finally scored Australia's first try after 52 minutes and further tries to replacement Tevita Kuridrani and a runaway from Kurtley Beale gave

The world champion All Blacks rebounded spectacularly to down the Wallabies 54-34 and plunge Australian rugby further into despair in the Rugby Championship opener in Sydney on Saturday.\n\nIt was New Zealand's biggest score over Australia, eclipsing their 51-20 win in Auckland three years ago and puts them well on the way to holding on to the trans-Tasman Bledisloe Cup, which they have held since 2003.\n\nNew Zealand's inability to put away the British and Irish Lions in their drawn home series last month had raised doubts whether the All Blacks' era of dominance was on the wane.\n\nBut the All Blacks roared back to outclass the Australians eight tries to four in a dynamic performance.\n\nWhile the Wallabies added some respectability to the final score after trailing 54-6 with four tries in the final half-hour the contest was well and truly over after the first 50 minutes.\n\nWhile it was a dominant Test for the All Blacks it plunged Australia rugby further in the gloom after a woeful Super Rugby season where Australian teams lost all their 26 games to New Zealand opposition.\n\nIt was played before the lowest Bledisloe Cup Test crowd at Sydney's Olympic stadium of 54,846.\n\nThe All Blacks demoralised the tackle-shy Wallabies with a six-try opening half to have the game wrapped up by half-time after a 40-6 landslide.\n\nWhile the Australians looked promising in attack they were clueless in defence with the world champions looking capable of scoring in every attacking phase.\n\nThe Wallabies left the field to stunned silence with their already tenuous Bledisloe Cup hopes in tatters with the All Blacks at home in the potentially deciding game in Dunedin next week.\n\nThe All Blacks scored their first try with quick passes from skipper Kieran Read and winger Rieko Ioane to give blindside flanker Liam Squire a clear run to the try-line.\n\nBernard Foley kicked the Wallabies to trail by a point with a 17th-minute penalty after the All Blacks scrum was penalised.\n\nBut the All Blacks again found a way through the Australian defence when left-winger Ioane got on the outside of floundering Israel Folau to score for a 12-6 lead midway through the half.\n\nIoane was over again minutes later when Michael Hooper's pass went astray and Ryan Crotty sent Ioane racing away between the posts.\n\nThe Wallabies defence was shredded again and Crotty scored an easy try near the posts after Beauden Barrett handled twice in the lead-up.\n\nThe New Zealanders claimed their fifth try just before half-time when Sonny Bill Williams crashed over and Barrett's conversion stretched the world champions' lead to 33-6.\n\nThe All Blacks made a mockery of the threadbare Australian defence with a sixth try off a training ground move and a double to centre Crotty after a scrum win deep inside the Wallabies' territory.\n\nBarrett's conversion gave the All Blacks an impregnable 40-6 lead at half-time.\n\nIt got no better with fullback Damian McKenzie scoring his first Test try three minutes after the resumption and Barrett's sixth conversion extended the lead to 47-6.\n\nWinger Ben Smith's try hoisted the All Blacks to their highest ever score against the Wallabies 54-6 and with still 30 minutes left in the one-sided Test.\n\nDebutant winger Curtis Rona finally scored Australia's first try after 52 minutes and further tries to replacement Tevita Kuridrani and a runaway from Kurtley Beale gave the home supporters something to cheer.\n\nIsrael Folau crossed for Australia's fourth try 11 minutes from the end.\n\nThe All Blacks continued their domination of the Wallabies and have lost only three of their last 30 encounters.\n\nAFP\n\nLike us on Facebook\n\nFollow us on Twitter", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-3370531", "id": "10065206", "url": "https://www.iol.co.za/sport/rugby/all-blacks-seal-sensational-win-over-australia-10858102", "sim": 0.7764706015586853, "details": {}, "uri": "711898067", "extractedDates": null, "eventUri": "eng-3370531", "image": "https://image.iol.co.za/image/1/process/620x349?source=https://inm-baobab-prod-eu-west-1.s3.amazonaws.com/public/inm/media/2017/08/19/iol/981/06151086.jpg&operation=CROP&offset=0x191&resize=3188x1790", "timeCrawl": "12:32:00", "isDuplicate": false, "dateTime": "2017-08-19T12:32:00Z", "lang": "eng", "title": "All Blacks seal sensational win over Australia | IOL Sport", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/African", "label": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/African", "id": 757}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "id": 885}], "time": "12:32:00", "source": {"uri": "iol.co.za", "title": "IOL", "id": "1546"}, "date": "2017-08-19", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19"}

Fullback McKenzie got his first try in three tests, and flanker Squire scored his second try in eight tests as the All Blacks led 40-6 at halftime - and six tries to nil.\n\nAustralia rallied with four converted tries in the second half, to winger Curtis Rona on debut, centers Tevita Kuridrani and Kurtley Beale, and fullback Israel Folau.\n\nNew Zealand's points score in Australia exceeded its 51-20 win in 2014, though the winning margin fell short of its record 43-6 victory in 1996. At one point Saturday, the All Blacks led 54-6.\n\nThe result fomented a deeper crisis within Australian rugby which was already struggling after its worst-ever Super Rugby season in which its teams lost all 26 matches against New Zealand opponents.\n\nThe Wallabies hoped to bring some solace to fans who have begun to turn away from the sport because of administrative issues and poor on-field performance. Instead, they compounded the impression that the sport in Australia is in disarray.\n\nNew Zealand should have won more convincingly but lost its way after halftime.\n\n\"I think in the second half we let frustration strangle us a little bit,\" All Blacks captain Kieran Read said. \"We just needed to dump that and get back to playing some simple footy.\n\n\"We showed in the first half we really just let the ball do the work - nothing special but it just worked for us. I think the first half was good and we were okay in patches of the second half but we conceded 34 points which means most days of the week you're going to be losing test matches. But you can't fault that first half. It was bloody fantastic.\"\n\nMcKenzie played creative roles in an early try for Squire and in Ioane's double, after Australia had led with a third-minute penalty to Bernard Foley.\n\nThe fullback's line-break began the movement in the 18th minute, leading to Squire being given a wide corridor down the left-hand touch to outflank the Wallabies' defense. Beauden Barrett's conversion gave the All Blacks a 7-3 lead on which they built steadily throughout the first half.\n\nMcKenzie was again instrumental in making Ioane's first try, breaking the defense and leaving the winger to win an easy one-on-one with Folau, who rushed out of position.\n\nIoane had his double when a rushed pass caused Beale to cough up possession to Ryan Crotty, who drew defenders before allowing the pacy winger to sprint away.\n\nCrotty had his first try in the 25th minute after prop Joe Moody and lock Brodie Retallick had broken the Australian defense and McKenzie combined with Barrett to leave the line open.\n\nSonny Bill Williams crashed over in the 34th, then Crotty scored his second try when scrumhalf Aaron Smith passed to him directly from an attacking scrum in the last minute of the first half.\n\nThe All Blacks took a 40-6 lead to halftime and the game was already over. New Zealand had taken a major step toward retaining the Bledisloe Cup which it has held since 2003.\n\nIts grip on the match became more emphatic when McKenzie scored a brilliant try in the third minute of the second half, then Ben Smith added another from a break by Squire.\n\nNew Zealand seemed headed for an historic winning margin but the tide turned from then on.\n\nRona scored a good try from a set move at a scrum in the 52nd to lift Australian spirits. Kuridrani came off the bench and scored a neat try from a double-round in midfield to make the score 54-20.\n\nBeale, playing his first test since the 2015 World Cup final between Australia and New Zealand, pounced on a loose ball and dashed away in the 62nd, then Folau scored a contentious try, which appeared to begin from a forward pass by Foley and to continue with an offside play by Folau.\n\nThe All Blacks might have surpassed 60 points with a late try to Barrett but the score was overruled by the television official.\n\n\"The Wallabies were certainly going to come out firing in that second half. They did and we just took our foot off the throat a bit,\" Read said. \"We'll take the positives and there's obviously things to learn from. It's not often you come here and put 50 points on the Wallabies.\"", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-3374401", "id": "10059971", "url": "http://www.foxsports.com/rugby/story/rugby-championship-8-tries-for-nz-in-54-34-win-v-australia-081917", "sim": 0.772549033164978, "details": {}, "uri": "711904441", "extractedDates": null, "eventUri": "eng-3370531", "image": "https://b.fssta.com/uploads/2017/08/201708190649245414032-p2.vresize.440.220.high.0.jpeg", "timeCrawl": "12:57:00", "isDuplicate": false, "dateTime": "2017-08-19T12:57:00Z", "lang": "eng", "title": "Rugby Championship: 8 tries for NZ in 54-34 win v Australia | FOX Sports", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "categories": [], "time": "12:57:00", "source": {"uri": "foxsports.com", "title": "FOX Sports", "id": "276"}, "date": "2017-08-19", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19"}

Zealand's Rugby Championship campaign suffered another setback just hours before their opening match against Australia after veteran flanker Jerome Kaino flew home from Syndey following revelations about his personal life.\n\nJust a day after New Zealand Rugby reopened the investigation into scrum-half Aaron Smith and his sex scandal with another woman at Christchurch Airport last September, flanker Kaino has found himself at the centre of a similar controversy.\n\nKaino was unusually left out of Steve Hansen's side when he named his squad for the Bledisloe Cup match in Sydney, and on Saturday morning it was reported in the Australian media that that 34-year-old has been having an alleged affair with a 24-year-old former model.\n\nRead more Smith scandal revelations no coincidence ahead of Rugby Championship\n\nKaino's wife, Diana, posted a message on Facebook that read \"Devastated\" on Saturday morning, before deleting the post, and the Blues forward flew back to Auckland due to what was said to be \"personal reasons\".\n\nThe two scandals have overshadowed the All Blacks' preparations for their Rugby Championship defence, which kicked off on Saturday against the Wallabies in Syndey, and NZR chief executive Steve Tew issued a statement to address the two incidents.\n\n\"We certainly understand that our game and our players are under public scrutiny and these latest stories are concerning,\" Tew said in a statement. \"As an employer, we will take some time to assess this.\n\n34-year-old Kaino's international career could now be in doubt (Getty)\n\n\"While NZR does not wish to comment on individual behaviour, it is clear that this is really hurting rugby, all the people concerned, our fans and supporters.\n\n\"We take these issues very seriously, and are also mindful that these issues affect people with families and loved ones.\"\n\nNZR are already reviewing the culture of New Zealand rugby and its treatment of women, following revelations about the Waikato Chiefs' behaviour on 'Mad Monday' last year when they hired an exotic dancer, who accused them of touching her inappropriately and throwing alcohol in her direction.\n\nKaino flew back to Auckland ahead of the Bledisloe Cup clash (Getty)\n\nTew added that the report could be made publically available as early as next month.\n\n\"At a time when we are grappling with our cultural reputation, the respect and responsibility review, which is currently under way, is even more important,\" Tew said.\n\n\"The review is being presented to the NZR Board this month and we are looking to make that public sometime in September.\"\n\nMore about: New Zealand rugby Jerome Kaino Rugby Championship Reuse content", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-3373462", "id": "10050661",

Well, for 50 minutes anyway.\n\nThe Bledisloe opener looked more like a Rugby World Cup game featuring New Zealand and a minnow nation as the Wallabies had little answer to the All Blacks' mix of speed, power and skill. That the Australians missed a double-decker busload of tackles certainly did help their cause.\n\nEarly on it appeared the Wallabies might offer some sort of opposition as they moved up field, at times even threatening to poke their noses through the defensive line. But they could manage only two penalties while the All Blacks ripped through the heart of the Australian defence, dancing down the touchline with effortless ease.\n\nLiam Squire set the tone for a scintillating half of attacking rugby from the All Blacks when he skipped down the left touchline for the game's opening try on 10 minutes, before Rieko Ioane and Ryan Crotty added doubles, and Sonny Bill Williams wrote his name on the scoresheet before halftime. Job done.\n\nThe home fans among the 54,846 on hand looked on in stunned disbelief with the score at 40-6 at the break while their All Blacks counterparts beamed from ear to ear - the controversial finish to the Lions series now nothing more than a distant memory.\n\nPlaying just his third Test, Super Rugby's standout player of 2017 Damian McKenzie enjoyed a marvellous first Bledisloe foray; the diminutive but elusive fullback cutting through the Wallabies at ease as he helped set the platform for a handful of the All Blacks' six first-half tries. But it was the All Blacks' collective catch-and-pass skillset that shone, something that went missing for much of the final two Tests against the Lions.\n\nAnd then there was the tissue-paper-like Wallabies defence that fell off tackles, made terrible defensive decisions and basically lacked any desire whatsoever to hurt the All Blacks in the tackle.\n\nThe Wallabies compounded their missed tackles with simple errors in attack, an offer the All Blacks gleefully accepted just four minutes after the break when McKenzie was rewarded for his stellar first half via an unselfish Ioane. Four minutes later it was Ben Smith's turn, the only surprise that it had taken Ben Smith 48 minutes to get in on the action.\n\nWith 48 minutes on the clock, the All Blacks had scored 54 points.\n\nIt certainly won't be an evening that Wallabies debutant Curtis Rona forgets in a hurry, but at least he had a try on his Test bow to soften the blow. Rona's five-pointer stemmed the flow of 47 straight All Blacks points, and the Wallabies soon had their second through replacement Tevita Kuridrani, who worked a one-two with Folau to cut through the All Blacks' defence. Suddenly it was only 54-20.\n\nKurtley Beale further reduced the gap again when he swooped on a loose ball and ran 50 metres to score the Wallabies third just after the hour mark, adding further respectability to the contest.\n\nIn what was a bizarre final quarter, Folau was then awarded a try despite what looked to be giant forward pass from Bernard Foley. But neither referee Wayne Barnes, assistant Nigel Owens nor the Television Match Official saw it that way and the margin was now just a paltry 20 points.\n\nBut it did little more than paper over the Grand Canyon-like cracks in this Wallabies outfit. The job done, and then some, by halftime, it was no surprise the All Blacks eased up. The world champions proving a major point on the paddock, after a tumultuous week off it. Coach Steve Hansen won't be thrilled by the way his side faded to finish with the 54-34 win, but he will be ecstatic with what was a devastatingly brilliant first 50 minutes.\n\nAnd the All Blacks know they are now just 80 minutes away from another year of ownership of the Bledisloe Cup. That job, in all likelihood, will be completed in Dunedin in seven days' time.\n\nIt's up to the Wallabies to make a game of it. To halftime at least.", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-3370531", "id": "10063978", "url": "http://www.espn.co.uk/rugby/report?gameId=291158&league=244293", "sim": 0.7686274647712708, "details": {}, "uri": "711916434", "extractedDates": null, "eventUri": "eng-3370531", "image": "http://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fi%2Fespn%2Fespn_logos%2Fespn_red.png", "timeCrawl": "13:36:00", "isDuplicate": false, "dateTime": "2017-08-19T13:36:00Z", "lang": "eng", "title": "Australia vs New Zealand - Report - Rugby Championship 2017 - 19 Aug, 2017 - ESPN", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_Union", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby Union", "id": 46}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "id": 47}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/African", "label": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/African", "id": 757}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Visual_Arts/Photography", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Visual Arts/Photography", "id": 798}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "id": 885}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Relativity", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Relativity", "id": 886}], "time": "13:36:00", "source": {"uri": "espn.co.uk", "title": "ESPN.com", "id": "4451"}, "date": "2017-08-19", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19"}

That showed a lack of respect,\" Cheika said. \"I wouldn't be smart enough to get that sort of stuff organized. I am too busy working on my own thing.\"\n\nCheika has had a frosty relationship with his All Blacks counterpart Steve Hansen as he maintains his conviction that the bugging plot was hatched to discredit the Wallabies.\n\nGard has pleaded not guilty to a charge of public mischief, with police alleging he made a false claim regarding the bug.\n\nHansen is adamant the All Blacks have never implied the Wallabies were involved in the bugging incident.\n\n\"I don't know where they feel the inference was,\" Hansen said. \"We don't know who put it there. I said that at the time and that hasn't changed.\"\n\nThe Smith controversy has also intruded into the All Blacks' match preparation.\n\nA newspaper quoted a woman who had a sexual encounter with Smith at Dunedin Airport last September as saying Smith encouraged her to lie about the incident.\n\nSmith was suspended for a week after being sent home before a test match in South Africa but the newspaper alleges New Zealand Rugby didn't have the full facts when it levied punishment. New Zealand Rugby has opened a fresh inquiry to consider the new evidence.\n\nAt his news conference Thursday, Hansen raised the Smith issue before reporters asked.\n\n\"Obviously the incident happened last year. We dealt with it and we feel that we dealt with it decisively,\" Hansen said. \"There's nothing more that I can add to that but if there is anything else that needs to be spoken about, it will come from the New Zealand Rugby Union.\"\n\nThe issues swirling about the All Blacks might help decrease pressure on the Wallabies at a time of turmoil in Australian rugby. The poor performance of Australia's Super Rugby teams and the failure of the Australian Rugby Union in the process of cutting one of those teams next season has damaged the sport.\n\nA heavy loss by the Wallabies might compound those problems but Cheika has been able to prepare his players in relative quiet while the All Blacks have had to deal with off-field issues.\n\nCheika was able to name his team without undue scrutiny of his decision to include on one wing Curtis Rona - a rugby league convert who has played 80 minutes at winger in his short rugby union career. The All Blacks team announcement, which could have concentrated on a reorganized back three and the dropping of veteran flanker Jerome Kaino, instead was overshadowed by Smith and bugging.\n\n--\n\nAP Sports Writer Steve McMorran contributed from Wellington, New Zealand", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-3370531", "id": "9813743", "url": "http://www.foxsports.com/rugby/story/all-blacks-wallabies-take-rivalry-off-field-before-1st-test-081717", "sim": 0.7647058963775635, "details": {}, "uri": "711222886", "extractedDates": null, "eventUri": "eng-3370531", "image": "https://b.fssta.com/uploads/2017/08/201708161520552536088-p2-3.vresize.440.220.high.0.jpeg", "timeCrawl": "03:07:00", "isDuplicate": false, "dateTime": "2017-08-18T03:07:00Z", "lang": "eng", "title": "All Blacks, Wallabies take rivalry off field before 1st test | FOX Sports", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "id": 31}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_Union", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby Union", "id": 46}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "id": 47}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/African", "label": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/African", "id": 757}], "time": "03:07:00", "source": {"uri": "foxsports.com", "title": "FOX Sports", "id": "276"}, "date": "2017-08-18", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18"}

Argentina 15: Courtnall Skosan, Raymond Rhule, Siya Kolisi and Pieter-Steph du Toit all crossed the whitewash\n\nSouth Africa strong-armed their way past Argentina to secure a four-try win in their Rugby Championship opener.\n\nThe Springboks ground past the Pumas 37-15 in Port Elizabeth with Courtnall Skosan, Raymond Rhule, Siya Kolisi and Pieter-Steph du Toit all crossing the whitewash.\n\nMartin Landajo and Emiliano Boffelli claimed tries for the ever attack-minded Pumas, but the visitors were unable to contain the Springboks' power, especially at the set-piece.\n\nSkosan and Rhule registered their first Test tries as the Springboks got their Rugby Championship campaign up and running in style.\n\nRaymond Rhule breaks through the Argentinian defence (Getty)\n\nElton Jantjies slotted three penalties to add to his four conversions, while Nicolas Sanchez posted a penalty for Argentina and Juan Martin Hernandez converted Boffelli's try.\n\nSouth Africa were made to wait for their breakthroughs despite eventually coasting home, with Jantjies landing two penalties for a 6-0 lead at the end of the first quarter.\n\nPumas scrum-half Landajo actually opened the try-scoring, capping a typically opportune attack.\n\nBut once Skosan crossed the hosts were able to take control, especially after half-time.\n\nAgustin Creevy makes a pass to Pablo Matera (Getty)\n\nSouth Africa led just 13-5 at the break and so were able to pile on the points after the interval, once their pack had wrestled full control.\n\nJan Serfontein's clever miss-pass allowed Rhule to dot down for the first try of the second half, only for Boffelli to hit back as the Pumas were rewarded for patient build-up with a neat score.\n\nCentre Serfontein turned provider for the Springboks once again to set the hosts back on track however, this time his neat offload allowing Kolisi to claim his second Test try.\n\nAnd after another dominant scrum Du Toit wriggled the ball to

Full-back McKenzie got his first try in three tests, and flanker Squire scored his second try in eight tests as the All Blacks led 40-6 at half-time - and six tries to nil.\n\nAustralia rallied with four converted second-half tries - from winger Curtis Rona on his debut, centres Tevita Kuridrani and Kurtley Beale, and full-back Israel Folau.\n\nNew Zealand's score exceeded its 51-20 win in 2014, though the winning margin fell short of its record 43-6 victory in 1996. At one point, the All Blacks led 54-6.\n\nThe Wallabies hoped to bring some solace to fans who have begun to turn away from the sport because of administrative issues and poor on-field performance. Instead, they compounded the impression that the sport in Australia is in disarray - and New Zealand should have won more convincingly.\n\n\"I think in the second half we let frustration strangle us a little bit,\" All Blacks captain Kieran Read said. \"We just needed to get back to playing some simple footy.\n\n\"We showed in the first half that we really just let the ball do the work.

Beauden Barrett's conversion gave the All Blacks a 7-3 lead.\n\nMcKenzie was again instrumental in Ioane's first try, leaving the winger in an easy one-on-one with Folau.\n\nIoane had his double when a rushed pass caused Beale to cough up possession to Ryan Crotty, who drew defenders before allowing the pacy winger to sprint away.\n\nCrotty had his first try in the 25th minute after McKenzie combined with Barrett to leave the line open.\n\nSonny Bill Williams crashed over in the 34th, then Crotty scored his second in the last minute of the first half.\n\nThe All Blacks took a 40-6 lead to halftime and the game was already over.

Kuridrani came off the bench and scored a neat try from a double-round in midfield to make the score 54-20.\n\nBeale pounced on a loose ball and dashed away in the 62nd minute, then Folau scored a contentious try, which appeared to begin from a forward pass by Foley.\n\nThe All Blacks might have surpassed 60 points with a late Barrett try but the score was overruled by the television official.", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-3374401", "id": "10072235", "url": "http://www.scotsman.com/sport/rugby-union/australia-34-54-new-zealand-all-blacks-blitz-wallabies-1-4536629", "sim": 0.7568627595901489, "details": {}, "uri": "711937651", "extractedDates": null, "eventUri": "eng-3370531", "image": "https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_300,f_auto,ar_3:2,c_fill/http://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4536628.1503153712!/image/image.jpg", "timeCrawl": "14:50:00", "isDuplicate": false, "dateTime": "2017-08-19T14:50:00Z", "lang": "eng", "title": "Australia 34 - 54 New Zealand: All Blacks blitz Wallabies", "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "id": 546}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/African", "label": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/African", "id": 757}], "time": "14:50:00", "source": {"uri": "scotsman.com", "title": "The Scotsman", "id": "1205"}, "date": "2017-08-19", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19"}

registered a record points tally over Australia in a Test match as they began their Rugby Championship defence with a crushing 54-34 victory in Sydney.\n\nThe All Blacks scored eight tries through Liam Squire, Rieko Ioane (2), Ryan Crotty (2), Sonny Bill Williams, Damian McKenzie and Ben Smith.\n\nAustralia scored four of their own in the second period through Curtis Rona, Tevita Kuridrani, Kurtley Beale and Israel Folau to add some respectability to the scoreline.\n\nAustralia now travel to face the All Blacks in Dunedin next Saturday.\n\nA frenetic start saw Australia break around the corner after lovely hands from second-row Sam Arnold and prop Scott Sio, and after several phases of pressure New Zealand were pinged for offside under their own posts and Bernard Foley stepped up to give the Wallabies a 3-0 lead after four minutes.\n\nNew Zealand responded within five minutes though through blindside flanker Squire, who showed great pace to burn past Samu Kerevi and race into the corner after McKenzie had make the original break and Kieran Read showed great hands to ship it on.\n\nAustralia responded with more forays into the 22 and after Owen Franks was pinged for pushing early and going to his knees at the next scrum, Foley kicked his second penalty of the game to bring them back to within one at 7-6 down.\n\nFrom the restart the All Blacks regained possession off a short kick-off, however, and after McKenzie and Ben Smith made good yards, New Zealand generated quick ball to Ioane, who checked Folau and finished well in the same corner that Squire had before him for their second try.\n\nIoane had his second and New Zealand's third try two minutes later after Crotty intercepted Foley's pass and shipped it onto the wing, who sprinted clear under the sticks.\n\nCrotty then scored a try of his own as Australia could not live with the All Blacks' intensity and pace.\n\nA flowing move started when prop Joe Moody sold a dummy and made good ground before offloading to lock Brodie Retallick, who produced a wonderful step, and from there quick ball saw Beauden Barrett find Crotty and the centre dived over from close range for a 26-6 lead after just 26 minutes.\n\nWilliams then crashed over for his 11th Test try on 34 minutes as he bulldozed past Speight and went over with the Australia defence increasingly porous after more quick ball from an All Black five-metre lineout.\n\nIn the final minute of the half Australia were penalised in their 22 again and after Read called a scrum, a set-piece move saw Crotty go over once more after Williams drew in two men.\n\nAmazingly, after Barrett's conversion, the All Blacks went in at the break with a lead of 40-6; a scoring rate of a point a minute.\n\nTwo minutes into the second period and the onslaught continued as Barrett ripped the ball off Hooper on half-way and found Ioane, who fed McKenzie on his shoulder with a clear run-in for his first Test try.\n\nBen Smith got in on the act after Squire cut through three attempted Wallby tackles and his namesake Aaron Smith found him on the inside, before Australia scored their first tries of the game through Rona on debut and replacement Kuridrani.\n\nBeale kept the spirited Wallabies response going when he raced away for an intercept try before Folau collected a ball which went to deck off Kuridrani's knee and ran in to rack up 34 points for Australia with 10 minutes to go, but that proved to be the end of the scoring.", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-3374401", "id": "10062594", "url":

That showed a lack of respect,\" Cheika said. \"I wouldn't be smart enough to get that sort of stuff organized. I am too busy working on my own thing.\"\n\nCheika has had a frosty relationship with his All Blacks counterpart Steve Hansen as he maintains his conviction that the bugging plot was hatched to discredit the Wallabies.\n\nHansen is adamant the All Blacks have never implied the Wallabies were involved in the bugging incident.\n\n\"I don't know where they feel the inference was,\" Hansen said. \"We don't know who put it there. I said that at the time and that hasn't changed.\"\n\nThe Smith controversy has also intruded into the All Blacks' match preparation.\n\nA newspaper quoted a woman who had a sexual encounter with Smith at Dunedin Airport last September as saying Smith encouraged her to lie about the incident.\n\nSmith was suspended for a week after being sent home before a test match in South Africa but the newspaper alleges New Zealand Rugby didn't have the full facts when it levied punishment. New Zealand Rugby has opened a fresh inquiry to consider the new evidence.\n\nAt his news conference Thursday, Hansen raised the Smith issue before reporters asked.\n\n\"Obviously the incident happened last year. We dealt with it and we feel that we dealt with it decisively,\" Hansen said. \"There's nothing more that I can add to that but if there is anything else that needs to be spoken about, it will come from the New Zealand Rugby Union.\"\n\nThe issues swirling about the All Blacks might help decrease pressure on the Wallabies at a time of turmoil in Australian rugby. The poor performance of Australia's Super Rugby teams and the failure of the Australian Rugby Union in the process of cutting one of those teams next season has damaged the sport.\n\nA heavy loss by the Wallabies might compound those problems but Cheika has been able to prepare his players in relative quiet while the All Blacks have had to deal with off-field issues.\n\nCheika was able to name his team without undue scrutiny of his decision to include on one wing Curtis Rona -- a rugby league convert who has played 80 minutes at winger in his short rugby union career. The All Blacks team announcement, which could have concentrated on a reorganized back three and the dropping of veteran flanker Jerome Kaino, instead was overshadowed by Smith and bugging.", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-3370531", "id": "10009887", "url": "http://www.pattayamail.com/worldsports/blacks-wallabies-take-rivalry-off-field-1st-test-183851", "sim": 0.7568627595901489, "details": {}, "uri": "711758053", "extractedDates": null, "eventUri": "eng-3370531", "image": "http://www.pattayamail.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/19-8-17s5-Rugby.jpg", "timeCrawl": "03:53:00", "isDuplicate": false, "dateTime": "2017-08-19T03:53:00Z", "lang": "eng", "title": "All Blacks, Wallabies take rivalry off field before 1st test - Pattaya Mail", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Sydney"}, "country": {"label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "type": "country"}, "type": "place"}, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "id": 31}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_Union", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby Union", "id": 46}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "id": 47}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/African", "label": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/African", "id": 757}], "time": "03:53:00", "source": {"uri": "pattayamail.com", "title": "Pattaya Mail", "id": "14452"}, "date": "2017-08-19", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19"}

yesterday.\n\nThe Wallabies have a chance to lift some of the gloom hanging over Australian rugby tomorrow, but to do so they will have to achieve the considerable feat of upsetting the All Blacks in the Rugby Championship opener.\n\nA miserable Super Rugby campaign, during which none of the nation's five teams beat New Zealand-based opponents in 26 attempts, was accompanied by the bitter and protracted effort to shut down the Western Force.\n\nWhile that public-relations disaster rumbled on, Australia coach Michael Cheika has had his players in a training camp for a month, plotting to take down the world champions in the first of three Bledisloe Cup Tests this year.\n\nThat lengthy preparation time and the talent at Cheika's disposal makes the Wallabies a \"dangerous beast,\" All Blacks coach Steve Hansen said yesterday.\n\n\"The third thing that makes them really dangerous is their desire to try to help Australian rugby and at the moment it has a bit of a cloud over it,\" Hansen told reporters. \"They haven't won the Bledisloe in a long time and they're pretty hungry for it so, as a team, we have to be hungrier than them, otherwise we're at a disadvantage.\"\n\nAustralia have not held the trophy that symbolizes tran-Tasman rugby supremacy since 2002 and the bookmakers do not share Hansen's caution, making the All Blacks 1-10 favorites to win at the Olympic Stadium.\n\nMoreover, New Zealand begin the defense of their Rugby Championship title feeling they have a point to prove after losing a Test at home for the first time in eight years during the drawn British and Irish Lions series in June.\n\nHansen has summoned the latest explosive back off the New Zealand production line by awarding Damian McKenzie the start at fullback and slotted the rugged Liam Squire into his back row to give Jerome Kaino a rest.\n\nSonny Bill Williams is back in the centers after serving his four-match ban for the red card he was shown during the Lions series and he is to line up opposite Kurtley Beale, who plays his first Test since the 2015 World Cup final.\n\nThat run leading up to the world title decider at Twickenham is now a distant memory for Australian rugby fans, who have had to get used to regular losses in the intervening two years.\n\nIt was a Sydney victory over the All Blacks in the truncated Rugby Championship of 2015 that really sparked the run to the World cup final and Cheika knows exactly the kind of effort that will be required to replicate it tomorrow.\n\n\"I just want to see them enjoying the battle,\" Cheika said yesterday. \"It's gonna be a big battle. Just that 100 percent commitment to each play, be decisive and the rest will flow from there.\"", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-3370531", "id": "9740681", "url": "http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/sport/archives/2017/08/18/2003676719", "sim": 0.7529411911964417, "details": {}, "uri": "711013165", "extractedDates": null, "eventUri": "eng-3370531", "image": "http://www.taipeitimes.com/images/2017/08/18/thumbs/P16-170818-346.jpg", "timeCrawl": "17:08:00", "isDuplicate": false, "dateTime": "2017-08-17T17:08:00Z", "lang": "eng", "title": "Aussies look to lift gloom - Taipei Times", "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_Union", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby Union", "id": 46}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "id": 47}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Competitions", "id": 256}], "time": "17:08:00", "source": {"uri": "taipeitimes.com", "title": "Taipei Times", "id": "3289"}, "date": "2017-08-17", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17"}

involving All Blacks scrumhalf Aaron Smith\n\nAustralia host Rugby Championship holders New Zealand, with the world champions hoping to return to winning ways following their engrossing Test series with the British and Irish Lions.\n\nThe Kiwis have travelled to Sydney for the opening game of this year's competition on Saturday, and coach Steve Hansen has made six changes to the side that drew the third Test against the Lions in July.\n\nSonny Bill Williams will start at centre for the All Blacks after completing a four-match ban and he joined his team-mates for the captain's run on the eve of the contest.\n\nSteve Hansen and Michael Cheika will go head to head on Saturday in the Bledisloe Cup clash\n\nSonny Bill Williams takes a selfie with some of the supporters who attended the session\n\nNew Zealand's Kieran Read speaks to the media during their captain's run training session\n\nAn increasingly acrimonious rivalry between the All Blacks and Wallabies has become more pronounced ahead of their first test of the Rugby Championship on Saturday.\n\nA sex scandal involving All Blacks scrumhalf Aaron Smith has been revived by an Australian newspaper on the eve of the Bledisloe Cup match at the Olympic stadium, and a Sydney court is hearing a case concerning the discovery of a listening device in the All Blacks' hotel before a match in Sydney last season.\n\nNew Zealand Rugby has moved quickly to try to shut down the Smith scandal by appointing an independent lawyer to review its handling of the matter when it first arose last year.\n\nThe bugging controversy is more complicated and has done more than anything else to sour relations between the Australian and New Zealand teams.\n\nA sex scandal involving scrumhalf Aaron Smith has been revived by an Australian newspaper\n\nJoe Moody is put through his paces during training ahead of the Rugby Championship opener\n\nIn the week before last year's Bledisloe Cup test, the All Blacks claimed to have found a listening device embedded in a chair in their team room at a Sydney Hotel: the room in which tactics are often discussed.\n\nThe discovery was made by an Australian security contractor, Adrian Gard, who had worked with the All Blacks team for more than a decade.\n\nThe All Blacks informed hotel management early in the week, but opted against calling in police until the morning of the match - when the story was reported by a New Zealand newspaper.\n\nThe Australian Rugby Union was angry the All Blacks kept silent on the incident for so long and suspected they leaked it to media for a match day distraction.\n\nAustralia coach Michael Cheika was more incensed, thinking the All Blacks had implied the Wallabies were in some way responsible.\n\nDamian McKenzie handles the all in the low sunshine at the Sydney Oval on Friday morning\n\nAustralia will have to be watchful of Beauden Barrett should they conceded penalties\n\n'They had that the whole week. That showed a lack of respect,' Cheika said.\n\n'I wouldn't be smart enough to get that sort of stuff organized. I am too busy working on my own thing.'\n\nCheika has had a frosty relationship with his All Blacks counterpart Steve Hansen as he maintains his conviction that the bugging plot was hatched to discredit the Wallabies.\n\nGard has pleaded not guilty to a charge of public mischief, with police alleging he made a false claim regarding the bug.\n\nHansen is adamant the All Blacks have never implied the Wallabies were involved in the bugging incident.\n\n'I don't know where they feel the inference was,' Hansen said. 'We don't know who put it there. I said that at the time and that hasn't changed.'\n\nThe Smith controversy has also intruded into the All Blacks' match preparation.\n\nSonny Bill Williams walks during their captain's run training session at the North Sydney Oval\n\nBeauden Barrett holds the ball during one drill with the backs as the Kiwis gear up for the game\n\nAUSTRALIA VS NEW ZELAND (KICK-OFF: 11AM BST)\n\nAUSTRALIA\n\nStarting XV: Israel Folau, Henry Speight, Samu Kerevi, Kurtley Beale, Curtis Rona, Bernard Foley, Will Genia; Scott Sio, Stephen Moore, Allan Alaalatoa, Rory Arnold, Adam Coleman, Ned Hanigan, Michael Hooper, Sean McMahon\n\nReplacements: Tatafu Polota-Nau, Tom Robertson, Sekope Kepu, Rob Simmons, Lopeti Timani, Nick Phipps, Reece Hodge, Tevita Kuridrani\n\nNEW ZEALAND\n\nStarting XV: Damian McKenzie, Ben Smith, Ryan Crotty, Sonny Bill Williams, Rieko Ioane, Beauden Barrett, Aaron Smith; Joe Moody, Codie Taylor, Owen Franks, Brodie Retallick, Sam Whitelock, Liam Squire, Sam Cane, Kieran Read\n\nReplacements: Nathan Harris, Wyatt Crockett, Ofa Tu'ungafasi, Luke Romano, Ardie Savea, TJ Perenara, Lima Sopoaga, Anton Lienert-Brown\n\nA newspaper quoted a woman who had a sexual encounter with Smith at Dunedin Airport last September as saying Smith encouraged her to lie about the incident.\n\nSmith was suspended for a week after being sent home before a test match in South Africa but the newspaper alleges New Zealand Rugby didn't have the full facts when it levied punishment. New Zealand Rugby has opened a fresh inquiry to consider the new evidence.\n\nAt his news conference Thursday, Hansen raised the Smith issue before reporters asked.\n\n'Obviously the incident happened last year. We dealt with it and we feel that we dealt with it decisively,' Hansen said. 'There's nothing more that I can add to that but if there is anything else that needs to be spoken about, it will come from the New Zealand Rugby Union.'\n\nHansen knows neutral supporters will be hoping the Wallabies can put in a good performance\n\nThe Wallabies have home advantage with the game taking place in Sydney's ANZ Stadium\n\nTalisman Barrett is all smiles in the sunshine\n\nThe issues swirling about the All Blacks might help decrease pressure on the Wallabies at a time of turmoil in Australian rugby. The poor performance of Australia's Super Rugby teams and the failure of the Australian Rugby Union in the process of cutting one of those teams next season has damaged the sport.\n\nA heavy loss by the Wallabies might compound those problems but Cheika has been able to prepare his players in relative quiet while the All Blacks have had to deal with off-field issues.\n\nCheika was able to name his team without undue scrutiny of his decision to include on one wing Curtis Rona - a rugby league convert who has played 80 minutes at winger in his short rugby union career. The All Blacks team announcement, which could have concentrated on a reorganized back three and the dropping of veteran flanker Jerome Kaino, instead was overshadowed by Smith and bugging.", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-3370531", "id": "9920674", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/~/article-4803032/index.html", "sim": 0.7411764860153198, "details": {}, "uri": "711509237", "extractedDates": null, "eventUri": "eng-3370531", "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/08/18/15/4358672200000578-0-image-a-190_1503067168566.jpg", "timeCrawl": "15:07:00", "isDuplicate": false, "dateTime": "2017-08-18T15:07:00Z", "lang": "eng", "title": "New Zealand train ahead of Rugby Championship opener against Australia", "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_Union", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby Union", "id": 46}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "id": 47}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/African", "label": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/African", "id": 757}], "time": "15:07:00", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "title": "Mail Online", "id": "214"}, "date": "2017-08-18", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18"}

from Curtis Rona, Tevita Kuridrani, Kurtley Beale and Israel Folau - saved them plenty of embarrassment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor context, the Wallabies missed a staggering 40 per cent (37 from 94) of all tackles in the first half and there will be immense pressure on defence coach Nathan Grey given what the Waratahs dished up this year too.\n\nYou will now receive updates from Rugbyheaven Newsletter Rugbyheaven Newsletter\n\nGet the latest news and updates emailed straight to your inbox.\n\nBy submitting your email you are agreeing to Fairfax Media's terms and conditions and privacy policy .\n\nBy the end of 80 minutes, Australia had missed 48 tackles, which is just not good enough at international level.\n\nIn last year's bloodbath against New Zealand in Sydney, the full-time margin was 34 points. On Saturday, the All Blacks led by that buffer at half-time.\n\nNew Zealand piled on an incredible six tries in the first half, which was more than they scored in the entire series against the British and Irish Lions.\n\nAnd when the All Blacks chalked up their eighth try in the 48th minute, thanks to a sensational pass back inside to Ben Smith from Aaron Smith, it marked the most points they had ever scored against Australia, from 182 matches.\n\nCheika may have boasted the Wallabies were fit and raring to go but they sure as anything didn't do enough work on their defensive structures in an abysmal effort.\n\nMeanwhile, after one of the most tumultuous weeks for New Zealand rugby in recent memory, the All Blacks were able to push to one side the off-field scandals and execute a game plan that completely blew the Wallabies off the park.\n\nHalfback Aaron Smith, whose \"toilet tryst\" last year resurfaced during the week as did fresh allegations of affairs with other women, had a brilliant game and was clearly unperturbed by what had transpired in recent days.\n\nCoach Steve Hansen's mind, however, would have been in two places hours before kick-off after it emerged New Zealand's team manager Darren Shand told police he believed Cheika was responsible for bugging the team's hotel last year.\n\nThe All Blacks, however, were more than able to separate on-field from off-field but will be annoyed they did not completely put Australia to the sword in the second half.\n\nTo the surprise of many, it was the Wallabies who got on the scoresheet first thanks to a penalty after four minutes to Bernard Foley on the back of some excellent attacking bursts in the All Blacks' 22.\n\nBut like they do so often, the All Blacks capitalised on a mistake from their opposition.\n\nAllan Alaalatoa knocked the ball on and shortly afterwards New Zealand were able to get auspicious front-foot ball before Liam Squire, Jerome Kaino's replacement, scored down the left edge.\n\nA Wallabies penalty brought the margin back to one point but that's about as good as it got for Cheika's men before a poor defensive read from Folau on the right edge saw Rieko Ioane put the visitors ahead 12-6.\n\nThe All Blacks, through Ioane and Ryan Crotty, then scored two tries in four minutes to put their tally at 26 points in as many minutes to silence a crowd of 54,846 at ANZ Stadium.\n\nAustralia's defensive line looked scrambled and they were unable to adapt on the run to countless questions asked by New Zealand's backs.\n\nRona scored a try on debut in the 52nd minute and when Kuridrani squeezed through a gap to go over the line in the 56th minute, Australia looked a completely different outfit.\n\nAttack-wise, there were things to like. Beale brought the flair we expected and scored Australia's third consecutive try when he scooped up a loose ball and ran 50 metres.\n\nThe 34 points the Wallabies racked up was actually the second-most against the All Blacks.\n\nThe bad news?

None of us have been a part of a team that have lost it.\n\n\"We all know the history of the cup. It is very special to us as All Blacks and we know how hungry the Wallabies will be.\n\n\"It doesn't take much to motivate the guys, outside the World Cup it is our most special cup which we cherish and we want to do well in it.\"\n\nThe All Blacks are coming of an unexpected drawn series against the British and Irish Lions which left everybody speechless and our willingness I guess to where our strengths are which is to have an attacking mind set.\n\nRead knows some of the players might be lacking confidence after the series, and he knows the team has to be better if they are to win.\n\n\"We have to have our minds on the job.\n\n\"If they are not there tomorrow we will certainly get found out. Things have been spoken about but we have come here with one job in mind and that is out on the footy field.\n\n\"We need to be better than what we were a month ago. That is in our performance and in a bit of attitude from the boys.\n\n\"We can't wait to get out there as it is a highly anticipated clash.

or are the Wallabies about to experience a sudden form reversal, and knock off the best nation in the world?\n\nLet's be honest - it's probably going to be the former. Almost certainly. If it's the latter, we will all have our jaws hanging open at 10 o'clock tonight.\n\nThe simple facts are that New Zealand haven't lost their grip on the Bledisloe Cup for thirteen years now, and Australia have won just six Bledisloe Tests against the Kiwis in that time.\n\nNew Zealand have won the last five meetings in a row between the two nations, including four Bledisloe Tests and the 2015 Rugby World Cup final.\n\nThat doesn't mean Australia can't pinch the odd Test against the All Blacks here and there - and here, at ANZ Stadium, is the most likely place for it to happen.\n\nOf the six Bledisloe Tests the Wallabies have won since they last held the cup, three of them have come at this ground, including the most recent one.\n\nBut still to pull that off, the Wallabies will have to see a significant reversal of their recent form, both at club level and as a national team.\n\nIn their three June Tests, the Wallabies recorded passable but uninspiring wins over Fiji and Italy, and a disappointing loss to Scotland.\n\nMore concerningly, in the 2017 Super Rugby season, Australian sides played against New Zealand sides twenty six times, and the final record was... 0-26 in favour of New Zealand.\n\nWhat about the All Blacks? Well, after a tied series with the British and Irish Lions, they look probably as vulnerable as they have in recent years - which isn't very much.\n\nThey defeated the Lions 30-15 in the first Test, but then lost the second 21-24 and drew the final match 15-all.\n\nIt wasn't technically two losses in a row, but it was the first time the All Blacks have had two consecutive non-win results since... scrolling, scrolling... they lost to the Springboks and Wallabies back-to-back in 2011.\n\nThey haven't played three Tests without winning at least one of them since 1998. The odds don't bode well for the Wallabies.\n\nIf there had been something dramatic that happened to reverse the respective fortunes of either team in recent weeks, perhaps we could make an argument for the Wallabies' chances of an upset.\n\nBut all that could qualify is the ARU's decision to axe the Western Force, which you'd think is more likely to be a distraction than a boost.\n\nIn the end, perhaps all Australian rugby fans can hope for is another unexpected twist in the tale, one which will see the come from nowhere to claim victory.\n\n(AP Photo/Rob Griffith)\n\nKey information\n\nKick-off: 8pm (AEST), Saturday August 19\n\nVenue: ANZ Stadium, Sydney\n\nTV: Live, Fox Sports 501, Network Ten\n\nOnline: Live, Foxtel Now, Foxtel App, Tenplay\n\nBetting: All Blacks $1.05, Wallabies $9\n\nHead-to-head: All Blacks 127, Wallabies 48, seven draws\n\nLast five: All Blacks 5-0 Wallabies\n\nSquads\n\nWallabies\n\n1.

That was already their highest score against the Wallabies, eclipsing 51 in 2014 in Auckland. But with utter humiliation achieved, the All Blacks let up, and Australia rallied with four tries to save a little face.\n\n\"You can't fault that first half. It was bloody fantastic,\" All Blacks captain Kieran Read said.\n\nNew Zealand scored eight tries, their most in 81 years against the Wallabies, who entered the match with a measure of confidence after a four-week camp. They'd also studied last year's opening loss to New Zealand, when they conceded 42 points and missed 38 tackles, and thought they sorted out that issue.\n\nBut the defense was nowhere to be seen as New Zealand sliced through Australia with ease in the first half.\n\n\"Our defense wasn't good enough at all,\" Australia coach Michael Cheika said. \"It's not attitude, it's maybe just that little bit of doubt creeps in. When something goes against you early and you have been preparing a certain way, in creeps a little bit of doubt.\"\n\nThe result fomented a deeper crisis within Australian rugby which was already struggling after its worst-ever Super Rugby season in which its teams lost all 26 matches against New Zealand opponents.\n\nThe Wallabies hoped to bring some solace to fans who have begun to turn away from the sport because of administrative issues and poor on-field performance. Instead, they compounded the impression that the sport in Australia is in disarray.\n\nNew Zealand fullback Damian McKenzie, playing his third test, had creative roles in an early try for flanker Liam Squire and in winger Rieko Ioane's double.\n\nMidfielder Ryan Crotty had his first try after forwards Joe Moody and Brodie Retallick broke the Australian defense, Sonny Bill Williams crashed over in the 34th, and Crotty scored his second try in the last minute of the first half.\n\nThe result was certain, and New Zealand took a major step toward retaining the Bledisloe Cup which it has held since 2003.\n\nIts grip on the match became more emphatic when McKenzie scored a brilliant try in the third minute of the second half, then winger Ben Smith added another from a break by Squire.\n\nNew Zealand seemed headed for an historic winning margin but the tide turned.\n\nThe Wallabies' pride demanded they grab a foothold somewhere, and they came back with tries to winger Curtis Rona on debut, centers Tevita Kuridrani and Kurtley Beale, who was playing his first test since the 2015 Rugby World Cup, and fullback Israel Folau.\n\nThe All Blacks might have surpassed 60 points with a late try to Beauden Barrett but the score was overruled by the television official.\n\n\"We just took our foot off the throat a bit,\" Read said. \"We'll take the positives and there's obviously things to learn from.

But it turned out to be a sad, forlorn longing, crushed by the weight of 23 men in black.\n\nSome claimed there were cracks in the All Blacks' armour. Sex scandals, bugging dramas and even a spelling crisis, but the only cracks were in the Wallabies' defence.\n\nThe All Blacks out-scored the Wallabies eight tries to four in their 54-34 win, setting a new record for points against Australia in a game which produced the second highest combined number of points, 88, in a Tri Nations/Rugby Championship Test. All Blacks Winger Rieko Ioane and centre Ryan Crotty both collected doubles.\n\nInstead of lifting spirits, the Wallabies defeat just created more despair to go with the gloom of Australia's 0-26 win-loss record against Kiwi opposition in Super Rugby and the culling of the Western Force.\n\nAustralian rugby desperately needed a Wallabies win to arrest the alarming decline of the game. Yet no one truly thought they could win, certainly not the fans. A crowd of only 54,846 showed up and a lot of supporters were Kiwis or, say it quietly, dual citizens. The large number of black coats, jumpers and jackets darkened the mood.\n\nIt was the worst crowd for a Bledisloe Cup Test in Sydney since they started playing at the 2000 Olympic venue in Homebush, but it was slightly better than some feared it might be, which unthinkably, was sub-50,000.\n\nThe All Blacks led 40-6 at half-time, setting a record for the most number of points they have scored against the Wallabies in a first-half. Australian five-eighth Bernard Foley opened the scoring with a penalty goal in the fourth minute after the All Blacks failed to roll away from the tackled player in their 22.\n\nBut the All Blacks soon exploited a weakness in the Wallabies' short-side defence. Flanker Liam Squire scored the first try of the game in the ninth minute after finishing an attacking movement on the left hand side with Wallabies winger Henry Speight rushing out of the line in the midfield to create an overlap.\n\nFoley edged the Wallabies closer, 7-6, with another penalty goal in the 16th minute after the All Blacks collapsed a scrum. But the visitors then blew the game apart, scoring 33 unanswered points in the next 24 minutes.\n\nIoane scored his first try in the 17th minute in the left hand corner after getting around Wallabies fullback Israel Folau. He was over again three minutes later, scoring a classic All Blacks try off turnover ball. A pass from Wallabies captain Michael Hooper to halfback Will Genia went to ground and the ball was scooped up by Crotty, who put Ioane away.\n\nCrotty scored in the 24th minute. Five-eighth Beauden Barrett looped around lock Brodie Retallick and slipped a pass to Crotty. By this point the Wallabies had already missed 27 tackles. Sonny Bill Williams scored in the 33rd minute, crashing over between rugby league convert Curtis Rona and Speight.\n\nCrotty collected his double on the stroke of half-time after receiving a cut-out pass from halfback Aaron Smith and darting over. And All Blacks fullback Damian McKenzie scored his first Test try in the 42nd minute to effectively put an end to any chance of a Wallabies comeback win.\n\nAll Blacks winger Ben Smith scored in the 47th minute after taking an inside ball from Aaron Smith, while Rona, replacement centre Tevita Kuridrani, centre Kurtley Beale and Folau scored consolation tries for the Wallabies, but even that was too little too late.\n\nThe Wallabies now travel to Dunedin where they will try to level the series on Saturday night. If it is any consolation the last time the Wallabies won in New Zealand was in Dunedin, but that was in 2001.", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-3370531", "id": "10056226", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/aug/19/ruthless-all-blacks-teach-wallabies-lesson-in-bledisloe-cup-opener", "sim": 0.6980392336845398, "details": {}, "uri": "711893978", "extractedDates": null, "eventUri": "eng-3370531", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd598cbc343dab4dc18657135ce1d497ace75f37/0_33_2839_1704/master/2839.jpg?w=1200&h=630&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Centropy&bm=normal&ba=bottom%2Cleft&blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNi8wNy9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&s=c4536c36d4d1baa950f21af2a4f96a49", "timeCrawl": "12:17:00", "isDuplicate": false, "dateTime": "2017-08-19T12:10:00Z", "lang": "eng", "title": "Ruthless All Blacks teach Wallabies lesson in Bledisloe Cup opener", "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_Union", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby Union", "id": 46}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "id": 47}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "id": 49}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "id": 51}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "id": 52}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/African", "label": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/African", "id": 757}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "id": 885}], "time": "12:10:00", "source": {"uri": "theguardian.com", "title": "The Guardian", "id": "260"}, "date": "2017-08-19", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19"}

the Bledisloe Cup series 3-0 following a 42-8 thrashing in Sydney, a 29-9 loss in Wellington, and a 37-10 defeat in Auckland.\n\nThe Wallabies' aggregate score of 27 points was the lowest total score any Australian side has posted in a three-match Bledisloe Cup series since 1972.\n\nTheir prospects of claiming a rare victory over the All Blacks since 2015 further diminished in the June test window earlier this year.\n\nTwo lacklustre performances against Fiji and Italy in Melbourne and Brisbane were compounded by a demoralising 24-19 loss to Scotland in Sydney, just their tenth loss to the Scots in their 90-year history.\n\nIn addition to the Wallabies' sub-par performances over the past year is the disappointing results posted by Australia's Super Rugby clubs this season, who went 26 matches without victory against Kiwi sides in 2017.", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-3370531", "id": "10038559", "url":

August 19, 2017\n\nWingers Courtnall Skosan and Raymond Rhule scored their first Test tries as South Africa stretched a winning run to four Tests by defeating Argentina 37-15 Saturday in the Rugby Championship.\n\nSpringboks fly-half Elton Jantjies kicked 17 points at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in Port Elizabeth as the home team finished comfortable victors after leading 13-5 at half-time.\n\nThe triumph followed a 3-0 whitewash of France two months ago and continued a turnaround after a calendar-year record eight defeats in 12 Tests last season.\n\nArgentina were virtually always on the back foot, committing countless handling errors, conceding numerous penalties and fly-half Nicolas Sanchez had an off-day with his goal-kicking.\n\n\"We could not have asked for a better start to the Rugby Championship,\" said South Africa skipper and lock Eben Etzebeth.\n\n\"Our sincere thanks to the unbelievable support that we got here tonight,\" he added, referring to the almost-capacity crowd in the 46,000-seat stadium.\n\n\"I cannot wait for the return match next weekend -- we will start preparing tomorrow. We are really looking forward to next weekend.\n\n\"It is incredible how the boys play for each other. The culture in this team is amazing and it is great to be part of it.\"\n\nArgentina skipper and hooker Agustin Creevy said: \"I think South Africa played a great game, but were are fortunate to have another chance to beat them next weekend.\n\nSpringboks winger Raymond Rhule (L) breaks through the Argentinian defence during the International Rugby Championship Test match August 19, 2017\n\n\"Our ball from set pieces and the breakdown was very slow so we have to fix that problem quickly.\n\n\"We have great memories from last year of Salta, where we beat the Springboks, and I hope we can repeat that feat at the same ground next weekend.\n\n\"My team will try to use home advantage in our favour and we will try to gain from the support of our people.\"\n\nRelentless early pressure from South Africa finally paid off after 12 minutes when Jantjies slotted a penalty after flanker Tomas Lezana went off his feet at a ruck.\n\nJantjies doubled the lead on 20 minutes from another penalty with Lezana again the offender, this time caught offside by French referee Romain Poite.\n\nA six-point lead after 20 minutes was hardly the reward the Springboks deserved as they had kept the Pumas hemmed deep in their half on a cool, clear eastern Cape evening.\n\nIt took Argentina 27 minutes to reach the South African '22' and almost immediately Sanchez had a chance to score, but missed a kickable penalty attempt.\n\nHowever, five minutes later the South Americans did score when a grubber kick from centre Jan Serfontein was snapped up by full-back Joaquin Tuculet, who counterattacked.\n\nWinger Emiliano Boffelli carried forward the move and his clever kick ahead was snapped up by scrum-half Martin Landajo and he dotted down in the corner.\n\nSpringboks full-back Andries Coetzee (C) runs with the ball during the International Rugby Test match against Argentina August 19, 2017\n\nSanchez failed to convert, leaving South Africa with a 6-5 ahead that did not reflect their possession and territory dominance.\n\nSouth Africa finally scored a try after 37 minutes as Skosan collected an inside pass from Jantjies, shrugged off a tackle and went over between the posts.\n\nJantjies converted and South Africa left the field at half-time full value for a 13-5 advantage.\n\nSanchez and Jantjies exchanged second-half penalties before Rhule burst between two Pumas to score his first try, which was converted.\n\nSlick handling sent Boffelli over at the other end and substitute fly-half Juan Martin Hernandez converted to leave the South Americans trailing 23-15 with an hour gone.\n\nSouth Africa controlled the final quarter and forwards Siya Kolisi and substitute Pieter-Steph du Toit scored tries which Jantjies converted.", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-3374439", "id": "10091906", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/~/article-4805516/index.html", "sim": 0.6941176652908325, "details": {}, "uri": "711991552", "extractedDates": [{"date": "2017-08-19", "textStart": 157, "textEnd": 172, "amb": false, "freq": 3}], "eventUri": "eng-3370531", "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2017/08/19/18/wire-1167045-1503165007-285_636x382.jpg", "timeCrawl": "17:55:00", "isDuplicate": false, "dateTime": "2017-08-19T17:55:00Z", "lang": "eng", "title": "Dominant Springboks make it four wins in a row", "location": null, "categories": [], "time": "17:55:00", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "title": "Mail Online", "id": "214"}, "date": "2017-08-19", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19"}

between the All Blacks and the Wallabies.\n\nThe 159th test match between New Zealand and Australia will take place this weekend in a match that doubles as the opening Rugby Championship and Bledisloe Cup fixture of 2017.\n\nIt will be the 72nd trans-Tasman meeting to be held in Sydney throughout the 114-year history the sides share with each other, with ANZ Stadium hosting the event for the 17th time.\n\nIn that time, both the All Blacks and the Wallabies have eight wins apiece at the 83,500-capacity venue, while the two nations shared the spoils in a 14-all draw in 2014.\n\nThe previous 21 opening Tri Nations/Rugby Championship encounters between the two teams have been an overhwelmingly successful fixture for the All Blacks, having emerged victorious 16 times to Australia's four.\n\nThat trend of starting quickly in Bledisloe Cup series has been a long-existing one for the New Zealanders, as since the Bledisloe Cup was first contested for back in 1932, the All Blacks have won 40 of the 56 series opening clashes against the Wallabies.\n\nThis statistic seems unlikely to change for the Australians given their recent results against both the All Blacks and in their June test series, as well as the performances of their Super Rugby franchises this year.\n\nLast year, the Wallabies did little to knock the All Blacks off their perch as the more dominant side of the two, losing the Bledisloe Cup series 3-0 following a 42-8 thrashing in Sydney, a 29-9 loss in Wellington, and a 37-10 defeat in Auckland.\n\nThe Wallabies' aggregate score of 27 points was the lowest total score any Australian side has posted in a three-match Bledisloe Cup series since 1972.\n\nTheir prospects of claiming a rare victory over the All Blacks since 2015 further diminished in the June test window earlier this year.\n\nTwo lacklustre performances against Fiji and Italy in Melbourne and Brisbane were compounded by a demoralising 24-19 loss to Scotland in Sydney, just their tenth loss to the Scots in their 90-year history.\n\nIn addition to the Wallabies' sub-par performances over the past year is the disappointing results posted by Australia's Super Rugby clubs this season, who went 26 matches without victory against Kiwi sides in 2017.\n\nThe Brumbies qualified for the playoffs as Australia's top side with 34 competition points from a 6-9 record. By contrast, the Blues finished at the bottom of the New Zealand conference with a better record (7-1-7) and more competition points (37) than the Canberra-based outfit.\n\nThe All Blacks' recent drawn series against the British and Irish Lions may not have done a lot to emphasise the perceived gulf in class between them and Australia, but all of the aforementioned contributing factors have most definitely not installed fear that the Wallabies will pose a threat against the All Blacks this weekend.\n\nPound for pound, the Wallabies have the individual talent at their disposal to challenge the All Blacks in this year's series, but the All Blacks' superior strength of squad depth, combined with the Wallabies' lack of confidence following such poor outcomes in recent results by Australian sides should see the All Blacks extend their prolonged tenure as Bledisloe Cup holders for a 15th year.\n\nSix changes have been made to the starting All Blacks side that drew with the British and Irish Lions in Auckland last month.\n\nFive of these changes have been made in the backline, with perhaps the most notable of these being the selection of Damian McKenzie at fullback.\n\nThe lightweight 22-year-old was electric for the Chiefs in Super Rugby, finshing near the top of many key attacking statistics at the conclusion of the season.\n\nHe was first in running metres (1,713), line breaks (22), tackle busts (89), second in runs (74), and fourth in offloads (31), all of which highlight his outstanding attacking capabilities.\n\nHe will be looking to prove the All Blacks selectors wrong after getting dropped from the Lions series to make way for fellow youngster Jordie Barrett.\n\nIt is the injured Barrett who he replaces at fullback, with vice-captain Ben Smith shifting to the right wing as he makes his return to the black jersey after suffering from vertigo during the Lions tour.\n\nSmith replaces Israel Dagg, who is being rested after getting through a massive workload with both the All Blacks and Super Rugby champion Crusaders over the past few months.\n\nThe other key change in All Blacks' starting side is the inclsuion of Highlanders' loose forward Liam Squire at blindside flanker ahead of veteran Jerome Kaino.\n\nSquire's selection suggests coach Steve Hansen and his assistants are beginning to assess potential candidates to fill the number six jersey once Kaino - who will be 36 years old at the 2019 World Cup - hangs his boots up.\n\nOther changes to the starting line up include Rieko Ioane returning from illness to take the left wing jersey back off the now ommitted Julian Savea, while Sonny Bill Williams and Ryan Crotty return from suspension and injury respectively to replace the midfield duo of Ngani Laumape and Anton Lienert-Brown.\n\nLienert-Brown is still likely to take the field on Saturday, as he has been named on the bench in the number 23 jersey in place of the departing Malakai Fekitoa.\n\nHe is one of four changes that have been made in the reserves, with Lima Sopoaga replacing France-bound Aaron Cruden as reserve first-five, Luke Romano taking the replacement lock spot ahead of fellow Crusader Scott Barrett, and youngster Ofa Tu'ungafasi earning the number 18 jersey in place of the departed Charlie Faumuina.\n\nMeanwhile, the Wallabies have made five changes to the starting XV that defeated Italy during the June test window.\n\nThe New Zealand-born Curtis Rona has been picked on the left wing to make his test debut in what could be regarded as the most surprising selection by coach Michael Cheika this week.\n\nHe is accompanied by Henry Speight on the right wing, with the two speedsters replacing Dane Haylett-Petty and Sefa Naivalu.\n\nA new midfield pairing has also been named to replace the injured Karmichael Hunt the Northampton-bound Rob Horne.\n\nKurtley Beale completes his return to Australian rugby from English club rugby after being named at second-five, while Samu Kerevi has recovered from injury to partner Beale in the midfield.\n\nThe lone change in the forward pack comes at number eight, with Sean McMahon taking the place of his Melbourne Rebels teammate Lopeti Timani, who drops to the bench in the number 20 jersey.\n\nTimani is one of five changes in the reserves, with Tom Robertson, Rob Simmons, Nick Phipps and Tevita Kuridrani all earning places on the bench after missing the Italian test.\n\nAll Blacks: 1.

In comparison, the Wallabies are paying an unfavourable $7.20 for an unlikely first up win.\n\nRieko Ioane is the favourite to score the first try of the match, paying $7.50. Israel Folau, Henry Speight and Curtis Rona are joint favourites to score the first try for the Wallabies, paying $15.\n\nPerhaps the best way to emphasise the perceived gulf in class between the All Blacks and Wallabies is that the TAB consider Ioane, Ben Smith, Damian McKenzie, Beauden Barrett, Sonny Bill Williams, Ryan Crotty and Kieran Read as either more or just as likely to score before any of the aforementioned Australians.\n\nThe Herald will be live blogging the game, and RadioSport will have live commentary. Sky TV will be showing the match live on Sky Sport 1 at 10pm.\n\nSouth Africa and Argentina will round out the opening weekend of the Rugby Championship tomorrow morning, with kick off at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in Port Elizabeth scheduled for 3.05am (NZT).\n\nThe Springboks will head into the clash as favourites, as they are playing in front of a home crowd and will look to continue on from their successful test series whitewash against France in June.\n\nHowever, since their inclusion in the Rugby Championship in 2012, the Pumas' best winning record is against the South Africans - a trend they will look to continue.\n\nSpringboks: 1.

It's a personal thing that he and his family have to deal with and there's no point us sitting here trying to talk about how he feels.\n\n\"I've got no show of telling what his headspace is. You put yourself in his shoes, what would yours be like?\"\n\nIn what has been a particularly difficult week for New Zealand rugby in the wake of the Kaino allegations and resurfacing of the Aaron Smith sex scandal, Hansen said there was no more motivation than normal before the All Blacks' 54-34 thumping of the Wallabies at ANZ Stadium.\n\n\"Rugby is always going to have moments where you're not happy with what's going on but ultimately it's all about Saturday isn't it?\" Hansen said. \"It's about winning the game and doing things right and doing things you can be proud of, so we've done that tonight.\n\n\"We did nothing different this week to what we normally do.\n\n\"Motivation's not about things like that. Motivation comes from players who want to be the best they possibly can be. It doesn't matter what sport you play ... motivation is internal.\"\n\nAsked what he thought of Smith's performance after being in the spotlight all week, Hansen replied: \"I thought he played really well\".\n\nMeanwhile, Hansen deflected a question in relation to a News Corp report revealing court documents that showed All Blacks team manager Darren Shand told police he believed Wallabies coach Michael Cheika may have been involved in the planting of a listening device in New Zealand's team hotel last year.\n\nShand's comments completely contradict what Hansen said on Thursday.\n\n\"We certainly haven't named them ... and we never will because we don't know who put it there,\" Hansen said during the week. \"I don't know where they feel the inference was because we certainly haven't blamed ... we don't know who put it there.\"\n\nOn Saturday, Hansen did not want to make comment, while an All Blacks media manager tried to change the topic of conversion.\n\n\"The bug case is over, isn't it?\" Hansen said.\n\nWith Stuff", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-3370531", "id": "10088530", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/rugby-union/union-news/all-blacks-jerome-kaino-flies-home-amid-affair-allegations-20170819-gy01vr.html", "sim": 0.686274528503418, "details": {}, "uri": "711974117", "extractedDates": null, "eventUri": "eng-3370531", "image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/g/x/x/y/c/i/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.gy01vr.png/1503161697422.jpg", "timeCrawl": "16:57:00", "isDuplicate": false, "dateTime": "2017-08-19T16:57:00Z", "lang": "eng", "title": "All Blacks' Jerome Kaino flies home amid affair allegations", "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "id": 31}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_Union", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby Union", "id": 46}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "id": 47}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/African", "label": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/African", "id": 757}], "time": "16:57:00", "source": {"uri": "smh.com.au", "title": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "id": "2784"}, "date": "2017-08-19", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19"}

The match so enthralled the general public that the journalist Jane Fraser revealed to her readers that eastern suburbs matrons had taken to calling great love-making the equivalent of \"Bledisloe Cup sex.\"\n\nThere is an irony in the iconic name given to the trophy played for by Australia and New Zealand in Test rugby.\n\nThere is no evidence that Lord Bledisloe, the Governor-General of New Zealand between 1929 and 1935 and alleged donor of the Bledisloe Cup, knew one end of a rugby ball from the other or cared in any way at all about the Tests played under his nomenclature.\n\nWho was this Lord Bledisloe who has such an undeserved sporting immortality?\n\nWhen I worked at the Sydney Morning Herald, in the days when it had a remarkable library holding documents going back to 1842, I discovered in this archive a typewritten biography of Lord Bledisloe, The English Statesman, that was sent out to newspaper offices throughout the British Empire by the Whitehall press office in London, dated October 1929, to mark his New Zealand appointment:\n\n\"Charles Bathurst, barrister, politician, agriculturalist and First Baron BLEDISLOE, was born Sept. 1867, and educated at Sherborne, Eton and University College, Oxford. After leaving Oxford, he was called to the bar in 1894 and practised as a Chancery barrister and conveyancer for 16 years. In 1910 he was elected Conservative MP for S. Wilts and made a member of the Duchy of Lancaster ...\"\n\nThis biography was updated in March 1934 when Lord Bledisloe was coming to the end of his term as Governor-General:\n\n\"In November 1929, Lord Bledisloe was appointed Governor-General of New Zealand... His knowledge of and interest in agriculture made him the most popular Governor of the Dominion in many years. He did everything in his power to strengthen the Empire bond in New Zealand. The fact that every article he wore was made there from Dominion materials gave great satisfaction... In May, 1932, he and Lady Bledisloe presented to the people of New Zealand one of the country's most precious relics... a house built by James Busby... at the Bay of Islands, outside which the Treaty of Waitangi was signed in 1840...\"\n\nThere is no evidence that Lord Bledisloe, the alleged donor of the Bledisloe Cup, knew one end of a rugby ball from the other.\n\nThere was no reference in this official retrospective of Lord Bledisloe's term of office in New Zealand of the famous trophy he was supposed to have donated for competition between the national rugby teams of New Zealand and Australia.\n\nEnter now into this strange story Bruce Hewitt, a New Zealand-born journalist and rugby fanatic, who worked for the New Zealand Press Association in New Zealand and Australia during a distinguished career in the media.\n\nAn article Hewitt wrote for the Sun-Herald in 1988 gave an entirely different perspective on the so-called \"most popular Governor.\" Hewitt remembered Lord Bledisloe as a man, often at odds with journalists, \"who had little interest in football, and his outdoor activities were limited to farming and long-winded speech-making at country shows.\"\n\nLord Bledisloe was once photographed, Hewitt recalled, at the Canterbury Show at Christchurch. The next day the photograph of a beaming Lord Bledisloe was run in the Christchurch Times. The caption underneath the photograph described Lord Bledisloe \"as the prize-winning ram at the Canterbury Show.\"\n\nLord Bledisloe insisted that the sub who wrote the caption be dismissed.\n\nThis incident, wrote Hewitt, triggered Lord Bledisloe's \"long-running differences with the New Zealand press... To a generation of reporters he became 'Chattering Charlie,' and there were harsher names when his complaints led inevitably to sackings in those bleak, jobless, and depression days.\"\n\nAn official of Lord Bledisloe's stature who is offside with the national press is in clear need of a public relations gesture, or gestures, it seems to me, to persuade the public that he is a man of compassion and devotion to the New Zealand people.\n\nThe gift of Waitangi House, mentioned in the 1934 Whitehall press release, fitted this need. And so too did giving his name to a Test match competition between the rugby teams of Australia and New Zealand.\n\nAn observant reader will notice that the inference in the last sentence is that Lord Bledisloe did not actually donate the Bledisloe Cup, as popular memory indicates.\n\nBut he did allow his name to be used with the trophy, which is an important difference.\n\nThe fact is that there was no acknowledgement by Lord Bledisloe of any deep involvement or even interest in the trophy. There is no evidence, either, that Lord Bledisloe instigated the creation of the trophy.\n\nThere was no mention, as I have noted, in the official biography issued to the media at the end of his term of office in New Zealand about the Bledisloe Cup, either.\n\nWith the Bledisloe Cup Tests already being played and the large trophy on display at these matches while Lord Bledisloe was still in office, you would have thought that the trophy's creation would have been listed as one of his achievements in New Zealand.\n\nYears later, too, when Lord Bledisloe, now in his anecdotage and sounding like PG Wodehouse's Lord Emsworth with his passion for pigs, toured New Zealand and Australia in the 1950s, there is no mention in the numerous press articles of the time of his connection with the rugby trophy named after him.\n\nThe official version of his close involvement is given in Keith Quinn's The Encyclopedia of World Rugby:\n\n\"The Bledisloe Cup was presented in 1931 by Lord Bledisloe, then Governor-General of New Zealand, as a trophy to be played between the Test teams of Australia and New Zealand... The first game for the trophy was played at Eden Park in Auckland in 1931, New Zealand winning by 20-13. The game, played in front of Lord Bledisloe, was notable for the small crowd that turned out (nearly 15,000) and for the scoring of 14 points by the New Zealand fullback, Ron Bush of Otago...\"\n\nBut did Lord Bledisloe watch the match at Eden Park? The evidence is strong that he did not.\n\nGordon Slater in his monumental history, On the Ball: The Centennial Book of New Zealand Rugby, is adamant that Lord Bledisloe was not even in Auckland at the time: \"He was in Wellington to attend the commercial travellers' smoke concert, at which he told them that the world was topsy-turvy, particularly in the sphere of industry and commerce.\"\n\nThe 1931 match at Eden Park involved the first Australian side in 18 years to play a Test (according to the NZRU) in New Zealand. Public interest in the tour was lukewarm. The side had won three matches, lost four and drawn one in the lead-up to the Test.\n\nWe go back now to Gordon Slater:\n\n\"On the day before the game, it was announced from Wellington that the Governor-General had presented a cup for competition between New Zealand and Australian Rugby teams and that the first match for the trophy would be the Test at Auckland the following day. Mr S.S.M. Deans, president of the New Zealand Rugby Union, and T.C. Davis, manager of the Australian team, expressed appreciation of the offer. The design of the cup was to be decided upon later, but it would be symbolic of the two countries.\"\n\nNotice that the announcement was made from Wellington, not Auckland. This is another indicator that Lord Bledisloe remained in Wellington, despite the fact that New Zealand were playing Australia for a trophy that bore his name the next day in Auckland.\n\nThe four Tests against the British and Irish Lions in 1930 drew crowds of 27,000 at Dunedin, 30,000 at Christchurch, 40,000 at Eden Park in Auckland and 40,000 at Wellington. The problem for the NZRU was that Lions tours, like the successful Springboks tour of 1921, were once in a decade money-making events.\n\nThe Wallabies, now that the QRU had been re-established in 1929 after closing down during World War I, would be touring New Zealand every couple of years. But on the evidence of the poor crowds for the first tour of the Wallabies since before World War I, the NZRU decided that something had to be done to make the New Zealand-Australia rugby contests more popular.\n\nMy hunch is that the NZRU decided to enhance the Tests by giving them a sort of Ranfurly Shield makeover.\n\nIn 1901, the Governor of New Zealand, Lord Ranfurly, offered a challenge trophy to the NZRU to be competed for between NZ unions, on a one-off basis, with the holder playing at home unless deciding to take the shield on tour.\n\nBy the 1930s, and even today, the Ranfurly Shield, the storied 'Log of Wood,' had created an aura and a passion about it that meant that big crowds invariably attended shield challenges.\n\nAn equivalent of a Ranfurly Shield for New Zealand - Australian Test competition was put in place by the NZRU to create interest in the trans-Tasman rugby rivalry.\n\nGetting old 'Chattering Charlie' to agree to the concept, though, was easier than getting him to actually attend the first Bledisloe Cup Test.\n\nHeadlines in the sports section of the New Zealand Free Lance of 7 September 1949 summed up the anguish and shock of the New Zealand rugby community:\n\n\"AN ALL BLACK DAY IN RUGBY: TWO TEST DEFEATS. Penalties Give Springboks Win For Second Time, Australia Too Good For Uninspired Home Side\"\n\nOn the same day, separated by thousands of miles and a few hours in time, the All Blacks lost two Tests. Bad (and in New Zealand eyes, biased) refereeing was behind a loss by a touring New Zealand side to South Africa 9-3 (three penalty goals to one try). Incompetent administration and hubris was to blame for a 11-6 defeat of another New Zealand side at Wellington by a touring Australian side.\n\nWith 30 of the nation's best players touring South Africa, the NZRU was careless about the prestige of the All Blacks, and condescending of Australian rugby, in agreeing to a two-match Test series for the Bledisloe Cup.\n\nThere was an excuse, perhaps, for the carelessness. From 1931 up to 1949, 14 Bledisloe Cup Tests had been played. The Wallabies had won one and drawn one in 1934 to win their first home Bledisloe Cup series. In all, the Wallabies had lost 12 Tests, including all four played in New Zealand in the two-match series in 1936 and 1946.\n\nThe precedent, too, for playing a third-string side had been set in 1905 when New Zealand defeated Australia 14-3 at Dunedin while the famous 1905-06 All Blacks had already left the country on their epic tour of Britain and France.\n\nThe task of the third-string All Blacks in 1949 was made much harder by the fact the team for the first Test at Wellington was selected only the day before it ran on to the field. No coach was provided, either.\n\nThe All Blacks were outplayed by the Wallabies, who tailored their tactics to suit a chilly, blustery day. Trevor Allan, the Australian captain, won the toss and played with the wind. By half-time, the Wallabies were leading 11-0 after kicking for position when they had the ball.\n\nThe All Blacks' possession was spoilt, particularly at the lineout, by the 'impetuous' Wallaby flanker David Brockhoff and the greyhound-fast Col Windon launching themselves at the New Zealand number ten, legally, when the half-back was set to pass to him.\n\nThis relentless attack on the New Zealand pivot destroyed any cohesion the All Blacks might have mustered.\n\nYears later, the inimitable Brockhoff, who attracted calls of \"Off-Side Brockhoff!\" throughout the tour, summed up the havoc he and Windon had caused this way: \"We missiled them all day, never gave them a sniff.\"\n\nThe mayhem of the Brockhoff-Windon double act continued during the second Test at Eden Park, won comfortably by the Wallabies 16-9.\n\nThe victory secured Australia's first Bledisloe Cup series win in New Zealand.\n\n\"Brockhoff's spoiling and scavenging were reminiscent of Cliff Porter and Dave Gallaher at their best,\" RH Chester and NAC McMillan noted in their monumental history of All Blacks rugby Men in Black.\n\nThe Wallabies were able to dominate the lineouts, a rare achievement in this era, with Nick Shehadie, later Lord Mayor of Sydney and knighted for his civic achievements, and a brash young Rex Mossop applying the needed energy and grunt.\n\n\"Hi Dad, hi Mum, hi Kirk! We've beaten the bastards! You beauty!\"\n\nAt the end of the Test, an elated Mossop gave some indication of the uninhibited sports broadcaster he was to become after his distinguished rugby and rugby league career ended when he was asked by a radio reporter to send a cheerio call back to Australia. Without any hesitation, he grabbed the microphone and yelled out: \"Hi Dad, hi Mum, hi Kirk! We've beaten the bastards! You beauty!\"\n\nThere was one further humiliation in store for New Zealand rugby in a year when the All Blacks lost four Tests to the Springboks, and two more and the Bledisloe Cup to the Wallabies.\n\nPeter Jenkins, in his magisterial history Wallaby Gold, tells the story of how the tour manager of the 1949 Wallabies, Bill Cerutti, rubbed salt into New Zealand rugby's wounds:\n\n\"The All Blacks heading home from South Africa docked in Sydney en route to New Zealand. When they arrived, Cerutti was down at the wharf, brandishing the Bledisloe Cup. It was the first time Australia had won the silverware in 15 years. 'Here it is,' he shouted to the New Zealanders. 'We've got it now.'\"\n\nTwo years later, the Bledisloe Cup was taken back by the All Blacks in a three-Test series played in Australia with the All Blacks, determined on revenge, winning all three Tests.\n\nFrom 1951 to 1978, the All Blacks won 26 Bledisloe Cup Tests and all 12 series. The Wallabies won only five Tests and two were drawn.\n\nThe effect of this one-sided contest was the interest in the trophy itself diminished.\n\nThe All Blacks' tradition, for instance, of filling the huge trophy to the brim with 26 jugs of beer and skulling the lot after a winning series was forgotten, only to be revived decades later in the professional era.\n\nThe real clincher in how unimportant the Bledisloe Cup had become in the memory of the rugby community is that it actually disappeared for a number of years. Apparently no-one, either in New Zealand or Australia, was aware of this disappearance, nor was anyone concerned about it.\n\nBruce Hewitt was given the job of finding the Cup as part of his NZPA duties in Australia. After an intensive investigation, he was able to report back with good news:\n\n\"The Bledisloe Cup has turned up eventually unharmed under a great deal of dusty cardboard cut-outs of Maori huts and Mount Cooks in the back storerooms of the old New Zealand Government Tourist Bureau in Temple Court, Melbourne, where it had evidently been taken for display purposes and forgotten.\"", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-3370531", "id": "9766663", "url": "http://www.theroar.com.au/2017/08/18/spiro-all-blacked-out-inspiring-stories-of-bledisloe-cup-glory-and-defeat/", "sim": 0.686274528503418, "details": {}, "uri": "711084158", "extractedDates": null, "eventUri": "eng-3370531", "image": "http://cdn0.theroar.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/All-Blacks-celebrate-2000-bledisloe-cup.jpg", "timeCrawl": "19:52:00", "isDuplicate": false, "dateTime": "2017-08-17T19:33:00Z", "lang": "eng", "title": "All Blacked-out!

Wallabies sides have always been talented. As Stephen King once said: \"Talent is cheaper than table salt. What separates the talented individual from the successful one is a lot of hard work.\"\n\nSeeking to get himself back on a firmer footing, Hansen then mentioned what a fantastic build-up to the Test Michael Cheika's team had enjoyed, spending the best part of a month training specifically for this contest. Unfortunately, even that compliment came out a little lamely.\n\n\"They've had a great preparation and while franchise fans weren't probably overexcited about the fact that they got knocked out early and would rather have seen them play right through to the final and have less preparation time.\"\n\nOK, so rub our noses in it yet again ... the only reason Australia had one team in the Super Rugby finals was because one team had to be there, as winners of the national conference. No matter that all five New Zealand teams finished ahead of that team, the Brumbies. And when they were eliminated from the first round of finals, predictably by a New Zealand side, well, what else did they have to occupy themselves with ?\n\nHis last stab at finding a reason was perhaps the saddest of them all. They're desperate, he said.\n\nTell us something we don't know. It is now 14 years since Australia surrendered the precious symbol of trans-Tasman supremacy. As it happens, Richie McCaw was playing in his 14th Test for the All Blacks when he stuffed up Australia for the first but by no means last time, tackling a try-bound Steve Larkham on a wet night in Auckland, August 16, 2003. The two players slid into the base of the posts at Eden Park which would have been a try, except that the ball was held in Larkham right arm -- and it was his left arm that touched the upright. Needless to say, McCaw got to his feet and won the penalty. Australia lost that Test 21-17. Had Larkham scored, well, who knows ...\n\n\"The third thing that makes them really dangerous is their desire to try to help Australian rugby and at the moment it has a bit of a cloud over it and they haven't won the Bledisloe in a long time. They're pretty hungry for it so as a team we have to be hungrier than them, otherwise we're at a disadvantage.\"\n\nSeemingly, the only thing putting the All Blacks at a disadvantage is their own libido. Or rather Aaron Smith's. You may recall the All Blacks halfback was sprung having sex in a disabled toilet last year, apologised profusely, was stood down for the next match and dutifully served his penance. But there may be more to the story. Certainly the Daily Mail is trying to convince its readers there is more, much more.\n\nThat forced Hansen to open his press conference by addressing the elephant in the room.\n\n\"Obviously the incident happened last year ... we dealt with it and we feel that we dealt with it decisively. There's nothing more I can add to that but it if there is anything that needs to be spoken about, it will come from the New Zealand Rugby Union. Steve Tew.\"\n\nAnd then the media manager stepped in and put an end to that line of questioning.

A verdict in the case is expected before Saturday's test and regardless of the outcome, there is going to be a further heavy impact on the relationship between the two nations.\n\nSince the New Zealand Herald broke the story almost exactly a year ago, the Australian Rugby Union has made it clear that they feel the Wallabies were implicated by New Zealand as the most likely guilty party.\n\nThe Australians have used the timing of the story breaking - on the day of the first Bledisloe test - as their justification to cast themselves as the accused.\n\nIt's a stance that has infuriated the New Zealand Rugby Union who have been careful in all of their public comments to not make allegations of blame or insinuate or speculate who might have planted the device.\n\nBut following the Wallabies 37-12 defeat at Eden Park last year - their fourth consecutive loss to the All Blacks - Cheika launched into an extraordinary tirade.\n\n\"I would say they caught me a bit offside with the accusation that we tried to bug them,\" said Cheika when he was asked whether his and the Wallabies' relationship had turned septic with the All Blacks.\n\n\"Really? Hello? Honestly? They had that the whole week..? That showed a lack of respect. I wouldn't be smart enough to get that sort of stuff organised. I am too busy working on my own thing.\"\n\nThe sense of injustice and resentment simmering within the Wallaby camp didn't reside that night at Eden Park and Hansen confirmed that Cheika sought him out in May when the two men were in Tokyo to see the draw being made for the 2019 World Cup.\n\n\"I don't know if he confronted me,\" said Hansen.\n\n\"We had a chat in Japan and I made it clear to him that we didn't highlight [the Wallabies as a guilty party]. I said to him there are only x amount of people who would take that opportunity [to plant a bug] and whether we would like it or not, if you [Cheika] found a bug in your [Wallabies] team room, we [All Blacks] would be one of those. So we haven't named them as that and we never will because we don't know who put it there.\n\n\"I don't know where they feel the inference was because we haven't said it. We don't know who put it there and we said at the time and that hasn't changed. We can't help how they feel.\"\n\nAn already difficult and tense relationship between the two sides now sits on the cusp of yet more ill-will and bad blood developing, depending on the verdict in the Gard case.\n\nA guilty verdict will incense the All Blacks while exoneration will effectively leave the mystery unsolved and the Australians thinking the cloud of suspicion they believe is hovering for them, lingering for longer.\n\nHansen said that he was keeping an eye on the ongoing Gard case.\n\n\"Obviously we are watching with interest. He is a good man and we feel for him.\"", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-3370531", "id": "9799572", "url": "https://www.odt.co.nz/sport/rugby/all-blacks/tension-between-all-blacks-wallabies", "sim": 0.6823529601097107, "details": {}, "uri": "711178736", "extractedDates": null, "eventUri": "eng-3370531", "image": "https://www.odt.co.nz/sites/default/files/story/2017/08/michael_cheika_2.jpg", "timeCrawl": "00:23:00", "isDuplicate": false, "dateTime": "2017-08-17T19:46:00Z", "lang": "eng", "title": "Tension between All Blacks, Wallabies", "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/African", "label": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/African", "id": 757}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "id": 885}], "time": "19:46:00", "source": {"uri": "odt.co.nz", "title": "Otago Daily Times Online News", "id": "4448"}, "date": "2017-08-17", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18"}

Africa stretched a winning run to four Tests by defeating Argentina 37-15 Saturday in the Rugby Championship.\n\nSpringboks fly-half Elton Jantjies kicked 17 points at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in Port Elizabeth as the home team finished comfortable victors after leading 13-5 at half-time.\n\nThe victory followed a 3-0 whitewash of France two months ago and continued a turnaround after a calendar-year record eight defeats in 12 Tests last season.\n\nArgentina were virtually always on the back foot, committing countless handling errors, conceding numerous penalties and fly-half Nicolas Sanchez had an off-day with his goal-kicking.\n\nRelentless early pressure from South Africa finally paid off after 12 minutes when Jantjies slotted a penalty after flanker Tomas Lezana went off his feet at a ruck.\n\nJantjies doubled the lead on 20 minutes from another penalty with Lezana again the offender, this time caught offside by French referee Romain Poite.\n\nA six-point lead after 20 minutes was hardly the reward the Springboks deserved as they had kept the Pumas hemmed deep in their half on a cool, clear eastern Cape evening.\n\nIt took Argentina 27 minutes to reach the South African '22' and almost immediately Sanchez had a chance to score, but missed a kickable penalty attempt.\n\nHowever, five minutes later the South Americans did score when a grubber kick from centre Jan Serfontein was snapped up by full-back Joaquin Tuculet, who counterattacked.\n\nWinger Emiliano Boffelli carried forward the move and his clever kick ahead was snapped up by scrum-half Martin Landajo and he dotted down in the corner.\n\nSanchez failed to convert, leaving South Africa with a 6-5 ahead that did not reflect their possession and territory dominance.\n\nSouth Africa finally scored a try after 37 minutes as Skosan collected an inside pass from Jantjies, shrugged off a tackle and went over between the posts.\n\nJantjies converted and South Africa left the field at half-time full value for a 13-5 advantage.\n\nSanchez and Jantjies exchanged second-half penalties before Rhule burst between two Pumas to score his first try, which was converted.\n\nSlick handling

reconfiguration of the Olympic venue in 2001 is 76,219.\n\nA roll-up of less than 54,937 on Saturday would be less than half of the world-record rugby crowd of 109,874 that witnessed the so-called

back from his four-game ban for his shoulder charge on Anthony Watson six weeks ago.\n\nThe Wallabies had just two Bernard Foley penalties to show for their efforts, meaning they trailed by an enormous 34 points at the break, the most in their history of facing the All Blacks, and although it would get better in the second half as Michael Cheika's side scored four tries in the second-half, former Australia fly-half Lynagh cut loose on the side.\n\n\"I can't overestimate how angry I am at seeing an Australian team who have skills that are non-existent,\" he said as part of Sky Sports' broadcast of the Rugby Championship opener.\n\nNew Wallabies captain Michael Hooper tried to play down the devastating result, which was completed by further tries for full-back Damian McKenzie and wing Ben Smith, and he instead wanted to gloss over the poor start to focus on Australia's results.\n\nRead more All Blacks rack up record score against Australia to make flying start\n\nCurtis Rona, Tevita Kuridrani, Kurtley Beale and Israel Folau all scored for the home side, with Foley converting all four to maintain a 100 per cent record from the tee, but it proved too little, too late as the Wallabies suffered a 20-point defeat in Sydney.\n\n\"It is not the start we would have hoped for,\" said Hooper. \"Being 50 points behind, you start to throw everything we had, I'm so happy with that.\"\n\nHowever, despite witnessing his side score the most points they've ever achieved against their Antipodean rivals - and banish memories of the disappointing draw against the Lions with an emphatic response - Kieran Read admitted that the 28-14 second-half scoreline was not a pleasing one for the All Blacks.\n\nHopper was keen to take the positives out of the second half than the negatives of the first (Getty)\n\n\"I think in the second half we let frustration strangle us a little bit,\" All Blacks captain Read said.\n\n\"We just needed to dump that and get back to playing some simple footy.\n\n\"We showed in the first half we really just let the ball do the work -- nothing special but it just worked for us. I think the first half was good and we were okay in patches of the second half but we conceded 34 points which means most days of the week you're going to be losing test matches. But you can't fault that first half. It was bloody fantastic.\"\n\nKieran Read was delighted to pass the 50-point barrier against Australia (Getty)\n\nIt doesn't get any easier for the Wallabies as they face a return match against the All Blacks at Dunedin's Forsyth Barr Stadium next weekend, and Read was keen to enjoy the win before turning his attention to the second Bledisloe Cup encounter.\n\n\"The Wallabies were certainly going to come out firing in that second half. They did and we just took our foot off the throat a bit,\" Read added. \"We'll take the positives and there's obviously things to learn from. It's not often you come here and put 50 points on the Wallabies.\"\n\nMore about: New Zealand rugby Australia Rugby Rugby Championship Michael Lynagh Reuse content", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-3370531", "id": "10072475", "url": "http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-union/international/australia-vs-new-zealand-rugby-championship-all-blacks-michael-lynagh-non-existent-skills-a7902246.html", "sim": 0.6705882549285889, "details": {}, "uri": "711938220", "extractedDates": null, "eventUri": "eng-3370531", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/08/19/15/michael-hooper1.jpg", "timeCrawl": "14:52:00", "isDuplicate": false, "dateTime": "2017-08-19T14:18:00Z", "lang": "eng", "title": "'Angry' Michael Lynagh savages Australia for having 'non-existent skills'", "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_Union", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby Union", "id": 46}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Products_and_Services", "label": "dmoz/Reference/Education/Products and Services", "id": 903}], "time": "14:18:00", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "title": "The Independent", "id": "3441"}, "date": "2017-08-19", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19"}

It was just so poor.\n\n\"The simple skills of passing and tackling were non-existent in the first half and that's very worrying.\"\n\nCheika said he didn't expect there to be major changes ahead of Australia's next assignment in Dunedin on Saturday but rather a change in attitude.\n\n\"The change has to be more about believing in ourselves to make the hits when we need to,\" Cheika said. \"You still feel just as bad but I know we'll improve and we've got to do some quick improving around for the next game. We want to keep the series alive.\n\n\"We had the right preparation no doubt and obviously not playing a lot of footy that leaves you out a little bit missing the [Super Rugby] games. That's as good as we could have had it. It comes down to bringing that into the game.\"\n\nHooper added: \"As Michael said, our defence just wasn't up to scratch and there was a bit of an unravelling there for a bit. We were able to get back in it with some really good fight.\"", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-3370531", "id": "10069601", "url": "http://www.watoday.com.au/rugby-union/michael-lynagh-savages-wallabies-as-michael-cheika-stands-behind-nathan-grey-after-5434-defeat-20170819-gy01jr.html", "sim": 0.6705882549285889, "details": {}, "uri": "711926367", "extractedDates": null, "eventUri": "eng-3370531", "image": "http://www.watoday.com.au/content/dam/images/g/y/0/1/a/6/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.gy01jr.png/1503151360652.jpg", "timeCrawl": "14:08:00", "isDuplicate": false, "dateTime": "2017-08-19T14:08:00Z", "lang": "eng", "title": "Michael Lynagh savages Wallabies as Michael Cheika stands behind Nathan Grey after 54-34 defeat", "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_Union", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby Union", "id": 46}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "id": 47}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "id": 51}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "id": 641}], "time": "14:08:00", "source": {"uri": "watoday.com.au", "title": "WA Today", "id": "1355"}, "date": "2017-08-19", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19"}

The All Blacks will believe either a forward pass from Bernard Foley or Folau's touching the ball in an offside position should have ruled it out, but referee Wayne Barnes allowed it and the home side had what they desperately needed - hope. Hope not for a victory in this match but hope nevertheless.\n\nA proper thrashing would have been a disaster for them, but they may just have redeemed themselves here, strange as it may sound with the All Blacks running up more than 50 points in a 54-34 victory.\n\nThe hosts, teetering following their Super Rugby shambles this year and a governing body in disarray, were in a desperate state at halftime when they trudged off 40-6 down.\n\nThe All Blacks, relishing the dry ground and fine conditions here after a wintry slog in June and July at home against the British and Irish Lions, had too many threats, too many ideas and too much desire.\n\nSignificantly, they had too much pace as well, with Rieko Ioane, Damian McKenzie and Ben Smith causing them fits. Wallabies assistant coach Mick Byrne, with the All Blacks for 11 years, predicted a frenetic match in terms of ball movement and it was, with either the All Blacks or the Wallabies in ascendancy. It was one of those matches.\n\nIt was difficult to pick the best try in a match which initially ran like an All Blacks' highlights reel, but Ben Smith's in the second half following Liam Squire's destructive run and Aaron Smith's inside pass must have been up there.\n\nThat try took the All Blacks to their highest score against Australia, beating the 50-21 they put on the Wallabies in this city in 2003, but Cheika's side weren't ready to give up and in showing their fighting spirit they may have just breathed a little life back into the Bledisloe Cup.\n\nSquire, running with freedom on the sidelines alongside skipper Kieran Read, should have the inside running over Kaino next weekend and his try - the All Blacks' first of eight - was a beauty. Fullback McKenzie, in his third test, should feel pretty satisfied too.\n\nAfter a week in which Spygate failed to reach a resolution and which has probably brought rugby relations between the two nations to a new low, there was ill feeling between the two sides, with Bernard Foley having a running battle with Sonny Bill Williams. And there will be bruises for both too.\n\nProp Wyatt Crockett went off with concussion - no head injury assessment required - and he must be a doubt for the return match next weekend.\n\nThe All Blacks, with a six wins in a row over their close rivals now, have one hand on the Bledisloe.

It will be just his third Test for the All Blacks.\n\nMcKenzie replaces an injured Jordie Barrett, with Ben Smith being shifted to the wing.\n\nHalves pairing Aaron Smith and Beauden Barrett are the only two to remain in the backline from the third Test against the Lions.\n\nAs well as the aforementioned McKenzie and Ben Smith moves, coach Steve Hansen has named Sonny Bill Williams and Ryan Crotty at inside and outside centre respectively.\n\nRieko Ioane takes flight on the opposite wing to Smith in his sixth Test in black.\n\nNothing too dramatic to speak of in the scrum with a very strong New Zealand pack shaping up.\n\nHowever, Jerome Kaino has sensationally been sent home following an alleged affair scandal, ruling him out of the contest.\n\nPrediction\n\nAs obvious as it sounds, this opening game is massively crucial, it's a must win for the Wallabies because they have all but no chance of winning Game 2 in Dunedin.\n\nThey're coming off a very nervy June campaign, coming up against an All Blacks side fired up from an immense series against the Lions.\n\nI don't think it will be the kind of blowout from Game 1 of last year in Sydney, but the All Blacks should get the job done tonight without too much trouble.\n\nNew Zealand to win by 19", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-3370531", "id": "10041668", "url": "http://www.theroar.com.au/2017/08/19/wallabies-vs-blacks-bledisloe-cup-game-1-live-scores-blog-2/", "sim": 0.6313725709915161, "details": {}, "uri": "711853959", "extractedDates": null, "eventUri": "eng-3370531", "image": "http://cdn0.theroar.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Michael-Hooper-Australia-Wallabies-Rugby-Union-Championship-2016.jpg", "timeCrawl": "09:59:00", "isDuplicate": false, "dateTime": "2017-08-19T09:59:00Z", "lang": "eng", "title": "Wallabies vs All Blacks: Bledisloe Cup Game 1 live scores, blog", "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_Union", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby Union", "id": 46}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "id": 47}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "id": 49}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "id": 52}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "id": 134}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "id": 135}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Game_Design", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Game Design", "id": 205}], "time": "09:59:00", "source": {"uri": "theroar.com.au", "title": "The Roar", "id": "2423"}, "date": "2017-08-19", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19"}

All-Blacks fight to save their reputation after a second sex scandal rocked the squad.\n\nKaino has been dumped from the squad to face Australia in the Bledisloe Cup after it was revealed he was allegedly having an affair with a model.\n\nThe flanker was said to have met Tara Pokarier in hotels across Austalia and New Zealand even though he is married to Diana Breslin.\n\nFurious All-Blacks bosses sent Kaino packing back home to his family for 'personal reasons' after details of the affair were made public in Australian newspaper The Telegraph.\n\nThey come just days after they were forced to re-open an investigation into the behaviour of half-back Aaron Smith after he was caught in a tryst with a lawyer in an airport toilet.\n\nSmith was banned for one match and sent home from the tour of South Africa last year after his sexual encounter while on All-Blacks duty.\n\nBut it has this week been alleged he was not straight with Kiwi bosses at the time, and they have been forced to investigate further into his actions amid claims he was involved in a two-year affair with the brunette.\n\nThe scandals have rocked New Zealand rugby to the core, with their previously immaculate reputation in tatters with suggestions there was a culture of bad behaviour within the squad.\n\nNew Zealand Rugby chief executive Steve Tew said: \"We certainly understand that our game and our players are under public scrutiny and these latest stories are concerning.\n\n\"As an employer, we will take some time to assess this.\n\n\"While NZR does not wish to comment on individual behaviour, it is clear that this is really hurting rugby, all the people concerned, our fans and supporters.\n\n\"We take these issues very seriously, and are also mindful that these issues affect people with families and loved ones.\n\n\"At a time when we are grappling with our cultural reputation, the Respect and Responsibility Review, which is currently under way, is even more important.\n\n\"The Review

I feel bad asking but would it help if I compensated you financially?\",' she said.\n\n'I understand he was just really desperate at the time for this not to come out.'\n\nAn All Blacks spokesman refused to comment on the story at a press conference on Thursday, while also barring Daily Mail Australia from the media event.\n\nThe salacious Facebook messages obtained by Daily Mail Australia show Smith had begged for sex in parks and 'good luck' sex before games.\n\nSmith begged the woman to keep to the story he had told his partner Ms Voykovich (right)\n\nIn proposing their toilet liaison he asked for a 'special toilets f***', saying the pair had to be 'sneaky' as his All Black teammates were nearby set to fly out to South Africa.\n\nSmith, 28, was suspended by the All Blacks and issued a tearful apology after he was caught following the toilet cubicle 'incident'.\n\nAt the time, a visibly shaken Smith said he had made a 'huge mistake, a huge error in judgement', and management decided to send him home from the South Africa tour and suspend him for one game as punishment.\n\nThe star halfback was named to start for the All Blacks in the opening test of the Bledisloe Cup series against the Wallabies at ANZ Stadium in Sydney on Saturday.\n\nSmith's partner Tegan Voykovich has stood by him throughout the scandal.", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-3370531", "id": "10066453", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/~/article-4804970/index.html", "sim": 0.6274510025978088, "details": {}, "uri": "711919598", "extractedDates": null, "eventUri": "eng-3370531", "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/08/19/14/436070AE00000578-0-image-a-37_1503149908247.jpg", "timeCrawl": "13:50:00", "isDuplicate": false, "dateTime": "2017-08-19T13:50:00Z", "lang": "eng", "title": "All Blacks demolish the Wallabies in the Bledisloe Cup ", "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Sex_Offenses", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Sex Offenses", "id": 227}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "label": "dmoz/Society/Sexuality", "id": 233}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/African", "label": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/African", "id": 757}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "id": 885}], "time": "13:50:00", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "title": "Mail Online", "id": "214"}, "date": "2017-08-19", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19"}

But not much.\n\nFor as much spirit was shown in the last half-hour, the Wallabies defence oscillated between atrocious and missing in the first 50 minutes and any hope of victory was gone well before the belated comeback.\n\nThe Wallabies made 95 tackles but missed a whopping 48 in the game and at times the All Blacks appeared to be able to score at will.\n\nRyan Crotty and Rieko Ioane scored twice, feasting off Australian mistakes and defensive errors highlighting the disturbing lack of confidence in the Wallabies ranks this year.\n\nThe only defensive starch came in the last quarter, when the energy of the Wallabies bench helped them stave off an unwanted place in the record books.\n\nThe most points conceded in a Test is 61 against South Africa in 1997, and just one more Kiwi try would have equalled that.\n\nBut it didn't come.\n\nThe second-half tries also saw off the possibility of the 2017 Wallabies taking the record of worst losing margin (45 points) against the Springboks in 2008.\n\nTo be any chance of winning the Bledisloe Cup this year, Australia must now go to Dunedin to try and beat the Kiwis on home soil on Saturday.\n\nIf they play anything like they did in Sydney, that's not happening.\n\nWallabies captain Michael Hooper said he was happy with the fightback, but not much else,.\n\n\"I am really proud we showed that Australian spirit and came back there,\" he said post-match.\n\nAll Blacks captain Kieran Read said the game had felt \"surreal in the first half\".\n\n\"It's nice to play when it's all coming off like that,\" Read said.\n\n\"We tried to come here and play our game and a lot of cases it just stuck in the first half.\"\n\n\u200bIt would be easy to say it was all over by halftime, with the All Blacks leading 40-6 courtesy of six tries.\n\nIn fact, it was all over by the 25 minutes, when \u200bthe Kiwis used a 10-minute period to sink Australia with three quick tries and turn what had been a reasonably close game into another walkover.\n\nBernard Foley nailed a penalty in the third minute but the Wallabies' main problem -- utterly woeful defence -- didn't take long to emerge.\n\nAn innocuous All Blacks attacking line somehow managed to bamboozle the Aussies and Liam Squire raced down the left sideline to score in the seventh minute.\n\nStill, Australia continued to attack and an Israel Folau offload put the Wallabies in good position. They walked away with a penalty and at the 17th minute it was 7-6.\n\nThen, carnage.\n\nWhen the Kiwis attacked the Aussie line, they somehow turned a two-on-five into a try when Folau bit on a drifting Beauden Barrett and let Ioane score on his outside.\n\nThree minutes later, Ioane went in again when a rushed pass from Bernard Foley was knocked by Kurtley Beale and the Kiwis swooped on the loose ball to score. More simple missed tackles let Crotty score a too-simple try another three minutes later, and then, Australia were toast at 26-6, with 56 minutes of the game left to play.\n\nMore missed tackles led to the Wallabies defending their line again and when Sonny Bill Williams was given a short ball near the line, halfback Aaron Smith didn't even wait until he broken through two defenders to score before he hollered about the try. It was that certain.\n\nSamu Kerevi missed another tackle and Crotty strolled in for a disturbingly easy second try.\n\n\u200bIf Cheika's halftime speech made any impact, it didn't show.\n\nTwo minutes into the second period, Damien McKenzie scored a simple try while fans were still finding their seats after the break.\n\nFive minutes later, Ben Smith scored after more missed tackles.\n\nPeople reached for the record books to put context to the slaughter.\n\nBut then, suddenly, Australia's fightback began.\n\nCurtis Rona scored from a Nick Phipps pass in the 51st minute after a scrum on the Kiwi line, and minutes later Tevita Kuridrani scored a second when he took an offload from Folau.\n\nThe Wallabies scored a third in the 60th minute though Beale when he picked up a dropped Kiwi pass and raced 50 metres before Folau added try in the 67th minute.", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-3370531", "id": "10062321", "url": "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/rugby/recordbreaking-all-blacks-record-highest-ever-score-against-wallabies-in-bledisloe-rout/news-story/cbe4283550fc212b4b20d264450e6fbf", "sim": 0.6117647290229797, "details": {}, "uri": "711901418", "extractedDates": null, "eventUri": "eng-3370531", "image": "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/afa5c2a476d5aee9dff697886a54f4bc", "timeCrawl": "12:46:00", "isDuplicate": false, "dateTime": "2017-08-19T12:46:00Z", "lang": "eng", "title": "All Blacks' record rout rolls Wallabies", "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "id": 49}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "id": 51}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Collecting", "id": 60}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Instruments", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Instruments", "id": 96}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/People/Lost_or_Missing", "label": "dmoz/Society/People/Lost or Missing", "id": 645}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Beauty_Pageants", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Beauty Pageants", "id": 646}], "time": "12:46:00", "source": {"uri": "dailytelegraph.com.au", "title": "The Daily Telegraph", "id": "3505"}, "date": "2017-08-19", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19"}

online ticketing getting up in the early hours of the morning and going down in the freezing Bathurst winter to line up at the local ticket office to get out Bledisloe Cup tickets.\n\nYou were only able to access to a maximum four tickets per person for the annual Test in Sydney.\n\nThat's right, tickets were restricted because it was so popular.\n\nTomorrow night only 50,000 tickets have been sold, 30,000 below Sydney Olympic Stadium's capacity.\n\nRugby is in a mess in Australia.\n\nLast week the ARU axed the Western Force from the Super Rugby competition and the game's boss Bill Pulver has stood down.\n\nNow frustration amongst fans is at boiling point.\n\nIn June the Wallabies lost to Scotland and no Australian Super Rugby team was able to beat a New Zealand side in 26 games of the season.\n\nAnd let's not forget last year's corresponding Bledisloe Cup match in Sydney when they lost 42-8 and fans walked out before the end of the game.\n\nThe last time the Wallabies won the Bledisloe Cup back in 2002, Facebook and iPhones weren't invented, John Howard was the Prime Minister and the current captain of the Australian team, Michael Hooper, was still in primary school.\n\nThe world is a different place in 2017 but the cup is still there to be won and if the Wallabies can finally end the All Blacks reign, it might inspire fans to return to the so-called game they play in heaven.", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-3370531", "id": "9830980", "url":

It is a source of genuine bitterness for the Wallabies and the finding of Downing Centre Local Court Magistrate Jennifer Atkinson on the eve of the first Bledisloe Cup test of 2017, that there was insufficient evidence to convict Gard, will keep alive the uncertainty of who was behind the planting of the bug.\n\nThe Australian Rugby Union were desperately hoping for Gard to be convicted so the case could be closed and the suspicion removed. Such an outcome would also have allowed them the opportunity to throw plenty back at New Zealand Rugby.\n\nBut that avenue has been closed and the first test will kick off tomorrow night with more questions than answers: with more ill-feeling and bad blood.\n\n\"It has taken twists and turns hasn't it,\" said All Blacks coach Steve Hansen of the relationship between New Zealand and Australia. \"At the end of the day New Zealand and Australia have done a lot of things together. It is a sort of big brother, little brother back yard game. Little brother doesn't like losing to big brother and big brother certainly doesn't like losing to little brother so that creates a tension.\n\n\"So when little brother appears to be winning more than he should be you probably get hacked off about it and it does create a little but of resentment I guess but I think the rivalry is good.\"\n\nWhile the Australians will want the whole business to die a death and be forgotten about, New Zealand Rugby will be determined to still find an answer to what happened this time a year ago and why.\n\nAnd without resolution, there has to be little hope of these two fierce rivals patching things up and returning their rivalry to a more respectful and healthy footing.\n\nSpygate has broken trust on an unprecedented scale. There have been multiple incidents between the two sides over the last decade or so. There was the whole, never ending thing between Richie McCaw and Quade Cooper.\n\nThere was the refusal by the Wallabies to have a drink with the All Blacks after the second test in 2010 and then the prolonged celebrations of the former in Hong Kong when they won, breaking a 10-test losing streak.\n\nThere have been warnings from New Zealand to stop pinching players and in the last few years a relentless niggle has come into Bledisloe tests.\n\nBut all of this is the expected and typical product of an intense rivalry. Everything has remained within the parameters of acceptability. But the discovery of the listening device and the subsequent court case, has changed everything.\n\nOn discovering it, the All Blacks immediately felt their team environment had been violated. On hearing that the All Blacks had discovered it, the Wallabies immediately felt they were being accused.\n\nOne cheap bit of electronics had the effect of elevating the rivalry to new levels that were no longer underpinned by mutual respect and a sense of morality that would guide both parties to stay within the limits.\n\nThe arrival of the police into any relationship can do that. In the last year several of New Zealand Rugby's most prominent figures have been grilled by the New South Wales Police and none have much enjoyed the experience.\n\nThere was genuine shock and outrage that Gard was arrested and the depth of that emotion was highlighted when All Blacks captain Kieran Read gave evidence on Friday.\n\nHe wanted to give Gard a character reference essentially. \"It was just as a mate I guess,\" he said. \"It was something that I wanted to do so I have done my bit. They decided to put the court case this week so it was what I had to do.\"\n\nLikewise the Australian Rugby Union were unhappy and shocked to find the same police force at their headquarters before the third Bledisloe Cup test last year.\n\nBut that's how it had to be because the discovery of the listening device, regardless of who was suspected of putting it there, potentially compromised the integrity of that first test.\n\nIt was the most serious breach of security in rugby history with dark and potentially dangerous possibilities attached. This wasn't akin to the underarm incident in 1981; this wasn't on the same page as Australians claiming Pavlova was theirs or New Zealand saying Russell Crowe wasn't theirs.\n\nThis had an unknown edge to it as the discovery of the bug opened the possibility that rugby had been targeted by organised crime.

Would they have thrown so many 50-50 passes?\n\nProbably not, but then Hansen wasn't buying such a soft justification for the second half turn off.\n\nHe wanted the foot on the throat for the duration. He wanted for his side to maintain their standards and for the bench to come on and add something. Instead the rugby became loose, complacent and error-strewn and instead of destroying the last semblance of confidence the Wallabies may have had left, the All Blacks did their level best to breathe hope back into their opponent and allow them a 30-minute period which has set Australia up well to be more competitive in Dunedin.\n\nIt was a period in which the Wallabies gave a strong reminder of their ability. They can play when they have the ball and if they are allowed to.\n\nThose four second half tries should serve as a warning to the All Blacks that they simply can't be that loose again because they may not get away it again.\n\nStill, despite the disappointment and frustration of the last half hour, the All Blacks were thrilled with the tries they scored and the way they put a difficult week behind them.\n\n\"Rugby is always going to have moments where you are not happy with what is going on but ultimately it is all about Saturday.

That first part of the game is not the level that we can be at, at all. Not in any game, let alone a game against them.\n\n\"It's not attitude. I think it's maybe just that little bit of doubt creeps in. When something goes against you early, we've been preparing a certain way and it creeps in a little bit of doubt, will I go or will I hedge and that causes some of the problems.\"\n\nTrailing by 34 points at the break, the Wallabies looked set to suffer a record defeat given the ease at which the All Blacks had found the tryline in the first half. But to their credit, the Australians turned in a much more committed display in the second stanza, winning it 28-14.\n\nAll Blacks coach Steve Hansen hailed his side's first-half as \"pretty special\" but admitted they were seduced by the scoreboard after the break.\n\n\"We were all frustrated because we've come to expect a lot from these men and some of what we got in the last 30 minutes wasn't where we want it to be,\" Hansen said. \"Everyone that was in the [coaching] box was frustrated; I'd say everyone that was on the park was frustrated.\n\n\"We just didn't arrest the error rate and they just kept coming at us. So that's another learning for a group that's re-establishing itself and will give us something to really focus in on when we go to Dunedin and it won't do us any harm. Had we gone on and won the game playing the way we were in the first half I don't think that would have done us any good either.\n\n\"So every now and again you've got to sit back and accept that we played pretty good tonight, enjoy the moment for what it is and then tomorrow we'll start getting back into it and trying to win again.\"\n\nWhile the Wallabies were significantly outclassed in the first 40, Cheika said wholesale changes were unlikely ahead of next week's return clash in Dunedin. Backs Kurtley Beale, Samu Kerevi, Henry Speight and Curtis Rona contributed 16 of the Wallabies' 30 missed tackles, with the wingers each missing five apiece.\n\n\"I don't think that there's going to be a lot of changes,\" Cheika said. \"The change has to be more about believing in ourselves to go up and make the hits when we need to, tracking well on the inside and making sure we're coming up in defence and backing ourselves and not worrying about what the opposition might be doing out the back or out wide, playing exactly what's in front of us defensively.\"\n\nStill, questions are likely to be asked of Grey who oversaw the Waratahs' systems this season when the franchise finished with the third worst defensive record in Super Rugby.", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-3370531", "id": "10100846", "url": "http://www.espn.co.uk/rugby/story/_/id/20387254", "sim": 0.5686274766921997, "details": {}, "uri": "712016618", "extractedDates": null, "eventUri": "eng-3370531", "image": "http://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2017%2F0819%2Fr246170_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "timeCrawl": "19:32:00", "isDuplicate": false, "dateTime": "2017-08-19T19:32:00Z", "lang": "eng", "title": "Cheika \"100 percent\" behind defensive coach", "location": {"label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "type": "country"}, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "id": 51}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Services", "id": 319}], "time": "19:32:00", "source": {"uri": "espn.co.uk", "title": "ESPN.com", "id": "4451"}, "date": "2017-08-19", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19"}

What matters this weekend is the rare situation of an All Black side having failed to win their two last tests, and having to essentially get their season back on track after a shock drawn series with the British & Irish Lions.\n\nIt's that Lions series that the Wallabies can draw some inspiration from. After coming back to win the second test - albeit with a little help from Sonny Bill Williams' indiscipline - they managed to withstand a first half onslaught from the All Blacks in the third and deciding test. They battled to an honourable, if a little controversial, draw at Eden Park - getting as close as anyone had to beating the All Blacks there since 1994.\n\nBesides the obvious immediate sledging of Smith (if he actually gets to play), a rush defence needs to be put in place early and often to try and nullify Beauden Barrett. The All Blacks were shown to be far too reliant on the Hurricanes first-five in the second test especially, and banging him up a bit could mean a few uncharacteristic mistakes in the backline.\n\nIt's unlikely that Barrett's sometimes wayward goalkicking will play a part in the result, given that Damian McKenzie has been brought into the side. The Chiefs fullback will have to contend with a barrage of high balls from both WIll Genia and Bernard Foley, and if the Wallabies are smart, they'll be running Israel Folau straight at him to leap up and over to claim those kicks.\n\nSo it's tempting to think the Wallabies will run a conservative game plan against the All Blacks, even though looking back at the few losses the World Champions have conceded, that has no basis in prior results. The Lions' 24 points to beat the All Blacks was admittedly the lowest winning total since 2011, however they did still have to outscore them by two tries to none.\n\nMeanwhile, the All Blacks simply have to get back to their bullying best. They've signified that intent with the promotion of Highlanders loose forward Liam Squire to the starting line-up, at the expense of veteran Jerome Kaino. This is arguably a much bigger talking point than McKenzie's start at fullback, given that Ben Smith will still be floating around on the wing to help him out under the aforementioned bombs.\n\nKaino's place in the pecking order has seriously slipped given that Squire has spent most of the season watching from the sidelines with injury, and is a clear sign that Steve Hansen is thinking about future-proofing the blindside flanker spot.\n\nSonny Bill Williams gets a chance to bury the demons of his shoulder-charge induced stint on the sideline, courtesy of some very liberal interpretations on what constitutes a proper game of rugby. His four-match suspension is now up, so expect a big performance from him on a ground where he has won two NRL premierships.\n\nA year-old sex scandal and confusing court case won't be enough to derail the All Blacks' preparation for this test. Especially considering that when you contrast them to Australian rugby having to ditch one of their Super Rugby teams, the Wallabies losing to Scotland this year and the very existence of the code being under threat in the country - all makes Aaron Smith making an ill-advised trip to the loo seem a bit miniscule in comparison, doesn't it?", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-3370531", "id": "9853576", "url": "http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/sport/337526/bledisloe-cup-wallabies-have-more-problems-than-the-all-blacks", "sim": 0.5647059082984924, "details": {}, "uri": "711337926", "extractedDates": null, "eventUri": "eng-3370531", "image": "http://www.radionz.co.nz/assets/news/119946/eight_col_000_PL88F.jpg?1501783205", "timeCrawl": "08:42:00", "isDuplicate": false, "dateTime": "2017-08-18T08:42:00Z", "lang": "eng", "title": "Bledisloe Cup: Wallabies have more problems than the All Blacks", "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Business/Industrial_Goods_and_Services/Machinery_and_Tools", "label": "dmoz/Business/Industrial Goods and Services/Machinery and Tools", "id": 165}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software_Testing", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Programming/Software Testing", "id": 546}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/African", "label": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/African", "id": 757}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Visual_Arts/Photography", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Visual Arts/Photography", "id": 798}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "id": 885}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Relativity", "label": "dmoz/Science/Physics/Relativity", "id": 886}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Periods_and_Movements", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Periods and Movements", "id": 950}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Educational", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Educational", "id": 1126}], "time": "08:42:00", "source": {"uri": "radionz.co.nz", "title": "Radio New Zealand", "id": "4239"}, "date": "2017-08-18", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18"}

You see some players doing the stuff they do for their franchises... there is always a bit of rust around in June. It doesn't surprise me.\n\n\"You're there for three weeks and then you're out with another team. It's now that you can start to make some in-roads in that area.\"\n\nThe 58-year-old former Australian Rules player, who watched as the All Blacks beat the Wallabies in all three Bledisloe Cup tests during his first year with the side, has had no contact with Steve Hansen this week, but that was due to the Australians being based in the western suburb of Penrith, with the All Blacks in the well-to-do eastern suburb of Double Bay.\n\n\"He's not going to travel that far to come and see me and I wasn't going to go that far to see him,\" Byrne said of Hansen. \"We'll wait to we come together on Saturday night.\"\n\nThe test, he said, was extra special but that was less due to the fact he was coming up against his former team and more that he would get the opportunity to see a new Wallabies group do their thing after working so hard over the last month.\n\n\"I feel it's extra special,\" he said. \"But it's extra special for me - and this is not being corny - [because I've spent] the last four weeks with these guys. I think the extra special part is waiting to see these guys out on the field. I have a lot of life-long friends on the other side but I haven't spoken to them this week.\n\n\"The boys are itching to get out on the field. They've been working really hard, they want to back their fitness, and we're going to play a running game.\n\n\"Our challenge is to hang on to the ball and back our skills and back the quality of work these guys have done. I think you're going to see a pretty frenetic game of footy tomorrow night.\"\n\nThe continuation of the gusty winds which have been plaguing the city over the past few days are expected to continue, which could make securing the high ball more difficult than usual, and while the Wallabies will be wary of allowing new fullback Damian McKenzie time and space with the ball, Byrne said his side had a major weapon of their own in Israel Folau.\n\n\"One of the key things is to make sure our game plan is executed and don't give those guys the opportunity to pick you off,\" he said. \"We've got some of those guys as well.

Cheika's stated is belief is that the Wallabies should stick to running rugby and just learn to \"do it better\".\n\nPersonally I am sceptical of the approach as it seems to me to be very low percentage, with a forced, flashy attack having many more critical points of failure than a game plan emphasising a simple, well organised defence combined with a good kicking game. However, Cheika is clearly the go hard or don't go at all type, so I guess the default option for Aussie rugby fans is to enjoy seeing whether or not he can finally get it right. If he doesn't, I doubt that his position as head coach will be sustainable beyond the end of this year and the Wallabies two years before the 2019 World Cup to change direction under a new coach. From a glass half full perspective, it is win-win for the fans.\n\nLooking at Cheika's starting backrow selections, it is clear to see how they would support his approach. Ned Hanigan, Michael Hooper and Sean McMahon may be on average light and short for an international side back row, but they are all young, fit and fast. This means that they are going to be able to keep pace with a wide, high tempo attack and clean out to secure the ball before the larger All Black forwards arrive, or alternatively to act as a link player.\n\nGiven the attacking quality of the Wallabies backs, I find it hard to believe that with sufficient possession, this mix of players won't score tries.\n\nOf course there is the matter of not letting the All Blacks score tries either, something which is a concern given the average to poor defensive records of the majority of the back line. However, the back row's line speed and work rate may help compensate for this, by putting significant pressure on the All Blacks inside backs and kick receivers and forcing the All Blacks to kick.\n\n(AAP Image/David Moir)\n\nWith this back row the previous season's wobbly lineout should actually improve compared to when David Pocock was teamed with Hooper, with Hanigan being a primary and McMahon a very credible secondary jumper. The key weakness with this back row is that they are disadvantaged in the battle of the muscle in tight, so it is really up to the tight five to step up there.\n\nTo me what these selections point to is that the Wallabies will attempt to play the same sort of high tempo attacking game that they played last season, where they scored early tries and had respectable scorelines in the first 50 to 60 minutes. The problem has been that the pace has proven to be impossible to maintain, with teams getting past them in the final quarter of the game.\n\nHowever, in this instance Cheika's bench selections may be instructive. Tatafu-Polota Nau, Rob Simmons, Lopeti Timani, Reece Hodge and Tevita Kuridrani are all very solid defenders, so I suspect Cheika may have selected them as finishers with the intent of holding a lead that the Wallabies might achieve. Could it be a piece in the puzzle to Cheika's holy grail of successfully playing the game 'the Australian Way'? We will have to wait and see.\n\n(AP Photo/Alastair Grant)\n\nSuffice to say success depends on the Wallabies improving on a whole range of other matters over the June Tests, with defensive organisation and all aspects of the kicking game. But if the Wallabies have used their month together wisely, I wouldn't write Cheika's approach as producing a competitive game against the All Blacks, even if the gap in class between the two teams is currently too great to expect a win.\n\nA respectable performance, even a narrow loss, would at least give Australian fans something to look forward when the Wallabies play more mortal teams during the remainder of the year. And if the Wallabies can build on the approach to beat those other teams, it Cheika's international coaching career might be saved from imploding to the tune of the old Frank Sinatra classic, My Way.", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-3370531", "id": "9968895", "url": "http://www.theroar.com.au/2017/08/19/cheika-aint-going-wondering/", "sim": 0.5254902243614197, "details": {}, "uri": "711637398", "extractedDates": null, "eventUri": "eng-3370531", "image": "http://cdn0.theroar.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Michael-Cheika-Australia-Rugby-Union-Wallabies-2016-Bledisloe-Cup.jpg", "timeCrawl": "20:11:00", "isDuplicate": false, "dateTime": "2017-08-18T20:11:00Z", "lang": "eng", "title": "Cheika ain't going down wondering", "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Games", "label": "dmoz/Games", "id": 49}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "id": 51}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "id": 52}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "id": 134}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys_and_Games/Games", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Toys and Games/Games", "id": 137}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Action", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Action", "id": 641}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Abstract", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Abstract", "id": 751}], "time": "20:11:00", "source": {"uri": "theroar.com.au", "title": "The Roar", "id": "2423"}, "date": "2017-08-18", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-18"}

They need a victory in Dunedin in order to have any chance of taking back the Cup for the first time since 2002.\n\nWhile they improved significantly in the second half, the Wallabies appeared to be revolving doors in the first 40 minutes as the All Blacks cut them open almost at will, with fullback Damian McKenzie, wings Rieko Ioane and Ben Smith and midfielder Ryan Crotty making big inroads.\n\nThe home side missed 30 tackles in total and made 98.

That first 10 minutes when we were attacking - we had some heat on them, but mistakes and our defence wasn't up to scratch.

Some of the [Wallabies] boys give us plenty of stick, they reckon we're twins,\" Alaalatoa said.\n\n\"I was the same age as Scotty's brother, Pat, and he's the same age as my brother [Michael]. So Pat and I were always the little smartarses ... Mike and Scotty would always whack us down.\"\n\nThe Wallabies haven't won the Bledisloe Cup since 2002 and have won just five of the past 37 Tests against New Zealand.\n\nThe trans-Tasman struggles were highlighted in Super Rugby this year when New Zealand teams won all 26 derbies against Australian sides.\n\nBut Sio and Alaalatoa have inside knowledge given Mike Alaalatoa was part of the Canterbury Crusaders' championship-winning team and Pat Sio is playing in the Kiwi domestic competition.\n\nScott Sio is confident the Wallabies can end the All Blacks hoodoo, backing coach Michael Cheika's preparation to have them ready to topple the world champions.\n\n\"You have to be confident. There's no point if we don't believe it and we feel we can get the job done,\" Sio said.\n\n\"Any game you play for Australia and that's the way you treat it. Allan and I are so close so we know we're comfortable with the challenge.\n\n\"This weekend we're playing against one of the best teams in the world and one of the best front rows as well.

coach Mick Byrne has predicted a \"frenetic\" Bledisloe Cup opener against the All Blacks on Saturday night as Australia discovers whether an intensive and lengthy preparation has closed the gap between them and the world champions.\n\nByrne, who won two Rugby World Cups while helping coach the All Blacks, said he had been impressed with the ability of the Wallaby players to compartmentalise a nightmare 0-26 Super Rugby season against New Zealand teams.\n\n\"Everyone was talking about the results in Super Rugby but the boys came in with a fresh approach,\" Byrne said on Friday at ANZ Stadium.\n\n\"The way they knuckled down was fantastic.\n\n\"The energy, the camaraderie that's been built... every cloud has a silver lining.\n\n\"In our case that was our cloud -- not getting into the finals -- but these guys have worked really hard over the last three weeks.\n\n\"There's a real confidence about their performance.\"\n\nNEW PODCAST! Sam Worthington and Christy Doran preview the first Bledisloe Cup Test and discuss the off-field shenanigans\n\nSubscribe to the podcast on iTunes by CLICKING HERE\n\nWallabies 'building trust'\n\n0:33\n\nWallabies coach Michael Cheika was unhappy with his side's fitness levels during the June Test series which they opened with a reasonable win over Fiji before losing to Scotland then bumbling their way to victory over Italy.\n\nBut Byrne indicated major gains had been made during brutal fitness and training camps in Cessnock and Newcastle as the Wallabies attempt to start climbing the world rankings again.\n\nByrne has previously espoused the virtues of using kicking as an attacking weapon so perhaps it is a bluff but he backed Cheika's comments about viewing putting boot to ball as a last resort.\n\n\"We want to back our fitness and we're going to play a running game,\" Byrne said.\n\n\"That's the way that Cheik builds up all his teams, to run the ball and play hard and our challenge is to hang onto it.\n\n\"If we're going to run it, hang onto it and back our skills and the quality of work these guys have done.\n\n\"I think you're going to see a pretty frenetic game of footy.\"\n\nLIVE stream the Bledisloe Cup and Rugby Championship on FOX SPORTS.

win a title as a player and a coach as the Crusaders knocked off the Lions 25-17 in front of packed house at Ellis Park.\n\nTheir eight-point win was the Crusaders' eighth Super Rugby title, but first since Robbie Deans left the helm in 2008 after winning his fifth as coach.\n\nThe win also saw the Canterbury-based side to become the first franchise to cross the Indian Ocean and return with the silverware, while also equalling the record for the most wins by any team in a single Super Rugby season with 14 (Reds 2011 and Hurricanes 2015).\n\nThey also have shown dominance against many of those they will face in national colours, with the Chiefs' final-round win over the Brumbies giving New Zealand teams a 25-0 winning record against Australian opposition this campaign, the first such clean sweep over their trans-Tasman rivals.\n\nIn fact, Australia's horror run against Kiwi teams actually extends to 30-0 if results from last year are factored in.\n\nWhen it comes to scoring tries, the New Zealand franchises have once again shown their attacking prowess, with three of their sides featuring in the top five try-scoring outfits; the Hurricanes leading the way with 93, the Crusaders in third with 79 and the Highlanders with 62 in fifth. While the other two sides, the Chiefs and the Blues are not far behind in sixth and seventh.\n\nNotable absences\n\nNew Zealand vice-captain Ben Smith will only be available to face Australia in two Tests, missing out on four Rugby Championship Tests against South Africa and Argentina, along with the third Test with the Wallabies.\n\nThe 31-year old, who has played in 62 Tests for the All Blacks, will take a break until the start of next season in order for his body to recover as Smith aims to reach the 2019 World Cup in prime condition; following a precedent set by Richie McCaw and Dan Carter, who both took breaks prior to the 2011 and 2015 World Cups.\n\n\"Contractually he's on sabbatical now,\" his agent Warren Alcock told the New Zealand Herald.\n\n\"He has decided to make himself available for the two Bledisloe games because he has missed some rugby this year.\"\n\nThe All Blacks were dealt a second blow when utility back Jordie Barrett was ruled out of the rest of the season with a shoulder injury picked up in the Hurricanes' Super Rugby semi-final against the Lions. Uncapped Crusaders full-back David Havilli takes his place in the squad.\n\nHowever, Sonny Bill Williams is back in the No 12 jersey for New Zealand's Rugby Championship opener.\n\nWilliams was handed a four-match ban after becoming the first All Black in 50 years to be sent off during New Zealand's second-Test loss to the British and Irish Lions earlier this month, but has now served his suspension.\n\nHave the All Blacks lost their fear factor?\n\nNew Zealand go into the Rugby Championship in a somewhat unfamiliar position, on the back of disappointment. While they may not have lost the series against the British and Irish Lions, the All Blacks were shown to be beatable\n\nThis paired with Ireland's victory over them in Chicago shows that despite their status as the world's best, they are not superhuman.\n\nHowever, following the Lions series, Sam Warburton told Sky Sports News HQ that despite the result people's opinion on the All Blacks shouldn't change: \"I think Ireland showed that last year, they had a good win last year, but players never believe the hype anyway, I think that is something which is built up externally.\n\n\"But without doubt, they are the best team in the world. They are back-to-back world champions, on their patch as well. We knew it was going to be the toughest challenge we could have had in our rugby careers.\n\n\"They are still the best team in the world. Just because we drew doesn't make us the best team, they have earned that right from performing so well over the past 10 years or so.\"\n\nThe squad\n\nForwards: Kieran Read, Liam Squire, Jerome Kaino, Sam Cane, Ardie Savea, Vaea Fifita, Luke Romano, Sam Whitelock, Brodie Retallick, Scott Barrett, Owen Franks, Nepo Laulala, Ofa Tu'ungafasi, Wyatt Crockett, Joe Moody, Dane Coles, Codie Taylor, Nathan Harris.\n\nBacks: Ben Smith, David Havili, Israel Dagg, Nehe Milner-Skudder, Waisake Naholo, Rieko Ioane, Ryan Crotty, Anton Lienert-Brown, Sonny Bill Williams, Ngani Laumape, Beauden Barrett, Lima Sopoaga, Damian McKenzie, Aaron Smith, TJ Perenara, Tawera Kerr-Barlow.\n\nAlso See: Rugby Championship: Argentina Rugby Championship: Australia Rugby Championship: South Africa Follow @SkySportsRugby", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-3374401", "id": "9705754", "url": "http://www.skysports.com/rugby-union/news/15176/10962317/rugby-championship-state-of-play-2017-new-zealand", "sim": 0.4627451002597809, "details": {}, "uri": "710924179", "extractedDates": null, "eventUri": "eng-3370531", "image": "http://e1.365dm.com/17/07/150x150/skysports-all-blacks-new-zealand_3994163.jpg", "timeCrawl": "14:10:00", "isDuplicate": false, "dateTime": "2017-08-17T14:10:00Z", "lang": "eng", "title": "Rugby Championship state of play 2017: New Zealand", "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football", "id": 31}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_Union", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby Union", "id": 46}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "id": 47}], "time": "14:10:00", "source": {"uri": "skysports.com", "title": "Sky Sports", "id": "709"}, "date": "2017-08-17", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-17"}

Some of the [Wallabies] boys give us plenty of stick, they reckon we're twins,\" Alaalatoa said.\n\n\"I was the same age as Scotty's brother, Pat, and he's the same age as my brother [Michael]. So Pat and I were always the little smartarses ... Mike and Scotty would always whack us down.\"\n\nThe Wallabies haven't won the Bledisloe Cup since 2002 and have won just five of the past 37 Tests against New Zealand.\n\nThe trans-Tasman struggles were highlighted in Super Rugby this year when New Zealand teams won all 26 derbies against Australian sides.\n\nBut Sio and Alaalatoa have inside knowledge given Mike Alaalatoa was part of the Canterbury Crusaders' championship-winning team and Pat Sio is playing in the Kiwi domestic competition.\n\nScott Sio is confident the Wallabies can end the All Blacks hoodoo, backing coach Michael Cheika's preparation to have them ready to topple the world champions.\n\n\"You have to be confident. There's no point if we don't believe it and we feel we can get the job done,\" Sio said.\n\n\"Any game you play for Australia and that's the way you treat it. Allan and I are so close so we know we're comfortable with the challenge.\n\n\"This weekend we're playing against one of the best teams in the world and one of the best front rows as well.

The senior All Black was released from the touring squad to return home.\n\nThe timing of both reports, coming on the back of the bug-gate hotel spying drama, were curious and no doubt caused major disruption within the All Blacks camp.\n\nBut the focus has fallen on the reputation damage to the national rugby body in the public eye.\n\nAt this stage, it is important to note that both cases have created moral rather than any legal debates that stretch well beyond rugby and into other realms of society. Marriages do not have a great success rate in the modern world. Many, many people have skeletons of their own.\n\nEvery All Black should not be tarred with the same brush, either. This team alone possess devoted family men, the likes of Ben Smith and captain Kieran Read. Those players are likely to be as frustrated as anyone that team-mates have brought about such unwanted scrutiny.\n\nIn these situations innocent parties are also often overlooked; the families who are being dragged into the respective sagas and having their private lives played out in the public arena.\n\nBut if it was not already, the All Blacks and other high-profile athletes must now fully appreciate that in the age of social media, where camera phones and groupies seemingly lurk around every corner, there is no escaping the spotlight.\n\nThe problem New Zealand Rugby has created for itself is by delivering public messaging such as 'better people make better All Blacks' the pedestal is raised and the debate around whether our top sports men and women should be considered role models is again thrust forward.\n\nThe All Blacks have worked hard to overhaul culture issues of past eras and educate players about standards expected from them at all times. In these instances, those have clearly not been met.\n\nOn this occasion, New Zealand Rugby was at least quick to front, with chief executive Steve Tew issuing a statement.\n\n\"We certainly understand that our game and our players are under public scrutiny and these latest stories are concerning,\" Tew said.\n\nHe said it was \"clear that this is really hurting rugby, all the people concerned, our fans and supporters. We take these issues very seriously, and are also mindful that these issues affect people with families and loved ones.\"\n\nNew Zealand Rugby has a large group of high powered global sponsors. For now it remains unclear what, if any, reaction or ramifications these incidents will have on their collective support.\n\nWhat is immediately clear is the 'Respect and Responsibility' review, understood to be presented to the board last Thursday, now takes on greater significance.\n\nThe Herald on Sunday understands a hard-hitting 160-page document has been complied after a wide-ranging independent look at the culture of rugby.\n\nThe process included public submissions and featured a panel, headed by New Zealand Law Society president and employment lawyer Kathryn Beck and including Olympic canoeist Lisa Carrington, former All Black doctor Deb Robinson and former All Blacks Keven Mealamu and Michael Jones. They will want the review to have integrity.\n\nIt is understood the review covers everything from the relationship with alcohol to effective relationships, sexism, racism, attitudes to women, bullying and diversity.\n\nThe importance of real change being made in these areas has now been hastened.\n\n\"At a time when we are grappling with our cultural reputation, the Respect and Responsibility Review, which is currently under way, is even more important,\" Tew said yesterday.", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-3373462", "id": "10087278", "url": "http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&objectid=11907337", "sim": 0.4549019634723663, "details": {}, "uri": "711977505", "extractedDates": null, "eventUri": "eng-3370531", "image": "http://www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/9Q-UAyE8QcAglhHJ3K2uFQa_3DE=/1200x0/smart/filters:quality(70)/arc-anglerfish-syd-prod-nzme.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IMP3BKCNDVHKFAEZVEXB7G6GBE.jpg", "timeCrawl": "17:08:00", "isDuplicate": false, "dateTime": "2017-08-19T17:08:00Z", "lang": "eng", "title": "Rugby: Brand All Blacks has taken a major image hit", "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_Union", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby Union", "id": 46}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby_League", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Football/Rugby League", "id": 47}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/African", "label": "dmoz/Society/Ethnicity/African", "id": 757}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Nationalism", "id": 885}], "time": "17:08:00", "source": {"uri": "nzherald.co.nz", "title": "The New Zealand Herald", "id": "1424"}, "date": "2017-08-19", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19"}

Damian McKenzie - 8\n\nFirst run went backwards but played a big part in both his side's first two tries. A menace throughout in open play.\n\n14. Ben Smith - 7\n\nAlways made the right decision and excelled in the air. An invaluable role to the man wearing his regular jersey.\n\n13. Ryan Crotty - 9\n\nEnterprising in the carry, having a hand in several tries and soon rewarded with his own. Took an early, well-earned rest.\n\n12. Sonny Bill Williams - 8\n\nOne big midfield bust and the odd offload, proving far too big and strong for his try. A classy return to action.\n\n11. Rieko Ioane - 9\n\nOutfoxed Folau for his first try and showed his wheels for the second, proving even better in setting up McKenzie.\n\n10. Beauden Barrett - 8\n\nA couple of early errors but made up for it on the fourth and fifth tries. Canny cross-kick inside his own 22 a highlight.\n\n9. Aaron Smith - 8\n\nBrilliant pass for Crotty's try on halftime, capping a fine 40 minutes. Another given an early breather to end an eventful week.\n\n8. Kieran Read - 7\n\nGood offload for opening try and a huge hit on Beale, marking an excellent defensive effort. A lineout weapon.\n\n7. Sam Cane - 7\n\nFlawless as always on defence, providing the substance to unlock his team-mates' style.\n\n6. Liam Squire - 8\n\nShowed plenty of pace to open his team's account and proved it wasn't an anomaly setting up Ben Smith's try. Jerome who?\n\n5. Sam Whitelock - 6\n\nPerformed the core duties with aplomb but well and truly outshone by his locking partner. Subbed with 20 to play.\n\n4. Brodie Retallick - 9\n\nA jaw-dropping first half. Typically adept with ball in hand and typically influential when without. Played with real purpose.\n\n3. Owen Franks - 5\n\nFound guilty of scrum offences in opening quarter, then made another mistake before early substitution.\n\n2. Codie Taylor - 6\n\nDid nothing wrong but one of the few wearing black to not feature prominently with ball in hand.\n\n1. Joe Moody - 8\n\nAn impressive and incongruous dummy-and-step set up a try. The exclamation mark to a dynamic display.\n\nReserves:\n\n16. Nathan Harris - N/A\n\n17. Wyatt Crockett - N/A\n\n18. Ofa Tu'ungafasi - 6\n\n19. Luke Romano - 6\n\n20. Ardie Savea - 6\n\n21.

Eventually found his own way over the line.\n\n14. Henry Speight - 6\n\nProved elusive down the right flank and bruising up the middle, but marred by playing matador on defence.\n\n13. Samu Kerevi - 5\n\nMissed four first-half tackles as the All Blacks' attack decided the result, negating any impact on attack.\n\n12. Kurtley Beale - 6\n\nBreakdown with Foley led directly to All Blacks' third, eventually accounted for the error to score Australia's third.\n\n11. Curtis Rona - 5\n\nA debut try but little else to shout about. Perhaps the worst tackler of a rather bad bunch.\n\n10. Bernard Foley - 6\n\nKicked his goals but ineffective otherwise. Must gaze with envy at his opposite's skillset and impact.\n\n9. Will Genia - 6\n\nShifted the ball quickly to spark his side's initial attacks, substituted early as Australia turned around the match.\n\n8. Sean McMahon - 7\n\nThe most effective Australian forward when in possession, cracking the half-ton on run metres.\n\n7. Michael Hooper - 4\n\nHis infringement led to the first try, setting the tone for an ill-disciplined display. Missed too many tackles.\n\n6. Ned Hanigan - 6\n\nOne of the few Wallabies to tackle well but relatively ineffective at the breakdown.\n\n5. Adam Coleman - 7\n\nMade hard metres, decent in the lineout and lasted the distance. Walked away less wounded than he looks.\n\n4. Rory Arnold - 5\n\nSeemed like he was playing a different sport when compared with his opposite number.\n\n3. Allan Alaalatoa - 6\n\nEasily boasted the most As and Ls on the teamsheet. Little else to report.\n\n2. Stephen Moore - 3\n\nDragged at halftime after an effort that would be kind to describe as anonymous.\n\n1. Scott Sio - 7\n\nMore than held his own at scrum time and denied a try only by some desperate defence.", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-3374401", "id": "10064939", "url": "http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&objectid=11907404", "sim": 0.4549019634723663, "details": {}, "uri": "711916906", "extractedDates": null, "eventUri": "eng-3370531", "image": "http://www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/tiG9P3ofTpwhX4kGiHySISldClI=/1200x0/smart/filters:quality(70)/arc-anglerfish-syd-prod-nzme.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ENMB5WDX3RAOZLNA7SRFW7SXK4.jpg", "timeCrawl": "13:37:00", "isDuplicate": false, "dateTime": "2017-08-19T13:37:00Z", "lang": "eng", "title": "Player ratings: All Blacks v Wallabies", "location": null, "categories": [{"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Performing_Arts/Theatre", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Performing Arts/Theatre", "id": 114}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "id": 161}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Science/Math/Logic_and_Foundations", "label": "dmoz/Science/Math/Logic and Foundations", "id": 191}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Literature/Drama", "id": 284}, {"wgt": 100, "uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Management_Science", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Management Science", "id": 976}], "time": "13:37:00", "source": {"uri": "nzherald.co.nz", "title": "The New Zealand Herald", "id": "1424"}, "date": "2017-08-19", "dateCrawl": "2017-08-19"}

Suspensions\n\nWilliams' original suspension was for four weeks, although this was quickly altered to seven weeks when it was realised that Bledisloe 1 fell out of this original suspension window.\n\n2. Appointment of referees\n\nThis year the Bledisloe refereeing panel is being as subtle as a sledge hammer. Of the four games the All Blacks have lost since 2013, the referees have been Wayne Barnes twice, Jerome Garces and Mathieu Reynal.\n\nSo - based on this - if you're looking for a refereeing duo that the All Blacks have historically struggled to dominate their opposition so easily under, a Barnes and Garces combo would be the ideal combination.\n\nAnd this is what we have scheduled.\n\n3. Dunedin as the venue for New Zealand's single Bledisloe Test this year\n\nWhy hold this game at a venue that will clearly favour the visitors?\n\nIt is a relatively small venue compared to Auckland and Wellington, the rugby crowd is reserved, polite and extremely welcoming given there are not a whole lot of foreign visitors to the region. Hardly the hotbed you want an opposition walking into.\n\nSurely the fortress of Eden Park would be the better option. The All Blacks have a great winning record there and are guaranteed a large crowd through the gate, all of them rabid and annoyed, not only with the difficulty of getting in and out of a stadium stupidly situated in a residential suburb, but Auckland attendees will likely to be looking to share their building bile at soon to be rising interest rates and the spectre of negative equity that eats away at each of them every day.\n\nOne has to wonder who has influenced this venue decision.\n\nIf like me you've got your tin foil hat on, then it's clear between now and Rugby World Cup 2019 that many a hurdle will be placed in front of New Zealand.

Clinical was the word I found most often used. The All Blacks attacked the narrow channels, won the gain-line with ease.\n\nRearrange the following in a sentence; barrel, shooting, fish - The rush defence provided no issues at all.\n\nTest Two\n\nI will admit assessing uneven variables is way past my pay grade, but a surprising outcome was that, even with a seven man pack for the best part of an hour, New Zealand still dominated possession, territory and all of the set piece stats.\n\nThe Lions forwards competed at the gain line for the first 20 minutes of this Test but that was largely it for any extended period in this series.\n\nNick Bishop showed that even with 14 men, the All Blacks were still creating space in the wider channels but not getting the ball there. Kieran Read got way too conservative for too long when down to 14.\n\nTest Three\n\nFor this game Hansen moved his point of attack wider of the ruck, as well attacking in close again, and with great success.\n\nNgani Laumape ran rampant, Owen Farrell missed five tackles and, for 50 minutes until Jerome Kaino went to the bin, the All Blacks made the gain line in close and went through the Lions backline almost at will.\n\nThe nine line breaks the All Blacks made this day would normally be enough to put a Test away but their execution was way below standard.\n\nArdie Savea dropped a sitter with the line open, Jordie Barrett threw a forward pass when Savea had an unopposed stroll. Laumape, Sam Cane and Barrett all spilled the ball in the red zone with the defensive line going backwards.\n\nThe execution was extremely poor, but it simply was not a function of any rush pattern.\n\nAdd Beauden Barrett's poor grubber kick for Read with the Lions backfield in disarray in Test two, and the execution errors really start to add up and get costly. This one, once again, not forced by any semblance of rushing defence.\n\nWhile the following clip's focus is on Beauden Barrett, there is enough in here to show that the All Blacks were in the back of the Lions almost at will.\n\nAny actual highlights clip of the Test demonstrates this at even greater length.\n\nSo why did the All Blacks not comfortably win the series and what will need to happen again to tip up the All Blacks in the Rugby Championship?\n\nHere are six things that made it the perfect storm for the All Blacks - almost literally.\n\n1. It rained - a lot\n\nLet's compare these games to New Zealand performances in wet weather Tests.\n\nWhile I am sure there are others, two spring to mind for me.\n\nvs Australia in Sydney 2014 - score 12-12\n\nI was at this game and it was miserable. A tight battle played on a soaked park in the rain and neither side managed to cross the chalk. Not sure I remember Ewen McKenzie being lauded for a magnificent defensive pattern despite New Zealand being kept try-less.\n\nvs South Africa at Twickenham, 2015. Score 20-18\n\nIf you are looking for the best rush defence executed against the All Blacks in recent years then go and watch this game. New Zealand scored two tries from five line breaks in an absolute soaking slugfest this night.\n\nFair to say, if you want to restrict the New Zealand attack then the weather gods will play a greater role in the outcome than any defensive system.\n\n2. A quite magnificent Lions scramble defence\n\nThis was the real key to staying in the games.\n\nWhether Gatland selected his pacy back three with this is mind is unknown, but this and the attitude displayed - Bishop calls it 'unity of purpose' - were the major contributors to the Lions defensive effort across Tests two and three.\n\nI have never seen a composite side with as much effort as we saw on this tour, they got up off the ground, covered each other, chased everything and never surrendered.\n\nJonathan Davies for me was brilliant in this regard, as well as timing his shooting out of the line in isolation superbly. The injuries to Billy Vunipola and Stuart Hogg that elevated Taulupe Faletau and Liam Williams ended up being fortunate bonuses to the Lions' defensive effort.\n\nRugby Videos See more \" Wallaroos register their first win of their World Cup campaign 1:05 Aaron Smith scandal leads to tense press conference 1:02 Justified red card or rugby gone soft? 0:58 Samu Kerevi itching to face SBW and All Blacks 0:59\n\n3. You don't want to play against 15 All Blacks all the time\n\nSelf-inflicted to a large degree, but the simple fact of the matter is there were 240 minutes of rugby in this series and New Zealand played with 14 men for 27 per cent of the time.\n\nYou aren't winning games or series being undermanned for a full quarter of the minutes, or more importantly, for more than 40 per cent of the last two Tests.\n\n4. Missing best in class players\n\nNot sure there is too much argument in declaring Dan Coles and Ben Smith as the best in their positions, while Ryan Crotty wouldn't be too far away if selecting a World XV. Coles remains out of Bledisloe One.\n\nIn isolation, this is something New Zealand should be able to cover, but in the perfect storm, it was a major contributing factor to the lack of execution.\n\n5. Goal kicking\n\nEvery New Zealander holds their breath every time Beauden Barrett stands over a goal kick. This was always going to cost a Test eventually and it very nearly cost a series.\n\nFarrell, on the other hand, was great in the clutch and confirmed himself as the world's best goal kicker.\n\n6. You need the rub of the refereeing green\n\nWithout relitigating the actual decisions, it would be fair to say the big calls favoured the Lions in the series.\n\nEver seen ten kickable penalties awarded in a Test without a yellow card?\n\nLet's say it, to tip up the All Blacks it really helps if Romain Garces somewhere in the immediate vicinity.\n\nIs it a coincidence that he was the appointment for the first Bledisloe Test before withdrawing through injury?\n\nAny single one of these items would normally be absorbed by what remains a quality New Zealand side, and to not lose the series against a very good Lions team in face of this perfect storm is actually quite impressive.\n\n(AAP Image/ David Rowland)\n\nThe series, however, threw up two interesting things you don't need to compete with the All Blacks.\n\nFirstly, you don't need to dominate the scoreboard. Over 240 minutes of rugby, the British and Irish Lions led for a sum total of three minutes.\n\nSecondly, you don't need parity in the forwards - something I'm surprised did not garner more comment or interest.\n\nWe were told the Lions would dominate set pieces, generate penalties, kick for touch and bully the All Blacks into submission, but nothing could have been further from the truth.\n\nThe Lions scrum, based on the Saracens model, was disappointing at best, toothless at worst. I'm not sure if Owen Franks has ever had an easier three weeks.\n\nNew Zealand scrummed at 100 per cent across the three Tests generating points from both penalties and try from this set piece. The Lions scrummed at 86 per cent.\n\nLineouts were really interesting. Across the series, New Zealand were at 81 per cent and the Lions 83 per cent, but there is a nice little quirk in the stats.\n\nOnce Maro Itoje was introduced in Tests two and three, New Zealand improved and the Lions deteriorated, with the numbers at 95 per cent versus 76 per cent.\n\nI would consider Itoje to be easily the best own ball jumper in world rugby right now, but it appears he was countered with relative ease.\n\nThe series is now consigned to history, and now the Championship starts, a wounded NZ, a revitalised South Africa, a super fit Australia and the ever mercurial Argentina.

He was a man who was generous with his name and his fame, driven by a strong belief that people with intellectual disabilities deserved the best. He believed that as a former All Black, with the opportunities he had been given, meant he had a responsibility to lend a hand where he could.\n\nThe legendary 'Pinetree' Meads played 133 matches for the All Blacks between 1957 and 1971. He was on IHC's team for 43 years.\n\nColin threw his weight behind IHC after he stopped playing rugby. In 1974 he was visited by IHC members - by the time they left, Colin had agreed to head up a newly formed King Country sub-branch.\n\n\"I said then I would give you two years. Within two years I was on the National Fundraising Committee,\" Colin said in his last interview with Community Moves. The two-year deadline came and went.\n\n\"We were going through the process of getting people away from the big institutions and out into the community,\" he says.\n\nHe often spoke about one young man from Kimberley Hospital in Levin, who became his friend. \"Dean Walker had been there since he was five.\" He was 15 or 16 when he left the institution to live in Te Kuiti and he became part of the community. \"It was the greatest move. Deano became part of the Waitete Rugby Club, so one thing led to another.\"\n\nColin put his money where his mouth was. Rugby in those days wasn't professional and there were rules around fees. So Colin and the IHC branch set up a special account into which he donated the proceeds from his many speaking engagements.\n\nIn 1988 this money went towards buying a farm in Te Kuiti for people with intellectual disabilities. The idea was to provide employment and teach farming skills and it became home to Dean and other men with disabilities for many years.\n\nHe remained concerned at the lack of employment opportunities for young people with disabilities and recalled the pride when someone got a job. \"I can remember the thrill of some of them getting their first pay. That was theirs; they were going to bank it.\"\n\nColin was knighted in 2001, but never used the title 'Sir' in his involvement with IHC. That would have set him apart. He was more comfortable kicking a ball around with a young disabled rugby player or standing for long hours at Mystery Creek Fieldays, whipping up support for IHC among his fellow farmers.\n\nColin was a natural fundraiser and backed a number of ingenious farm-based fundraising schemes. He bought a horse each year at the yearling sales, and he and IHC supporters sold raffle tickets and raised between $110,000 and $120,000 a horse. Colin also supported farmers Norm Cashmore and Mick Murphy who started the IHC Calf Scheme in 1983. They encouraged dairy farmers to raise a calf and donate the proceeds to IHC in exchange for a pair of gumboots.\n\nThe IHC Calf & Rural Scheme is still going 33 years later and it raises more than $1 million annually for people with disabilities.\n\nWhen Colin was made a distinguished companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit from Governor-General Dame Silvia Cartwright in 2001 he told us \"she said this is not just for your rugby, this is for your work with IHC also. I was quite proud of it to be honest\".\n\n\"Colin Meads made an extraordinary contribution to improve the lives of people with intellectual disabilities - one-on-one and on a large scale,\" says Ralph Jones.\n\n\"Colin and Verna Meads have truly made a difference.\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T03:53:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 72, "textStart": 58, "date": "2017-08-20", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.4392156898975372, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373494", "time": "03:53:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3370531", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "242009", "label": {"eng": "Te Kuiti"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Te_Kuiti", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Te Kuiti"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, "score": 3}, {"id": "302718", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "score": 3}, {"id": "303732", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Employment"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment", "score": 3}, {"id": "304107", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Horse"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse", "score": 2}, {"id": "305200", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Disability"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability", "score": 5}, {"id": "309322", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Rugby union"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_union", "score": 5}, {"id": "323269", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Intellectual disability"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_disability", "score": 5}, {"id": "346371", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand national rugby union team"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_national_rugby_union_team", "score": 3}, {"id": "377063", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand Order of Merit"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Order_of_Merit", "score": 1}, {"id": "413040", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "King Country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Country", "score": 3}, {"id": "662484", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Mystery Creek Events Centre"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_Creek_Events_Centre", "score": 2}, {"id": "688256", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Colin Meads"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Meads", "score": 5}, {"id": "853262", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "National Agricultural Fieldays"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Agricultural_Fieldays", "score": 2}, {"id": "905168", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Ralph Jones"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Jones", "score": 3}], "image": "http://img.scoop.co.nz/stories/images/1509/scoop_placeholder.jpg", "wgt": 1, "timeCrawl": "03:53:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "IHC New Zealand pays tribute to Colin Meads", "originalArticle": null}], "pages": 263}}}

I didn't change until 30 minutes before the game. The haka was my warm-up.\n\n\"I worry about the modern game, I think they do too much warm-up. If you need tackling practice before the game, you shouldn't be in the team.\"\n\nAfter announcing in August (2016) that he had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer after feeling \"crook\" (sick) for six months, he asked for privacy as he fought the disease.\n\nMeads' biographer, the late Alex Veysey, said success never changed the big man.\n\n\"His rugby moved multitudes to wild-eyed, horse-throated frenzy,\" Veysey wrote.\n\n\"Yet when rugby day was done, he became what he had always been -- a farmer embarrassed by his fame, always seeking the quiet company of his fellows, a bit bemused when the autograph hunters besieged him beyond others.\"", "dateTime": "2017-08-20T04:05:00Z", "extractedDates": [{"textEnd": 433, "textStart": 422, "date": "2016-08-", "amb": false}], "sim": 0.7568627595901489, "dateCrawl": "2017-08-20", "details": {}, "storyUri": "eng-3373494", "time": "04:05:00", "lang": "eng", "eventUri": "eng-3370531", "location": null, "concepts": [{"id": "12", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Australia"}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "171", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}, "score": 5}, {"id": "84296", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Scotland"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "242009", "label": {"eng": "Te Kuiti"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Te_Kuiti", "type": "loc", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Te Kuiti"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand"}}}, "score": 2}, {"id": "305180", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Pancreatic cancer"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatic_cancer", "score": 3}, {"id": "309322", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Rugby union"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_union", "score": 5}, {"id": "309560", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Test cricket"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_cricket", "score": 4}, {"id": "310925", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Sheep"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheep", "score": 4}, {"id": "326436", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "British and Irish Lions"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_and_Irish_Lions", "score": 3}, {"id": "346371", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "New Zealand national rugby union team"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_national_rugby_union_team", "score": 5}, {"id": "348282", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Haka"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haka", "score": 2}, {"id": "364401", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "John Key"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Key", "score": 3}, {"id": "380189", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Richie McCaw"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richie_McCaw", "score": 3}, {"id": "399676", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Sheep station"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheep_station", "score": 4}, {"id": "413040", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "King Country"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Country", "score": 3}, {"id": "443020", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "Liniment"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liniment", "score": 2}, {"id": "497781", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Steve Tew"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Tew", "score": 3}, {"id": "688256", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Colin Meads"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Meads", "score": 3}, {"id": "802433", "type": "person", "label": {"eng": "Ken Catchpole"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Catchpole", "score": 2}, {"id": "1318865", "type": "wiki", "label": {"eng": "World Rugby Hall of Fame"}, "uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Rugby_Hall_of_Fame", "score": 3}], "image": null, "wgt": 1, "timeCrawl": "04:05:00", "isDuplicate": false, "title": "New Zealand's mighty All Black Colin 'Pinetree' Meads dies of cancer", "originalArticle": null}], "pages": 264}}}

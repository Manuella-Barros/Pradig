More than half-a-million others escaped Afghanistan after the Taliban takeover in 2021, with thousands waiting in Pakistan for resettlement in the United States and elsewhere.\n\nSince Pakistan's widely-criticised clampdown started last November, an estimated six lakh Afghans have returned home. The undocumented Afghans are separate from refugees who have registered with the authorities and the UNHCR, though the crackdown has raised concerns among the refugee population as well.\n\nAlso Read | PM Narendra Modi Calls Russia's Highest Civilian Award 'Order of St Andrew the Apostle' an Honour for 140 Crore Indians.\n\nUN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi arrived in Pakistan on Sunday and met with Afghan refugees on the first two days of his visit.\n\n\"I spent time with Afghan refugees whose resourcefulness is testimony to their strength -- and to Pakistan's long hospitality,\" Grandi wrote on the social media platform X, adding that his visit aimed to \"discuss how we can best support both amidst growing challenges\".\n\nPakistan's Prime Minister Shabaz Sharif told the UN refugee agency chief that Afghan refugees are treated with \"exemplary respect and dignity\" despite facing multiple challenges, according to a statement released by his office on Tuesday.\n\nSharif also urged the international community to \"recognise the burden being shouldered by Pakistan while hosting such a large refugee population and demonstrate collective responsibility\".\n\nHe also asked for help from UNHCR to repatriate the refugees in \"a safe and dignified\" manner.\n\nAfter the meeting, the UNHCR said Grandi expressed his appreciation that the repatriation of undocumented persons has been suspended and sought assurances that it would remain on hold.\n\nThere was no immediate confirmation from the authorities that the repatriation was in fact halted.\n\nGrandi also urged Pakistani officials to extend the validity of the registration cards -- critical identity documents -- held by over 1.3 million (13 lakh) Afghan refugees in Pakistan.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, Grandi met with Asif Durrani, the country's special representative for Afghanistan. Durrani wrote on X that the two men \"expressed readiness to find a durable solution to the Afghan refugee problem, including their repatriation\".\n\nPakistan had previously said the crackdown targeted those without valid documents regardless of nationality.\n\nUN agencies have decried the forced expulsion of Afghans from Pakistan, saying it could lead to severe human rights violations -- including the separation of families and deportation of minors. Although Pakistan had been routinely deporting Afghans who came here without valid documents in recent years, the ongoing crackdown is unprecedented in scale.\n\nSince the crackdown, the neighbouring Taliban-led government in Kabul said it set up a commission to deal with repatriated nationals and has criticised Islamabad's actions.\n\nPakistan has also faced a surge in militant attacks on security forces and civilians, mostly blamed on the Pakistani Taliban -- a separate militant group but a close ally of the Afghan Taliban -- straining the ties between the two countries.\n\nOn Tuesday, four soldiers, including an army captain, were killed in a pair of attacks in former militant strongholds of North and South Waziristan in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province near the Afghan border, the military said. Two militants were killed in the North Waziristan attack, where a search operation was still underway to find the attackers.\n\nSharif denounced the attacks and paid glowing tributes to the slain soldiers, a statement from his office said.\n\nNorth and South Waziristan served as a base for the Pakistani Taliban until a crackdown by the Pakistani military killed or arrested most in recent years. Others fled to Afghanistan, where they have been living openly.

It may be noted that no such understanding has been given by Pakistan to the UNHCR, including in recent meetings with the High Commissioner for Refugees,\" Mumtaz Zehra Baloch told the newspaper.\n\nEarlier, UNHCR Commissioner Filippo Grandi, after his three-day visit on Tuesday confirmed the suspension of the repatriation plan after meeting with Pakistani leaders.", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_refugees", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Afghan refugees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_High_Commissioner_for_Refugees", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nawaz_Sharif", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nawaz Sharif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghanistan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Afghanistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Deportation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shehbaz_Sharif", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shehbaz Sharif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_Pakistan", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cabinet of Pakistan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Pakistan", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of Pakistan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caretaker_government", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caretaker government"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repatriation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Repatriation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filippo_Grandi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Filippo Grandi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10_Downing_Street", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "10 Downing Street"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign,_Commonwealth_and_Development_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_displacement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Forced displacement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_commissioner", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "High commissioner"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn_(newspaper)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dawn (newspaper)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baloch_people", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baloch people"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Illegal immigration"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/aiimagegallery/10_07_2024_16_17_33_9693963.png?width=920&format=jpeg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718034", "eventUri": "eng-9718034", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-30", "textStart": 101, "textEnd": 108}, {"amb": false, "date": "-11-01", "textStart": 1121, "textEnd": 1131}], "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

Since the crackdown began in November, around 600,000 Afghans have returned home.\n\nGrandi, who arrived in Pakistan on Sunday, spent two days meeting Afghan refugees, praising their resilience and Pakistan's hospitality. His visit aimed to discuss support for both refugees and Pakistan amidst increasing challenges.\n\nSharif emphasized that Afghan refugees have been treated with respect and dignity in Pakistan and called on the international community to recognize Pakistan's burden and share responsibility. He also requested UNHCR's assistance in repatriating the refugees safely and with dignity.\n\nGrandi also met with Asif Durrani, Pakistan's special representative for Afghanistan, who expressed a commitment to finding a durable solution to the Afghan refugee issue, including repatriation.\n\nThe Taliban-led Afghan government has criticized Pakistan's crackdown and set up a commission to handle repatriated nationals. Meanwhile, Pakistan faces a surge in militant attacks, mostly attributed to the Pakistani Taliban, straining ties with Afghanistan.\n\nThe trend of deporting Afghan migrants from Iran and Pakistan continued amid a humanitarian crisis despite international reactions, according to Khaama Press report.\n\nThe forced deportation of Afghan refugees from Iran and Pakistan has exacerbated the dire humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan. Many of these deportees face uncertain futures after returning to Afghanistan as the country faces economic instability and a lack of basic services.\n\nThe sudden increase in returnees has already overwhelmed communities and humanitarian organisations are struggling to provide support.\n\nHuman rights groups and organisations across the world have condemned the mass deportations and expressed concerns regarding the safety and well-being of Afghan deportees, Khaama Press reported.\n\nInternational human rights groups said that such actions violate international law, especially concerning the principle of non-refoulement, which bans the forced return of refugees to a country where they could face persecution or serious harm.\n\nAmidst these developments, Afghanistan faces a dire humanitarian crisis exacerbated by the forced return of thousands of migrants, many of whom include vulnerable women and children. The situation highlights ongoing human rights violations and challenges in protecting the rights and safety of Afghan refugees\n\nAfter seizing power, the Taliban has shut schools for girls from grades 7 to 12 and barred women from pursuing studies in universities.

But the country has not always welcomed Afghan refugees, subjecting them to hostile living conditions and threatening deportation over the years.\n\nMore than 3 million Afghan refugees, including registered refugees and more than 800,000 undocumented people were living in Pakistan as of March 2024, according to UNHCR data.\n\nSome fled their home country decades ago during the Soviet invasion, while other Afghans sought refuge in Pakistan when the Taliban retook Afghanistan in 2021, implementing its oppressive rule.\n\nLast October, Pakistan gave undocumented Afghans weeks to leave or face deportation, claiming Afghan nationals carried out 14 of 24 major terrorist attacks in Pakistan last year. Between September 15, 2023 and the end of June, about 650,000 Afghans had returned home, according to the UNHCR. Some 32,000 of them were deported.\n\nThey're returning to a country under the control of a militant regime that has imposed a form of gender apartheid and where millions live in poverty.\n\nA UN report published Tuesday detailed human rights violations by the Taliban's so-called morality police - which have disproportionately targeted women and girls - creating a \"climate of fear and intimidation\" in Afghanistan.\n\nMoniza Kakar, a lawyer who helps Afghan migrants navigate Pakistan's legal system, said the POR card extension will not provide stability for all refugees.\n\n\"Afghan communities that I have spoken to are still concerned since there are many instances of households where a man might have a POR card and his wife and kids would have no documentation,\" Kakar told CNN.\n\n\"There is still a huge worry amongst families of being split because of these issues of documentation.\"\n\nThyagi Ruwanpathirana, a regional researcher for South Asia at Amnesty International, said the human rights group had \"documented extensive delays and barriers refugees face in obtaining POR cards.\"\n\nThe status of 80,000 Afghan Citizen Card holders, another form of registration for Afghan refugees in Pakistan, was also uncertain, Ruwanpathirana added.\n\n\"We urge the government of Pakistan to formally suspend its 'Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan,' stop all deportations, and develop a national legal framework to regulate access to refugee status in line with international refugee law,\" she said. -- CNN", "source": {"uri":

He also expressed appreciation that the \"Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan\" had been suspended and sought assurances that it would remain on hold. Grandi urged Pakistan to continue its proud tradition of hospitality towards Afghans with international protection needs.\n\nRecognizing the challenges faced by Pakistan and the country's admirable generosity over 45 years of hosting Afghan refugees, Grandi called for an urgent reset of the aid model towards solutions and responsibility sharing.

The UNHCR had asked Pakistan not to repatriate these 70,000 Afghans as their lives would be in danger if sent back to Afghanistan. The government, therefore, decided that these 70,000 Afghans would be sent to a third country, but after three years, only 9,000 were sent to the third country. During the meeting, the UNHCR official called for bolstering efforts towards longer-term solutions for Afghans in Pakistan, and support for their host communities.\n\nUNHCR official seeks urgent reset of aid model, timely extension of PoR card; promises to pave way for voluntary returns\n\nDuring his three-day stay, Mr Grandi visited Peshawar and Haripur in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, meeting Afghan refugees in urban settings as well as in a refugee village. People he met shared a message of anxiety regarding their situation, but also of their desire to contribute to their communities in Pakistan, as well as eventually in Afghanistan, said the statement.\n\nThe high commissioner also called for the timely extension of the PoR cards, a critical identity document held by over 1.3 million Afghan refugees. He expressed appreciation that the \"Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan\" had been suspended and sought assurances that it would remain on hold. He called for Pakistan's proud tradition of hospitality towards those Afghans with international protection needs to continue.\n\nRecognising the challenges facing the country and hosting the refugees for over 45 years, Mr Grandi called for an urgent reset of the aid model towards solutions and responsibility sharing, including fostering new partnerships and developing innovative approaches to addressing the protracted displacement situation. \"We need to seize this opportunity to accelerate solutions, and have a bigger, broader vision for the Afghan people in Pakistan,\" he added.\n\nThe high commissioner offered to work towards a dialogue later this year, which would bring together key stakeholders (including government representatives, develop\u00adment actors, and the private sector) to develop a package of solutions for the benefit of Afghans living in Pakistan and the host country itself.\n\nMr Grandi also committed to redoubling efforts aimed at creating conditions conducive for returns to Afghanistan, including from the perspective of material conditions, access to services, job opportunities, as well as rights -- paving the way for sustainable voluntary returns in the future.\n\nIn the meantime, as Pakistan continues to host some three million Afghans, all solutions need to be explored in addition to voluntary repatriation, including third-country resettlement and longer-term solutions within Pakistan.", "source": {"uri": "dawn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dawn"}, "authors": [{"uri": "syed_irfan_raza@dawn.com", "name": "Syed Irfan Raza",

More than half a million others escaped Afghanistan after the Taliban takeover in 2021, with thousands waiting in Pakistan for resettlement in the United States and elsewhere.\n\nSince Pakistan's widely criticized clampdown started last November, an estimated 600,000 Afghans have returned home.\n\nU.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi arrived in Pakistan on Sunday and met with Afghan refugees on the first two days of his visit.\n\n\"I spent time with Afghan refugees whose resourcefulness is testimony to their strength -- and to Pakistan's long hospitality,\" Grandi wrote on the social media platform X, adding that his visit aimed to \"discuss how we can best support both amidst growing challenges.\"\n\nPakistan's Prime Minister Shabaz Sharif told the U.N. refugee agency chief that Afghan refugees are treated with \"exemplary respect and dignity\" despite facing multiple challenges, according to a statement released by his office Tuesday.\n\nSharif also urged the international community to \"recognize the burden being shouldered by Pakistan while hosting such a large refugee population and demonstrate collective responsibility.\"\n\nHe also asked for help from UNHCR to repatriate the refugees in \"a safe and dignified\" manner.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, Grandi met with Asif Durrani, the country's special representative for Afghanistan. Durrani wrote on X that the two men \"expressed readiness to find a durable solution to the Afghan refugee problem, including their repatriation.\"\n\nPakistan had previously said the crackdown targeted those without valid documents regardless of nationality.\n\nU.N. agencies have decried the forced expulsion of Afghans from Pakistan, saying it could lead to severe human rights violations -- including the separation of families and deportation of minors. Although Pakistan had been routinely deporting Afghans who came here without valid documents in recent years, the ongoing crackdown is unprecedented in scale.\n\nSince the crackdown, the neighboring Taliban-led government in Kabul said it set up a commission to deal with repatriated nationals and has criticized Islamabad's actions.\n\nPakistan has also faced a surge in militant attacks on security forces and civilians, mostly blamed on the Pakistani Taliban -- a separate militant group but a close ally of the Afghan Taliban -- straining the ties between the two countries.\n\nOn Tuesday, four soldiers, including an army captain, were killed in a pair of attacks in former militant strongholds of North and South Waziristan in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province near the Afghan border, the military said. Two militants were killed in the North Waziristan attack, where a search operation was still underway to find the attackers.\n\nSharif denounced the attacks, and paid glowing tributes to the slain soldiers, a statement from his office said.\n\nNorth and South Waziristan served as a base for the Pakistani Taliban until a crackdown by the Pakistani military killed or arrested most in recent years. Others fled to Afghanistan, where they have been living openly.", "source": {"uri": "kentuckytoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Kentucky Today"}, "authors": [{"uri":

legally residing in the country a day after the UN refugee commissioner asked for a pause in the country's plan to repatriate refugees.\n\nIn a meeting on Wednesday, the federal cabinet gave a go-ahead to a one-year extension of Proof Of Registration (POR) cards for 1.45 million Afghan refugees and whose POR cards expired last month.\n\nThe extension in the POR cards has been granted till 30th June next year.\n\nThe development came a day after United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Filippo Grandi met top Pakistani officials including Prime Minister Shehbaz and appreciated the country for suspending the \"Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan,\" according to a statement issued by the UN UNHCR.\n\nDuring his discussions with Pakistani officials, the high commissioner had called for the timely extension of the POR cards, a critical identity document held by over 1.3 million Afghan refugees.\n\nThe statement said Grandi also sought assurance that the repatriation plan would remain on hold.\n\nIn the meeting, PM Shehbaz called on the world to recognise the country's burden of hosting a large population of Afghan refugees and demonstrate collective responsibility.\n\nIslamabad began expelling undocumented foreigners, mostly Afghans, in November last year amid a row over accusations that Afghanistan harbours militants, a charge its ruling Taliban deny.\n\nPakistan says it is also struggling to host millions of refugees as it grapples with an economic crisis.\n\nLast year, Pakistan announced a huge drive to repatriate foreigners without visas, mostly the roughly 4 million Afghans who crossed the border during 40 years of armed conflict in their home country and after the Taliban seized power in 2021.\n\nMore than 500,000 Afghans have returned from Pakistan since the campaign was announced, according to UN figures.\n\nThe UN High Commissioner for Refugees, earlier this week wrapped up a three-day visit during which he called for the extension of the registration cards and said the international community should find more solutions for refugees and host countries such as Pakistan, the UNHCR statement said.", "source": {"uri":

High Commissioner for Refugees, or UNHCR, wrapped up his three-day visit Tuesday and called for \"a bolstering of efforts towards longer-term solutions\" for Afghans in Pakistan.\n\nA post-visit UNHCR statement said, \"Grandi expressed appreciation that the 'Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan' had been suspended and sought assurances that it would remain on hold.\"\n\nA senior Pakistani official who was knowledgeable about Grandi's meetings with leaders in Islamabad confirmed to VOA that Pakistan had halted deportation of Afghans. However, the official did not specify the duration of the suspension. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly to the media.\n\n\"Our message to Grandi was that the international community should fulfill its responsibility for the upkeep and repatriation of Afghan refugees. It's a shared responsibility and shouldn't be left to Pakistan to lift the entire burden,\" the official said.\n\nThe decision to suspend the evictions of Afghans was taken on \"humanitarian grounds\" because of deteriorating economic and humanitarian conditions facing impoverished, war-ravaged Afghanistan, said Pakistani and U.N. officials.\n\nDuring his visit, Grandi met with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and other senior Pakistani officials, and his talks mainly focused on the fate of about 3 million Afghans.\n\nAccording to Pakistani and U.N. officials, of those, about 1.3 million are officially declared refugees, nearly 900,000 hold Afghan citizenship cards, and the remainder are without documents, or their visas have expired while waiting to seek asylum in third countries after fleeing the August 2021 Taliban takeover of Afghanistan.\n\nRepatriation action\n\nPakistan unleashed a crackdown last November on all foreigners illegally staying in the country, citing a dramatic rise in militant attacks and attributing them to people residing among the refugee populations. The move has largely targeted more than 1 million Afghan migrants and asylum-seekers who lack legal documents or valid visas.\n\nPakistani and Afghan officials say close to 600,000 Afghans have been repatriated to their homeland since the deportation campaign started.\n\nDuring his stay in Pakistan, Grandi also traveled to Afghan refugee localities in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, including its capital of Peshawar, and met with their representatives.\n\n\"In the meantime, as Pakistan continues to host some 3 million Afghans, all solutions need to be explored in addition to voluntary repatriation, including third-country resettlement and longer-term solutions within Pakistan,\" concluded the UNHCR statement.\n\nIslamabad maintains that anti-Pakistan militant groups entrenched in sanctuaries in Afghanistan have stepped up attacks against Pakistani security forces and civilians since the Taliban returned to power in the neighboring country three years ago.\n\nTaliban authorities have criticized the expulsion of Afghans from Pakistan and dismissed allegations they are allowing militants to use Afghan soil to threaten neighboring countries and

The purpose of the new method is to make the monitoring of Afghan citizens effective.\n\nMeanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has sought UN High Commissioner for Refugees Fili\u00acppo Grandi's support in mobilising adequate resources to supplement Pakistan's efforts.\n\nThe top UN body official was on a three-day official visit to the country to take stock of the situation. He called on PM Shehbaz on the last leg of his visit.\n\nThe premier urged the UN body to play its role in promoting durable solutions to address the situation of Afghan refugees, including through safe and dignified return and reintegration into their homeland, as well as third-country relocation.\n\nDuring his Pakistan stay, according to a UNHCR statement, Grandi visited Peshawar and Haripur, meeting with Afghan refugees in urban settings as well as in a refugee village.\n\n\"People he met shared a message of anxiety regarding their situation, but also of their desire to contribute to their communities in Pakistan, as well as eventually in Afghanistan.\"\n\nThe high commissioner called for the timely extension of the PoR cards and expressed appreciation that the \"Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan\" had been suspended and sought assurances that it would remain on hold.\n\nHe called for Pakistan's proud tradition of hospitality towards those Afghans with international protection needs to continue.\n\nRecognising the challenges facing the country and the admirable generosity of the Pakistani government over 45 years of hosting Afghan refugees, Grandi called for an urgent reset of the aid model towards solutions and responsibility sharing, including fostering new partnerships and developing innovative approaches to addressing the protracted displacement situation.\n\nThe high commissioner offered to work towards a dialogue later this year, which will bring together key stakeholders -- including government representatives, development actors, and the private sector -- to develop a package of solutions that benefits both the Afghan population living in Pakistan and the host country itself.\n\nGrandi also committed to redoubling efforts aimed at creating conditions conducive for returns to Afghanistan including from the perspective of material conditions, access to services, job opportunities, as well as rights -- paving the way for sustainable voluntary returns in the future.", "source": {"uri": "geo.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "GEO TV"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Even explicit promises are not kept. Following the Taliban takeover in 2021, an additional 70,000 refugees came to Pakistan.

This criticism, however, overlooked the burden on Pakistan's struggling economy, which has hosted these refugees for decades. The countries and coalitions responsible for the massive displacement of Afghan people towards Pakistan have gradually shirked their responsibility for the refugees. Busy with war and weapons, the United States and its NATO allies have withdrawn support for key United Nations humanitarian projects.\n\nThe UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) also suffers from a shortage of funds while displaced populations grow. In a meeting with UNHCR Commissioner Filippo Grandi, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif rightly highlighted the global community's responsibility. Pakistan lacks the resources to accommodate or carry out the mass repatriation process in a dignified way. Handling 1.7 million people requires immense resources and help from the UN and its partners.\n\nBeyond repatriation, the 1.45 million registered Afghan refugees in Pakistan need education and other essential services. Without cooperation from the UNHCR and dedicated funds, this cannot be achieved. Blind criticism must be replaced by an acknowledgment of Pakistan's role in accommodating the second-largest refugee population for so long. This acknowledgment must then be followed by concrete assistance, both in repatriation and in supporting the refugees who will remain in Pakistan.\n\nNot long ago, wealthy and resourceful European countries panicked when displaced Syrians entered their territories. In sharp contrast, Pakistan welcomed Afghan refugees with a sense of duty to a neighboring country. All global stakeholders should take collective responsibility, and the UNHCR must streamline assistance to sustain, return, or relocate Afghan refugees in Pakistan.", "source": {"uri": "nation.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Nation"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repatriation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Repatriation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_High_Commissioner_for_Refugees", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Afghans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_refugees", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Afghan refugees"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forced_displacement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Forced displacement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shehbaz_Sharif", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shehbaz Sharif"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filippo_Grandi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Filippo Grandi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internally_displaced_person", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Internally displaced person"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghans_in_Pakistan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Afghans in Pakistan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Syria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Syria"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Refugees", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/Refugees", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 76}], "image": "https://www.nation.com.pk/assets/thenation_202006/images/no-image-large.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9718034", "eventUri": "eng-9718034", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

Courtesy Reuters\n\nIslamabad said on Wednesday that 1.45 million Afghan refugees in Pakistan will be permitted to remain for an additional year, but it vowed that the expulsion of unregistered migrants would go on.\n\nSince Islamabad last year ordered unauthorized migrants to leave or risk imprisonment as relations with Kabul worsened over security, nearly 600,000 Afghans have departed Pakistan.\n\nHuman rights observers cautioned that individuals deported to Afghanistan under Taliban rule had minimal assistance and that some may risk persecution from the country's new government in Kabul.\n\nPrime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's cabinet said it approved an extension until June 2025 for the 1.45 million Afghan refugees legally residing in the country who hold Proof of Registration cards.\n\nThe cards expired at the end of last month, leaving holders without legal certainty about their right to remain in Pakistan.\n\nNot all Afghan citizens in Pakistan have such cards and even those who do hold them have reported being harassed and intimidated to leave the country.\n\nIslamabad's announcement came the day after a three-day visit by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Filippo Grandi.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, the UNHCR said Grandi \"expressed appreciation that the 'Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan' had been suspended\".\n\nHowever a foreign office spokeswoman said \"this is not true\".\n\nMumtaz Zahra Baloch told reporters in a statement: \"No such understanding has been given by Pakistan to the UNHCR\" and the scheme \"remains in place and is being implemented in an orderly and phased manner\".\n\nMeanwhile, a Pakistani immigration official at the Torkham border crossing said they had begun seizing documents, including refugee registration cards, from departing Afghans.\n\n\"We are implementing this directive following instructions from the Ministry of Interior,\" said the official at the busiest crossing between Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\n\"This measure aims to ensure they do not return to Pakistan and instead depart permanently, though they may re-enter after obtaining a visa,\" he told AFP on condition of anonymity.\n\nMillions of Afghans have poured into Pakistan over the years, fleeing decades of cascading conflict.\n\nAn estimated 600,000 arrived since the Taliban government seized power in August 2021 and imposed its stark interpretation of Islamic law.\n\nIslamabad has previously said its massive eviction scheme is justified by security concerns and its faltering economy.\n\nAnalysts say it is pressuring Kabul over rising attacks in Pakistan's border regions with Afghanistan, where the Taliban government is accused of giving militants safe haven.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com",

After forcing thousands back daily, the deportations slowed down and appeared to halt in recent months.\n\nOn Wednesday, following a visit by the U.N. refugee agency chief, Filippo Grandi, Islamabad announced it has extended the stay of 1.45 million Afghan refugees residing in the country.\n\nDuring his visit, Grandi welcomed what he described as the Pakistan government 's suspension of the deportations.\n\nHowever, Baloch denied that was the case and said there has been no suspension in the anti-migrant crackdown that targets those without valid papers.

He has rightly emphasised that Pakistan can no longer bear the burden of hosting millions of Afghan refugees alone, especially given the strain on our economy and national security.\n\nThe call for collective responsibility resonates deeply in a world where geopolitical decisions have far-reaching consequences for neighbouring nations. The presence of Afghan refugees in Pakistan is not solely a consequence of regional instability but also reflects the aftermath of policies pursued by global powers in Afghanistan. The imperialist interventions and subsequent instability have compelled millions of Afghans to seek refuge across borders, including in Pakistan. It is imperative for the international community, particularly Western countries, to acknowledge their role in shaping these circumstances and to share the responsibility for addressing the humanitarian crisis that has ensued.\n\nWhile Pakistan has taken steps to manage the influx of refugees, including initiatives to streamline the process of repatriation for undocumented individuals, challenges remain. The sheer numbers and the prolonged nature of displacement necessitate a coordinated international effort to provide sustainable solutions. This includes not only humanitarian aid but also support for comprehensive refugee management strategies that ensure the dignity and rights of all displaced persons.\n\nMoreover, there is a pressing need for transparency and accountability in how refugee policies are formulated and implemented. Interestingly, the countries advising Pakistan today on managing its refugees have some of the most stringent policies for refugees and migrants. Pakistan's efforts to repatriate Afghan refugees should be supported and strengthened by international partnerships that prioritise the wellbeing of refugees while respecting host country sovereignty.

This does not seem to prevent senior Iranian diplomats from supporting Pezeshkian's policies (from engaging the West to Afghan refugees, which was a focal point of discussion during the elections).\n\nThat said, it remains unclear as to how the conservative political regime will respond to his policies, with one scholar referring to over two interactions with the Ayatollah, speculating Pezeshkian to have received some directions/guidance on the same. On enquiring over Pezeshkian's interaction with the Ayatollah, one IRGC commander acknowledged Pezeshkian received direction to continue the foreign policy initiatives of his predecessor, the late former president Ebrahim Raisi, without naming the Ayatollah.\n\nIt may be too early to predict the potential prospect of Pezeshkian's Middle East policy or future efforts to renew Iran-West diplomacy with a neighbouring Taliban, but we witness some excitement within the Rahbari Shura, with members enthusiastically watching this political transition.\n\nAfghan migration post-Taliban rule\n\nAs the third year of Taliban rule comes to a close, Afghans continue to apply -- in large numbers -- for migration to Iran, a pattern which appears to have grown since 2021. According to a source close to Khalil Haqqani (the acting Minister of Refugees), citizens (by hundreds) continue to stand in line outside the Ministry of Refugee and Repatriation in Kabul, seeking permission to leave the country.\n\nWith the Islamic Republic of Iran topping the list of countries hosting Afghan refugees since the Taliban rule, Iran's Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Ambassador Amir Saeed Iravani, during a Security Council session on June 21, reflected the reality. He stated that Iran has hosted over 6 million Afghan refugees till date. In what appeared to be a call for global support on the fate of Afghan Refugees, he argued that the Afghan refugees cost over $10 billion annually for sanctioned-struck Iran. With economic challenges and sanctions drastically sinking Iran's economy, this amount may be phenomenal, with thousands of Afghan refugees waiting to flee.\n\nTehran's approach to Afghan refugees\n\nThe fate of Afghan refugees in Iran and Tehran's approach to resolving the refugee crisis may appear to be pertinent as questions, but they receive occasional responses from Tehran. The future of millions of Afghans living in despicable conditions throughout Iran raises questions on the sheer absence of housing, medical care, education, reunification of families (living within various camps), citizenship, access to bank accounts, or right to work, among other basic facilities, in the background of sheer ambiguous occasional responses from the Tehranian political class.\n\nTo the Iranian public, the presence of Afghan migrants living in Tehran is a significant cause of concern, as expressed roughly by every scholar we interviewed. Unlike nations with dedicated migration frameworks/programmes/initiatives formulated by state humanitarian entities, Iran lacks a migration policy. This reflects local Iranians' sentiment towards Afghan migrants, forcing Tehran to maintain some distance from the issue, creating a policy vacuum. Devoid of social interaction/societal integration, the Afghan migrants continue to be viewed with great suspicion, forcing local authorities to deny them even basic amenities and access to decent living.\n\nA hope from Pezeshkian?\n\nIn many economies, migrant/refugee policies have always found their way through the electoral process. They did so, even in Iran's conservative political system, with presidential candidates arguing on the issue of migrants. During the presidential race, Mohammad Ghalibaf and Pezeshkian emphasised the need to seriously address the Afghan refugee issue, at least in their campaign, garnering greater interaction/engagement over the problem. However, it remains ignored and occasionally answered by Tehran when asked by South Asian/Western scholars.\n\nReflecting on Pezeshkian's presidential campaign, we decided to predict that President-elect Pezeshkian's refugee policy -- which remains unclear due to the Ayatollah's constant guidance (according to one scholar) -- may vary from closing the eastern borders with Afghanistan and Pakistan to mass deportation of refugees to a dedicated refugee agreement with the Taliban government or creating a dedicated Afghan refugee policy without alienating the Taliban. Those close to Pezeshkian reflected some positive outcomes to the Afghan refugee issue since \"the President-elect aims to formulate a multi-dimensional approach to counter illegal foreign nationals\", according to a source who advises him on migrant issues.\n\nAccording to a Tehran-based scholar, Pezeshkian may call for a complete border closure, taking a harsher stand on migration in the first few weeks of his presidency. Although the President-elect discussed the challenges to migration and the influx of refugees (in Europe) with European leaders, it is highly likely for him to request that EU leaders accept some refugees if the Israeli hostage negotiations between the US and Hamas conclude successfully. It would not be incorrect to credit Pezeshkian on his positive reflection towards Afghan refugees, which, according to him, would play a positive/progressive role in Iran's development, terming their contribution as constructive to the country's growth.\n\nWith the elections over and Pezeshkian yet to take office, the issue of Afghan refugees (which took precedence during his election campaign) may take a back seat, at least until August.\n\nA dedicated Afghan refugee policy?\n\nWithout a doubt, the President-elect aims to govern refugees, and he understands the challenges of shutting down the border. Unlike his counterpart, he has drawn lessons from Trump's Mexico Wall or the stricter stance of right-wing policymakers in Europe. It remains unclear whether his government would formulate a dedicated refugee policy (even one dedicated to Afghan refugees), carrying the risk of alienating either his voters, regime loyalists, Ayatollah himself or the Taliban.\n\nPezeshkian's first few months of the presidency will focus on the Gaza War, sanctioned hit economy, increasing unemployment and depleting workforce, not on the Afghan refugee crisis. Nonetheless, he could initiate policies and programmes to integrate Afghan refugees into a constructive role in Iran. The argument of a refugee policy/migrant reform dedicated to Afghan refugees appears far-fetched, but the President-elect may allow them to contribute to Iran's economic development and infrastructural growth and also guarantee better housing, healthcare and access to better living.\n\nThat said, decisions about the fate of Afghan refugees are made at levels higher than the legislative branch (executive under the guidance of the Supreme Leader), which the President-elect Pezeshkian cannot substantially change even as a policy. Though he may bring minor alterations in such a scenario, a fundamental change is but ideal.", "source": {"uri": "kathmandupost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "kathmandupost.com"}, "authors": [],

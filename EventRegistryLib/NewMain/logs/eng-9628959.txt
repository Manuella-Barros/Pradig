World War II veterans from across the United States as well as Britain and Canada are in Normandy this week to mark 80 years since the D-Day landings that helped lead to Hitler's defeat.\n\nWednesday, June 5, 2024 | 9:06 p.m.\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the sun sets on the D-Day generation, it's rising again over Normandy beaches where soldiers fought and died exactly 80 years ago, kicking off intense anniversary commemorations Thursday against the backdrop of renewed war in Europe, in Ukraine.\n\nEver-dwindling numbers of World War II veterans, and Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, make this anniversary particularly meaningful, mixing poignant remembrances for D-Day sacrifices with an Allied show of solidarity for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, among the guests.\n\nBut host France hasn't invited World War II ally Russia, citing its \"war of aggression against Ukraine that has intensified in recent weeks.\"\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. The previous story is below.\n\nAs the sun sets on the D-Day generation, it will rise again Thursday over the Normandy beaches where the waves long ago washed away the blood and boot-steps of its soldiers, but where their exploits that helped end Adolf Hitler's tyranny are being remembered by the next generations, seeing war again in Europe, in Ukraine.\n\nEver-dwindling numbers of World War II veterans who have pilgrimaged back to France, and Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine that has dashed hopes that lives and cities wouldn't again be laid to waste in Europe, are making the always poignant anniversaries of the June 6, 1944, Allied landings even more so 80 years on.\n\nAs now-centenarian veterans revisit old memories and fallen comrades buried in Normandy graves, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's presence at D-Day commemorations with world leaders -- including U.S. President Joe Biden -- who are supporting his country's fight against Russia's invasion will inevitably fuse together World War II's awful past with the fraught present on Thursday.\n\nThe break of dawn almost eight decades exactly after Allied troops waded ashore under hails of gunfire on five code-named beaches -- Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword -- will kick off a day of remembrance by Allied nations now standing together again behind Ukraine -- and with World War II ally Russia not invited by host France. It cited Russia's \"war of aggression against Ukraine that has intensified in recent weeks\" for the snub.\n\nWith the dead and wounded on both sides in Ukraine estimated in the hundreds of thousands, commemorations for the more than 4,400 Allied dead on D-Day and many tens of thousands more, including French civilians, killed in the ensuing Battle of Normandy are tinged with concerns that World War II lessons are being lost.\n\n\"There are things worth fighting for,\" said World War II veteran Walter Stitt, who fought in tanks and turns 100 in July, as he visited Omaha Beach this week. \"Although I wish there was another way to do it than to try to kill each other.\"\n\n\"We'll learn one of these days, but I won't be around for that,\" he said.\n\nConscious of the inevitability that major D-Day anniversaries will soon take place without World War II veterans, huge throngs of aficionados in uniforms and riding vehicles of the time, and tourists soaking up the spectacle, have flooded Normandy for the 80th anniversary.\n\nThe fair-like atmosphere fueled by World War II-era jeeps and trucks tearing down hedge-rowed lanes so deadly for Allied troops who fought dug-in German defenders, and of reenactors playing at war on sands where D-Day soldiers fell, leave open the question of what meaning anniversaries will have once the veterans are gone.\n\nBut at the 80th, they're the VIPs of commemorations across the Normandy coast where the largest-ever land, sea and air armada punctured Hitler's defenses in Western Europe and helped precipitate his downfall 11 months later.\n\nThose who traveled to Normandy include women who were among the millions who built bombers, tanks and other weaponry and played other vital World War II roles that were long overshadowed by the combat exploits of men.\n\n\"We weren't doing it for honors and awards. We were doing it to save our country. And we ended up helping save the world,\" said 98-year-old Anna Mae Krier, who worked as a riveter building B-17 and B-29 bombers.\n\nFeted where ever they go in wheelchairs and walking with canes, veterans are using their voices to repeat their message they hope will live eternal: Never forget.\n\n\"To know the amount of people who were killed here, just amazing,\" 98-year-old Allan Chatwin, who served with the U.S. Navy in the Pacific, said as he visited Omaha, the deadliest of the Allied beaches on D-Day.\n\nHe quickly added: \"I don't know that amazing is the word.\"", "source":

Imagine just jumping into the water, freezing cold,\" the 54-year-old said as she gazed across the English Channel, tears in her eyes. \"The bravery, the courage, for people to face that is just unbelievable -- very, very humbled to be here.\"\n\nShe was among a crowd of thousands of people that stretched for several kilometers (miles) along Utah Beach, the westernmost of the D-Day beaches.\n\nIn a quiet spot away from the official ceremonies, France's Christophe Receveur performed his own tribute, unfurling an American flag he had bought on a trip to Pennsylvania to honor those who died on D-Day.\n\n\"To forget them is to let them die all over again,\" the 57-year-old said as he and his daughter, Julie, then carefully refolded the flag into a tight triangle, adding that those now dying in Ukraine fighting the invading Russian army were also on his mind.\n\n\"All these troops came to liberate a country that they didn't know for an ideology -- democracy, freedom -- that is under severe strain now,\" he said.\n\nThe fair-like atmosphere fueled by World War II-era jeeps and trucks tearing down hedge-rowed lanes so deadly for Allied troops who fought dug-in German defenders, and of reenactors playing at war on sands where D-Day soldiers fell, leave open the question of what meaning anniversaries will have once the veterans are gone.\n\nBut at the 80th, they're the VIPs of commemorations across the Normandy coast where the largest-ever land, sea and air armada punctured Hitler's defenses in Western Europe and helped precipitate his downfall 11 months later.\n\n\"They really were the golden generation, those 17-, 18-year-old guys doing something so brave,\" said James Baker, a 56-year-old from the Netherlands, reflecting as dawn broke on Utah Beach.\n\nFarther up the coast on Gold Beach, a military bagpiper played at precisely the time that British troops landed there 80 years ago.\n\nThe United Kingdom's King Charles III and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak were among those at a ceremony later in the day to honor the troops who landed there and on Sword Beach, while Prince William and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau joined others at ceremony for the Canadian troops who landed on Juno Beach.\n\nIn his address, the king told the crowd that the world was fortunate that a generation \"did not flinch\" when they were called upon.\n\n\"Our obligation to remember what they stood for and what they achieved for us all can never diminish,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking in French, Charles also paid tribute to the \"unimaginable number\" of French civilians killed in the battle for Normandy, and the bravery and sacrifice of the French Resistance.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron pledged that ''France will never forget'' those who fought to liberate his country.\n\nBiden was to take part in a ceremony later at the American cemetery overlooking Omaha Beach.\n\nThose who traveled to Normandy include women who were among the millions who built bombers, tanks and other weaponry and played other vital World War II roles that were long overshadowed by the combat exploits of men.\n\n\"We weren't doing it for honors and awards. We were doing it to save our country. And we ended up helping save the world,\" said 98-year-old Anna Mae Krier, who worked as a riveter building B-17 and B-29 bombers.\n\nFeted where ever they go in wheelchairs and walking with canes, veterans are using their voices to repeat their message they hope will live eternal: Never forget.\n\n\"To know the amount of people who were killed here, just amazing,\" 98-year-old Allan Chatwin, who served with the U.S. Navy in the Pacific, said as he visited Omaha, the deadliest of the Allied beaches on D-Day.\n\nHe quickly added: \"I don't know that amazing is the word.\"", "source":

It cited Russia's \"war of aggression against Ukraine that has intensified in recent weeks\" for the snub.\n\nWith the dead and wounded on both sides in Ukraine estimated in the hundreds of thousands, commemorations for the more than 4,400 Allied dead on D-Day and many tens of thousands more, including French civilians, killed in the ensuing Battle of Normandy are tinged with concerns that World War II lessons are being lost.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron told D-Day veterans on Thursday that ''France will never forget'' their battle to liberate Europe from the Nazis.\n\n\"There are things worth fighting for,\" said World War II veteran Walter Stitt, who fought in tanks and turns 100 in July, as he visited Omaha Beach this week. \"Although I wish there was another way to do it than to try to kill each other.\"\n\n\"We'll learn one of these days, but I won't be around for that,\" he said.\n\nConscious of the inevitability that major D-Day anniversaries will soon take place without World War II veterans, huge throngs of aficionados in uniforms and riding vehicles of the time, and tourists soaking up the spectacle, have flooded Normandy for the 80th anniversary.\n\n\"It's so historic, and we just have to remember the sacrifices of everybody who gave us our freedom,\" said Becky Kraubetz, a Briton now living in Florida whose grandfather served with the British Army during World War II and was captured in Malta.\n\n\"It gives you goosebumps, everything that happened here. Imagine just jumping into the water, freezing cold,\" the 54-year-old said as she gazed across the English Channel, tears in her eyes. \"The bravery, the courage, for people to face that is just unbelievable -- very, very humbled to be here.\"\n\nShe was among a crowd of thousands of people that stretched for several miles along Utah Beach, the westernmost of the D-Day beaches.\n\nIn a quiet spot away from the official ceremonies, France's Christophe Receveur performed his own tribute, unfurling an American flag he had bought on a trip to Pennsylvania to honor those who died on D-Day.\n\n\"To forget them is to let them die all over again,\" the 57-year-old said as he and his daughter, Julie, then carefully refolded the flag into a tight triangle, adding that those now dying in Ukraine fighting the invading Russian army were also on his mind.\n\n\"All these troops came to liberate a country that they didn't know for an ideology -- democracy, freedom -- that is under severe strain now,\" he said.\n\nThe fair-like atmosphere fueled by World War II-era jeeps and trucks tearing down hedge-rowed lanes so deadly for Allied troops who fought dug-in German defenders, and of reenactors playing at war on sands where D-Day soldiers fell, leave open the question of what meaning anniversaries will have once the veterans are gone.\n\nBut at the 80th, they're the VIPs of commemorations across the Normandy coast where the largest-ever land, sea and air armada punctured Hitler's defenses in Western Europe and helped precipitate his downfall 11 months later.\n\n\"They really were the golden generation, those 17-, 18-year-old guys doing something so brave,\" said James Baker, a 56-year-old from the Netherlands, reflecting as dawn broke on Utah Beach.\n\nFarther up the coast on Gold Beach, a military bagpiper played at precisely the time that British troops landed there 80 years ago.\n\nThe United Kingdom's King Charles III and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak were among those at a ceremony later in the day to honor the troops who landed there and on Sword Beach, while Prince William and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau joined others at a ceremony for the Canadian troops who landed on Juno Beach.\n\nIn his address, the king told the crowd that the world was fortunate that a generation \"did not flinch\" when they were called upon.\n\n\"Our obligation to remember what they stood for and what they achieved for us all can never diminish,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking in French, Charles also paid tribute to the \"unimaginable number\" of French civilians killed in the battle for Normandy, and the bravery and sacrifice of the French Resistance.\n\nBiden was to take part in a ceremony later at the American cemetery overlooking Omaha Beach.\n\nThose who traveled to Normandy include women who were among the millions who built bombers, tanks and other weaponry and played other vital World War II roles that were long overshadowed by the combat exploits of men.\n\n\"We weren't doing it for honors and awards. We were doing it to save our country. And we ended up helping save the world,\" said 98-year-old Anna Mae Krier, who worked as a riveter building B-17 and B-29 bombers.\n\nFeted wherever they go in wheelchairs and walking with canes, veterans are using their voices to repeat their message they hope will live eternal: Never forget.\n\n\"To know the amount of people who were killed here, just amazing,\" 98-year-old Allan Chatwin, who served with the U.S. Navy in the Pacific, said as he visited Omaha, the deadliest of the Allied beaches on D-Day.\n\nHe quickly added: \"I don't know that amazing is the word.\"", "source":

World War II ally Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, was not invited.\n\nWith the dead and wounded on both sides in Ukraine estimated in the hundreds of thousands, commemorations for the more than 4,400 Allied dead on D-Day and many tens of thousands more, including French civilians, killed in the ensuing Battle of Normandy are tinged with concerns that World War II lessons are being lost.\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak and Akshata Murty stand with D-Day veteran Alec Penstone, 98, following the UK national commemorative event for the 80th anniversary of D-Day, held at the British Normandy Memorial in Ver-sur-Mer, Normandy, France, Thursday June 6, 2024.

Among the Americans was Edward Berthold, a pilot who carried out his three missions over France in May 1944, before taking part in an operation in Saint-Lo, in Normandy, on D-Day. He flew 35 combat missions in all during World War II.\n\n\"You came here because the free world needed each and every one of you, and you answered the call,\" Macron said. \"You came here to make France a free nation.

She was among a crowd of thousands of people that stretched for several kilometers (miles) along Utah Beach, the westernmost of the D-Day beaches.\n\nIn a quiet spot away from the official ceremonies, France's Christophe Receveur performed his own tribute, unfurling an American flag he had bought on a trip to Pennsylvania to honor those who died on D-Day.\n\n\"To forget them is to let them die all over again,\" the 57-year-old said as he and his daughter, Julie, then carefully refolded the flag into a tight triangle, adding that those now dying in Ukraine fighting the invading Russian army were also on his mind.\n\nA re enactor holds a lantern during a ceremony at Utah Beach near Saint-Martin-de-Vareville Normandy, Thursday, June 6, 2024.

It cited Russia's \"war of aggression against Ukraine that has intensified in recent weeks\" for the snub.\n\nWith the dead and wounded on both sides in Ukraine estimated in the hundreds of thousands, commemorations for the more than 4,400 Allied dead on D-Day and many tens of thousands more, including French civilians, killed in the ensuing Battle of Normandy are tinged with concerns that World War II lessons are being lost.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron told D-Day veterans on Thursday that \"France will never forget\" their battle to liberate Europe from the Nazis.\n\n\"There are things worth fighting for,\" said World War II veteran Walter Stitt, who fought in tanks and turns 100 in July, as he visited Omaha Beach this week. \"Although I wish there was another way to do it than to try to kill each other.\"\n\n\"We'll learn one of these days, but I won't be around for that,\" he said.\n\nConscious of the inevitability that major D-Day anniversaries will soon take place without World War II veterans, huge throngs of aficionados in uniforms and riding vehicles of the time, and tourists soaking up the spectacle, have flooded Normandy for the 80th anniversary.\n\n\"It's so historic and we just have to remember the sacrifices of everybody who gave us our freedom,\" said Becky Kraubetz, a Briton now living in Florida whose grandfather served with the British Army during World War II and was captured in Malta.\n\n\"It gives you goosebumps, everything that happened here. Imagine just jumping into the water, freezing cold,\" the 54-year-old said as she gazed across the English Channel, tears in her eyes. \"The bravery, the courage, for people to face that is just unbelievable -- very, very humbled to be here.\"\n\nShe was among a crowd of thousands of people that stretched for several kilometers (miles) along Utah Beach, the westernmost of the D-Day beaches.\n\nIn a quiet spot away from the official ceremonies, France's Christophe Receveur performed his own tribute, unfurling an American flag he had bought on a trip to Pennsylvania to honor those who died on D-Day.\n\n\"To forget them is to let them die all over again,\" the 57-year-old said as he and his daughter, Julie, then carefully refolded the flag into a tight triangle, adding that those now dying in Ukraine fighting the invading Russian army were also on his mind.\n\n\"All these troops came to liberate a country that they didn't know for an ideology -- democracy, freedom -- that is under severe strain now,\" he said.\n\nThe fair-like atmosphere fueled by World War II-era jeeps and trucks tearing down hedge-rowed lanes so deadly for Allied troops who fought dug-in German defenders, and of reenactors playing at war on sands where D-Day soldiers fell, leave open the question of what meaning anniversaries will have once the veterans are gone.\n\nBut at the 80th, they're the VIPs of commemorations across the Normandy coast where the largest-ever land, sea and air armada punctured Hitler's defenses in Western Europe and helped precipitate his downfall 11 months later.\n\n\"They really were the golden generation, those 17-, 18-year-old guys doing something so brave,\" said James Baker, a 56-year-old from the Netherlands, reflecting as dawn broke on Utah Beach.\n\nFarther up the coast on Gold Beach, a military bagpiper played at precisely the time that British troops landed there 80 years ago.\n\nThe United Kingdom's King Charles III and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak were among those at a ceremony later in the day to honor the troops who landed there and on Sword Beach, while Prince William and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau joined others at ceremony for the Canadian troops who landed on Juno Beach.\n\nIn his address, the king told the crowd that the world was fortunate that a generation \"did not flinch\" when they were called upon.\n\n\"Our obligation to remember what they stood for and what they achieved for us all can never diminish,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking in French, Charles also paid tribute to the \"unimaginable number\" of French civilians killed in the battle for Normandy, and the bravery and sacrifice of the French Resistance.\n\nBiden was to take part in a ceremony later at the American cemetery overlooking Omaha Beach.\n\nThose who traveled to Normandy include women who were among the millions who built bombers, tanks and other weaponry and played other vital World War II roles that were long overshadowed by the combat exploits of men.\n\n\"We weren't doing it for honors and awards.

The previous story is below.\n\nAs the sun sets on the D-Day generation, it will rise again Thursday over the Normandy beaches where the waves long ago washed away the blood and boot-steps of its soldiers, but where their exploits that helped end Adolf Hitler's tyranny are being remembered by the next generations, seeing war again in Europe, in Ukraine.\n\nEver-dwindling numbers of World War II veterans who have pilgrimaged back to France, and Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine that has dashed hopes that lives and cities wouldn't again be laid to waste in Europe, are making the always poignant anniversaries of the June 6, 1944, Allied landings even more so 80 years on.\n\nAs now-centenarian veterans revisit old memories and fallen comrades buried in Normandy graves, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's presence at D-Day commemorations with world leaders -- including U.S. President Joe Biden -- who are supporting his country's fight against Russia's invasion will inevitably fuse together World War II's awful past with the fraught present on Thursday.\n\nThe break of dawn almost eight decades exactly after Allied troops waded ashore under hails of gunfire on five code-named beaches -- Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword -- will kick off a day of remembrance by Allied nations now standing together again behind Ukraine -- and with World War II ally Russia not invited by host France. It cited Russia's \"war of aggression against Ukraine that has intensified in recent weeks\" for the snub.\n\nWith the dead and wounded on both sides in Ukraine estimated in the hundreds of thousands, commemorations for the more than 4,400 Allied dead on D-Day and many tens of thousands more, including French civilians, killed in the ensuing Battle of Normandy are tinged with concerns that World War II lessons are being lost.\n\n\"There are things worth fighting for,\" said World War II veteran Walter Stitt, who fought in tanks and turns 100 in July, as he visited Omaha Beach this week. \"Although I wish there was another way to do it than to try to kill each other.\"\n\n\"We'll learn one of these days, but I won't be around for that,\" he said.\n\nConscious of the inevitability that major D-Day anniversaries will soon take place without World War II veterans, huge throngs of aficionados in uniforms and riding vehicles of the time, and tourists soaking up the spectacle, have flooded Normandy for the 80th anniversary.\n\nThe fair-like atmosphere fueled by World War II-era jeeps and trucks tearing down hedge-rowed lanes so deadly for Allied troops who fought dug-in German defenders, and of reenactors playing at war on sands where D-Day soldiers fell, leave open the question of what meaning anniversaries will have once the veterans are gone.\n\nBut at the 80th, they're the VIPs of commemorations across the Normandy coast where the largest-ever land, sea and air armada punctured Hitler's defenses in Western Europe and helped precipitate his downfall 11 months later.\n\nThose who traveled to Normandy include women who were among the millions who built bombers, tanks and other weaponry and played other vital World War II roles that were long overshadowed by the combat exploits of men.\n\n\"We weren't doing it for honors and awards. We were doing it to save our country. And we ended up helping save the world,\" said 98-year-old Anna Mae Krier, who worked as a riveter building B-17 and B-29 bombers.\n\nFeted where ever they go in wheelchairs and walking with canes,

''You came here to make France a free nation. You're back here today at home, if I may say.\"\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story follows below.\n\nUTAH BEACH, France (AP) -- Leaders, veterans and visitors from around the world paid tribute Thursday to the D-Day generation in moving ceremonies on and around the Normandy beaches where the Allies landed exactly 80 years ago, with the war in Ukraine on the minds of many and a common message that tyranny cannot be permitted to prevail.\n\nEver-dwindling numbers of World War II veterans who have pilgrimaged back to France, and Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine that has dashed hopes that lives and cities wouldn't again be laid to waste in Europe, are making the poignant anniversary of the June 6, 1944, Allied landings even more so.\n\nThe break of dawn eight decades after Allied troops waded ashore under hails of gunfire on five code-named beaches -- Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword -- kicked off a day of remembrance by Allied nations now standing together again behind Ukraine -- and with World War II ally Russia not invited by host France. It cited Russia's \"war of aggression against Ukraine that has intensified in recent weeks\" for the snub.\n\nWith the dead and wounded on both sides in Ukraine estimated in the hundreds of thousands, commemorations for the more than 4,400 Allied dead on D-Day and many tens of thousands more, including French civilians, killed in the ensuing Battle of Normandy are tinged with concerns that World War II lessons are being lost.\n\n\"There are things worth fighting for,\" said World War II veteran Walter Stitt, who fought in tanks and turns 100 in July, as he visited Omaha Beach this week. \"Although I wish there was another way to do it than to try to kill each other.\"\n\n\"We'll learn one of these days, but I won't be around for that,\" he said.\n\nAs now-centenarian veterans revisit old memories and fallen comrades buried in Normandy graves, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's presence at the D-Day commemorations with world leaders who are supporting Ukraine's fight against Russia's invasion -- including U.S. President Joe Biden -- will inevitably fuse together World War II's awful past with the fraught present.\n\nConscious of the inevitability that major D-Day anniversaries will soon take place without World War II veterans, huge throngs of aficionados in uniforms and riding vehicles of the time, and tourists soaking up the spectacle, flooded Normandy for the 80th anniversary.\n\n\"It's so historic and we just have to remember the sacrifices of everybody who gave us our freedom,\" said Becky Kraubetz, a Briton now living in Florida whose grandfather served with the British Army during World War II and was captured in Malta.\n\n\"It gives you goosebumps, everything that happened here. Imagine just jumping into the water, freezing cold,\" the 54-year-old said as she gazed across the English Channel, tears in her eyes. \"The bravery, the courage, for people to face that is just unbelievable -- very, very humbled to be here.\"\n\nShe was among a crowd of thousands of people that stretched for several kilometers (miles) along Utah Beach, the westernmost of the D-Day beaches.\n\nIn a quiet spot away from the official ceremonies, France's Christophe Receveur performed his own tribute, unfurling an American flag he had bought on a trip to Pennsylvania to honor those who died on D-Day.\n\n\"To forget them is to let them die all over again,\" the 57-year-old said as he and his daughter, Julie, then carefully refolded the flag into a tight triangle, adding that those now dying in Ukraine fighting the invading Russian army were also on his mind.\n\n\"All these troops came to liberate a country that they didn't know for an ideology -- democracy, freedom -- that is under severe strain now,\" he said.\n\nThe fair-like atmosphere fueled by World War II-era jeeps and trucks tearing down hedge-rowed lanes so deadly for Allied troops who fought dug-in German defenders, and of reenactors playing at war on sands where D-Day soldiers fell, leave open the question of what meaning anniversaries will have once the veterans are gone.\n\nBut at the 80th, they're the VIPs of commemorations across the Normandy coast where the largest-ever land, sea and air armada punctured Hitler's defenses in Western Europe and helped precipitate his downfall 11 months later.\n\n\"They really were the golden generation, those 17-, 18-year-old guys doing something so brave,\" said James Baker, a 56-year-old from the Netherlands, reflecting as dawn broke on Utah Beach.\n\nFarther up the coast on Gold Beach, a military bagpiper played at precisely the time that British troops landed there 80 years ago.\n\nThe United Kingdom's King Charles III and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak were among those at a ceremony later in the day to honor the troops who landed there and on Sword Beach, while Prince William and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau joined others at ceremony for the Canadian troops who landed on Juno Beach.\n\nIn his address, the king told the crowd that the world was fortunate that a generation \"did not flinch\" when they were called upon.\n\n\"Our obligation to remember what they stood for and what they achieved for us all can never diminish,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking in French, Charles also paid tribute to the \"unimaginable number\" of French civilians killed in the battle for Normandy, and the bravery and sacrifice of the French Resistance.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron pledged that ''France will never forget'' those who fought to liberate his country.\n\nBiden was to take part in a ceremony later at the American cemetery overlooking Omaha Beach.\n\nThose who traveled to Normandy include women who were among the millions who built bombers, tanks and other weaponry and played other vital World War II roles that were long overshadowed by the combat exploits of men.\n\n\"We weren't doing it for honors and awards. We were doing it to save our country. And we ended up helping save the world,\" said 98-year-old Anna Mae Krier, who worked as a riveter building B-17 and B-29 bombers.\n\nFeted where ever they go in wheelchairs and walking with canes, veterans are using their voices to repeat their message they hope will live eternal: Never forget.\n\n\"To know the amount of people who were killed here, just amazing,\" 98-year-old Allan Chatwin, who served with the U.S. Navy in the Pacific, said as he visited Omaha, the deadliest of the Allied beaches on D-Day.\n\nHe quickly added: \"I don't know that amazing is the word.\"\n\nMore from this section\n\nAmerican Pacific Mortgage Picks Fee Chaser by LenderLogix to Collect Upfront Borrower Fees\n\nClick n' Close to Receive Top Lender Award at USDA's Single Family Housing Guaranteed Loan Program Ceremony\n\nMontana US Sen.

It cited Russia's \"war of aggression against Ukraine that has intensified in recent weeks\" for the snub.\n\nWith the dead and wounded on both sides in Ukraine estimated in the hundreds of thousands, commemorations for the more than 4,400 Allied dead on D-Day and many tens of thousands more, including French civilians, killed in the ensuing Battle of Normandy are tinged with concerns that World War II lessons are being lost.\n\n\"There are things worth fighting for,\" said World War II veteran Walter Stitt, who fought in tanks and turns 100 in July, as he visited Omaha Beach this week. \"Although I wish there was another way to do it than to try to kill each other.\"\n\n\"We'll learn one of these days, but I won't be around for that,\" he said.\n\nConscious of the inevitability that major D-Day anniversaries will soon take place without World War II veterans, huge throngs of aficionados in uniforms and riding vehicles of the time, and tourists soaking up the spectacle, have flooded Normandy for the 80th anniversary.\n\n\"It's so historic and we just have to remember the sacrifices of everybody who gave us our freedom,\" said Becky Kraubetz, a Briton now living in Florida whose grandfather served with the British Army during World War II and was captured in Malta.\n\n\"It gives you goosebumps, everything that happened here. Imagine just jumping into the water, freezing cold,\" the 54-year-old said as she gazed across the English Channel, tears in her eyes. \"The bravery, the courage, for people to face that is just unbelievable -- very, very humbled to be here.\"\n\nShe was among a crowd of thousands of people that stretched for several kilometers (miles) along Utah beach, the westernmost of the D-Day beaches.\n\nIn a quiet spot away from the official ceremonies, France's Christophe Receveur performed his own tribute, unfurling an American flag he had bought on a trip to Pennsylvania to honor those who died on D-Day.\n\n\"To forget them is to let them die all over again,\" the 57-year-old said as he and his daughter, Julie, then carefully refolded the flag into a tight triangle, adding that those now dying in Ukraine fighting the invading Russian army were also on his mind.\n\n\"All these troops came to liberate a country that they didn't know for an ideology -- democracy, freedom -- that is under severe strain now,\" he said.\n\nThe fair-like atmosphere fueled by World War II-era jeeps and trucks tearing down hedge-rowed lanes so deadly for Allied troops who fought dug-in German defenders, and of reenactors playing at war on sands where D-Day soldiers fell, leave open the question of what meaning anniversaries will have once the veterans are gone.\n\nBut at the 80th, they're the VIPs of commemorations across the Normandy coast where the largest-ever land, sea and air armada punctured Hitler's defenses in Western Europe and helped precipitate his downfall 11 months later.\n\n\"They really were the golden generation, those 17-, 18-year-old guys doing something so brave,\" said James Baker, a 56-year-old from the Netherlands, reflecting as dawn broke on Utah Beach.\n\nFarther up the coast on Gold beach, a military bagpiper played at precisely the time that British troops landed there 80 years ago.\n\nU.K. King Charles III and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak were to take part in a ceremony later in the day to honor them and the British troops who also landed on Sword beach, while Prince William was set to participate in a ceremony for the Canadian troops who landed on Juno beach that will also include Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n\nBiden was to take part in a ceremony at the American cemetery overlooking Omaha beach.\n\nThose who traveled to Normandy include women who were among the millions who built bombers, tanks and other weaponry and played other vital World War II roles that were long overshadowed by the combat exploits of men.\n\n\"We weren't doing it for honors and awards. We were doing it to save our country. And we ended up helping save the world,\" said 98-year-old Anna Mae Krier, who worked as a riveter building B-17 and B-29 bombers.\n\nFeted where ever they go in wheelchairs and walking with canes, veterans are using their voices to repeat their message they hope will live eternal: Never forget.\n\n\"To know the amount of people who were killed here, just amazing,\" 98-year-old Allan Chatwin, who served with the U.S. Navy in the Pacific, said as he visited Omaha, the deadliest of the Allied beaches on D-Day.\n\nHe quickly added: \"I don't know that amazing is the word.\"\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 The Associated Press.

Imagine just jumping into the water, freezing cold,\" the 54-year-old said as she gazed across the English Channel, tears in her eyes. \"The bravery, the courage, for people to face that is just unbelievable -- very, very humbled to be here.\"\n\nShe was among a crowd of thousands of people that stretched for several kilometers (miles) along Utah Beach, the westernmost of the D-Day beaches.\n\nIn a quiet spot away from the official ceremonies, France's Christophe Receveur performed his own tribute, unfurling an American flag he had bought on a trip to Pennsylvania to honor those who died on D-Day.\n\n\"To forget them is to let them die all over again,\" the 57-year-old said as he and his daughter, Julie, then carefully refolded the flag into a tight triangle, adding that those now dying in Ukraine fighting the invading Russian army were also on his mind.\n\n\"All these troops came to liberate a country that they didn't know for an ideology -- democracy, freedom -- that is under severe strain now,\" he said.\n\nThe fair-like atmosphere fueled by World War II-era jeeps and trucks tearing down hedge-rowed lanes so deadly for Allied troops who fought dug-in German defenders, and of reenactors playing at war on sands where D-Day soldiers fell, leave open the question of what meaning anniversaries will have once the veterans are gone.\n\nBut at the 80th, they're the VIPs of commemorations across the Normandy coast where the largest-ever land, sea and air armada punctured Hitler's defenses in Western Europe and helped precipitate his downfall 11 months later.\n\n\"They really were the golden generation, those 17-, 18-year-old guys doing something so brave,\" said James Baker, a 56-year-old from the Netherlands, reflecting as dawn broke on Utah Beach.\n\nFarther up the coast on Gold Beach, a military bagpiper played at precisely the time that British troops landed there 80 years ago.\n\nThe United Kingdom's King Charles III and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak were among those at a ceremony later in the day to honor the troops who landed there and on Sword Beach, while Prince William and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau joined others at ceremony for the Canadian troops who landed on Juno Beach.\n\nIn his address, the king told the crowd that the world was fortunate that a generation \"did not flinch\" when they were called upon.\n\n\"Our obligation to remember what they stood for and what they achieved for us all can never diminish,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking in French, Charles also paid tribute to the \"unimaginable number\" of French civilians killed in the battle for Normandy, and the bravery and sacrifice of the French Resistance.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron pledged that ''France will never forget'' those who fought to liberate his country.\n\nBiden was to take part in a ceremony later at the American cemetery overlooking Omaha Beach.\n\nThose who traveled to Normandy include women who were among the millions who built bombers, tanks and other weaponry and played other vital World War II roles that were long overshadowed by the combat exploits of men.\n\n\"We weren't doing it for honors and awards. We were doing it to save our country. And we ended up helping save the world,\" said 98-year-old Anna Mae Krier, who worked as a riveter building B-17 and B-29 bombers.\n\nFeted where ever they go in wheelchairs and walking with canes, veterans are using their voices to repeat their message they hope will live eternal: Never forget.\n\n\"To know the amount of people who were killed here, just amazing,\" 98-year-old Allan Chatwin, who served with the U.S. Navy in the Pacific, said as he visited Omaha, the deadliest of the Allied beaches on D-Day.\n\nHe quickly added: \"I don't know that amazing is the word.\"", "source":

It cited Russia's \"war of aggression against Ukraine that has intensified in recent weeks\" for the snub.\n\nWith the dead and wounded on both sides in Ukraine estimated in the hundreds of thousands, commemorations for the more than 4,400 Allied dead on D-Day and many tens of thousands more, including French civilians, killed in the ensuing Battle of Normandy are tinged with concerns that World War II lessons are being lost.\n\n\"There are things worth fighting for,\" said World War II veteran Walter Stitt, who fought in tanks and turns 100 in July, as he visited Omaha Beach this week. \"Although I wish there was another way to do it than to try to kill each other.\"\n\n\"We'll learn one of these days, but I won't be around for that,\" he said.\n\nAs now-centenarian veterans revisit old memories and fallen comrades buried in Normandy graves, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's presence at the D-Day commemorations with world leaders who are supporting Ukraine's fight against Russia's invasion -- including U.S. President Joe Biden -- will inevitably fuse together World War II's awful past with the fraught present.\n\nConscious of the inevitability that major D-Day anniversaries will soon take place without World War II veterans, huge throngs of aficionados in uniforms and riding vehicles of the time, and tourists soaking up the spectacle, flooded Normandy for the 80th anniversary.\n\n\"It's so historic and we just have to remember the sacrifices of everybody who gave us our freedom,\" said Becky Kraubetz, a Briton now living in Florida whose grandfather served with the British Army during World War II and was captured in Malta.\n\n\"It gives you goosebumps, everything that happened here. Imagine just jumping into the water, freezing cold,\" the 54-year-old said as she gazed across the English Channel, tears in her eyes. \"The bravery, the courage, for people to face that is just unbelievable -- very, very humbled to be here.\"\n\nShe was among a crowd of thousands of people that stretched for several kilometers (miles) along Utah Beach, the westernmost of the D-Day beaches.\n\nIn a quiet spot away from the official ceremonies, France's Christophe Receveur performed his own tribute, unfurling an American flag he had bought on a trip to Pennsylvania to honor those who died on D-Day.\n\n\"To forget them is to let them die all over again,\" the 57-year-old said as he and his daughter, Julie, then carefully refolded the flag into a tight triangle, adding that those now dying in Ukraine fighting the invading Russian army were also on his mind.\n\n\"All these troops came to liberate a country that they didn't know for an ideology -- democracy, freedom -- that is under severe strain now,\" he said.\n\nThe fair-like atmosphere fueled by World War II-era jeeps and trucks tearing down hedge-rowed lanes so deadly for Allied troops who fought dug-in German defenders, and of reenactors playing at war on sands where D-Day soldiers fell, leave open the question of what meaning anniversaries will have once the veterans are gone.\n\nBut at the 80th, they're the VIPs of commemorations across the Normandy coast where the largest-ever land, sea and air armada punctured Hitler's defenses in Western Europe and helped precipitate his downfall 11 months later.\n\n\"They really were the golden generation, those 17-, 18-year-old guys doing something so brave,\" said James Baker, a 56-year-old from the Netherlands, reflecting as dawn broke on Utah Beach.\n\nFarther up the coast on Gold Beach, a military bagpiper played at precisely the time that British troops landed there 80 years ago.\n\nThe United Kingdom's King Charles III and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak were among those at a ceremony later in the day to honor the troops who landed there and on Sword Beach, while Prince William and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau joined others at ceremony for the Canadian troops who landed on Juno Beach.\n\nIn his address, the king told the crowd that the world was fortunate that a generation \"did not flinch\" when they were called upon.\n\n\"Our obligation to remember what they stood for and what they achieved for us all can never diminish,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking in French, Charles also paid tribute to the \"unimaginable number\" of French civilians killed in the battle for Normandy, and the bravery and sacrifice of the French Resistance.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron pledged that ''France will never forget'' those who fought to liberate his country.\n\nBiden was to take part in a ceremony later at the American cemetery overlooking Omaha Beach.\n\nThose who traveled to Normandy include women who were among the millions who built bombers, tanks and other weaponry and played other vital World War II roles that were long overshadowed by the combat exploits of men.\n\n\"We weren't doing it for honors and awards.

World War II ally Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, was not invited.\n\nWith the dead and wounded on both sides in Ukraine estimated in the hundreds of thousands, commemorations for the more than 4,400 Allied dead on D-Day and many tens of thousands more, including French civilians, killed in the ensuing Battle of Normandy are tinged with concerns that World War II lessons are being lost.\n\n\"There are things worth fighting for,\" said Walter Stitt, who fought in tanks and turns 100 in July, as he visited Omaha Beach this week. \"Although I wish there was another way to do it than to try to kill each other.\"\n\n\"We'll learn one of these days, but I won't be around for that,\" he said.\n\nAs now-centenarian veterans revisit old memories and fallen comrades buried in Normandy graves, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's presence at the D-Day commemorations with world leaders who are supporting Ukraine's fight against Russia's invasion -- including U.S. President Joe Biden -- will inevitably fuse together World War II's awful past with the fraught present.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron awarded the Legion of Honor to 11 U.S. veterans and a British female veteran. Among the Americans was Edward Berthold, a pilot who carried out his three missions over France in May 1944, before taking part in an operation in Saint-Lo, in Normandy, on D-Day. He flew 35 combat missions in all during World War II.\n\n\"You came here because the free world needed each and every one of you, and you answered the call,\" Macron said. \"You came here to make France a free nation. You're back here today at home, if I may say.\"\n\nMacron also bestowed the Legion of Honor on 103-year-old Christian Lamb, the daughter of a Royal Navy admiral who was studying in Normandy in 1939 when her father called her back to London. There, Lamb created detailed maps that guided the crews of landing craft on D-Day.\n\nThe French president bent down to Lamb in her wheelchair to pin the medal and kiss her on both cheeks, describing her as one of the \"heroes in the shadows.\"\n\nConscious of the inevitability that major D-Day anniversaries will soon take place without World War II veterans, huge throngs of aficionados in uniforms and riding vehicles of the time, and tourists soaking up the spectacle, flooded Normandy for the 80th anniversary.\n\n\"We just have to remember the sacrifices of everybody who gave us our freedom,\" said Becky Kraubetz, a Briton now living in Florida whose grandfather served with the British Army during World War II and was captured in Malta. She was among a crowd of thousands of people that stretched for several miles along Utah Beach, the westernmost of the D-Day beaches.\n\nIn a quiet spot away from the official ceremonies, France's Christophe Receveur performed his own tribute, unfurling an American flag he had bought on a trip to Pennsylvania to honor those who died on D-Day.\n\n\"To forget them is to let them die all over again,\" the 57-year-old said as he and his daughter, Julie, then carefully refolded the flag into a tight triangle, adding that those now dying in Ukraine fighting the invading Russian army were also on his mind.\n\n\"All these troops came to liberate a country that they didn't know for an ideology -- democracy, freedom -- that is under severe strain now,\" he said.\n\nThe fair-like atmosphere fueled by World War II-era jeeps and trucks tearing down hedge-rowed lanes so deadly for Allied troops who fought dug-in German defenders, and of reenactors playing at war on sands where D-Day soldiers fell, leave open the question of what meaning anniversaries will have once the veterans are gone.\n\nBut at the 80th, they're the VIPs of commemorations across the Normandy coast where the largest-ever land, sea and air armada punctured Hitler's defenses in Western Europe and helped precipitate his downfall 11 months later.\n\n\"They really were the golden generation, those 17-, 18-year-old guys doing something so brave,\" said James Baker, a 56-year-old from the Netherlands, reflecting on Utah Beach.\n\nFarther up the coast on Gold Beach, a military bagpiper played at precisely the time that British troops landed there 80 years ago.\n\nThe United Kingdom's King Charles III and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak were among those at a ceremony to honor the troops who landed there and on Sword Beach, while Prince William and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau joined others at ceremony for the Canadian troops at Juno Beach.\n\nIn his address, the king told the crowd that the world was fortunate that a generation \"did not flinch\" when they were called upon.\n\n\"Our obligation to remember what they stood for and what they achieved for us all can never diminish,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking in French, Charles also paid tribute to the \"unimaginable number\" of French civilians killed in the battle for Normandy, and the bravery and sacrifice of the French Resistance.\n\nBiden was to take part in a ceremony later at the American cemetery overlooking Omaha Beach.\n\nThose who traveled to Normandy include women who were among the millions who built bombers, tanks and other weaponry and played other vital World War II roles that were long overshadowed by the combat exploits of men.\n\n\"We weren't doing it for honors and awards. We were doing it to save our country. And we ended up helping save the world,\" said 98-year-old Anna Mae Krier, who worked as a riveter building B-17 and B-29 bombers.\n\nFeted where ever they go in wheelchairs and walking with canes, veterans are using their voices to repeat their message they hope will live eternal: Never forget.", "source": {"uri": "vindy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Vindicator"}, "authors": [],

World War II ally Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, was not invited.\n\nWith the dead and wounded on both sides in Ukraine estimated in the hundreds of thousands, commemorations for the more than 4,400 Allied dead on D-Day and many tens of thousands more, including French civilians, killed in the ensuing Battle of Normandy are tinged with concerns that World War II lessons are being lost.\n\n\"There are things worth fighting for,\" said Walter Stitt, who fought in tanks and turns 100 in July, as he visited Omaha Beach this week. \"Although I wish there was another way to do it than to try to kill each other.\"\n\n\"We'll learn one of these days, but I won't be around for that,\" he said.\n\nAs now-centenarian veterans revisit old memories and fallen comrades buried in Normandy graves, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's presence at the D-Day commemorations with world leaders who are supporting Ukraine's fight against Russia's invasion -- including U.S. President Joe Biden -- will inevitably fuse together World War II's awful past with the fraught present.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron awarded the Legion of Honor to 11 U.S. veterans and a British female veteran. Among the Americans was Edward Berthold, a pilot who carried out his three missions over France in May 1944, before taking part in an operation in Saint-Lo, in Normandy, on D-Day. He flew 35 combat missions in all during World War II.\n\n\"You came here because the free world needed each and every one of you, and you answered the call,\" Macron said. \"You came here to make France a free nation. You're back here today at home, if I may say.\"\n\nMacron also bestowed the Legion of Honor on 103-year-old Christian Lamb, the daughter of a Royal Navy admiral who was studying in Normandy in 1939 when her father called her back to London. There, Lamb created detailed maps that guided the crews of landing craft on D-Day.\n\nThe French president bent down to Lamb in her wheelchair to pin the medal and kiss her on both cheeks, describing her as one of the \"heroes in the shadows.\"\n\nConscious of the inevitability that major D-Day anniversaries will soon take place without World War II veterans, huge throngs of aficionados in uniforms and riding vehicles of the time, and tourists soaking up the spectacle, flooded Normandy for the 80th anniversary.\n\n\"We just have to remember the sacrifices of everybody who gave us our freedom,\" said Becky Kraubetz, a Briton now living in Florida whose grandfather served with the British Army during World War II and was captured in Malta. She was among a crowd of thousands of people that stretched for several kilometers (miles) along Utah Beach, the westernmost of the D-Day beaches.\n\nIn a quiet spot away from the official ceremonies, France's Christophe Receveur performed his own tribute, unfurling an American flag he had bought on a trip to Pennsylvania to honor those who died on D-Day.\n\n\"To forget them is to let them die all over again,\" the 57-year-old said as he and his daughter, Julie, then carefully refolded the flag into a tight triangle, adding that those now dying in Ukraine fighting the invading Russian army were also on his mind.\n\n\"All these troops came to liberate a country that they didn't know for an ideology -- democracy, freedom -- that is under severe strain now,\" he said.\n\nThe fair-like atmosphere fueled by World War II-era jeeps and trucks tearing down hedge-rowed lanes so deadly for Allied troops who fought dug-in German defenders, and of reenactors playing at war on sands where D-Day soldiers fell, leave open the question of what meaning anniversaries will have once the veterans are gone.\n\nBut at the 80th, they're the VIPs of commemorations across the Normandy coast where the largest-ever land, sea and air armada punctured Hitler's defenses in Western Europe and helped precipitate his downfall 11 months later.\n\n\"They really were the golden generation, those 17-, 18-year-old guys doing something so brave,\" said James Baker, a 56-year-old from the Netherlands, reflecting on Utah Beach.\n\nFarther up the coast on Gold Beach, a military bagpiper played at precisely the time that British troops landed there 80 years ago.\n\nThe United Kingdom's King Charles III and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak were among those at a ceremony to honor the troops who landed there and on Sword Beach, while Prince William and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau joined others at ceremony for the Canadian troops at Juno Beach.\n\nIn his address, the king told the crowd that the world was fortunate that a generation \"did not flinch\" when they were called upon.\n\n\"Our obligation to remember what they stood for and what they achieved for us all can never diminish,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking in French, Charles also paid tribute to the \"unimaginable number\" of French civilians killed in the battle for Normandy, and the bravery and sacrifice of the French Resistance.\n\nBiden was to take part in a ceremony later at the American cemetery overlooking Omaha Beach.\n\nThose who traveled to Normandy include women who were among the millions who built bombers, tanks and other weaponry and played other vital World War II roles that were long overshadowed by the combat exploits of men.\n\n\"We weren't doing it for honors and awards. We were doing it to save our country. And we ended up helping save the world,\" said 98-year-old Anna Mae Krier, who worked as a riveter building B-17 and B-29 bombers.\n\nFeted where ever they go in wheelchairs and walking with canes, veterans are using their voices to repeat their message they hope will live eternal: Never forget.", "source": {"uri": "bostonherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Boston Herald"}, "authors":

It cited Russia's \"war of aggression against Ukraine that has intensified in recent weeks\" for the snub.\n\nWith the dead and wounded on both sides in Ukraine estimated in the hundreds of thousands, commemorations for the more than 4,400 Allied dead on D-Day and many tens of thousands more, including French civilians, killed in the ensuing Battle of Normandy are tinged with concerns that World War II lessons are being lost.\n\n\"There are things worth fighting for,\" said World War II veteran Walter Stitt, who fought in tanks and turns 100 in July, as he visited Omaha Beach this week. \"Although I wish there was another way to do it than to try to kill each other.\"\n\n\"We'll learn one of these days, but I won't be around for that,\" he said.\n\nConscious of the inevitability that major D-Day anniversaries will soon take place without World War II veterans, huge throngs of aficionados in uniforms and riding vehicles of the time, and tourists soaking up the spectacle, have flooded Normandy for the 80th anniversary.\n\nThe fair-like atmosphere fueled by World War II-era jeeps and trucks tearing down hedge-rowed lanes so deadly for Allied troops who fought dug-in German defenders, and of reenactors playing at war on sands where D-Day soldiers fell, leave open the question of what meaning anniversaries will have once the veterans are gone.\n\nBut at the 80th, they're the VIPs of commemorations across the Normandy coast where the largest-ever land, sea and air armada punctured Hitler's defenses in Western Europe and helped precipitate his downfall 11 months later.\n\nThose who traveled to Normandy include women who were among the millions who built bombers, tanks and other weaponry and played other vital World War II roles that were long overshadowed by the combat exploits of men.\n\n\"We weren't doing it for honors and awards. We were doing it to save our country. And we ended up helping save the world,\" said 98-year-old Anna Mae Krier, who worked as a riveter building B-17 and B-29 bombers.\n\nFeted wherever they go in wheelchairs and walking with canes, veterans are using their voices to repeat their message they hope will live eternal: Never forget.\n\n\"To know the amount of people who were killed here, just amazing,\" 98-year-old Allan Chatwin, who served with the U.S. Navy in the Pacific, said as he visited Omaha, the deadliest of the Allied beaches on D-Day.\n\nHe quickly added: \"I don't know that amazing is the word.\"", "source":

On D-Day, Charles Shay was a 19-year-old Native American army medic who was ready to give his life -- and actually saved many. Now 99, he's spreading a message of peace with tireless dedication as he's about to take part in the 80th celebrations of the landings in Normandy that led to the liberation of France and Europe from Nazi Germany occupation.\n\nWorld War II veterans are joining heads of state and others Thursday on the beaches of Normandy to commemorate the 80th anniversary of D-Day.\n\nThe Allied invasion, which began on June 6, 1944, led to the defeat of the Nazis and the end of the war. The assault began with Allied aircraft bombing German defenses in Normandy, followed by around 1,200 aircraft that carried airborne troops. As dawn broke, Allied forces started bombing German coastal defenses and shortly after that vessels began putting troops ashore on five codenamed beaches: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword. By the end of the day, nearly 160,000 Allied troops had landed in Normandy, although there were thousands of casualties.\n\nFew witnesses to history's biggest amphibious invasion remain alive today.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- Hour by hour: A brief timeline of the Allies' invasion of occupied France\n\n-- With time short, veterans seize the chance to keep their D-Day memories alive for others\n\n-- Women were barred from combat.

On Thursday, a dwindling number of World War II veterans in a parade of wheelchairs joined a new generation of leaders to honor the dead, the living and the fight for democracy in moving commemorations on and around those same beaches where they landed exactly 80 years ago on D-Day.\n\nThe war in Ukraine shadowed the ceremonies, a grim modern-day example of lives and cities that are again suffering through war in Europe.\n\nThe break of dawn eight decades after Allied troops landed on five code-named beaches -- Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword -- started the day of remembrance by Allied nations now standing together again behind Ukraine.\n\nWorld War II ally Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, wasn't invited, and U.S. President Joe Biden directly linked Ukraine's fight for its young democracy to the battle to defeat Nazi Germany.\n\n\"To surrender to bullies, to bow down to dictators is simply unthinkable,\" Biden said. \"If we were to do that, it means we'd be forgetting what happened here on these hallowed beaches.\"\n\nWith the dead and wounded on both sides in Ukraine estimated in the hundreds of thousands, commemorations for the more than 4,400 Allied dead on D-Day and many tens of thousands more, including French civilians, killed in the ensuing Battle of Normandy are tinged with concerns that World War II lessons are being lost.\n\n\"There are things worth fighting for,\" said Walter Stitt, who fought in tanks and turns 100 in July, as he visited Omaha Beach this week. \"Although I wish there was another way to do it than to try to kill each other.\"\n\n\"We'll learn one of these days, but I won't be around for that,\" he said.\n\nAs now-centenarian veterans revisited old memories and fallen comrades buried in Normandy graves, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's presence at the international D-Day commemoration was met with loud applause, fusing World War II's awful past with the fraught present. More applause followed when a giant screen showed the Ukrainian leader speaking with U.S. veterans.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron awarded the Legion of Honor to 11 U.S. veterans and a British female veteran. Among the Americans was Edward Berthold, a pilot who carried out his three missions over France in May 1944, before taking part in an operation in Saint-Lo, in Normandy, on D-Day. He flew 35 combat missions in all during World War II.\n\n\"You came here because the free world needed each and every one of you, and you answered the call,\" Macron said. \"You came here to make France a free nation. You're back here today at home, if I may say.\"\n\nMacron also bestowed the Legion of Honor on 103-year-old Christian Lamb, the daughter of a Royal Navy admiral who was studying in Normandy in 1939 when her father called her back to London. There, Lamb created detailed maps that guided the crews of landing craft on D-Day.\n\nThe French president bent down to Lamb in a wheelchair, pin the medal and kiss her on both cheeks, describing her as one of the \"heroes in the shadows.\"\n\nConscious of the inevitability of age and time for World War II veterans, huge throngs of aficionados in uniforms and riding vehicles of the time, and tourists soaking up the spectacle, flooded Normandy for the 80th anniversary. At the international ceremony later, the veterans received a standing ovation as they were paraded before the stands in a stately line of wheelchairs to avoid the long walk across the beachfront promenade.\n\n\"We just have to remember the sacrifices of everybody who gave us our freedom,\" said Becky Kraubetz, a Briton now living in Florida whose grandfather served with the British Army during World War II and was captured in Malta. She was among a crowd of thousands of people that stretched for several kilometers (miles) along Utah Beach, the westernmost of the D-Day beaches.\n\nIn a quiet spot away from the official ceremonies, France's Christophe Receveur performed his own tribute, unfurling an American flag he had bought on a trip to Pennsylvania to honor those who died on D-Day.\n\n\"To forget them is to let them die all over again,\" the 57-year-old said as he and his daughter, Julie, then carefully refolded the flag into a tight triangle, adding that those now dying in Ukraine fighting the invading Russian army were also on his mind.\n\n\"All these troops came to liberate a country that they didn't know for an ideology -- democracy, freedom -- that is under severe strain now,\" he said.\n\nFor Warren Goss, a 99-year-old American veteran of D-Day who landed in the first waves on Utah Beach, a visit years later to the same place where he watched a comrade fall to incoming fire confirmed that the sacrifice was worthy.\n\n\"I looked at the beach and it was beautiful, all the people, the kids were playing and I see the boys and girls were walking, holding hands, with their life back,\" he told the Danish king and prime minister, who hung on his every word.\n\nThe fair-like atmosphere fueled by World War II-era jeeps and trucks tearing down hedge-rowed lanes so deadly for Allied troops who fought dug-in German defenders, and of reenactors playing at war on sands where D-Day soldiers fell, leave open the question of what meaning anniversaries will have once the veterans are gone.\n\nBut at the 80th, they're the VIPs of commemorations across the Normandy coast where the largest-ever land, sea and air armada punctured Hitler's defenses in Western Europe and helped precipitate his downfall 11 months later.\n\n\"They really were the golden generation, those 17-, 18-year-old guys doing something so brave,\" said James Baker, a 56-year-old from the Netherlands, reflecting on Utah Beach.\n\nFarther up the coast on Gold Beach, a military bagpiper played at precisely the time that British troops landed there 80 years ago.\n\nThe United Kingdom's King Charles III and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak were among those at a ceremony to honor the troops who landed there and on Sword Beach, while Prince William and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau joined others at ceremony for the Canadian troops at Juno Beach.\n\nIn his address, the king told the crowd that the world was fortunate that a generation \"did not flinch\" when they were called upon.\n\n\"Our obligation to remember what they stood for and what they achieved for us all can never diminish,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking in French, Charles also paid tribute to the \"unimaginable number\" of French civilians killed in the battle for Normandy, and the bravery and sacrifice of the French Resistance.\n\nThose who traveled to Normandy include women who were among the millions who built bombers, tanks and other weaponry and played other vital World War II roles that were long overshadowed by the combat exploits of men.\n\nFeted everywhere they go in wheelchairs and walking with canes, veterans are using their voices to repeat their message they hope will live eternal: Never forget.\n\n\"We weren't doing it for honors and awards. We were doing it to save our country,\" said 98-year-old Anna Mae Krier, who worked as a riveter building B-17 and B-29 bombers. \"We ended up helping save the world.\"\n\nJill Lawless in London, and

It cited Russia's \"war of aggression against Ukraine that has intensified in recent weeks\" for the snub.\n\nWith the dead and wounded on both sides in Ukraine estimated in the hundreds of thousands, commemorations for the more than 4,400 Allied dead on D-Day and many tens of thousands more, including French civilians, killed in the ensuing Battle of Normandy are tinged with concerns that World War II lessons are being lost.\n\n\"There are things worth fighting for,\" said World War II veteran Walter Stitt, who fought in tanks and turns 100 in July, as he visited Omaha Beach this week. \"Although I wish there was another way to do it than to try to kill each other.\"\n\n\"We'll learn one of these days, but I won't be around for that,\" he said.\n\nConscious of the inevitability that major D-Day anniversaries will soon take place without World War II veterans, huge throngs of aficionados in uniforms and riding vehicles of the time, and tourists soaking up the spectacle, have flooded Normandy for the 80th anniversary.\n\nThe fair-like atmosphere fueled by World War II-era jeeps and trucks tearing down hedge-rowed lanes so deadly for Allied troops who fought dug-in German defenders, and of reenactors playing at war on sands where D-Day soldiers fell, leave open the question of what meaning anniversaries will have once the veterans are gone.\n\nBut at the 80th, they're the VIPs of commemorations across the Normandy coast where the largest-ever land, sea and air armada punctured Hitler's defenses in Western Europe and helped precipitate his downfall 11 months later.\n\nThose who traveled to Normandy include women who were among the millions who built bombers, tanks and other weaponry and played other vital World War II roles that were long overshadowed by the combat exploits of men.\n\n\"We weren't doing it for honors and awards. We were doing it to save our country. And we ended up helping save the world,\" said 98-year-old Anna Mae Krier, who worked as a riveter building B-17 and B-29 bombers.\n\nFeted where ever they go in wheelchairs and walking with canes, veterans are using their voices to repeat their message they hope will live eternal: Never forget.\n\n\"To know the amount of people who were killed here, just amazing,\" 98-year-old Allan Chatwin, who served with the U.S. Navy in the Pacific, said as he visited Omaha, the deadliest of the Allied beaches on D-Day.\n\nHe quickly added: \"I don't know that amazing is the word.\"\n\nMore from this section\n\nJohn Driscoll wins Democratic nomination for U.S. House in Montana's 2nd Congressional District\n\nMontana US Sen.

On Thursday, a dwindling number of World War II veterans were joined by a new generation of leaders to honor the dead, the living and the fight for democracy in moving commemorations on and around those same beaches where they landed exactly 80 years ago on D-Day.\n\nThe war in Ukraine shadowed the ceremonies, a grim modern-day example of lives and cities that are again suffering through war in Europe.\n\nThe break of dawn eight decades after Allied troops landed on five code-named beaches -- Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword -- started the day of remembrance by Allied nations now standing together again behind Ukraine.\n\nWorld War II ally Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, wasn't invited, and U.S. President Joe Biden directly linked Ukraine's fight for its young democracy to the battle to defeat Nazi Germany.\n\n\"To surrender to bullies, to bow down to dictators is simply unthinkable,\" Biden said. \"If we were to do that, it means we'd be forgetting what happened here on these hallowed beaches.\"\n\nWith the dead and wounded on both sides in Ukraine estimated in the hundreds of thousands, commemorations for the more than 4,400 Allied dead on D-Day and many tens of thousands more, including French civilians, killed in the ensuing Battle of Normandy are tinged with concerns that World War II lessons are being lost.\n\n\"There are things worth fighting for,\" said Walter Stitt, who fought in tanks and turns 100 in July, as he visited Omaha Beach this week. \"Although I wish there was another way to do it than to try to kill each other.\"\n\n\"We'll learn one of these days, but I won't be around for that,\" he said.\n\nAs now-centenarian veterans revisit old memories and fallen comrades buried in Normandy graves, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's presence at the D-Day commemorations with world leaders who are supporting Ukraine fused World War II's awful past with the fraught present.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron awarded the Legion of Honor to 11 U.S. veterans and a British female veteran. Among the Americans was Edward Berthold, a pilot who carried out his three missions over France in May 1944, before taking part in an operation in Saint-Lo, in Normandy, on D-Day. He flew 35 combat missions in all during World War II.\n\n\"You came here because the free world needed each and every one of you, and you answered the call,\" Macron said. \"You came here to make France a free nation. You're back here today at home, if I may say.\"\n\nMacron also bestowed the Legion of Honor on 103-year-old Christian Lamb, the daughter of a Royal Navy admiral who was studying in Normandy in 1939 when her father called her back to London. There, Lamb created detailed maps that guided the crews of landing craft on D-Day.\n\nThe French president bent down to Lamb, in a wheelchair as were many of the veterans, to pin the medal and kiss her on both cheeks, describing her as one of the \"heroes in the shadows.\"\n\nConscious of the inevitability of age and time for World War II veterans, huge throngs of aficionados in uniforms and riding vehicles of the time, and tourists soaking up the spectacle, flooded Normandy for the 80th anniversary.\n\n\"We just have to remember the sacrifices of everybody who gave us our freedom,\" said Becky Kraubetz, a Briton now living in Florida whose grandfather served with the British Army during World War II and was captured in Malta. She was among a crowd of thousands of people that stretched for several kilometers (miles) along Utah Beach, the westernmost of the D-Day beaches.\n\nIn a quiet spot away from the official ceremonies, France's Christophe Receveur performed his own tribute, unfurling an American flag he had bought on a trip to Pennsylvania to honor those who died on D-Day.\n\n\"To forget them is to let them die all over again,\" the 57-year-old said as he and his daughter, Julie, then carefully refolded the flag into a tight triangle, adding that those now dying in Ukraine fighting the invading Russian army were also on his mind.\n\n\"All these troops came to liberate a country that they didn't know for an ideology -- democracy, freedom -- that is under severe strain now,\" he said.\n\nThe fair-like atmosphere fueled by World War II-era jeeps and trucks tearing down hedge-rowed lanes so deadly for Allied troops who fought dug-in German defenders, and of reenactors playing at war on sands where D-Day soldiers fell, leave open the question of what meaning anniversaries will have once the veterans are gone.\n\nBut at the 80th, they're the VIPs of commemorations across the Normandy coast where the largest-ever land, sea and air armada punctured Hitler's defenses in Western Europe and helped precipitate his downfall 11 months later.\n\n\"They really were the golden generation, those 17-, 18-year-old guys doing something so brave,\" said James Baker, a 56-year-old from the Netherlands, reflecting on Utah Beach.\n\nFarther up the coast on Gold Beach, a military bagpiper played at precisely the time that British troops landed there 80 years ago.\n\nThe United Kingdom's King Charles III and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak were among those at a ceremony to honor the troops who landed there and on Sword Beach, while Prince William and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau joined others at ceremony for the Canadian troops at Juno Beach.\n\nIn his address, the king told the crowd that the world was fortunate that a generation \"did not flinch\" when they were called upon.\n\n\"Our obligation to remember what they stood for and what they achieved for us all can never diminish,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking in French, Charles also paid tribute to the \"unimaginable number\" of French civilians killed in the battle for Normandy, and the bravery and sacrifice of the French Resistance.\n\nThose who traveled to Normandy include women who were among the millions who built bombers, tanks and other weaponry and played other vital World War II roles that were long overshadowed by the combat exploits of men.\n\nFeted everywhere they go in wheelchairs and walking with canes, veterans are using their voices to repeat their message they hope will live eternal: Never forget.\n\n\"We weren't doing it for honors and awards. We were doing it to save our country,\" said 98-year-old Anna Mae Krier, who worked as a riveter building B-17 and B-29 bombers. \"We ended up helping save the world.\"\n\n___\n\nJill Lawless in

The assault began with Allied aircraft bombing German defenses in Normandy, followed by around 1,200 aircraft that carried airborne troops.

Growing up amid the June 6, 1944, landing zones, he said he has become accustomed to seeing walls still pockmarked by bullets, shrapnel and other reminders of that fateful day.\n\nBut on the 80th

On Thursday, a dwindling number of World War II veterans in a parade of wheelchairs joined a new generation of leaders to honor the dead, the living, and the fight for democracy in moving commemorations on and around those same beaches where they landed exactly 80 years ago on D-Day.\n\nThe war in Ukraine shadowed the ceremonies, a grim modern-day example of lives and cities that are again suffering through war in Europe.\n\nThe break of dawn eight decades after Allied troops landed on five code-named beaches -- Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword -- started the day of remembrance by Allied nations now standing together again behind Ukraine.\n\nWorld War II ally Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, wasn't invited, and U.S. President Joe Biden directly linked Ukraine's fight for its young democracy to the battle to defeat Nazi Germany.\n\n\"To surrender to bullies, to bow down to dictators is simply unthinkable,\" Biden said. \"If we were to do that, it means we'd be forgetting what happened here on these hallowed beaches.\"\n\nWith the dead and wounded on both sides in Ukraine estimated in the hundreds of thousands, commemorations for the more than 4,400 Allied dead on D-Day and many tens of thousands more, including French civilians, killed in the ensuing Battle of Normandy are tinged with concerns that World War II lessons are being lost.\n\n\"There are things worth fighting for,\" said Walter Stitt, who fought in tanks and turns 100 in July, as he visited Omaha Beach this week. \"Although I wish there was another way to do it than to try to kill each other.\"\n\n\"We'll learn one of these days, but I won't be around for that,\" he said.\n\nAs now-centenarian veterans revisited old memories and fallen comrades buried in Normandy graves, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's presence at the international D-Day commemoration was met with loud applause, fusing World War II's awful past with the fraught present. More applause followed when a giant screen showed the Ukrainian leader speaking with U.S. veterans.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron awarded the Legion of Honor to 11 U.S. veterans and a British female veteran. Among the Americans was Edward Berthold, a pilot who carried out his three missions over France in May 1944, before taking part in an operation in Saint-Lo, in Normandy, on D-Day. He flew 35 combat missions in all during World War II.\n\n\"You came here because the free world needed each and every one of you, and you answered the call,\" Macron said. \"You came here to make France a free nation. You're back here today at home, if I may say.\"\n\nMacron also bestowed the Legion of Honor on 103-year-old Christian Lamb, the daughter of a Royal Navy admiral who was studying in Normandy in 1939 when her father called her back to London. There, Lamb created detailed maps that guided the crews of landing craft on D-Day.\n\nThe French president bent down to Lamb in a wheelchair, pin the medal and kiss her on both cheeks, describing her as one of the \"heroes in the shadows.\"\n\nConscious of the inevitability of age and time for World War II veterans, huge throngs of aficionados in uniforms and riding vehicles of the time, and tourists soaking up the spectacle, flooded Normandy for the 80th anniversary. At the international ceremony later, the veterans received a standing ovation as they were paraded before the stands in a stately line of wheelchairs to avoid the long walk across the beachfront promenade.\n\n\"We just have to remember the sacrifices of everybody who gave us our freedom,\" said Becky Kraubetz, a Briton now living in Florida whose grandfather served with the British Army during World War II and was captured in Malta. She was among a crowd of thousands of people that stretched for several kilometers (miles) along Utah Beach, the westernmost of the D-Day beaches.\n\nIn a quiet spot away from the official ceremonies, France's Christophe Receveur performed his own tribute, unfurling an American flag he had bought on a trip to Pennsylvania to honor those who died on D-Day.\n\n\"To forget them is to let them die all over again,\" the 57-year-old said as he and his daughter, Julie, then carefully refolded the flag into a tight triangle, adding that those now dying in Ukraine fighting the invading Russian army were also on his mind.\n\n\"All these troops came to liberate a country that they didn't know for an ideology -- democracy, freedom -- that is under severe strain now,\" he said.\n\nFor Warren Goss, a 99-year-old American veteran of D-Day who landed in the first waves on Utah Beach, a visit years later to the same place where he watched a comrade fall to incoming fire confirmed that the sacrifice was worthy.\n\n\"I looked at the beach and it was beautiful, all the people, the kids were playing and I see the boys and girls were walking, holding hands, with their life back,\" he told the Danish king and prime minister, who hung on his every word.\n\nThe fair-like atmosphere fueled by World War II-era jeeps and trucks tearing down hedge-rowed lanes so deadly for Allied troops who fought dug-in German defenders, and of reenactors playing at war on sands where D-Day soldiers fell, leave open the question of what meaning anniversaries will have once the veterans are gone.\n\nBut at the 80th, they're the VIPs of commemorations across the Normandy coast where the largest-ever land, sea and air armada punctured Hitler's defenses in Western Europe and helped precipitate his downfall 11 months later.\n\n\"They really were the golden generation, those 17-, 18-year-old guys doing something so brave,\" said James Baker, a 56-year-old from the Netherlands, reflecting on Utah Beach.\n\nFarther up the coast on Gold Beach, a military bagpiper played at precisely the time that British troops landed there 80 years ago.\n\nThe United Kingdom's King Charles III and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak were among those at a ceremony to honor the troops who landed there and on Sword Beach, while Prince William and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau joined others at ceremony for the Canadian troops at Juno Beach.\n\nIn his address, the king told the crowd that the world was fortunate that a generation \"did not flinch\" when they were called upon.\n\n\"Our obligation to remember what they stood for and what they achieved for us all can never diminish,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking in French, Charles also paid tribute to the \"unimaginable number\" of French civilians killed in the battle for Normandy, and the bravery and sacrifice of the French Resistance.\n\nThose who traveled to Normandy include women who were among the millions who built bombers, tanks and other weaponry and played other vital World War II roles that were long overshadowed by the combat exploits of men.\n\nFeted everywhere they go in wheelchairs and walking with canes, veterans are using their voices to repeat their message they hope will live eternal: Never forget.\n\n\"We weren't doing it for honors and awards. We were doing it to save our country,\" said 98-year-old Anna Mae Krier, who worked as a riveter building B-17 and B-29 bombers. \"We ended up helping save the world.\"\n\nJill Lawless in London, and

''You came here to make France a free nation. You're back here today at home, if I may say.\"\n\nLeaders, veterans and visitors from around the world paid tribute Thursday to the D-Day generation in moving ceremonies on and around the Normandy beaches where the Allies landed exactly 80 years ago, with the war in Ukraine on the minds of many and a common message that tyranny cannot be permitted to prevail.\n\nEver-dwindling numbers of Second World War veterans who have pilgrimaged back to France, and Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine that has dashed hopes that lives and cities wouldn't again be laid to waste in Europe, are making the poignant anniversary of the June 6, 1944, Allied landings even more so.\n\nThe break of dawn eight decades after Allied troops waded ashore under hails of gunfire on five code-named beaches -- Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword -- kicked off a day of remembrance by Allied nations now standing together again behind Ukraine -- and with the Second World War ally Russia not invited by host France. It cited Russia's \"war of aggression against Ukraine that has intensified in recent weeks\" for the snub.\n\nWith the dead and wounded on both sides in Ukraine estimated in the hundreds of thousands, commemorations for the more than 4,400 Allied dead on D-Day and many tens of thousands more, including French civilians, killed in the ensuing Battle of Normandy are tinged with concerns that Second World War lessons are being lost.\n\n\"There are things worth fighting for,\" said Second World War veteran Walter Stitt, who fought in tanks and turns 100 in July, as he visited Omaha Beach this week. \"Although I wish there was another way to do it than to try to kill each other.\"\n\n\"We'll learn one of these days, but I won't be around for that,\" he said.\n\nAs now-centenarian veterans revisit old memories and fallen comrades buried in Normandy graves, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's presence at the D-Day commemorations with world leaders who are supporting Ukraine's fight against Russia's invasion -- including U.S. President Joe Biden -- will inevitably fuse together Second World War's awful past with the fraught present.\n\nConscious of the inevitability that major D-Day anniversaries will soon take place without Second World War veterans, huge throngs of aficionados in uniforms and riding vehicles of the time, and tourists soaking up the spectacle, flooded Normandy for the 80th anniversary.\n\n\"It's so historic and we just have to remember the sacrifices of everybody who gave us our freedom,\" said Becky Kraubetz, a Briton now living in Florida whose grandfather served with the British Army during the Second World War and was captured in Malta.\n\n\"It gives you goosebumps, everything that happened here. Imagine just jumping into the water, freezing cold,\" the 54-year-old said as she gazed across the English Channel, tears in her eyes. \"The bravery, the courage, for people to face that is just unbelievable -- very, very humbled to be here.\"\n\nShe was among a crowd of thousands of people that stretched for several kilometres along Utah Beach, the westernmost of the D-Day beaches.\n\nIn a quiet spot away from the official ceremonies, France's Christophe Receveur performed his own tribute, unfurling an American flag he had bought on a trip to Pennsylvania to honour those who died on D-Day.\n\n\"To forget them is to let them die all over again,\" the 57-year-old said as he and his daughter, Julie, then carefully refolded the flag into a tight triangle, adding that those now dying in Ukraine fighting the invading Russian army were also on his mind.\n\n\"All these troops came to liberate a country that they didn't know for an ideology -- democracy, freedom -- that is under severe strain now,\" he said.\n\nThe fair-like atmosphere fuelled by Second World War-era jeeps and trucks tearing down hedge-rowed lanes so deadly for Allied troops who fought dug-in German defenders, and of reenactors playing at war on sands where D-Day soldiers fell, leave open the question of what meaning anniversaries will have once the veterans are gone.\n\nBut at the 80th, they're the VIPs of commemorations across the Normandy coast where the largest-ever land, sea and air armada punctured Hitler's defences in Western Europe and helped precipitate his downfall 11 months later.\n\n\"They really were the golden generation, those 17-, 18-year-old guys doing something so brave,\" said James Baker, a 56-year-old from the Netherlands, reflecting as dawn broke on Utah Beach.\n\nFarther up the coast on Gold Beach, a military bagpiper played at precisely the time that British troops landed there 80 years ago.\n\nThe United Kingdom's King Charles III and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak were among those at a ceremony later in the day to honour the troops who landed there and on Sword Beach, while Prince William and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau joined others at ceremony for the Canadian troops who landed on Juno Beach.\n\nIn his address, the king told the crowd that the world was fortunate that a generation \"did not flinch\" when they were called upon.\n\n\"Our obligation to remember what they stood for and what they achieved for us all can never diminish,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking in French, Charles also paid tribute to the \"unimaginable number\" of French civilians killed in the battle for Normandy, and the bravery and sacrifice of the French Resistance.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron pledged that ''France will never forget'' those who fought to liberate his country.\n\nBiden was to take part in a ceremony later at the American cemetery overlooking Omaha Beach.\n\nThose who travelled to Normandy include women who were among the millions who built bombers, tanks and other weaponry and played other vital Second World War roles that were long overshadowed by the combat exploits of men.\n\n\"We weren't doing it for honours and awards. We were doing it to save our country. And we ended up helping save the world,\" said 98-year-old Anna Mae Krier, who worked as a riveter building B-17 and B-29 bombers.\n\nFeted whereever they go in wheelchairs and walking with canes, veterans are using their voices to repeat their message they hope will live eternal: Never forget.\n\n\"To know the amount of people who were killed here, just amazing,\" 98-year-old Allan Chatwin, who served with the U.S. Navy in the Pacific, said as he visited Omaha, the deadliest of the Allied beaches on D-Day.\n\nHe quickly added: \"I don't know that amazing is the word.\"", "source":

On Thursday, a dwindling number of World War II veterans in a parade of wheelchairs joined a new generation of leaders to honor the dead, the living and the fight for democracy in moving commemorations on and around those same beaches where they landed exactly 80 years ago on D-Day.\n\nThe war in Ukraine shadowed the ceremonies, a grim modern-day example of lives and cities that are again suffering through war in Europe.\n\nThe break of dawn eight decades after Allied troops landed on five code-named beaches -- Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword -- started the day of remembrance by Allied nations now standing together again behind Ukraine.\n\nWorld War II ally Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, wasn't invited, and U.S. President Joe Biden directly linked Ukraine's fight for its young democracy to the battle to defeat Nazi Germany.\n\n\"To surrender to bullies, to bow down to dictators is simply unthinkable,\" Biden said. \"If we were to do that, it means we'd be forgetting what happened here on these hallowed beaches.\"\n\nWith the dead and wounded on both sides in Ukraine estimated in the hundreds of thousands, commemorations for the more than 4,400 Allied dead on D-Day and many tens of thousands more, including French civilians, killed in the ensuing Battle of Normandy are tinged with concerns that World War II lessons are being lost.\n\n\"There are things worth fighting for,\" said Walter Stitt, who fought in tanks and turns 100 in July, as he visited Omaha Beach this week. \"Although I wish there was another way to do it than to try to kill each other.\"\n\n\"We'll learn one of these days, but I won't be around for that,\" he said.\n\nAs now-centenarian veterans revisited old memories and fallen comrades buried in Normandy graves, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's presence at the international D-Day commemoration was met with loud applause, fusing World War II's awful past with the fraught present. More applause followed when a giant screen showed the Ukrainian leader speaking with U.S. veterans.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron awarded the Legion of Honor to 11 U.S. veterans and a British female veteran. Among the Americans was Edward Berthold, a pilot who carried out his three missions over France in May 1944, before taking part in an operation in Saint-Lo, in Normandy, on D-Day. He flew 35 combat missions in all during World War II.\n\n\"You came here because the free world needed each and every one of you, and you answered the call,\" Macron said. \"You came here to make France a free nation. You're back here today at home, if I may say.\"\n\nMacron also bestowed the Legion of Honor on 103-year-old Christian Lamb, the daughter of a Royal Navy admiral who was studying in Normandy in 1939 when her father called her back to London. There, Lamb created detailed maps that guided the crews of landing craft on D-Day.\n\nThe French president bent down to Lamb in a wheelchair, pin the medal and kiss her on both cheeks, describing her as one of the \"heroes in the shadows.\"\n\nConscious of the inevitability of age and time for World War II veterans, huge throngs of aficionados in uniforms and riding vehicles of the time, and tourists soaking up the spectacle, flooded Normandy for the 80th anniversary. At the international ceremony later, the veterans received a standing ovation as they were paraded before the stands in a stately line of wheelchairs to avoid the long walk across the beachfront promenade.\n\n\"We just have to remember the sacrifices of everybody who gave us our freedom,\" said Becky Kraubetz, a Briton now living in Florida whose grandfather served with the British Army during World War II and was captured in Malta. She was among a crowd of thousands of people that stretched for several kilometers (miles) along Utah Beach, the westernmost of the D-Day beaches.\n\nIn a quiet spot away from the official ceremonies, France's Christophe Receveur performed his own tribute, unfurling an American flag he had bought on a trip to Pennsylvania to honor those who died on D-Day.\n\n\"To forget them is to let them die all over again,\" the 57-year-old said as he and his daughter, Julie, then carefully refolded the flag into a tight triangle, adding that those now dying in Ukraine fighting the invading Russian army were also on his mind.\n\n\"All these troops came to liberate a country that they didn't know for an ideology -- democracy, freedom -- that is under severe strain now,\" he said.\n\nFor Warren Goss, a 99-year-old American veteran of D-Day who landed in the first waves on Utah Beach, a visit years later to the same place where he watched a comrade fall to incoming fire confirmed that the sacrifice was worthy.\n\n\"I looked at the beach and it was beautiful, all the people, the kids were playing and I see the boys and girls were walking, holding hands, with their life back,\" he told the Danish king and prime minister, who hung on his every word.\n\nThe fair-like atmosphere fueled by World War II-era jeeps and trucks tearing down hedge-rowed lanes so deadly for Allied troops who fought dug-in German defenders, and of reenactors playing at war on sands where D-Day soldiers fell, leave open the question of what meaning anniversaries will have once the veterans are gone.\n\nBut at the 80th, they're the VIPs of commemorations across the Normandy coast where the largest-ever land, sea and air armada punctured Hitler's defenses in Western Europe and helped precipitate his downfall 11 months later.\n\n\"They really were the golden generation, those 17-, 18-year-old guys doing something so brave,\" said James Baker, a 56-year-old from the Netherlands, reflecting on Utah Beach.\n\nFarther up the coast on Gold Beach, a military bagpiper played at precisely the time that British troops landed there 80 years ago.\n\nThe United Kingdom's King Charles III and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak were among those at a ceremony to honor the troops who landed there and on Sword Beach, while Prince William and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau joined others at ceremony for the Canadian troops at Juno Beach.\n\nIn his address, the king told the crowd that the world was fortunate that a generation \"did not flinch\" when they were called upon.\n\n\"Our obligation to remember what they stood for and what they achieved for us all can never diminish,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking in French, Charles also paid tribute to the \"unimaginable number\" of French civilians killed in the battle for Normandy, and the bravery and sacrifice of the French Resistance.\n\nThose who traveled to Normandy include women who were among the millions who built bombers, tanks and other weaponry and played other vital World War II roles that were long overshadowed by the combat exploits of men.\n\nFeted everywhere they go in wheelchairs and walking with canes, veterans are using their voices to repeat their message they hope will live eternal: Never forget.\n\n\"We weren't doing it for honors and awards. We were doing it to save our country,\" said 98-year-old Anna Mae Krier, who worked as a riveter building B-17 and B-29 bombers. \"We ended up helping save the world.\"\n\n___\n\nJill Lawless in London, and Jeffrey Schaeffer, Mark Carlson, Bela Szandelszky, Helena Alves and Alex Turnbull along the Normandy coast, contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

anniversary", "body": "\"There are things worth fighting for,\" said one World War II veteran. \"Although I wish there was another way to do it than to try to kill each other.\"\n\nWorld War II veterans joined heads of state and others to commemorate the 80th anniversary of D-Day on Thursday.\n\nThe Allied invasion, which began on 6 June, 1944, led to the defeat of the Nazis and the end of the war.\n\nThe assault on the beaches began with Allied aircraft bombing German defenses in Normandy, followed by around 1,200 aircraft that carried airborne troops.\n\nAs dawn broke, Allied forces started bombing German coastal defenses and shortly after that vessels began putting troops ashore on five codenamed beaches: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword.\n\nBy the end of the day, nearly 160,000 Allied troops had landed in Normandy, although there were thousands of casualties.\n\nEver-dwindling numbers of World War II veterans have pilgrimaged back to France, while Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine has dashed hopes that lives and cities wouldn't again be laid to waste in Europe.\n\nAs now-centenarian veterans revisit old memories and fallen comrades buried in Normandy graves, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's presence at D-Day commemorations with world leaders -- including US President Joe Biden -- who are supporting his country's fight against Russia's invasion will inevitably fuse together World War II's awful past with the fraught present on Thursday.\n\nWith the dead and wounded on both sides in Ukraine estimated in the hundreds of thousands, commemorations for the more than 4,400 Allied dead on D-Day and many tens of thousands more, including French civilians, killed in the ensuing Battle of Normandy are tinged with concerns that World War II lessons are being lost.\n\n\"There are things worth fighting for,\" said World War II veteran Walter Stitt, who fought in tanks and turns 100 in July, as he visited Omaha Beach this week. \"Although I wish there was another way to do it than to try to kill each other.\"\n\n\"We'll learn one of these days, but I won't be around for that,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "euronews.com",

Now bent with age, the dwindling number of World War II veterans joined a new generation of leaders on Thursday to honor the dead, the living and the fight for democracy on the shores where they landed 80 years ago on D-Day.\n\nThe war in Ukraine shadowed the ceremonies in Normandy, a grim modern-day example of lives and cities that are again suffering through war in Europe. Ukraine's president was greeted with a standing ovation and cheers. Russia, a crucial World War II ally whose full-scale invasion of its smaller neighbor in 2022 set Europe on a new path of war, was not invited.\n\nThe commemorations for the more than 4,400 Allied dead on D-Day and many tens of thousands more, including French civilians, killed in the ensuing Battle of Normandy were tinged with fear that World War II lessons are fading.\n\n\"There are things worth fighting for,\" said Walter Stitt, who fought in tanks and turns 100 in July, as he visited Omaha Beach this week. \"Although I wish there was another way to do it than to try to kill each other.\"\n\n\"We'll learn one of these days, but I won't be around for that,\" he said.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden directly linked Ukraine's fight for its young democracy to the battle to defeat Nazi Germany.\n\n\"To surrender to bullies, to bow down to dictators is simply unthinkable,\" Biden said. \"If we were to do that, it means we'd be forgetting what happened here on these hallowed beaches.\"\n\nAs now-centenarian veterans revisited old memories and fallen comrades buried in Normandy graves, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's presence at the international D-Day commemoration fused World War II's awful past with the fraught present. The dead and wounded on both sides in Ukraine are estimated in the hundreds of thousands.\n\nDespite Russia's absence, French President Emmanuel Macron paid homage to those who fought on the eastern front \"and the resolute commitment of the Red Army and all the people who were part of the then-Soviet Union.\"\n\nBut it was the landing on June 6, 1944, and the battles in Normandy that followed that ultimately drove the Nazis from France.\n\n\"You came here because the free world needed each and every one of you, and you answered the call,\" Macron said. \"You came here to make France a free nation. You're back here today at home, if I may say.\"\n\nThe French president awarded the Legion of Honor to 14 U.S. veterans and a British female veteran. Among the Americans was Edward Berthold, a pilot who carried out his three missions over France in May 1944, before taking part in an operation in Saint-Lo, in Normandy, on D-Day. He flew 35 combat missions in all during World War II.\n\nBerthold later read aloud a letter he'd written home the next day, showing that even as a young man he was aware of D-Day's importance.\n\n\"Wednesday night, June 7th, 1944. Dear Mom, just a few lines to tell you we are all ok. We flew mission number 10 on D-Day,\" he wrote. \"It certainly was a terrific show, what we could see. This is what everyone has been waiting for.\"\n\nMacron also bestowed the Legion of Honor on 103-year-old Christian Lamb, the daughter of a Royal Navy admiral who was studying in Normandy in 1939 when her father called her back to London. There, Lamb created detailed maps that guided the crews of landing craft on D-Day.\n\nThe French president bent down to Lamb in a wheelchair, pin the medal and kiss her on both cheeks, describing her as one of the \"heroes in the shadows.\"\n\nConscious of the inevitability of age and time for World War II veterans, throngs of aficionados in period uniforms and vehicles, along with tourists soaking up the spectacle, flooded Normandy for the 80th anniversary. At the international ceremony later, the veterans received a standing ovation as they were paraded before the stands in a stately line of wheelchairs to avoid the long walk across the beachfront promenade.\n\n\"We just have to remember the sacrifices of everybody who gave us our freedom,\" said Becky Kraubetz, a Briton now living in Florida whose grandfather served with the British Army during World War II and was captured in Malta. She was among a crowd of thousands of people that stretched for several kilometers (miles) along Utah Beach, the westernmost of the D-Day beaches.\n\nIn a quiet spot away from the pomp, France's Christophe Receveur offered his own tribute, unfurling an American flag he had bought on a trip to Pennsylvania to honor those who died on D-Day.\n\n\"To forget them is to let them die all over again,\" the 57-year-old said as he and his daughter, Julie, carefully refolded the flag into a tight triangle. Those now dying in Ukraine fighting the invading Russian army were also on his mind.\n\n\"All these troops came to liberate a country that they didn't know for an ideology -- democracy, freedom -- that is under severe strain now,\" he said.\n\nFor Warren Goss, a 99-year-old American veteran of D-Day who landed in the first waves on Utah Beach, the sacrifice was affirmed by a visit years later to the same place where his comrades fell.\n\n\"I looked at the beach and it was beautiful, all the people, the kids were playing and I see the boys and girls were walking, holding hands, with their life back,\" he told the Danish king and prime minister, who hung on his words.\n\nThe fair-like atmosphere on the five code-named beaches -- Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword -- was fueled by World War II-era jeeps and trucks tearing down hedge-rowed lanes so deadly for Allied troops who fought dug-in German defenders, and of reenactors playing at war on sands where D-Day soldiers fell.\n\nBut the real VIPs of the commemorations across the Normandy coast were the veterans who took part in the largest-ever land, sea and air armada that punctured Hitler's defenses in Western Europe and helped precipitate his downfall 11 months later.\n\n\"They really were the golden generation, those 17-, 18-year-old guys doing something so brave,\" said James Baker, a 56-year-old from the Netherlands, reflecting on Utah Beach.\n\nFarther up the coast on Gold Beach, a military bagpiper played at precisely the time that British troops landed there 80 years ago.\n\nThe United Kingdom's King Charles III and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak were among those at a ceremony to honor the troops who landed there and on Sword Beach, while Prince William and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau joined others at ceremony for the Canadian troops at Juno Beach.\n\nIn his address, the king told the crowd that the world was fortunate that a generation \"did not flinch\" when they were called upon.\n\n\"Our obligation to remember what they stood for and what they achieved for us all can never diminish,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking in French, Charles also paid tribute to the \"unimaginable number\" of French civilians killed in the battle for Normandy, and the bravery and sacrifice of the French Resistance.\n\nThose who traveled to Normandy include women who were among the millions who built bombers, tanks and other weaponry and played other vital World War II roles that were long overshadowed by the combat exploits of men.\n\nFeted everywhere they go in wheelchairs and walking with canes, veterans are using their voices to repeat their message they hope will live eternal: Never forget.\n\n\"We weren't doing it for honors and awards. We were doing it to save our country,\" said 98-year-old Anna Mae Krier, who worked as a riveter building B-17 and B-29 bombers. \"We ended up helping save the world.\"\n\nAssociated Press writers

The assault began with Allied aircraft bombing German defenses in Normandy, followed by around 1,200 aircraft that carried airborne troops. As dawn broke, Allied forces started bombing German coastal defenses and shortly after that vessels began putting troops ashore on five codenamed beaches: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword. By the end of the day, nearly 160,000 Allied troops had landed in Normandy, although there were thousands of casualties.\n\nFew witnesses to history's biggest amphibious invasion remain alive today.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- Hour by hour: A brief timeline of the Allies' invasion of occupied France\n\n-- With time short, veterans seize the chance to keep their D-Day memories alive for others\n\n-- Women were barred from combat.

Growing up amid the June 6, 1944, landing zones, he said he has become accustomed to seeing walls still pockmarked by bullets, shrapnel and other reminders of that fateful day.\n\nBut on the 80th anniversary \"to think that they liberated us\" hammered home the emotion, he said.", "source": {"uri": "abc4.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC 4"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Among the Americans was Edward Berthold, a pilot who carried out his three missions over France in May 1944, before taking part in an operation in Saint-Lo, in Normandy, on D-Day. He flew 35 combat missions in all during World War II.\n\n\"You came here because the free world needed each and every one of you, and you answered the call,\" Macron said. \"You came here to make France a free nation. You're back here today at home, if I may say.\"\n\nMacron also bestowed the Legion of Honor on 103-year-old Christian Lamb, the daughter of a Royal Navy admiral who was studying in Normandy in 1939 when her father called her back to London. There, Lamb created detailed maps that guided the crews of landing craft on D-Day.\n\nThe French president bent down to Lamb, in a wheelchair as were many of the veterans, to pin the medal and kiss her on both cheeks, describing her as one of the \"heroes in the shadows.\"\n\nConscious of the inevitability of age and time for World War II veterans, huge throngs of aficionados in uniforms and riding vehicles of the time, and tourists soaking up the spectacle, flooded Normandy for the 80th anniversary.\n\n\"We just have to remember the sacrifices of everybody who gave us our freedom,\" said Becky Kraubetz, a Briton now living in Florida whose grandfather served with the British Army during World War II and was captured in Malta. She was among a crowd of thousands of people that stretched for several kilometers along Utah Beach, the westernmost of the D-Day beaches.\n\nIn a quiet spot away from the official ceremonies, France's Christophe Receveur performed his own tribute, unfurling an American flag he had bought on a trip to Pennsylvania to honor those who died on D-Day.\n\n\"To forget them is to let them die all over again,\" the 57-year-old said as he and his daughter, Julie, then carefully refolded the flag into a tight triangle, adding that those now dying in Ukraine fighting the invading Russian army were also on his mind.\n\n\"All these troops came to liberate a country that they didn't know for an ideology -- democracy, freedom -- that is under severe strain now,\" he said.\n\nThe fair-like atmosphere fueled by World War II-era jeeps and trucks tearing down hedge-rowed lanes so deadly for Allied troops who fought dug-in German defenders, and of reenactors playing at war on sands where D-Day soldiers fell, leave open the question of what meaning anniversaries will have once the veterans are gone.\n\nBut at the 80th, they're the VIPs of commemorations across the Normandy coast where the largest-ever land, sea and air armada punctured Hitler's defenses in Western Europe and helped precipitate his downfall 11 months later.\n\n\"They really were the golden generation, those 17-, 18-year-old guys doing something so brave,\" said James Baker, a 56-year-old from the Netherlands, reflecting on Utah Beach.\n\nFarther up the coast on Gold Beach, a military bagpiper played at precisely the time that British troops landed there 80 years ago.\n\nThe United Kingdom's King Charles III and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak were among those at a ceremony to honor the troops who landed there and on Sword Beach, while Prince William and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau joined others at ceremony for the Canadian troops at Juno Beach.\n\nIn his address, the king told the crowd that the world was fortunate that a generation \"did not flinch\" when they were called upon.\n\n\"Our obligation to remember what they stood for and what they achieved for us all can never diminish,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking in French, Charles also paid tribute to the \"unimaginable number\" of French civilians killed in the battle for Normandy, and the bravery and sacrifice of the French Resistance.\n\nThose who traveled to Normandy include women who were among the millions who built bombers, tanks and other weaponry and played other vital World War II roles that were long overshadowed by the combat exploits of men.\n\nFeted everywhere they go in wheelchairs and walking with canes, veterans are using their voices to repeat their message they hope will live eternal: Never forget.\n\n\"We weren't doing it for honors and awards. We were doing it to save our country,\" said 98-year-old Anna Mae Krier, who worked as a riveter building B-17 and B-29 bombers. \"We ended up helping save the world.\"\n\nJill Lawless in London, and

His great grandfather fought in WWI, his grandfather was a prisoner of war in WWII, and his father was a veteran of France's war in former North African colony Algeria.\n\n\"I don't want our freedom, for our kids, our grandkids, to be hit by ... I don't want to say a madman,\" referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"So a lot of respect for these people who died and for those who are still dying,\" he said of the WWII dead and those in Ukraine.\n\nHe said the D-Day sacrifices have to be remembered. \"Lots of emotion that all these troops came to liberate a country that they didn't know for an ideology -- democracy, freedom -- that is under severe strain now.\"\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the golden sun pierced low clouds over the seas that were thick with landing craft approaching Normandy on D-Day, Becky Kraubetz peered across the English Channel toward her native Britain, her eyes filled with tears as she thought about the scene 80 years ago.\n\n\"It's so historic and we just have to remember the sacrifices of everybody who gave us our freedom,\" said Kraubetz, whose grandfather served with the British Army during World War II and was captured in Malta.\n\n\"It gives you goosebumps, everything that happened here. Imagine just jumping into the water, freezing cold,\" said the 54-year-old who now lives in Florida, as the rays of the morning sun started to warm the hundreds of people who'd waited through the night's chill for dawn's break.\n\n\"The bravery, the courage, for people to face that is just unbelievable -- very, very humbled to be here.\"\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the sun sets on the D-Day generation, it's rising again over Normandy beaches where soldiers fought and died exactly 80 years ago, kicking off intense anniversary commemorations Thursday against the backdrop of renewed war in Europe, in Ukraine.\n\nEver-dwindling numbers of World War II veterans, and Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, make this anniversary particularly meaningful, mixing poignant remembrances for D-Day sacrifices with an Allied show of solidarity for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, among the guests.\n\nBut host France hasn't invited World War II ally Russia, citing its \"war of aggression against Ukraine that has intensified in recent weeks.\"\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Hundreds of people, some in WWII-era uniforms, arrived before dawn to stretch out across the now peaceful sands of Utah Beach, one of the five Allied landing zones on D-Day where troops waded into cold seas through hails of fire exactly 80 years ago.\n\n\"It's our way of paying homage, and better understanding what really happened in the 1944 landings,\" said Dimitri Picot, a 33-year-old from the nearby Normandy town of Carentan who works as a rat and pest catcher.\n\nPicot said he often dives on a wrecked ship that was hit and exploded, its wreckage visible Thursday as night gave way to day. Growing up amid the June 6, 1944, landing zones, he said he has become accustomed to seeing walls still pockmarked by bullets, shrapnel and other reminders of that fateful day.\n\nBut on the 80th

British forces landing in gliders take two strategic bridges near the city of Caen.\n\nWorld War II veterans are joining heads of state and others Thursday on the beaches of Normandy to commemorate the 80th anniversary of D-Day.\n\nThe Allied invasion, which began on June 6, 1944, led to the defeat of the Nazis and the end of the war. The assault began with Allied aircraft bombing German defenses in Normandy, followed by around 1,200 aircraft that carried airborne troops. As dawn broke, Allied forces started bombing German coastal defenses and shortly after that vessels began putting troops ashore on five codenamed beaches: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword. By the end of the day, nearly 160,000 Allied troops had landed in Normandy, although there were thousands of casualties.\n\nFew witnesses to history's biggest amphibious invasion remain alive today.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- Hour by hour: A brief timeline of the Allies' invasion of occupied France\n\n-- With time short, veterans seize the chance to keep their D-Day memories alive for others\n\n-- Women were barred from combat.

On Thursday, a dwindling number of World War II veterans in a parade of wheelchairs joined a new generation of leaders to honor the dead, the living and the fight for democracy in moving commemorations on and around those same beaches where they landed exactly 80 years ago on D-Day.\n\nThe war in Ukraine shadowed the ceremonies, a grim modern-day example of lives and cities that are again suffering through war in Europe.\n\nThe break of dawn eight decades after Allied troops landed on five code-named beaches -- Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword -- started the day of remembrance by Allied nations now standing together again behind Ukraine.\n\nWorld War II ally Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, wasn't invited, and U.S. President Joe Biden directly linked Ukraine's fight for its young democracy to the battle to defeat Nazi Germany.\n\n\"To surrender to bullies, to bow down to dictators is simply unthinkable,\" Biden said. \"If we were to do that, it means we'd be forgetting what happened here on these hallowed beaches.\"\n\nWith the dead and wounded on both sides in Ukraine estimated in the hundreds of thousands, commemorations for the more than 4,400 Allied dead on D-Day and many tens of thousands more, including French civilians, killed in the ensuing Battle of Normandy are tinged with concerns that World War II lessons are being lost.\n\n\"There are things worth fighting for,\" said Walter Stitt, who fought in tanks and turns 100 in July, as he visited Omaha Beach this week. \"Although I wish there was another way to do it than to try to kill each other.\"\n\n\"We'll learn one of these days, but I won't be around for that,\" he said.\n\nAs now-centenarian veterans revisited old memories and fallen comrades buried in Normandy graves, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's presence at the international D-Day commemoration was met with loud applause, fusing World War II's awful past with the fraught present. More applause followed when a giant screen showed the Ukrainian leader speaking with U.S. veterans.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron awarded the Legion of Honor to 14 U.S. veterans and a British female veteran. Among the Americans was Edward Berthold, a pilot who carried out his three missions over France in May 1944, before taking part in an operation in Saint-Lo, in Normandy, on D-Day. He flew 35 combat missions in all during World War II.\n\n\"You came here because the free world needed each and every one of you, and you answered the call,\" Macron said. \"You came here to make France a free nation. You're back here today at home, if I may say.\"\n\nBerthold later read aloud a letter he'd written home the next day, showing that even as a young man he was aware of D-Day's importance.\n\n\"Wednesday night, June 7th, 1944. Dear Mom, just a few lines to tell you we are all ok. We flew mission number 10 on D-Day,\" he wrote. \"It certainly was a terrific show, what we could see. This is what everyone has been waiting for.\"\n\nMacron also bestowed the Legion of Honor on 103-year-old Christian Lamb, the daughter of a Royal Navy admiral who was studying in Normandy in 1939 when her father called her back to London. There, Lamb created detailed maps that guided the crews of landing craft on D-Day.\n\nThe French president bent down to Lamb in a wheelchair, pin the medal and kiss her on both cheeks, describing her as one of the \"heroes in the shadows.\"\n\nConscious of the inevitability of age and time for World War II veterans, huge throngs of aficionados in uniforms and riding vehicles of the time, and tourists soaking up the spectacle, flooded Normandy for the 80th anniversary. At the international ceremony later, the veterans received a standing ovation as they were paraded before the stands in a stately line of wheelchairs to avoid the long walk across the beachfront promenade.\n\n\"We just have to remember the sacrifices of everybody who gave us our freedom,\" said Becky Kraubetz, a Briton now living in Florida whose grandfather served with the British Army during World War II and was captured in Malta. She was among a crowd of thousands of people that stretched for several kilometers (miles) along Utah Beach, the westernmost of the D-Day beaches.\n\nIn a quiet spot away from the official ceremonies, France's Christophe Receveur performed his own tribute, unfurling an American flag he had bought on a trip to Pennsylvania to honor those who died on D-Day.\n\n\"To forget them is to let them die all over again,\" the 57-year-old said as he and his daughter, Julie, then carefully refolded the flag into a tight triangle, adding that those now dying in Ukraine fighting the invading Russian army were also on his mind.\n\n\"All these troops came to liberate a country that they didn't know for an ideology -- democracy, freedom -- that is under severe strain now,\" he said.\n\nFor Warren Goss, a 99-year-old American veteran of D-Day who landed in the first waves on Utah Beach, a visit years later to the same place where he watched comrades fall to incoming fire affirmed the sacrifice.\n\n\"I looked at the beach and it was beautiful, all the people, the kids were playing and I see the boys and girls were walking, holding hands, with their life back,\" he told the Danish king and prime minister, who hung on his every word.\n\nThe fair-like atmosphere fueled by World War II-era jeeps and trucks tearing down hedge-rowed lanes so deadly for Allied troops who fought dug-in German defenders, and of reenactors playing at war on sands where D-Day soldiers fell, leave open the question of what meaning anniversaries will have once the veterans are gone.\n\nBut at the 80th, they're the VIPs of commemorations across the Normandy coast where the largest-ever land, sea and air armada punctured Hitler's defenses in Western Europe and helped precipitate his downfall 11 months later.\n\n\"They really were the golden generation, those 17-, 18-year-old guys doing something so brave,\" said James Baker, a 56-year-old from the Netherlands, reflecting on Utah Beach.\n\nFarther up the coast on Gold Beach, a military bagpiper played at precisely the time that British troops landed there 80 years ago.\n\nThe United Kingdom's King Charles III and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak were among those at a ceremony to honor the troops who landed there and on Sword Beach, while Prince William and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau joined others at ceremony for the Canadian troops at Juno Beach.\n\nIn his address, the king told the crowd that the world was fortunate that a generation \"did not flinch\" when they were called upon.\n\n\"Our obligation to remember what they stood for and what they achieved for us all can never diminish,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking in French, Charles also paid tribute to the \"unimaginable number\" of French civilians killed in the battle for Normandy, and the bravery and sacrifice of the French Resistance.\n\nThose who traveled to Normandy include women who were among the millions who built bombers, tanks and other weaponry and played other vital World War II roles that were long overshadowed by the combat exploits of men.\n\nFeted everywhere they go in wheelchairs and walking with canes, veterans are using their voices to repeat their message they hope will live eternal: Never forget.\n\n\"We weren't doing it for honors and awards. We were doing it to save our country,\" said 98-year-old Anna Mae Krier, who worked as a riveter building B-17 and B-29 bombers. \"We ended up helping save the world.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press

It cited Russia's \"war of aggression against Ukraine that has intensified in recent weeks\" for the snub.\n\nWith the dead and wounded on both sides in Ukraine estimated in the hundreds of thousands, commemorations for the more than 4,400 Allied dead on D-Day and many tens of thousands more, including French civilians, killed in the ensuing Battle of Normandy are tinged with concerns that World War II lessons are being lost.\n\n\"There are things worth fighting for,\" said World War II veteran Walter Stitt, who fought in tanks and turns 100 in July, as he visited Omaha Beach this week. \"Although I wish there was another way to do it than to try to kill each other.\"\n\n\"We'll learn one of these days, but I won't be around for that,\" he said.\n\nConscious of the inevitability that major D-Day anniversaries will soon take place without World War II veterans, huge throngs of aficionados in uniforms and riding vehicles of the time, and tourists soaking up the spectacle, have flooded Normandy for the 80th anniversary.\n\nThe fair-like atmosphere fueled by World War II-era jeeps and trucks tearing down hedge-rowed lanes so deadly for Allied troops who fought dug-in German defenders, and of reenactors playing at war on sands where D-Day soldiers fell, leave open the question of what meaning anniversaries will have once the veterans are gone.\n\nBut at the 80th, they're the VIPs of commemorations across the Normandy coast where the largest-ever land, sea and air armada punctured Hitler's defenses in Western Europe and helped precipitate his downfall 11 months later.\n\nThose who traveled to Normandy include women who were among the millions who built bombers, tanks and other weaponry and played other vital World War II roles that were long overshadowed by the combat exploits of men.\n\n\"We weren't doing it for honors and awards. We were doing it to save our country. And we ended up helping save the world,\" said 98-year-old Anna Mae Krier, who worked as a riveter building B-17 and B-29 bombers.\n\nFeted where ever they go in wheelchairs and walking with canes, veterans are using their voices to repeat their message they hope will live eternal: Never forget.\n\n\"To know the amount of people who were killed here, just amazing,\" 98-year-old Allan Chatwin,

The assault began with Allied aircraft bombing German defenses in Normandy, followed by around 1,200 aircraft that carried airborne troops. As dawn broke, Allied forces started bombing German coastal defenses and shortly after that vessels began putting troops ashore on five codenamed beaches: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword.

Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nAs now-centenarian veterans revisit old memories and fallen comrades buried in Normandy graves, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's presence at D-Day commemorations with world leaders -- including U.S. President Joe Biden -- who are supporting his country's fight against Russia's invasion will inevitably fuse together World War II's awful past with the fraught present on Thursday.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe break of dawn almost eight decades exactly after Allied troops waded ashore under hails of gunfire on five code-named beaches -- Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword -- will kick off a day of remembrance by Allied nations now standing together again behind Ukraine -- and with World War II ally Russia not invited by host France. It cited Russia's \"war of aggression against Ukraine that has intensified in recent weeks\" for the snub.\n\nWith the dead and wounded on both sides in Ukraine estimated in the hundreds of thousands, commemorations for the more than 4,400 Allied dead on D-Day and many tens of thousands more, including French civilians, killed in the ensuing Battle of Normandy are tinged with concerns that World War II lessons are being lost.\n\n\"There are things worth fighting for,\" said World War II veteran Walter Stitt, who fought in tanks and turns 100 in July, as he visited Omaha Beach this week. \"Although I wish there was another way to do it than to try to kill each other.\"\n\n\"We'll learn one of these days, but I won't be around for that,\" he said.\n\nConscious of the inevitability that major D-Day anniversaries will soon take place without World War II veterans, huge throngs of aficionados in uniforms and riding vehicles of the time, and tourists soaking up the spectacle, have flooded Normandy for the 80th anniversary.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe fair-like atmosphere fueled by World War II-era jeeps and trucks tearing down hedge-rowed lanes so deadly for Allied troops who fought dug-in German defenders, and of reenactors playing at war on sands where D-Day soldiers fell, leave open the question of what meaning anniversaries will have once the veterans are gone.\n\nBut at the 80th, they're the VIPs of commemorations across the Normandy coast where the largest-ever land, sea and air armada punctured Hitler's defenses in Western Europe and helped precipitate his downfall 11 months later.\n\nThose who traveled to Normandy include women who were among the millions who built bombers, tanks and other weaponry and played other vital World War II roles that were long overshadowed by the combat exploits of men.\n\n\"We weren't doing it for honors and awards. We were doing it to save our country. And we ended up helping save the world,\" said 98-year-old Anna Mae Krier, who worked as a riveter building B-17 and B-29 bombers.\n\nFeted where ever they go in wheelchairs and walking with canes, veterans are using their voices to repeat their message they hope will live eternal: Never forget.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"To know the amount of people who were killed here, just amazing,\" 98-year-old Allan Chatwin, who served with the U.S. Navy in the Pacific, said as he visited Omaha, the deadliest of the Allied beaches on D-Day.\n\nHe quickly added: \"I don't know that amazing is the word.\"", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy_landings",

The assault began with Allied aircraft bombing German defenses in Normandy, followed by around 1,200 aircraft that carried airborne troops. As dawn broke, Allied forces started bombing German coastal defenses and shortly after that vessels began putting troops ashore on five codenamed beaches: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword. By the end of the day, nearly 160,000 Allied troops had landed in Normandy, although there were thousands of casualties.\n\nFew witnesses to history's biggest amphibious invasion remain alive today.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- Hour by hour: A brief timeline of the Allies' invasion of occupied France\n\n-- With time short, veterans seize the chance to keep their D-Day memories alive for others\n\n-- Women were barred from combat. But they helped D-Day succeed in other ways\n\n-- How AP covered the D-Day landings and lost a photographer in the battle for Normandy\n\n-- A Jewish veteran from London prepares to commemorate the 80th anniversary\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nVER-SUR-MER, France -- King Charles III and Queen Camilla led commemorations at the new British Normandy Memorial in Ver-sur-Mer.\n\nCamilla wiped away a tear as actor Martin Freeman read words by 99-year-old D-Day veteran Joe Mines, recalling that \"I was 19 when I landed, but I was still a boy. I don't care what people say, I wasn't a man, I was a boy. And I didn't have any idea of war and killing.\"\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak and Labour Party leader Keir Starmer took a break from campaigning for Britain's July 4 election to travel to France for the ceremony.\n\nSunak paid tribute to veterans, saying their \"actions freed a continent and built a better world.\"\n\n\"You risked everything and we owe you everything,\" he said. \"We cannot possibly hope to repay that debt but we can and we must pledge never to forget.\"\n\nWelsh singer Tom Jones, 83, sang his song \"I Won't Crumble With You If You Fall,\" before the king addressed the audience in French and English.\n\nCharles said that while the number of living veterans was dwindling, \"our obligation to remember what they stood for and what they achieved for us all can never diminish.\"\n\nSpeaking in French, Charles paid tribute to the \"unimaginable number\" of French civilians killed in the battle for Normandy, and the bravery and sacrifice of the French Resistance.\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Among the thousands who flocked to D-Day beach Utah was the grandson of an American colonel who smuggled himself aboard a landing craft so he could join his men in the first waves of the June 6, 1944, invasion.\n\nJohn Reistrup, 55, never met his grandfather, Eugene M. Caffey, who died in 1961. Coming back to Utah for the 80th anniversary was his way of carrying \"the torch for someone you never met that had such an impact on so many lives.\"\n\nA plaque at the beach that honors his grandfather says the colonel led the 19,500 men of the 1st Engineer Special Brigade tasked on that fateful day with the logistics of the landing on Utah, one of five invasion beaches.\n\nNot scheduled to land until 0900, Caffey, a 49-year-old father of nine, had smuggled himself, with no equipment except an empty rifle, aboard an 8th Infantry landing craft. En route he managed to load his rifle by taking up a collection of one bullet each from eight infantrymen. He arrived ashore very early in the assault, Reistrup said.\n\n\"No officers were allowed on the first waves of the landing but he said, 'Hell, no, I'm going with my guys.'\"\n\nA Nazi bunker captured on the beach then became his grandfather's office, he said. Caffey's portrait hangs there, inside, to this day.\n\nForging ahead into fire on D-Day \"has got to be the greatest courage you could ever have,\" said Reistrup, who has visited Normandy about 10 times since his first visit as a kid in 1974.\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Thousands of people, including many people in World War II-era uniforms, were stretched for several kilometers (miles) along Utah Beach ahead of commemorations marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings.\n\nUtah was one of the five landing beaches along the coast of Normandy where Allied troops landed on June 6, 2024. Utah and Omaha were taken -- at the cost of hundreds of lives -- by American forces, with the others stormed by troops from Britain and Canada, also killing many hundreds, plus others from France.\n\nThe long stretch of the Normandy coast is where the largest-ever land, sea and air armada punctured Hitler's defenses in Western Europe and helped precipitate his downfall 11 months later.\n\nA fair-like atmosphere is fueled by World War II-era jeeps and trucks tearing down hedge-rowed lanes so deadly for Allied troops who fought dug-in German defenders, and of reenactors playing at war on sands where D-Day soldiers fell.\n\nSurviving veterans, who are around 100 years old now, are the VIPs of the day's events.\n\nCOPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Denmark's prime minister said that this year's observances of the D-Day landings, which come as Russia is at war against Ukraine, are a reminder that there is a price for defending freedom.\n\n\"From D-Day we have learned that freedom costs,\" Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said in a statement as she headed to Normandy for ceremonies marking the 80th anniversary of the Allied landings.\n\n\"Eighty years later, Europe once again finds itself at a fateful moment. Where freedom is once again being fought for on our own continent,\" she said, \"against an aggressive and brutal enemy who will dictate country borders with brute force and leave a trail of death and destruction.\"\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Because freedom is worth celebrating and passing on to children, too, Alexandra Hamon, 35, drank champagne and shared the sunrise with her boys, Karl and Neils, both 13, as the day dawned Thursday over the beaches where Allied soldiers landed on D-Day.\n\nThe family was among a crowd several thousands strong that stretched for kilometers along Utah beach -- one of the five beaches along the coast of Normandy where Allied troops landed. Utah and Omaha were taken -- at the cost of hundreds of lives -- by American forces, with the others stormed by troops from Britain and Canada, also killing many hundreds, plus others from France. The other code-named beaches are Juno, Sword and Gold.\n\nKarl sat perched on the hood of their 1943 Dodge truck, lovingly restored by her husband, Enogat, as the family from Saint Malo, a French coastal city that was badly damaged in major fighting about two months after D-Day, stared out across the English Channel.\n\nThe waters Thursday were still and peaceful -- unlike on that fateful day that helped change the course of WWII and precipitate Adolf Hitler's downfall 11 months later.\n\n\"It's indescribable, just imagining the chaos. Now it's peaceful, almost festive, we try to imagine but I think it's unimaginable,\" she said.\n\n\"You think of all those guys, everything they went through,\" she added of the fast-dwindling D-Day veterans. \"They say they aren't heroes. But they are, they are. Those guys really should never die. I imagine the boats, the guys arriving, the sounds. It must have been horrible, yes, horrible.\"\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the rising sun took the night's chill off Utah Beach, Christophe Receveur, 57, from Thionville in eastern France, unfurled a Stars and Stripes he bought in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, six months ago specifically to honor the Americans who fell on D-Day.\n\n\"To keep alive the memory of the soldiers who died for our freedom,\" he said. \"To forget them is to let them die all over again.\"\n\nReceveur and his daughter, Julie, 28, carefully folded the flag into a tight triangle after their quiet, reflective homage on an empty stretch of the beach, busy with hundreds of people strung out along the sands.\n\nReceveur said the Ukraine war was on his mind, too, as he honored the fallen of WWII. His great grandfather fought in WWI, his grandfather was a prisoner of war in WWII, and his father was a veteran of France's war in former North African colony Algeria.\n\n\"I don't want our freedom, for our kids, our grandkids, to be hit by ... I don't want to say a madman,\" referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"So a lot of respect for these people who died and for those who are still dying,\" he said of the WWII dead and those in Ukraine.\n\nHe said the D-Day sacrifices have to be remembered. \"Lots of emotion that all these troops came to liberate a country that they didn't know for an ideology -- democracy, freedom -- that is under severe strain now.\"\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the golden sun pierced low clouds over the seas that were thick with landing craft approaching Normandy on D-Day, Becky Kraubetz peered across the English Channel toward her native Britain, her eyes filled with tears as she thought about the scene 80 years ago.\n\n\"It's so historic and we just have to remember the sacrifices of everybody who gave us our freedom,\" said Kraubetz, whose grandfather served with the British Army during World War II and was captured in Malta.\n\n\"It gives you goosebumps, everything that happened here. Imagine just jumping into the water, freezing cold,\" said the 54-year-old who now lives in Florida, as the rays of the morning sun started to warm the hundreds of people who'd waited through the night's chill for dawn's break.\n\n\"The bravery, the courage, for people to face that is just unbelievable -- very, very humbled to be here.\"\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the sun sets on the D-Day generation, it's rising again over Normandy beaches where soldiers fought and died exactly 80 years ago, kicking off intense anniversary commemorations Thursday against the backdrop of renewed war in Europe, in Ukraine.\n\nEver-dwindling numbers of World War II veterans, and Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, make this anniversary particularly meaningful, mixing poignant remembrances for D-Day sacrifices with an Allied show of solidarity for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, among the guests.\n\nBut host France hasn't invited World War II ally Russia, citing its \"war of aggression against Ukraine that has intensified in recent weeks.\"\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Hundreds of people, some in WWII-era uniforms, arrived before dawn to stretch out across the now peaceful sands of Utah Beach, one of the five Allied landing zones on D-Day where troops waded into cold seas through hails of fire exactly 80 years ago.\n\n\"It's our way of paying homage, and better understanding what really happened in the 1944 landings,\" said Dimitri Picot, a 33-year-old from the nearby Normandy town of Carentan who works as a rat and pest catcher.\n\nPicot said he often dives on a wrecked ship that was hit and exploded, its wreckage visible Thursday as night gave way to day. Growing up amid the June 6, 1944, landing zones, he said he has become accustomed to seeing walls still pockmarked by bullets, shrapnel and other reminders of that fateful day.\n\nBut on the 80th anniversary \"to think that they liberated us\" hammered home the emotion, he said.", "source": {"uri": "wate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WATE 6 On Your Side"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

''Although I wish there was another way to do it than to try to kill each other.\" \"We'll learn one of these days, but I won't be around for that,\" he said.\n\nConscious of the inevitability that major D-Day anniversaries will soon take place without World War II veterans, huge throngs of aficionados in uniforms and riding vehicles of the time, and tourists soaking up the spectacle, have flooded Normandy for the 80th anniversary.\n\nThe fair-like atmosphere fuelled by World War II-era jeeps and trucks tearing down hedge-rowed lanes so deadly for Allied troops who fought dug-in German defenders, and of reenactors playing at war on sands where D-Day soldiers fell, leave open the question of what meaning anniversaries will have once the veterans are gone.\n\nBut at the 80th, they're the VIPs of commemorations across the Normandy coast where the largest-ever land, sea and air armada punctured Hitler's defences in Western Europe and helped precipitate his downfall 11 months later.\n\nThose who travelled to Normandy include women who were among the millions who built bombers, tanks and other weaponry and played other vital World War II roles that were long overshadowed by the combat exploits of men.\n\n\"We weren't doing it for honours and awards. We were doing it to save our country. And we ended up helping save the world,\" said 98-year-old Anna Mae Krier, who worked as a riveter building B-17 and B-29 bombers.\n\nFeted where ever they go in wheelchairs and walking with canes, veterans are using their voices to repeat their message they hope will live eternal: Never forget.\n\n\"To know the amount of people who were killed here, just amazing,\" 98-year-old Allan Chatwin,

The assault began with Allied aircraft bombing German defenses in Normandy, followed by around 1,200 aircraft that carried airborne troops. As dawn broke, Allied forces started bombing German coastal defenses and shortly after that vessels began putting troops ashore on five codenamed beaches: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword. By the end of the day, nearly 160,000 Allied troops had landed in Normandy, although there were thousands of casualties.\n\nFew witnesses to history's biggest amphibious invasion remain alive today.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- Hour by hour: A brief timeline of the Allies' invasion of occupied France\n\n-- With time short, veterans seize the chance to keep their D-Day memories alive for others\n\n-- Women were barred from combat.

Imagine just jumping into the water, freezing cold,\" said the 54-year-old who now lives in Florida, as the rays of the morning sun started to warm the hundreds of people who'd waited through the night's chill for dawn's break.\n\n\"The bravery, the courage, for people to face that is just unbelievable -- very, very humbled to be here.\"\n\nTHE SUN RISES OVER NORMANDY BEACHES AS THE WORLD REMEMBERS D-DAY\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the sun sets on the D-Day generation, it's rising again over Normandy beaches where soldiers fought and died exactly 80 years ago, kicking off intense anniversary commemorations Thursday against the backdrop of renewed war in Europe, in Ukraine.\n\nEver-dwindling numbers of World War II veterans, and Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, make this anniversary particularly meaningful, mixing poignant remembrances for D-Day sacrifices with an Allied show of solidarity for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, among the guests.\n\nBut host France hasn't invited World War II ally Russia, citing its \"war of aggression against Ukraine that has intensified in recent weeks.\"\n\nHUNDREDS GATHER AT DAWN AT UTAH BEACH TO MARK D-DAY'S 80TH ANNIVERSARY\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Hundreds of people, some in WWII-era uniforms, arrived before dawn to stretch out across the now peaceful sands of Utah Beach, one of the five Allied landing zones on D-Day where troops waded into cold seas through hails of fire exactly 80 years ago.\n\n\"It's our way of paying homage, and better understanding what really happened in the 1944 landings,\" said Dimitri Picot, a 33-year-old from the nearby Normandy town of Carentan who works as a rat and pest catcher.\n\nPicot said he often dives on a wrecked ship that was hit and exploded, its wreckage visible Thursday as night gave way to day. Growing up amid the June 6, 1944, landing zones, he said he has become accustomed to seeing walls still pockmarked by bullets, shrapnel and other reminders of that fateful day.\n\nBut on the 80th

Now bent with age, the dwindling number of World War II veterans joined a new generation of leaders on Thursday to honor the dead, the living and the fight for democracy on the shores where they landed 80 years ago on D-Day.\n\nThe war in Ukraine shadowed the ceremonies in Normandy, a grim modern-day example of lives and cities that are again suffering through war in Europe. Ukraine's president was greeted with a standing ovation and cheers. Russia, a crucial World War II ally whose full-scale invasion of its smaller neighbor in 2022 set Europe on a new path of war, was not invited.\n\nThe commemorations for the more than 4,400 Allied dead on D-Day and many tens of thousands more, including French civilians, killed in the ensuing Battle of Normandy were tinged with fear that World War II lessons are fading.\n\n\"There are things worth fighting for,\" said Walter Stitt, who fought in tanks and turns 100 in July, as he visited Omaha Beach this week. \"Although I wish there was another way to do it than to try to kill each other.\"\n\n\"We'll learn one of these days, but I won't be around for that,\" he said.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden directly linked Ukraine's fight for its young democracy to the battle to defeat Nazi Germany.\n\n\"To surrender to bullies, to bow down to dictators is simply unthinkable,\" Biden said. \"If we were to do that, it means we'd be forgetting what happened here on these hallowed beaches.\"\n\nAs now-centenarian veterans revisited old memories and fallen comrades buried in Normandy graves, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's presence at the international D-Day commemoration fused World War II's awful past with the fraught present. The dead and wounded on both sides in Ukraine are estimated in the hundreds of thousands.\n\nDespite Russia's absence, French President Emmanuel Macron paid homage to those who fought on the eastern front \"and the resolute commitment of the Red Army and all the people who were part of the then-Soviet Union.\"\n\nBut it was the landing on June 6, 1944, and the battles in Normandy that followed that ultimately drove the Nazis from France.\n\n\"You came here because the free world needed each and every one of you, and you answered the call,\" Macron said. \"You came here to make France a free nation. You're back here today at home, if I may say.\"\n\nThe French president awarded the Legion of Honor to 14 U.S. veterans and a British female veteran. Among the Americans was Edward Berthold, a pilot who carried out his three missions over France in May 1944, before taking part in an operation in Saint-Lo, in Normandy, on D-Day. He flew 35 combat missions in all during World War II.\n\nBerthold later read aloud a letter he'd written home the next day, showing that even as a young man he was aware of D-Day's importance.\n\n\"Wednesday night, June 7th, 1944. Dear Mom, just a few lines to tell you we are all ok. We flew mission number 10 on D-Day,\" he wrote. \"It certainly was a terrific show, what we could see. This is what everyone has been waiting for.\"\n\nMacron also bestowed the Legion of Honor on 103-year-old Christian Lamb, the daughter of a Royal Navy admiral who was studying in Normandy in 1939 when her father called her back to London. There, Lamb created detailed maps that guided the crews of landing craft on D-Day.\n\nThe French president bent down to Lamb in a wheelchair, pin the medal and kiss her on both cheeks, describing her as one of the \"heroes in the shadows.\"\n\nConscious of the inevitability of age and time for World War II veterans, throngs of aficionados in period uniforms and vehicles, along with tourists soaking up the spectacle, flooded Normandy for the 80th anniversary. At the international ceremony later, the veterans received a standing ovation as they were paraded before the stands in a stately line of wheelchairs to avoid the long walk across the beachfront promenade.\n\n\"We just have to remember the sacrifices of everybody who gave us our freedom,\" said Becky Kraubetz, a Briton now living in Florida whose grandfather served with the British Army during World War II and was captured in Malta. She was among a crowd of thousands of people that stretched for several kilometers (miles) along Utah Beach, the westernmost of the D-Day beaches.\n\nIn a quiet spot away from the pomp, France's Christophe Receveur offered his own tribute, unfurling an American flag he had bought on a trip to Pennsylvania to honor those who died on D-Day.\n\n\"To forget them is to let them die all over again,\" the 57-year-old said as he and his daughter, Julie, carefully refolded the flag into a tight triangle. Those now dying in Ukraine fighting the invading Russian army were also on his mind.\n\n\"All these troops came to liberate a country that they didn't know for an ideology -- democracy, freedom -- that is under severe strain now,\" he said.\n\nFor Warren Goss, a 99-year-old American veteran of D-Day who landed in the first waves on Utah Beach, the sacrifice was affirmed by a visit years later to the same place where his comrades fell.\n\n\"I looked at the beach and it was beautiful, all the people, the kids were playing and I see the boys and girls were walking, holding hands, with their life back,\" he told the Danish king and prime minister, who hung on his words.\n\nThe fair-like atmosphere on the five code-named beaches -- Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword -- was fueled by World War II-era jeeps and trucks tearing down hedge-rowed lanes so deadly for Allied troops who fought dug-in German defenders, and of reenactors playing at war on sands where D-Day soldiers fell.\n\nBut the real VIPs of the commemorations across the Normandy coast were the veterans who took part in the largest-ever land, sea and air armada that punctured Hitler's defenses in Western Europe and helped precipitate his downfall 11 months later.\n\n\"They really were the golden generation, those 17-, 18-year-old guys doing something so brave,\" said James Baker, a 56-year-old from the Netherlands, reflecting on Utah Beach.\n\nFarther up the coast on Gold Beach, a military bagpiper played at precisely the time that British troops landed there 80 years ago.\n\nThe United Kingdom's King Charles III and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak were among those at a ceremony to honor the troops who landed there and on Sword Beach, while Prince William and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau joined others at ceremony for the Canadian troops at Juno Beach.\n\nIn his address, the king told the crowd that the world was fortunate that a generation \"did not flinch\" when they were called upon.\n\n\"Our obligation to remember what they stood for and what they achieved for us all can never diminish,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking in French, Charles also paid tribute to the \"unimaginable number\" of French civilians killed in the battle for Normandy, and the bravery and sacrifice of the French Resistance.\n\nThose who traveled to Normandy include women who were among the millions who built bombers, tanks and other weaponry and played other vital World War II roles that were long overshadowed by the combat exploits of men.\n\nFeted everywhere they go in wheelchairs and walking with canes, veterans are using their voices to repeat their message they hope will live eternal: Never forget.\n\n\"We weren't doing it for honors and awards. We were doing it to save our country,\" said 98-year-old Anna Mae Krier, who worked as a riveter building B-17 and B-29 bombers. \"We ended up helping save the world.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press

The assault began with Allied aircraft bombing German defenses in Normandy, followed by around 1,200 aircraft that carried airborne troops. As dawn broke, Allied forces started bombing German coastal defenses and shortly after that vessels began putting troops ashore on five codenamed beaches: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword. By the end of the day, nearly 160,000 Allied troops had landed in Normandy, although there were thousands of casualties.\n\nFew witnesses to history\u00b4s biggest amphibious invasion remain alive today.\n\nCurrently:\n\n- Hour by hour: A brief timeline of the Allies\u00b4 invasion of occupied France\n\n- With time short, veterans seize the chance to keep their D-Day memories alive for others\n\nFILE - This photograph is believed to show E Company, 16th Regiment, 1st Infantry Division, participating in the first wave of assaults during D-Day in Normandy, France, June 6, 1944.

More than 9,000 Allied soldiers were killed or wounded in the first 24 hours. (Chief Photographer's Mate Robert M. Sargent, U.S. Coast Guard via AP, File)\n\n- Women were barred from combat.

As dawn broke, Allied forces started bombing German coastal defenses and shortly after that vessels began putting troops ashore on five codenamed beaches: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword. By the end of the day, nearly 160,000 Allied troops had landed in Normandy, although there were thousands of casualties.\n\nFew witnesses to history's biggest amphibious invasion remain alive today.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- Hour by hour: A brief timeline of the Allies' invasion of occupied France\n\n-- With time short, veterans seize the chance to keep their D-Day memories alive for others\n\n-- Women were barred from combat. But they helped D-Day succeed in other ways\n\n-- How AP covered the D-Day landings and lost a photographer in the battle for Normandy\n\n-- A Jewish veteran from London prepares to commemorate the 80th anniversary\n\nHere's the latest:\n\n103-YEAR-OLD FEMALE VETERAN GIVEN LEGION OF HONOR AWARD\n\nVERS-SUR-MER, France -- French President Emmanuel Macron bestowed a Legion of Honor award on a 103-year-old female British veteran officer who created detailed maps that guided the crews of landing craft on D-Day.\n\nChristian Lamb sat in a wheelchair as Macron bent down to pin the medal on her and kissed her on both cheeks.\n\nHe told her she was one of the \"heroes in the shadows\" as he described how she was studying in Normandy in 1939 when her father, a Royal Navy admiral, called her back to London on the eve of World War II.\n\nIn a recent interview with The Associated Press, Lamb recalled creating maps that \"showed railways, roads, churches, castles, every possible feature that could be visible to an incoming invader and from every angle,\" Lamb.\n\n\"It was intense and exciting work, and obviously detail was vital. It was crucial that the maps were 100% accurate,\" she said.\n\nPRINCE WILLIAM PRAISES CANADIAN TROOPS IN NORMANDY\n\nJUNO BEACH, France -- Prince William has praised the bravery and sacrifice of Canadian troops as he addressed a D-Day anniversary ceremony on Juno Beach.\n\nThe royal was joined by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal and Canadian D-Day veterans.\n\nSome 14,000 Canadians were part of the 150,000 Allied troops who landed or parachuted into Normandy in 1944.\n\n\"Far from home they stormed these very sand dunes behind me, shoulder to shoulder with thousands of British troops,\" William said.\n\nAddressing veterans at the ceremony, the royal added: \"Thank you for our freedom, and thank you for your service.\"\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN MEETS WITH AMERICAN VETERANS\n\nCOLLEVILLE-SUR-MER, France -- U.S. President Joe Biden met with American veterans of D-Day as he marked the invasion's 80th anniversary.\n\nVeterans who could stand were helped out of wheelchairs to pose for photos with the president and first lady Jill Biden. One hugged Biden, another saluted. When Biden learned it was the birthday of one of the veterans, he led the audience in singing 'Happy Birthday.'\n\nThe first lady clutched the arm of another veteran, Robert Gibson, to help him stand next to Biden as they shook hands. \"Don't get old,\" the 100-year-old man joked to the 81-year-old president, who was a toddler when D-Day took place.\n\nSteve Spielberg and Tom Hanks, the Hollywood heavyweights behind movies and television shows about World War II, were nearby.\n\nKING CHARLES AND QUEEN CAMILLA LEAD D-DAY COMMEMORATIONS AT NEW MEMORIAL IN FRANCE\n\nVER-SUR-MER, France -- King Charles III and Queen Camilla led commemorations at the new British Normandy Memorial in Ver-sur-Mer.\n\nCamilla wiped away a tear as actor Martin Freeman read words by 99-year-old D-Day veteran Joe Mines, recalling that \"I was 19 when I landed, but I was still a boy. I don't care what people say, I wasn't a man, I was a boy. And I didn't have any idea of war and killing.\"\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak and Labour Party leader Keir Starmer took a break from campaigning for Britain's July 4 election to travel to France for the ceremony.\n\nSunak paid tribute to veterans, saying their \"actions freed a continent and built a better world.\"\n\n\"You risked everything and we owe you everything,\" he said. \"We cannot possibly hope to repay that debt but we can and we must pledge never to forget.\"\n\nWelsh singer Tom Jones, 83, sang his song \"I Won't Crumble With You If You Fall,\" before the king addressed the audience in French and English.\n\nCharles said that while the number of living veterans was dwindling, \"our obligation to remember what they stood for and what they achieved for us all can never diminish.\"\n\nSpeaking in French, Charles paid tribute to the \"unimaginable number\" of French civilians killed in the battle for Normandy, and the bravery and sacrifice of the French Resistance.\n\nMAN HONORS A GRANDFATHER HE NEVER KNEW, AN OFFICER WHO SMUGGLED HIMSELF ON A LANDING CRAFT\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Among the thousands who flocked to D-Day beach Utah was the grandson of an American colonel who smuggled himself aboard a landing craft so he could join his men in the first waves of the June 6, 1944, invasion.\n\nJohn Reistrup, 55, never met his grandfather, Eugene M. Caffey, who died in 1961. Coming back to Utah for the 80th anniversary was his way of carrying \"the torch for someone you never met that had such an impact on so many lives.\"\n\nA plaque at the beach that honors his grandfather says the colonel led the 19,500 men of the 1st Engineer Special Brigade tasked on that fateful day with the logistics of the landing on Utah, one of five invasion beaches.\n\nNot scheduled to land until 0900, Caffey, a 49-year-old father of nine, had smuggled himself, with no equipment except an empty rifle, aboard an 8th Infantry landing craft. En route he managed to load his rifle by taking up a collection of one bullet each from eight infantrymen. He arrived ashore very early in the assault, Reistrup said.\n\n\"No officers were allowed on the first waves of the landing but he said, 'Hell, no, I'm going with my guys.'\"\n\nA Nazi bunker captured on the beach then became his grandfather's office, he said. Caffey's portrait hangs there, inside, to this day.\n\nForging ahead into fire on D-Day \"has got to be the greatest courage you could ever have,\" said Reistrup, who has visited Normandy about 10 times since his first visit as a kid in 1974.\n\nTHOUSANDS OF PEOPLE DOT FRANCE'S UTAH BEACH FOR D-DAY COMMEMORATIONS\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Thousands of people, including many people in World War II-era uniforms, were stretched for several kilometers (miles) along Utah Beach ahead of commemorations marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings.\n\nUtah was one of the five landing beaches along the coast of Normandy where Allied troops landed on June 6, 2024. Utah and Omaha were taken -- at the cost of hundreds of lives -- by American forces, with the others stormed by troops from Britain and Canada, also killing many hundreds, plus others from France.\n\nThe long stretch of the Normandy coast is where the largest-ever land, sea and air armada punctured Hitler's defenses in Western Europe and helped precipitate his downfall 11 months later.\n\nA fair-like atmosphere is fueled by World War II-era jeeps and trucks tearing down hedge-rowed lanes so deadly for Allied troops who fought dug-in German defenders, and of reenactors playing at war on sands where D-Day soldiers fell.\n\nSurviving veterans, who are around 100 years old now, are the VIPs of the day's events.\n\n'FREEDOM COSTS,' DENMARK'S PRIME MINISTER SAYS AS SHE MARKS D-DAY'S 80TH ANNIVERSARY\n\nCOPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Denmark's prime minister said that this year's observances of the D-Day landings, which come as Russia is at war against Ukraine, are a reminder that there is a price for defending freedom.\n\n\"From D-Day we have learned that freedom costs,\" Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said in a statement as she headed to Normandy for ceremonies marking the 80th anniversary of the Allied landings.\n\n\"Eighty years later, Europe once again finds itself at a fateful moment. Where freedom is once again being fought for on our own continent,\" she said, \"against an aggressive and brutal enemy who will dictate country borders with brute force and leave a trail of death and destruction.\"\n\nIMAGINING THE HORROR AND CELEBRATING FREEDOM\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Because freedom is worth celebrating and passing on to children, too, Alexandra Hamon, 35, drank champagne and shared the sunrise with her boys, Karl and Neils, both 13, as the day dawned Thursday over the beaches where Allied soldiers landed on D-Day.\n\nThe family was among a crowd several thousands strong that stretched for kilometers along Utah beach -- one of the five beaches along the coast of Normandy where Allied troops landed. Utah and Omaha were taken -- at the cost of hundreds of lives -- by American forces, with the others stormed by troops from Britain and Canada, also killing many hundreds, plus others from France. The other code-named beaches are Juno, Sword and Gold.\n\nKarl sat perched on the hood of their 1943 Dodge truck, lovingly restored by her husband, Enogat, as the family from Saint Malo, a French coastal city that was badly damaged in major fighting about two months after D-Day, stared out across the English Channel.\n\nThe waters Thursday were still and peaceful -- unlike on that fateful day that helped change the course of WWII and precipitate Adolf Hitler's downfall 11 months later.\n\n\"It's indescribable, just imagining the chaos. Now it's peaceful, almost festive, we try to imagine but I think it's unimaginable,\" she said.\n\n\"You think of all those guys, everything they went through,\" she added of the fast-dwindling D-Day veterans. \"They say they aren't heroes. But they are, they are. Those guys really should never die. I imagine the boats, the guys arriving, the sounds. It must have been horrible, yes, horrible.\"\n\nKEEPING ALIVE THE MEMORY OF SOLDIERS 'WHO DIED FOR OUR FREEDOM'\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the rising sun took the night's chill off Utah Beach, Christophe Receveur, 57, from Thionville in eastern France, unfurled a Stars and Stripes he bought in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, six months ago specifically to honor the Americans who fell on D-Day.\n\n\"To keep alive the memory of the soldiers who died for our freedom,\" he said. \"To forget them is to let them die all over again.\"\n\nReceveur and his daughter, Julie, 28, carefully folded the flag into a tight triangle after their quiet, reflective homage on an empty stretch of the beach, busy with hundreds of people strung out along the sands.\n\nReceveur said the Ukraine war was on his mind, too, as he honored the fallen of WWII. His great grandfather fought in WWI, his grandfather was a prisoner of war in WWII, and his father was a veteran of France's war in former North African colony Algeria.\n\n\"I don't want our freedom, for our kids, our grandkids, to be hit by ... I don't want to say a madman,\" referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"So a lot of respect for these people who died and for those who are still dying,\" he said of the WWII dead and those in Ukraine.\n\nHe said the D-Day sacrifices have to be remembered. \"Lots of emotion that all these troops came to liberate a country that they didn't know for an ideology -- democracy, freedom -- that is under severe strain now.\"\n\n'WE JUST HAVE TO REMEMBER THE SACRIFICES'\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the golden sun pierced low clouds over the seas that were thick with landing craft approaching Normandy on D-Day, Becky Kraubetz peered across the English Channel toward her native Britain, her eyes filled with tears as she thought about the scene 80 years ago.\n\n\"It's so historic and we just have to remember the sacrifices of everybody who gave us our freedom,\" said Kraubetz, whose grandfather served with the British Army during World War II and was captured in Malta.\n\n\"It gives you goosebumps, everything that happened here. Imagine just jumping into the water, freezing cold,\" said the 54-year-old who now lives in Florida, as the rays of the morning sun started to warm the hundreds of people who'd waited through the night's chill for dawn's break.\n\n\"The bravery, the courage, for people to face that is just unbelievable -- very, very humbled to be here.\"\n\nTHE SUN RISES OVER NORMANDY BEACHES AS THE WORLD REMEMBERS D-DAY\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the sun sets on the D-Day generation, it's rising again over Normandy beaches where soldiers fought and died exactly 80 years ago, kicking off intense anniversary commemorations Thursday against the backdrop of renewed war in Europe, in Ukraine.\n\nEver-dwindling numbers of World War II veterans, and Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, make this anniversary particularly meaningful, mixing poignant remembrances for D-Day sacrifices with an Allied show of solidarity for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, among the guests.\n\nBut host France hasn't invited World War II ally Russia, citing its \"war of aggression against Ukraine that has intensified in recent weeks.\"\n\nHUNDREDS GATHER AT DAWN AT UTAH BEACH TO MARK D-DAY'S 80TH ANNIVERSARY\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Hundreds of people, some in WWII-era uniforms, arrived before dawn to stretch out across the now peaceful sands of Utah Beach, one of the five Allied landing zones on D-Day where troops waded into cold seas through hails of fire exactly 80 years ago.\n\n\"It's our way of paying homage, and better understanding what really happened in the 1944 landings,\" said Dimitri Picot, a 33-year-old from the nearby Normandy town of Carentan who works as a rat and pest catcher.\n\nPicot said he often dives on a wrecked ship that was hit and exploded, its wreckage visible Thursday as night gave way to day. Growing up amid the June 6, 1944, landing zones, he said he has become accustomed to seeing walls still pockmarked by bullets, shrapnel and other reminders of that fateful day.\n\nBut on the 80th anniversary \"to think that they liberated us\" hammered home the emotion, he said.", "source": {"uri": "local3news.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Local3News.com"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The assault began with Allied aircraft bombing German defenses in Normandy, followed by around 1,200 aircraft that carried airborne troops. As dawn broke, Allied forces started bombing German coastal defenses and shortly after that vessels began putting troops ashore on five codenamed beaches: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword. By the end of the day, nearly 160,000 Allied troops had landed in Normandy, although there were thousands of casualties.\n\nFew witnesses to history's biggest amphibious invasion remain alive today. Here's the latest:\n\nPRINCE WILLIAM PRAISES CANADIAN TROOPS IN NORMANDY\n\nJUNO BEACH, France -- Prince William has praised the bravery and sacrifice of Canadian troops as he addressed a D-Day anniversary ceremony on Juno Beach.\n\nThe royal was joined by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal and Canadian D-Day veterans.\n\nSome 14,000 Canadians were part of the 150,000 Allied troops who landed or parachuted into Normandy in 1944.\n\n\"Far from home they stormed these very sand dunes behind me, shoulder to shoulder with thousands of British troops,\" William said.\n\nAddressing veterans at the ceremony, the royal added: \"Thank you for our freedom, and thank you for your service.\"\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN MEETS WITH AMERICAN VETERANS\n\nCOLLEVILLE-SUR-MER, France -- U.S. President Joe Biden met with American veterans of D-Day as he marked the invasion's 80th anniversary.\n\nVeterans who could stand were helped out of wheelchairs to pose for photos with the president and first lady Jill Biden. One hugged Biden, another saluted. When Biden learned it was the birthday of one of the veterans, he led the audience in singing 'Happy Birthday.'\n\nThe first lady clutched the arm of another veteran, Robert Gibson, to help him stand next to Biden as they shook hands. \"Don't get old,\" the 100-year-old man joked to the 81-year-old president, who was a toddler when D-Day took place.\n\nSteve Spielberg and Tom Hanks, the Hollywood heavyweights behind movies and television shows about World War II, were nearby.\n\nKING CHARLES AND QUEEN CAMILLA LEAD D-DAY COMMEMORATIONS AT NEW MEMORIAL IN FRANCE\n\nVER-SUR-MER, France -- King Charles III and Queen Camilla led commemorations at the new British Normandy Memorial in Ver-sur-Mer.\n\nCamilla wiped away a tear as actor Martin Freeman read words by 99-year-old D-Day veteran Joe Mines, recalling that \"I was 19 when I landed, but I was still a boy. I don't care what people say, I wasn't a man, I was a boy. And I didn't have any idea of war and killing.\"\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak and Labour Party leader Keir Starmer took a break from campaigning for Britain's July 4 election to travel to France for the ceremony.\n\nSunak paid tribute to veterans, saying their \"actions freed a continent and built a better world.\"\n\n\"You risked everything and we owe you everything,\" he said. \"We cannot possibly hope to repay that debt but we can and we must pledge never to forget.\"\n\nWelsh singer Tom Jones, 83, sang his song \"I Won't Crumble With You If You Fall,\" before the king addressed the audience in French and English.\n\nCharles said that while the number of living veterans was dwindling, \"our obligation to remember what they stood for and what they achieved for us all can never diminish.\"\n\nSpeaking in French, Charles paid tribute to the \"unimaginable number\" of French civilians killed in the battle for Normandy, and the bravery and sacrifice of the French Resistance.\n\nMAN HONORS A GRANDFATHER HE NEVER KNEW, AN OFFICER WHO SMUGGLED HIMSELF ON A LANDING CRAFT\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Among the thousands who flocked to D-Day beach Utah was the grandson of an American colonel who smuggled himself aboard a landing craft so he could join his men in the first waves of the June 6, 1944, invasion.\n\nJohn Reistrup, 55, never met his grandfather, Eugene M. Caffey, who died in 1961. Coming back to Utah for the 80th anniversary was his way of carrying \"the torch for someone you never met that had such an impact on so many lives.\"\n\nA plaque at the beach that honors his grandfather says the colonel led the 19,500 men of the 1st Engineer Special Brigade tasked on that fateful day with the logistics of the landing on Utah, one of five invasion beaches.\n\nNot scheduled to land until 0900, Caffey, a 49-year-old father of nine, had smuggled himself, with no equipment except an empty rifle, aboard an 8th Infantry landing craft. En route he managed to load his rifle by taking up a collection of one bullet each from eight infantrymen. He arrived ashore very early in the assault, Reistrup said.\n\n\"No officers were allowed on the first waves of the landing but he said, 'Hell, no, I'm going with my guys.'\"\n\nA Nazi bunker captured on the beach then became his grandfather's office, he said. Caffey's portrait hangs there, inside, to this day.\n\nForging ahead into fire on D-Day \"has got to be the greatest courage you could ever have,\" said Reistrup, who has visited Normandy about 10 times since his first visit as a kid in 1974.\n\nTHOUSANDS OF PEOPLE DOT FRANCE'S UTAH BEACH FOR D-DAY COMMEMORATIONS\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Thousands of people, including many people in World War II-era uniforms, were stretched for several kilometers (miles) along Utah Beach ahead of commemorations marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings.\n\nUtah was one of the five landing beaches along the coast of Normandy where Allied troops landed on June 6, 2024. Utah and Omaha were taken -- at the cost of hundreds of lives -- by American forces, with the others stormed by troops from Britain and Canada, also killing many hundreds, plus others from France.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe long stretch of the Normandy coast is where the largest-ever land, sea and air armada punctured Hitler's defenses in Western Europe and helped precipitate his downfall 11 months later.\n\nA fair-like atmosphere is fueled by World War II-era jeeps and trucks tearing down hedge-rowed lanes so deadly for Allied troops who fought dug-in German defenders, and of reenactors playing at war on sands where D-Day soldiers fell.\n\nSurviving veterans, who are around 100 years old now, are the VIPs of the day's events.\n\n'FREEDOM COSTS,' DENMARK'S PRIME MINISTER SAYS AS SHE MARKS D-DAY'S 80TH ANNIVERSARY\n\nCOPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Denmark's prime minister said that this year's observances of the D-Day landings, which come as Russia is at war against Ukraine, are a reminder that there is a price for defending freedom.\n\n\"From D-Day we have learned that freedom costs,\" Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said in a statement as she headed to Normandy for ceremonies marking the 80th anniversary of the Allied landings.\n\n\"Eighty years later, Europe once again finds itself at a fateful moment. Where freedom is once again being fought for on our own continent,\" she said, \"against an aggressive and brutal enemy who will dictate country borders with brute force and leave a trail of death and destruction.\"\n\nIMAGINING THE HORROR AND CELEBRATING FREEDOM\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Because freedom is worth celebrating and passing on to children, too, Alexandra Hamon, 35, drank champagne and shared the sunrise with her boys, Karl and Neils, both 13, as the day dawned Thursday over the beaches where Allied soldiers landed on D-Day.\n\nThe family was among a crowd several thousands strong that stretched for kilometers along Utah beach -- one of the five beaches along the coast of Normandy where Allied troops landed. Utah and Omaha were taken -- at the cost of hundreds of lives -- by American forces, with the others stormed by troops from Britain and Canada, also killing many hundreds, plus others from France. The other code-named beaches are Juno, Sword and Gold.\n\nKarl sat perched on the hood of their 1943 Dodge truck, lovingly restored by her husband, Enogat, as the family from Saint Malo, a French coastal city that was badly damaged in major fighting about two months after D-Day, stared out across the English Channel.\n\nThe waters Thursday were still and peaceful -- unlike on that fateful day that helped change the course of WWII and precipitate Adolf Hitler's downfall 11 months later.\n\n\"It's indescribable, just imagining the chaos. Now it's peaceful, almost festive, we try to imagine but I think it's unimaginable,\" she said.\n\n\"You think of all those guys, everything they went through,\" she added of the fast-dwindling D-Day veterans. \"They say they aren't heroes. But they are, they are. Those guys really should never die. I imagine the boats, the guys arriving, the sounds. It must have been horrible, yes, horrible.\"\n\nKEEPING ALIVE THE MEMORY OF SOLDIERS 'WHO DIED FOR OUR FREEDOM'\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the rising sun took the night's chill off Utah Beach, Christophe Receveur, 57, from Thionville in eastern France, unfurled a Stars and Stripes he bought in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, six months ago specifically to honor the Americans who fell on D-Day.\n\n\"To keep alive the memory of the soldiers who died for our freedom,\" he said. \"To forget them is to let them die all over again.\"\n\nReceveur and his daughter, Julie, 28, carefully folded the flag into a tight triangle after their quiet, reflective homage on an empty stretch of the beach, busy with hundreds of people strung out along the sands.\n\nReceveur said the Ukraine war was on his mind, too, as he honored the fallen of WWII. His great grandfather fought in WWI, his grandfather was a prisoner of war in WWII, and his father was a veteran of France's war in former North African colony Algeria.\n\n\"I don't want our freedom, for our kids, our grandkids, to be hit by ... I don't want to say a madman,\" referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"So a lot of respect for these people who died and for those who are still dying,\" he said of the WWII dead and those in Ukraine.\n\nHe said the D-Day sacrifices have to be remembered. \"Lots of emotion that all these troops came to liberate a country that they didn't know for an ideology -- democracy, freedom -- that is under severe strain now.\"\n\n'WE JUST HAVE TO REMEMBER THE SACRIFICES'\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the golden sun pierced low clouds over the seas that were thick with landing craft approaching Normandy on D-Day, Becky Kraubetz peered across the English Channel toward her native Britain, her eyes filled with tears as she thought about the scene 80 years ago.\n\n\"It's so historic and we just have to remember the sacrifices of everybody who gave us our freedom,\" said Kraubetz, whose grandfather served with the British Army during World War II and was captured in Malta.\n\n\"It gives you goosebumps, everything that happened here. Imagine just jumping into the water, freezing cold,\" said the 54-year-old who now lives in Florida, as the rays of the morning sun started to warm the hundreds of people who'd waited through the night's chill for dawn's break.\n\n\"The bravery, the courage, for people to face that is just unbelievable -- very, very humbled to be here.\"\n\nTHE SUN RISES OVER NORMANDY BEACHES AS THE WORLD REMEMBERS D-DAY\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the sun sets on the D-Day generation, it's rising again over Normandy beaches where soldiers fought and died exactly 80 years ago, kicking off intense anniversary commemorations Thursday against the backdrop of renewed war in Europe, in Ukraine.\n\nEver-dwindling numbers of World War II veterans, and Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, make this anniversary particularly meaningful, mixing poignant remembrances for D-Day sacrifices with an Allied show of solidarity for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, among the guests.\n\nBut host France hasn't invited World War II ally Russia, citing its \"war of aggression against Ukraine that has intensified in recent weeks.\"\n\nHUNDREDS GATHER AT DAWN AT UTAH BEACH TO MARK D-DAY'S 80TH ANNIVERSARY\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Hundreds of people, some in WWII-era uniforms, arrived before dawn to stretch out across the now peaceful sands of Utah Beach, one of the five Allied landing zones on D-Day where troops waded into cold seas through hails of fire exactly 80 years ago.\n\n\"It's our way of paying homage, and better understanding what really happened in the 1944 landings,\" said Dimitri Picot, a 33-year-old from the nearby Normandy town of Carentan who works as a rat and pest catcher.\n\nPicot said he often dives on a wrecked ship that was hit and exploded, its wreckage visible Thursday as night gave way to day. Growing up amid the June 6, 1944, landing zones, he said he has become accustomed to seeing walls still pockmarked by bullets, shrapnel and other reminders of that fateful day.\n\nBut on the 80th anniversary \"to think that they liberated us\" hammered home the emotion, he said.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The assault began with Allied aircraft bombing German defenses in Normandy, followed by around 1,200 aircraft that carried airborne troops. As dawn broke, Allied forces started bombing German coastal defenses and shortly after that vessels began putting troops ashore on five codenamed beaches: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword. By the end of the day, nearly 160,000 Allied troops had landed in Normandy, although there were thousands of casualties.\n\nFew witnesses to history's biggest amphibious invasion remain alive today.\n\n-- How AP covered the D-Day landings and lost a photographer in the battle for Normandy\n\n-- A Jewish veteran from London prepares to commemorate the 80th anniversary\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nPRINCE WILLIAM PRAISES CANADIAN TROOPS IN NORMANDY\n\nJUNO BEACH, France -- Prince William has praised the bravery and sacrifice of Canadian troops as he addressed a D-Day anniversary ceremony on Juno Beach.\n\nThe royal was joined by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal and Canadian D-Day veterans.\n\nSome 14,000 Canadians were part of the 150,000 Allied troops who landed or parachuted into Normandy in 1944.\n\n\"Far from home they stormed these very sand dunes behind me, shoulder to shoulder with thousands of British troops,\" William said.\n\nAddressing veterans at the ceremony, the royal added: \"Thank you for our freedom, and thank you for your service.\"\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN MEETS WITH AMERICAN VETERANS\n\nCOLLEVILLE-SUR-MER, France -- U.S. President Joe Biden met with American veterans of D-Day as he marked the invasion's 80th anniversary.\n\nVeterans who could stand were helped out of wheelchairs to pose for photos with the president and first lady Jill Biden. One hugged Biden, another saluted. When Biden learned it was the birthday of one of the veterans, he led the audience in singing 'Happy Birthday.'\n\nThe first lady clutched the arm of another veteran, Robert Gibson, to help him stand next to Biden as they shook hands. \"Don't get old,\" the 100-year-old man joked to the 81-year-old president, who was a toddler when D-Day took place.\n\nSteve Spielberg and Tom Hanks, the Hollywood heavyweights behind movies and television shows about World War II, were nearby.\n\nKING CHARLES AND QUEEN CAMILLA LEAD D-DAY COMMEMORATIONS AT NEW MEMORIAL IN FRANCE\n\nVER-SUR-MER, France -- King Charles III and Queen Camilla led commemorations at the new British Normandy Memorial in Ver-sur-Mer.\n\nCamilla wiped away a tear as actor Martin Freeman read words by 99-year-old D-Day veteran Joe Mines, recalling that \"I was 19 when I landed, but I was still a boy. I don't care what people say, I wasn't a man, I was a boy. And I didn't have any idea of war and killing.\"\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak and Labour Party leader Keir Starmer took a break from campaigning for Britain's July 4 election to travel to France for the ceremony.\n\nSunak paid tribute to veterans, saying their \"actions freed a continent and built a better world.\"\n\n\"You risked everything and we owe you everything,\" he said. \"We cannot possibly hope to repay that debt but we can and we must pledge never to forget.\"\n\nWelsh singer Tom Jones, 83, sang his song \"I Won't Crumble With You If You Fall,\" before the king addressed the audience in French and English.\n\nCharles said that while the number of living veterans was dwindling, \"our obligation to remember what they stood for and what they achieved for us all can never diminish.\"\n\nSpeaking in French, Charles paid tribute to the \"unimaginable number\" of French civilians killed in the battle for Normandy, and the bravery and sacrifice of the French Resistance.\n\nMAN HONORS A GRANDFATHER HE NEVER KNEW, AN OFFICER WHO SMUGGLED HIMSELF ON A LANDING CRAFT\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Among the thousands who flocked to D-Day beach Utah was the grandson of an American colonel who smuggled himself aboard a landing craft so he could join his men in the first waves of the June 6, 1944, invasion.\n\nJohn Reistrup, 55, never met his grandfather, Eugene M. Caffey, who died in 1961. Coming back to Utah for the 80th anniversary was his way of carrying \"the torch for someone you never met that had such an impact on so many lives.\"\n\nA plaque at the beach that honors his grandfather says the colonel led the 19,500 men of the 1st Engineer Special Brigade tasked on that fateful day with the logistics of the landing on Utah, one of five invasion beaches.\n\nNot scheduled to land until 0900, Caffey, a 49-year-old father of nine, had smuggled himself, with no equipment except an empty rifle, aboard an 8th Infantry landing craft. En route he managed to load his rifle by taking up a collection of one bullet each from eight infantrymen. He arrived ashore very early in the assault, Reistrup said.\n\n\"No officers were allowed on the first waves of the landing but he said, 'Hell, no, I'm going with my guys.'\"\n\nA Nazi bunker captured on the beach then became his grandfather's office, he said. Caffey's portrait hangs there, inside, to this day.\n\nForging ahead into fire on D-Day \"has got to be the greatest courage you could ever have,\" said Reistrup, who has visited Normandy about 10 times since his first visit as a kid in 1974.\n\nTHOUSANDS OF PEOPLE DOT FRANCE'S UTAH BEACH FOR D-DAY COMMEMORATIONS\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Thousands of people, including many people in World War II-era uniforms, were stretched for several kilometers (miles) along Utah Beach ahead of commemorations marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings.\n\nUtah was one of the five landing beaches along the coast of Normandy where Allied troops landed on June 6, 2024. Utah and Omaha were taken -- at the cost of hundreds of lives -- by American forces, with the others stormed by troops from Britain and Canada, also killing many hundreds, plus others from France.\n\nThe long stretch of the Normandy coast is where the largest-ever land, sea and air armada punctured Hitler's defenses in Western Europe and helped precipitate his downfall 11 months later.\n\nA fair-like atmosphere is fueled by World War II-era jeeps and trucks tearing down hedge-rowed lanes so deadly for Allied troops who fought dug-in German defenders, and of reenactors playing at war on sands where D-Day soldiers fell.\n\nSurviving veterans, who are around 100 years old now, are the VIPs of the day's events.\n\n'FREEDOM COSTS,' DENMARK'S PRIME MINISTER SAYS AS SHE MARKS D-DAY'S 80TH ANNIVERSARY\n\nCOPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Denmark's prime minister said that this year's observances of the D-Day landings, which come as Russia is at war against Ukraine, are a reminder that there is a price for defending freedom.\n\n\"From D-Day we have learned that freedom costs,\" Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said in a statement as she headed to Normandy for ceremonies marking the 80th anniversary of the Allied landings.\n\n\"Eighty years later, Europe once again finds itself at a fateful moment. Where freedom is once again being fought for on our own continent,\" she said, \"against an aggressive and brutal enemy who will dictate country borders with brute force and leave a trail of death and destruction.\"\n\nIMAGINING THE HORROR AND CELEBRATING FREEDOM\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Because freedom is worth celebrating and passing on to children, too, Alexandra Hamon, 35, drank champagne and shared the sunrise with her boys, Karl and Neils, both 13, as the day dawned Thursday over the beaches where Allied soldiers landed on D-Day.\n\nThe family was among a crowd several thousands strong that stretched for kilometers along Utah beach -- one of the five beaches along the coast of Normandy where Allied troops landed. Utah and Omaha were taken -- at the cost of hundreds of lives -- by American forces, with the others stormed by troops from Britain and Canada, also killing many hundreds, plus others from France. The other code-named beaches are Juno, Sword and Gold.\n\nKarl sat perched on the hood of their 1943 Dodge truck, lovingly restored by her husband, Enogat, as the family from Saint Malo, a French coastal city that was badly damaged in major fighting about two months after D-Day, stared out across the English Channel.\n\nThe waters Thursday were still and peaceful -- unlike on that fateful day that helped change the course of WWII and precipitate Adolf Hitler's downfall 11 months later.\n\n\"It's indescribable, just imagining the chaos. Now it's peaceful, almost festive, we try to imagine but I think it's unimaginable,\" she said.\n\n\"You think of all those guys, everything they went through,\" she added of the fast-dwindling D-Day veterans. \"They say they aren't heroes. But they are, they are. Those guys really should never die. I imagine the boats, the guys arriving, the sounds. It must have been horrible, yes, horrible.\"\n\nKEEPING ALIVE THE MEMORY OF SOLDIERS 'WHO DIED FOR OUR FREEDOM'\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the rising sun took the night's chill off Utah Beach, Christophe Receveur, 57, from Thionville in eastern France, unfurled a Stars and Stripes he bought in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, six months ago specifically to honor the Americans who fell on D-Day.\n\n\"To keep alive the memory of the soldiers who died for our freedom,\" he said. \"To forget them is to let them die all over again.\"\n\nReceveur and his daughter, Julie, 28, carefully folded the flag into a tight triangle after their quiet, reflective homage on an empty stretch of the beach, busy with hundreds of people strung out along the sands.\n\nReceveur said the Ukraine war was on his mind, too, as he honored the fallen of WWII. His great grandfather fought in WWI, his grandfather was a prisoner of war in WWII, and his father was a veteran of France's war in former North African colony Algeria.\n\n\"I don't want our freedom, for our kids, our grandkids, to be hit by ... I don't want to say a madman,\" referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"So a lot of respect for these people who died and for those who are still dying,\" he said of the WWII dead and those in Ukraine.\n\nHe said the D-Day sacrifices have to be remembered. \"Lots of emotion that all these troops came to liberate a country that they didn't know for an ideology -- democracy, freedom -- that is under severe strain now.\"\n\n'WE JUST HAVE TO REMEMBER THE SACRIFICES'\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the golden sun pierced low clouds over the seas that were thick with landing craft approaching Normandy on D-Day, Becky Kraubetz peered across the English Channel toward her native Britain, her eyes filled with tears as she thought about the scene 80 years ago.\n\n\"It's so historic and we just have to remember the sacrifices of everybody who gave us our freedom,\" said Kraubetz, whose grandfather served with the British Army during World War II and was captured in Malta.\n\n\"It gives you goosebumps, everything that happened here. Imagine just jumping into the water, freezing cold,\" said the 54-year-old who now lives in Florida, as the rays of the morning sun started to warm the hundreds of people who'd waited through the night's chill for dawn's break.\n\n\"The bravery, the courage, for people to face that is just unbelievable -- very, very humbled to be here.\"\n\nTHE SUN RISES OVER NORMANDY BEACHES AS THE WORLD REMEMBERS D-DAY\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the sun sets on the D-Day generation, it's rising again over Normandy beaches where soldiers fought and died exactly 80 years ago, kicking off intense anniversary commemorations Thursday against the backdrop of renewed war in Europe, in Ukraine.\n\nEver-dwindling numbers of World War II veterans, and Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, make this anniversary particularly meaningful, mixing poignant remembrances for D-Day sacrifices with an Allied show of solidarity for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, among the guests.\n\nBut host France hasn't invited World War II ally Russia, citing its \"war of aggression against Ukraine that has intensified in recent weeks.\"\n\nHUNDREDS GATHER AT DAWN AT UTAH BEACH TO MARK D-DAY'S 80TH ANNIVERSARY\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Hundreds of people, some in WWII-era uniforms, arrived before dawn to stretch out across the now peaceful sands of Utah Beach, one of the five Allied landing zones on D-Day where troops waded into cold seas through hails of fire exactly 80 years ago.\n\n\"It's our way of paying homage, and better understanding what really happened in the 1944 landings,\" said Dimitri Picot, a 33-year-old from the nearby Normandy town of Carentan who works as a rat and pest catcher.\n\nPicot said he often dives on a wrecked ship that was hit and exploded, its wreckage visible Thursday as night gave way to day. Growing up amid the June 6, 1944, landing zones, he said he has become accustomed to seeing walls still pockmarked by bullets, shrapnel and other reminders of that fateful day.\n\nBut on the 80th anniversary \"to think that they liberated us\" hammered home the emotion, he said.", "source": {"uri": "bangordailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bangor Daily News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Imagine just jumping into the water, freezing cold,\" the 54-year-old said as she gazed across the English Channel, tears in her eyes. \"The bravery, the courage, for people to face that is just unbelievable -- very, very humbled to be here.\"\n\nShe was among a crowd of thousands of people that stretched for several kilometers (miles) along Utah Beach, the westernmost of the D-Day beaches.\n\nIn a quiet spot away from the official ceremonies, France's Christophe Receveur performed his own tribute, unfurling an American flag he had bought on a trip to Pennsylvania to honor those who died on D-Day.\n\n\"To forget them is to let them die all over again,\" the 57-year-old said as he and his daughter, Julie, then carefully refolded the flag into a tight triangle, adding that those now dying in Ukraine fighting the invading Russian army were also on his mind.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"All these troops came to liberate a country that they didn't know for an ideology -- democracy, freedom -- that is under severe strain now,\" he said.\n\nThe fair-like atmosphere fueled by World War II-era jeeps and trucks tearing down hedge-rowed lanes so deadly for Allied troops who fought dug-in German defenders, and of reenactors playing at war on sands where D-Day soldiers fell, leave open the question of what meaning anniversaries will have once the veterans are gone.\n\nBut at the 80th, they're the VIPs of commemorations across the Normandy coast where the largest-ever land, sea and air armada punctured Hitler's defenses in Western Europe and helped precipitate his downfall 11 months later.\n\n\"They really were the golden generation, those 17-, 18-year-old guys doing something so brave,\" said James Baker, a 56-year-old from the Netherlands, reflecting as dawn broke on Utah Beach.\n\nFarther up the coast on Gold Beach, a military bagpiper played at precisely the time that British troops landed there 80 years ago.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe United Kingdom's King Charles III and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak were among those at a ceremony later in the day to honor the troops who landed there and on Sword Beach, while Prince William and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau joined others at ceremony for the Canadian troops who landed on Juno Beach.\n\nIn his address, the king told the crowd that the world was fortunate that a generation \"did not flinch\" when they were called upon.\n\n\"Our obligation to remember what they stood for and what they achieved for us all can never diminish,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking in French, Charles also paid tribute to the \"unimaginable number\" of French civilians killed in the battle for Normandy, and the bravery and sacrifice of the French Resistance.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron pledged that ''France will never forget'' those who fought to liberate his country.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBiden was to take part in a ceremony later at the American cemetery overlooking Omaha Beach.\n\nThose who traveled to Normandy include women who were among the millions who built bombers, tanks and other weaponry and played other vital World War II roles that were long overshadowed by the combat exploits of men.\n\n\"We weren't doing it for honors and awards. We were doing it to save our country. And we ended up helping save the world,\" said 98-year-old Anna Mae Krier, who worked as a riveter building B-17 and B-29 bombers.\n\nFeted where ever they go in wheelchairs and walking with canes, veterans are using their voices to repeat their message they hope will live eternal: Never forget.\n\n\"To know the amount of people who were killed here, just amazing,\" 98-year-old Allan Chatwin, who served with the U.S. Navy in the Pacific, said as he visited Omaha, the deadliest of the Allied beaches on D-Day.\n\nHe quickly added: \"I don't know that amazing is the word.\"", "source":

The assault began with Allied aircraft bombing German defenses in Normandy, followed by around 1,200 aircraft that carried airborne troops. As dawn broke, Allied forces started bombing German coastal defenses and shortly after that vessels began putting troops ashore on five codenamed beaches: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword. By the end of the day, nearly 160,000 Allied troops had landed in Normandy, although there were thousands of casualties.\n\nFew witnesses to history's biggest amphibious invasion remain alive today.

Now, this WWII veteran warns against Holocaust denial ASSOCIATED PRESS PRESIDENT BIDEN MEETS WITH AMERICAN VETERANS\n\nCOLLEVILLE-SUR-MER, France -- U.S. President Joe Biden met with American veterans of D-Day as he marked the invasion's 80th anniversary.\n\nVeterans who could stand were helped out of wheelchairs to pose for photos with the president and first lady Jill Biden. One hugged Biden, another saluted. When Biden learned it was the birthday of one of the veterans, he led the audience in singing 'Happy Birthday.'\n\nThe first lady clutched the arm of another veteran, Robert Gibson, to help him stand next to Biden as they shook hands. \"Don't get old,\" the 100-year-old man joked to the 81-year-old president, who was a toddler when D-Day took place.\n\nSteve Spielberg and Tom Hanks, the Hollywood heavyweights behind movies and television shows about World War II, were nearby.\n\nKING CHARLES AND QUEEN CAMILLA LEAD D-DAY COMMEMORATIONS AT NEW MEMORIAL IN FRANCE\n\nVER-SUR-MER, France -- King Charles III and Queen Camilla led commemorations at the new British Normandy Memorial in Ver-sur-Mer.\n\nCamilla wiped away a tear as actor Martin Freeman read words by 99-year-old D-Day veteran Joe Mines, recalling that \"I was 19 when I landed, but I was still a boy. I don't care what people say, I wasn't a man, I was a boy. And I didn't have any idea of war and killing.\"\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak and Labour Party leader Keir Starmer took a break from campaigning for Britain's July 4 election to travel to France for the ceremony.\n\nSunak paid tribute to veterans, saying their \"actions freed a continent and built a better world.\"\n\n\"You risked everything and we owe you everything,\" he said. \"We cannot possibly hope to repay that debt but we can and we must pledge never to forget.\"\n\nWelsh singer Tom Jones, 83, sang his song \"I Won't Crumble With You If You Fall,\" before the king addressed the audience in French and English.\n\nCharles said that while the number of living veterans was dwindling, \"our obligation to remember what they stood for and what they achieved for us all can never diminish.\"\n\nSpeaking in French, Charles paid tribute to the \"unimaginable number\" of French civilians killed in the battle for Normandy, and the bravery and sacrifice of the French Resistance.\n\nMAN HONORS A GRANDFATHER HE NEVER KNEW, AN OFFICER WHO SMUGGLED HIMSELF ON A LANDING CRAFT\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Among the thousands who flocked to D-Day beach Utah was the grandson of an American colonel who smuggled himself aboard a landing craft so he could join his men in the first waves of the June 6, 1944, invasion.\n\nJohn Reistrup, 55, never met his grandfather, Eugene M. Caffey, who died in 1961. Coming back to Utah for the 80th anniversary was his way of carrying \"the torch for someone you never met that had such an impact on so many lives.\"\n\nA plaque at the beach that honors his grandfather says the colonel led the 19,500 men of the 1st Engineer Special Brigade tasked on that fateful day with the logistics of the landing on Utah, one of five invasion beaches.\n\nNot scheduled to land until 0900, Caffey, a 49-year-old father of nine, had smuggled himself, with no equipment except an empty rifle, aboard an 8th Infantry landing craft. En route he managed to load his rifle by taking up a collection of one bullet each from eight infantrymen. He arrived ashore very early in the assault, Reistrup said.\n\n\"No officers were allowed on the first waves of the landing but he said, 'Hell, no, I'm going with my guys.'\"\n\nA Nazi bunker captured on the beach then became his grandfather's office, he said. Caffey's portrait hangs there, inside, to this day.\n\nForging ahead into fire on D-Day \"has got to be the greatest courage you could ever have,\" said Reistrup, who has visited Normandy about 10 times since his first visit as a kid in 1974.\n\nNation & World Jewish veteran from London prepares to commemorate 80th anniversary of D-Day landings DANICA KIRKA Associated Press 4 min to read THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE DOT FRANCE'S UTAH BEACH FOR D-DAY COMMEMORATIONS\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Thousands of people, including many people in World War II-era uniforms, were stretched for several kilometers (miles) along Utah Beach ahead of commemorations marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings.\n\nUtah was one of the five landing beaches along the coast of Normandy where Allied troops landed on June 6, 2024. Utah and Omaha were taken -- at the cost of hundreds of lives -- by American forces, with the others stormed by troops from Britain and Canada, also killing many hundreds, plus others from France.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe long stretch of the Normandy coast is where the largest-ever land, sea and air armada punctured Hitler's defenses in Western Europe and helped precipitate his downfall 11 months later.\n\nA fair-like atmosphere is fueled by World War II-era jeeps and trucks tearing down hedge-rowed lanes so deadly for Allied troops who fought dug-in German defenders, and of reenactors playing at war on sands where D-Day soldiers fell.\n\nSurviving veterans, who are around 100 years old now, are the VIPs of the day's events.\n\nNation & World At 100, this vet says the 'greatest generation' moniker fits 'because we saved the world' ASSOCIATED PRESS 2 min to read 'FREEDOM COSTS,' DENMARK'S PRIME MINISTER SAYS AS SHE MARKS D-DAY'S 80TH ANNIVERSARY\n\nCOPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Denmark's prime minister said that this year's observances of the D-Day landings, which come as Russia is at war against Ukraine, are a reminder that there is a price for defending freedom.\n\n\"From D-Day we have learned that freedom costs,\" Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said in a statement as she headed to Normandy for ceremonies marking the 80th anniversary of the Allied landings.\n\n\"Eighty years later, Europe once again finds itself at a fateful moment. Where freedom is once again being fought for on our own continent,\" she said, \"against an aggressive and brutal enemy who will dictate country borders with brute force and leave a trail of death and destruction.\"\n\nIMAGINING THE HORROR AND CELEBRATING FREEDOM\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Because freedom is worth celebrating and passing on to children, too, Alexandra Hamon, 35, drank champagne and shared the sunrise with her boys, Karl and Neils, both 13, as the day dawned Thursday over the beaches where Allied soldiers landed on D-Day.\n\nThe family was among a crowd several thousands strong that stretched for kilometers along Utah beach -- one of the five beaches along the coast of Normandy where Allied troops landed. Utah and Omaha were taken -- at the cost of hundreds of lives -- by American forces, with the others stormed by troops from Britain and Canada, also killing many hundreds, plus others from France. The other code-named beaches are Juno, Sword and Gold.\n\nKarl sat perched on the hood of their 1943 Dodge truck, lovingly restored by her husband, Enogat, as the family from Saint Malo, a French coastal city that was badly damaged in major fighting about two months after D-Day, stared out across the English Channel.\n\nThe waters Thursday were still and peaceful -- unlike on that fateful day that helped change the course of WWII and precipitate Adolf Hitler's downfall 11 months later.\n\n\"It's indescribable, just imagining the chaos. Now it's peaceful, almost festive, we try to imagine but I think it's unimaginable,\" she said.\n\n\"You think of all those guys, everything they went through,\" she added of the fast-dwindling D-Day veterans. \"They say they aren't heroes. But they are, they are. Those guys really should never die. I imagine the boats, the guys arriving, the sounds. It must have been horrible, yes, horrible.\"\n\nKEEPING ALIVE THE MEMORY OF SOLDIERS 'WHO DIED FOR OUR FREEDOM'\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the rising sun took the night's chill off Utah Beach, Christophe Receveur, 57, from Thionville in eastern France, unfurled a Stars and Stripes he bought in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, six months ago specifically to honor the Americans who fell on D-Day.\n\n\"To keep alive the memory of the soldiers who died for our freedom,\" he said. \"To forget them is to let them die all over again.\"\n\nReceveur and his daughter, Julie, 28, carefully folded the flag into a tight triangle after their quiet, reflective homage on an empty stretch of the beach, busy with hundreds of people strung out along the sands.\n\nReceveur said the Ukraine war was on his mind, too, as he honored the fallen of WWII. His great grandfather fought in WWI, his grandfather was a prisoner of war in WWII, and his father was a veteran of France's war in former North African colony Algeria.\n\n\"I don't want our freedom, for our kids, our grandkids, to be hit by ... I don't want to say a madman,\" referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"So a lot of respect for these people who died and for those who are still dying,\" he said of the WWII dead and those in Ukraine.\n\nHe said the D-Day sacrifices have to be remembered. \"Lots of emotion that all these troops came to liberate a country that they didn't know for an ideology -- democracy, freedom -- that is under severe strain now.\"\n\n'WE JUST HAVE TO REMEMBER THE SACRIFICES'\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the golden sun pierced low clouds over the seas that were thick with landing craft approaching Normandy on D-Day, Becky Kraubetz peered across the English Channel toward her native Britain, her eyes filled with tears as she thought about the scene 80 years ago.\n\n\"It's so historic and we just have to remember the sacrifices of everybody who gave us our freedom,\" said Kraubetz, whose grandfather served with the British Army during World War II and was captured in Malta.\n\n\"It gives you goosebumps, everything that happened here. Imagine just jumping into the water, freezing cold,\" said the 54-year-old who now lives in Florida, as the rays of the morning sun started to warm the hundreds of people who'd waited through the night's chill for dawn's break.\n\n\"The bravery, the courage, for people to face that is just unbelievable -- very, very humbled to be here.\"\n\nTHE SUN RISES OVER NORMANDY BEACHES AS THE WORLD REMEMBERS D-DAY\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the sun sets on the D-Day generation, it's rising again over Normandy beaches where soldiers fought and died exactly 80 years ago, kicking off intense anniversary commemorations Thursday against the backdrop of renewed war in Europe, in Ukraine.\n\nEver-dwindling numbers of World War II veterans, and Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, make this anniversary particularly meaningful, mixing poignant remembrances for D-Day sacrifices with an Allied show of solidarity for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, among the guests.\n\nBut host France hasn't invited World War II ally Russia, citing its \"war of aggression against Ukraine that has intensified in recent weeks.\"\n\nHUNDREDS GATHER AT DAWN AT UTAH BEACH TO MARK D-DAY'S 80TH ANNIVERSARY\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Hundreds of people, some in WWII-era uniforms, arrived before dawn to stretch out across the now peaceful sands of Utah Beach, one of the five Allied landing zones on D-Day where troops waded into cold seas through hails of fire exactly 80 years ago.\n\n\"It's our way of paying homage, and better understanding what really happened in the 1944 landings,\" said Dimitri Picot, a 33-year-old from the nearby Normandy town of Carentan who works as a rat and pest catcher.\n\nPicot said he often dives on a wrecked ship that was hit and exploded, its wreckage visible Thursday as night gave way to day. Growing up amid the June 6, 1944, landing zones, he said he has become accustomed to seeing walls still pockmarked by bullets, shrapnel and other reminders of that fateful day.\n\nBut on the 80th anniversary \"to think that they liberated us\" hammered home the emotion, he said.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The assault began with Allied aircraft bombing German defenses in Normandy, followed by around 1,200 aircraft that carried airborne troops. As dawn broke, Allied forces started bombing German coastal defenses and shortly after that vessels began putting troops ashore on five codenamed beaches: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword. By the end of the day, nearly 160,000 Allied troops had landed in Normandy, although there were thousands of casualties.\n\nFew witnesses to history's biggest amphibious invasion remain alive today.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- Hour by hour: A brief timeline of the Allies' invasion of occupied France\n\n-- With time short, veterans seize the chance to keep their D-Day memories alive for others\n\n-- Women were barred from combat. But they helped D-Day succeed in other ways\n\n-- How AP covered the D-Day landings and lost a photographer in the battle for Normandy\n\n-- A Jewish veteran from London prepares to commemorate the 80th anniversary\n\nHere's the latest:\n\n103-YEAR-OLD FEMALE VETERAN GIVEN LEGION OF HONOR AWARD\n\nVERS-SUR-MER, France -- French President Emmanuel Macron bestowed a Legion of Honor award on a 103-year-old female British veteran officer who created detailed maps that guided the crews of landing craft on D-Day.\n\nChristian Lamb sat in a wheelchair as Macron bent down to pin the medal on her and kissed her on both cheeks.\n\nHe told her she was one of the \"heroes in the shadows\" as he described how she was studying in Normandy in 1939 when her father, a Royal Navy admiral, called her back to London on the eve of World War II.\n\nIn a recent interview with The Associated Press, Lamb recalled creating maps that \"showed railways, roads, churches, castles, every possible feature that could be visible to an incoming invader and from every angle,\" Lamb.\n\n\"It was intense and exciting work, and obviously detail was vital. It was crucial that the maps were 100% accurate,\" she said.\n\nPRINCE WILLIAM PRAISES CANADIAN TROOPS IN NORMANDY\n\nJUNO BEACH, France -- Prince William has praised the bravery and sacrifice of Canadian troops as he addressed a D-Day anniversary ceremony on Juno Beach.\n\nThe royal was joined by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal and Canadian D-Day veterans.\n\nSome 14,000 Canadians were part of the 150,000 Allied troops who landed or parachuted into Normandy in 1944.\n\n\"Far from home they stormed these very sand dunes behind me, shoulder to shoulder with thousands of British troops,\" William said.\n\nAddressing veterans at the ceremony, the royal added: \"Thank you for our freedom, and thank you for your service.\"\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN MEETS WITH AMERICAN VETERANS\n\nCOLLEVILLE-SUR-MER, France -- U.S. President Joe Biden met with American veterans of D-Day as he marked the invasion's 80th anniversary.\n\nVeterans who could stand were helped out of wheelchairs to pose for photos with the president and first lady Jill Biden. One hugged Biden, another saluted. When Biden learned it was the birthday of one of the veterans, he led the audience in singing 'Happy Birthday.'\n\nThe first lady clutched the arm of another veteran, Robert Gibson, to help him stand next to Biden as they shook hands. \"Don't get old,\" the 100-year-old man joked to the 81-year-old president, who was a toddler when D-Day took place.\n\nSteve Spielberg and Tom Hanks, the Hollywood heavyweights behind movies and television shows about World War II, were nearby.\n\nKING CHARLES AND QUEEN CAMILLA LEAD D-DAY COMMEMORATIONS AT NEW MEMORIAL IN FRANCE\n\nVER-SUR-MER, France -- King Charles III and Queen Camilla led commemorations at the new British Normandy Memorial in Ver-sur-Mer.\n\nCamilla wiped away a tear as actor Martin Freeman read words by 99-year-old D-Day veteran Joe Mines, recalling that \"I was 19 when I landed, but I was still a boy. I don't care what people say, I wasn't a man, I was a boy. And I didn't have any idea of war and killing.\"\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak and Labour Party leader Keir Starmer took a break from campaigning for Britain's July 4 election to travel to France for the ceremony.\n\nSunak paid tribute to veterans, saying their \"actions freed a continent and built a better world.\"\n\n\"You risked everything and we owe you everything,\" he said. \"We cannot possibly hope to repay that debt but we can and we must pledge never to forget.\"\n\nWelsh singer Tom Jones, 83, sang his song \"I Won't Crumble With You If You Fall,\" before the king addressed the audience in French and English.\n\nCharles said that while the number of living veterans was dwindling, \"our obligation to remember what they stood for and what they achieved for us all can never diminish.\"\n\nSpeaking in French, Charles paid tribute to the \"unimaginable number\" of French civilians killed in the battle for Normandy, and the bravery and sacrifice of the French Resistance.\n\nMAN HONORS A GRANDFATHER HE NEVER KNEW, AN OFFICER WHO SMUGGLED HIMSELF ON A LANDING CRAFT\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Among the thousands who flocked to D-Day beach Utah was the grandson of an American colonel who smuggled himself aboard a landing craft so he could join his men in the first waves of the June 6, 1944, invasion.\n\nJohn Reistrup, 55, never met his grandfather, Eugene M. Caffey, who died in 1961. Coming back to Utah for the 80th anniversary was his way of carrying \"the torch for someone you never met that had such an impact on so many lives.\"\n\nA plaque at the beach that honors his grandfather says the colonel led the 19,500 men of the 1st Engineer Special Brigade tasked on that fateful day with the logistics of the landing on Utah, one of five invasion beaches.\n\nNot scheduled to land until 0900, Caffey, a 49-year-old father of nine, had smuggled himself, with no equipment except an empty rifle, aboard an 8th Infantry landing craft. En route he managed to load his rifle by taking up a collection of one bullet each from eight infantrymen. He arrived ashore very early in the assault, Reistrup said.\n\n\"No officers were allowed on the first waves of the landing but he said, 'Hell, no, I'm going with my guys.'\"\n\nA Nazi bunker captured on the beach then became his grandfather's office, he said. Caffey's portrait hangs there, inside, to this day.\n\nForging ahead into fire on D-Day \"has got to be the greatest courage you could ever have,\" said Reistrup, who has visited Normandy about 10 times since his first visit as a kid in 1974.\n\nTHOUSANDS OF PEOPLE DOT FRANCE'S UTAH BEACH FOR D-DAY COMMEMORATIONS\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Thousands of people, including many people in World War II-era uniforms, were stretched for several kilometers (miles) along Utah Beach ahead of commemorations marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings.\n\nUtah was one of the five landing beaches along the coast of Normandy where Allied troops landed on June 6, 2024. Utah and Omaha were taken -- at the cost of hundreds of lives -- by American forces, with the others stormed by troops from Britain and Canada, also killing many hundreds, plus others from France.\n\nThe long stretch of the Normandy coast is where the largest-ever land, sea and air armada punctured Hitler's defenses in Western Europe and helped precipitate his downfall 11 months later.\n\nA fair-like atmosphere is fueled by World War II-era jeeps and trucks tearing down hedge-rowed lanes so deadly for Allied troops who fought dug-in German defenders, and of reenactors playing at war on sands where D-Day soldiers fell.\n\nSurviving veterans, who are around 100 years old now, are the VIPs of the day's events.\n\n'FREEDOM COSTS,' DENMARK'S PRIME MINISTER SAYS AS SHE MARKS D-DAY'S 80TH ANNIVERSARY\n\nCOPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Denmark's prime minister said that this year's observances of the D-Day landings, which come as Russia is at war against Ukraine, are a reminder that there is a price for defending freedom.\n\n\"From D-Day we have learned that freedom costs,\" Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said in a statement as she headed to Normandy for ceremonies marking the 80th anniversary of the Allied landings.\n\n\"Eighty years later, Europe once again finds itself at a fateful moment. Where freedom is once again being fought for on our own continent,\" she said, \"against an aggressive and brutal enemy who will dictate country borders with brute force and leave a trail of death and destruction.\"\n\nIMAGINING THE HORROR AND CELEBRATING FREEDOM\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Because freedom is worth celebrating and passing on to children, too, Alexandra Hamon, 35, drank champagne and shared the sunrise with her boys, Karl and Neils, both 13, as the day dawned Thursday over the beaches where Allied soldiers landed on D-Day.\n\nThe family was among a crowd several thousands strong that stretched for kilometers along Utah beach -- one of the five beaches along the coast of Normandy where Allied troops landed. Utah and Omaha were taken -- at the cost of hundreds of lives -- by American forces, with the others stormed by troops from Britain and Canada, also killing many hundreds, plus others from France. The other code-named beaches are Juno, Sword and Gold.\n\nKarl sat perched on the hood of their 1943 Dodge truck, lovingly restored by her husband, Enogat, as the family from Saint Malo, a French coastal city that was badly damaged in major fighting about two months after D-Day, stared out across the English Channel.\n\nThe waters Thursday were still and peaceful -- unlike on that fateful day that helped change the course of WWII and precipitate Adolf Hitler's downfall 11 months later.\n\n\"It's indescribable, just imagining the chaos. Now it's peaceful, almost festive, we try to imagine but I think it's unimaginable,\" she said.\n\n\"You think of all those guys, everything they went through,\" she added of the fast-dwindling D-Day veterans. \"They say they aren't heroes. But they are, they are. Those guys really should never die. I imagine the boats, the guys arriving, the sounds. It must have been horrible, yes, horrible.\"\n\nKEEPING ALIVE THE MEMORY OF SOLDIERS 'WHO DIED FOR OUR FREEDOM'\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the rising sun took the night's chill off Utah Beach, Christophe Receveur, 57, from Thionville in eastern France, unfurled a Stars and Stripes he bought in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, six months ago specifically to honor the Americans who fell on D-Day.\n\n\"To keep alive the memory of the soldiers who died for our freedom,\" he said. \"To forget them is to let them die all over again.\"\n\nReceveur and his daughter, Julie, 28, carefully folded the flag into a tight triangle after their quiet, reflective homage on an empty stretch of the beach, busy with hundreds of people strung out along the sands.\n\nReceveur said the Ukraine war was on his mind, too, as he honored the fallen of WWII. His great grandfather fought in WWI, his grandfather was a prisoner of war in WWII, and his father was a veteran of France's war in former North African colony Algeria.\n\n\"I don't want our freedom, for our kids, our grandkids, to be hit by ... I don't want to say a madman,\" referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"So a lot of respect for these people who died and for those who are still dying,\" he said of the WWII dead and those in Ukraine.\n\nHe said the D-Day sacrifices have to be remembered. \"Lots of emotion that all these troops came to liberate a country that they didn't know for an ideology -- democracy, freedom -- that is under severe strain now.\"\n\n'WE JUST HAVE TO REMEMBER THE SACRIFICES'\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the golden sun pierced low clouds over the seas that were thick with landing craft approaching Normandy on D-Day, Becky Kraubetz peered across the English Channel toward her native Britain, her eyes filled with tears as she thought about the scene 80 years ago.\n\n\"It's so historic and we just have to remember the sacrifices of everybody who gave us our freedom,\" said Kraubetz, whose grandfather served with the British Army during World War II and was captured in Malta.\n\n\"It gives you goosebumps, everything that happened here. Imagine just jumping into the water, freezing cold,\" said the 54-year-old who now lives in Florida, as the rays of the morning sun started to warm the hundreds of people who'd waited through the night's chill for dawn's break.\n\n\"The bravery, the courage, for people to face that is just unbelievable -- very, very humbled to be here.\"\n\nTHE SUN RISES OVER NORMANDY BEACHES AS THE WORLD REMEMBERS D-DAY\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the sun sets on the D-Day generation, it's rising again over Normandy beaches where soldiers fought and died exactly 80 years ago, kicking off intense anniversary commemorations Thursday against the backdrop of renewed war in Europe, in Ukraine.\n\nEver-dwindling numbers of World War II veterans, and Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, make this anniversary particularly meaningful, mixing poignant remembrances for D-Day sacrifices with an Allied show of solidarity for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, among the guests.\n\nBut host France hasn't invited World War II ally Russia, citing its \"war of aggression against Ukraine that has intensified in recent weeks.\"\n\nHUNDREDS GATHER AT DAWN AT UTAH BEACH TO MARK D-DAY'S 80TH ANNIVERSARY\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Hundreds of people, some in WWII-era uniforms, arrived before dawn to stretch out across the now peaceful sands of Utah Beach, one of the five Allied landing zones on D-Day where troops waded into cold seas through hails of fire exactly 80 years ago.\n\n\"It's our way of paying homage, and better understanding what really happened in the 1944 landings,\" said Dimitri Picot, a 33-year-old from the nearby Normandy town of Carentan who works as a rat and pest catcher.\n\nPicot said he often dives on a wrecked ship that was hit and exploded, its wreckage visible Thursday as night gave way to day. Growing up amid the June 6, 1944, landing zones, he said he has become accustomed to seeing walls still pockmarked by bullets, shrapnel and other reminders of that fateful day.\n\nBut on the 80th anniversary \"to think that they liberated us\" hammered home the emotion, he said.", "source": {"uri": "kimt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KIMT-TV 3 Mason City"}, "authors": [{"uri":

One hugged Biden, another saluted. When Biden learned it was the birthday of one of the veterans, he led the audience in singing 'Happy Birthday.'\n\nThe first lady clutched the arm of another veteran, Robert Gibson, to help him stand next to Biden as they shook hands. \"Don't get old,\" the 100-year-old man joked to the 81-year-old president, who was a toddler when D-Day took place.\n\nSteve Spielberg and Tom Hanks, the Hollywood heavyweights behind movies and television shows about World War II, were nearby.\n\nKING CHARLES AND QUEEN CAMILLA LEAD D-DAY COMMEMORATIONS AT NEW MEMORIAL IN FRANCE\n\nVER-SUR-MER, France -- King Charles III and Queen Camilla led commemorations at the new British Normandy Memorial in Ver-sur-Mer.\n\nCamilla wiped away a tear as actor Martin Freeman read words by 99-year-old D-Day veteran Joe Mines, recalling that \"I was 19 when I landed, but I was still a boy. I don't care what people say, I wasn't a man, I was a boy. And I didn't have any idea of war and killing.\"\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak and Labour Party leader Keir Starmer took a break from campaigning for Britain's July 4 election to travel to France for the ceremony.\n\nSunak paid tribute to veterans, saying their \"actions freed a continent and built a better world.\"\n\n\"You risked everything and we owe you everything,\" he said. \"We cannot possibly hope to repay that debt but we can and we must pledge never to forget.\"\n\nWelsh singer Tom Jones, 83, sang his song \"I Won't Crumble With You If You Fall,\" before the king addressed the audience in French and English.\n\nCharles said that while the number of living veterans was dwindling, \"our obligation to remember what they stood for and what they achieved for us all can never diminish.\"\n\nSpeaking in French, Charles paid tribute to the \"unimaginable number\" of French civilians killed in the battle for Normandy, and the bravery and sacrifice of the French Resistance.\n\nMAN HONORS A GRANDFATHER HE NEVER KNEW, AN OFFICER WHO SMUGGLED HIMSELF ON A LANDING CRAFT\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Among the thousands who flocked to D-Day beach Utah was the grandson of an American colonel who smuggled himself aboard a landing craft so he could join his men in the first waves of the June 6, 1944, invasion.\n\nJohn Reistrup, 55, never met his grandfather, Eugene M. Caffey, who died in 1961. Coming back to Utah for the 80th anniversary was his way of carrying \"the torch for someone you never met that had such an impact on so many lives.\"\n\nA plaque at the beach that honors his grandfather says the colonel led the 19,500 men of the 1st Engineer Special Brigade tasked on that fateful day with the logistics of the landing on Utah, one of five invasion beaches.\n\nNot scheduled to land until 0900, Caffey, a 49-year-old father of nine, had smuggled himself, with no equipment except an empty rifle, aboard an 8th Infantry landing craft. En route he managed to load his rifle by taking up a collection of one bullet each from eight infantrymen. He arrived ashore very early in the assault, Reistrup said.\n\n\"No officers were allowed on the first waves of the landing but he said, 'Hell, no, I'm going with my guys.'\"\n\nA Nazi bunker captured on the beach then became his grandfather's office, he said. Caffey's portrait hangs there, inside, to this day.\n\nForging ahead into fire on D-Day \"has got to be the greatest courage you could ever have,\" said Reistrup, who has visited Normandy about 10 times since his first visit as a kid in 1974.\n\nTHOUSANDS OF PEOPLE DOT FRANCE'S UTAH BEACH FOR D-DAY COMMEMORATIONS\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Thousands of people, including many people in World War II-era uniforms, were stretched for several kilometers (miles) along Utah Beach ahead of commemorations marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings.\n\nUtah was one of the five landing beaches along the coast of Normandy where Allied troops landed on June 6, 2024. Utah and Omaha were taken -- at the cost of hundreds of lives -- by American forces, with the others stormed by troops from Britain and Canada, also killing many hundreds, plus others from France.\n\nThe long stretch of the Normandy coast is where the largest-ever land, sea and air armada punctured Hitler's defenses in Western Europe and helped precipitate his downfall 11 months later.\n\nA fair-like atmosphere is fueled by World War II-era jeeps and trucks tearing down hedge-rowed lanes so deadly for Allied troops who fought dug-in German defenders, and of reenactors playing at war on sands where D-Day soldiers fell.\n\nSurviving veterans, who are around 100 years old now, are the VIPs of the day's events.\n\n'FREEDOM COSTS,' DENMARK'S PRIME MINISTER SAYS AS SHE MARKS D-DAY'S 80TH ANNIVERSARY\n\nCOPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Denmark's prime minister said that this year's observances of the D-Day landings, which come as Russia is at war against Ukraine, are a reminder that there is a price for defending freedom.\n\n\"From D-Day we have learned that freedom costs,\" Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said in a statement as she headed to Normandy for ceremonies marking the 80th anniversary of the Allied landings.\n\n\"Eighty years later, Europe once again finds itself at a fateful moment. Where freedom is once again being fought for on our own continent,\" she said, \"against an aggressive and brutal enemy who will dictate country borders with brute force and leave a trail of death and destruction.\"\n\nIMAGINING THE HORROR AND CELEBRATING FREEDOM\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Because freedom is worth celebrating and passing on to children, too, Alexandra Hamon, 35, drank champagne and shared the sunrise with her boys, Karl and Neils, both 13, as the day dawned Thursday over the beaches where Allied soldiers landed on D-Day.\n\nThe family was among a crowd several thousands strong that stretched for kilometers along Utah beach -- one of the five beaches along the coast of Normandy where Allied troops landed. Utah and Omaha were taken -- at the cost of hundreds of lives -- by American forces, with the others stormed by troops from Britain and Canada, also killing many hundreds, plus others from France. The other code-named beaches are Juno, Sword and Gold.\n\nKarl sat perched on the hood of their 1943 Dodge truck, lovingly restored by her husband, Enogat, as the family from Saint Malo, a French coastal city that was badly damaged in major fighting about two months after D-Day, stared out across the English Channel.\n\nThe waters Thursday were still and peaceful -- unlike on that fateful day that helped change the course of WWII and precipitate Adolf Hitler's downfall 11 months later.\n\n\"It's indescribable, just imagining the chaos. Now it's peaceful, almost festive, we try to imagine but I think it's unimaginable,\" she said.\n\n\"You think of all those guys, everything they went through,\" she added of the fast-dwindling D-Day veterans. \"They say they aren't heroes. But they are, they are. Those guys really should never die. I imagine the boats, the guys arriving, the sounds. It must have been horrible, yes, horrible.\"\n\nKEEPING ALIVE THE MEMORY OF SOLDIERS 'WHO DIED FOR OUR FREEDOM'\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the rising sun took the night's chill off Utah Beach, Christophe Receveur, 57, from Thionville in eastern France, unfurled a Stars and Stripes he bought in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, six months ago specifically to honor the Americans who fell on D-Day.\n\n\"To keep alive the memory of the soldiers who died for our freedom,\" he said. \"To forget them is to let them die all over again.\"\n\nReceveur and his daughter, Julie, 28, carefully folded the flag into a tight triangle after their quiet, reflective homage on an empty stretch of the beach, busy with hundreds of people strung out along the sands.\n\nReceveur said the Ukraine war was on his mind, too, as he honored the fallen of WWII. His great grandfather fought in WWI, his grandfather was a prisoner of war in WWII, and his father was a veteran of France's war in former North African colony Algeria.\n\n\"I don't want our freedom, for our kids, our grandkids, to be hit by ... I don't want to say a madman,\" referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"So a lot of respect for these people who died and for those who are still dying,\" he said of the WWII dead and those in Ukraine.\n\nHe said the D-Day sacrifices have to be remembered. \"Lots of emotion that all these troops came to liberate a country that they didn't know for an ideology -- democracy, freedom -- that is under severe strain now.\"\n\n'WE JUST HAVE TO REMEMBER THE SACRIFICES'\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the golden sun pierced low clouds over the seas that were thick with landing craft approaching Normandy on D-Day, Becky Kraubetz peered across the English Channel toward her native Britain, her eyes filled with tears as she thought about the scene 80 years ago.\n\n\"It's so historic and we just have to remember the sacrifices of everybody who gave us our freedom,\" said Kraubetz, whose grandfather served with the British Army during World War II and was captured in Malta.\n\n\"It gives you goosebumps, everything that happened here. Imagine just jumping into the water, freezing cold,\" said the 54-year-old who now lives in Florida, as the rays of the morning sun started to warm the hundreds of people who'd waited through the night's chill for dawn's break.\n\n\"The bravery, the courage, for people to face that is just unbelievable -- very, very humbled to be here.\"\n\nTHE SUN RISES OVER NORMANDY BEACHES AS THE WORLD REMEMBERS D-DAY\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the sun sets on the D-Day generation, it's rising again over Normandy beaches where soldiers fought and died exactly 80 years ago, kicking off intense anniversary commemorations Thursday against the backdrop of renewed war in Europe, in Ukraine.\n\nEver-dwindling numbers of World War II veterans, and Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, make this anniversary particularly meaningful, mixing poignant remembrances for D-Day sacrifices with an Allied show of solidarity for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, among the guests.\n\nBut host France hasn't invited World War II ally Russia, citing its \"war of aggression against Ukraine that has intensified in recent weeks.\"\n\nHUNDREDS GATHER AT DAWN AT UTAH BEACH TO MARK D-DAY'S 80TH ANNIVERSARY\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Hundreds of people, some in WWII-era uniforms, arrived before dawn to stretch out across the now peaceful sands of Utah Beach, one of the five Allied landing zones on D-Day where troops waded into cold seas through hails of fire exactly 80 years ago.\n\n\"It's our way of paying homage, and better understanding what really happened in the 1944 landings,\" said Dimitri Picot, a 33-year-old from the nearby Normandy town of Carentan who works as a rat and pest catcher.\n\nPicot said he often dives on a wrecked ship that was hit and exploded, its wreckage visible Thursday as night gave way to day. Growing up amid the June 6, 1944, landing zones, he said he has become accustomed to seeing walls still pockmarked by bullets, shrapnel and other reminders of that fateful day.\n\nBut on the 80th anniversary \"to think that they liberated us\" hammered home the emotion, he said.", "source": {"uri": "kurv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "710 KURV - The Valley's News/Talk Station"},

On Thursday, a dwindling number of World War II veterans in a parade of wheelchairs joined a new generation of leaders to honor the dead, the living and the fight for democracy in moving commemorations on and around those same beaches where they landed exactly 80 years ago on D-Day.\n\nThe war in Ukraine shadowed the ceremonies, a grim modern-day example of lives and cities that are again suffering through war in Europe.\n\nThe break of dawn eight decades after Allied troops landed on five code-named beaches -- Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword -- started the day of remembrance by Allied nations now standing together again behind Ukraine.\n\nWorld War II ally Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, wasn't invited, and U.S. President Joe Biden directly linked Ukraine's fight for its young democracy to the battle to defeat Nazi Germany.\n\n\"To surrender to bullies, to bow down to dictators is simply unthinkable,\" Biden said. \"If we were to do that, it means we'd be forgetting what happened here on these hallowed beaches.\"\n\nWith the dead and wounded on both sides in Ukraine estimated in the hundreds of thousands, commemorations for the more than 4,400 Allied dead on D-Day and many tens of thousands more, including French civilians, killed in the ensuing Battle of Normandy are tinged with concerns that World War II lessons are being lost.\n\n\"There are things worth fighting for,\" said Walter Stitt, who fought in tanks and turns 100 in July, as he visited Omaha Beach this week. \"Although I wish there was another way to do it than to try to kill each other.\"\n\n\"We'll learn one of these days, but I won't be around for that,\" he said.\n\nAs now-centenarian veterans revisited old memories and fallen comrades buried in Normandy graves, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's presence at the international D-Day commemoration was met with loud applause, fusing World War II's awful past with the fraught present. More applause followed when a giant screen showed the Ukrainian leader speaking with U.S. veterans.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron awarded the Legion of Honor to 11 U.S. veterans and a British female veteran. Among the Americans was Edward Berthold, a pilot who carried out his three missions over France in May 1944, before taking part in an operation in Saint-Lo, in Normandy, on D-Day. He flew 35 combat missions in all during World War II.\n\n\"You came here because the free world needed each and every one of you, and you answered the call,\" Macron said. \"You came here to make France a free nation. You're back here today at home, if I may say.\"\n\nMacron also bestowed the Legion of Honor on 103-year-old Christian Lamb, the daughter of a Royal Navy admiral who was studying in Normandy in 1939 when her father called her back to London. There, Lamb created detailed maps that guided the crews of landing craft on D-Day.\n\nThe French president bent down to Lamb in a wheelchair, pin the medal and kiss her on both cheeks, describing her as one of the \"heroes in the shadows.\"\n\nConscious of the inevitability of age and time for World War II veterans, huge throngs of aficionados in uniforms and riding vehicles of the time, and tourists soaking up the spectacle, flooded Normandy for the 80th anniversary. At the international ceremony later, the veterans received a standing ovation as they were paraded before the stands in a stately line of wheelchairs to avoid the long walk across the beachfront promenade.\n\n\"We just have to remember the sacrifices of everybody who gave us our freedom,\" said Becky Kraubetz, a Briton now living in Florida whose grandfather served with the British Army during World War II and was captured in Malta. She was among a crowd of thousands of people that stretched for several kilometers (miles) along Utah Beach, the westernmost of the D-Day beaches.\n\nIn a quiet spot away from the official ceremonies, France's Christophe Receveur performed his own tribute, unfurling an American flag he had bought on a trip to Pennsylvania to honor those who died on D-Day.\n\n\"To forget them is to let them die all over again,\" the 57-year-old said as he and his daughter, Julie, then carefully refolded the flag into a tight triangle, adding that those now dying in Ukraine fighting the invading Russian army were also on his mind.\n\nToday's Top Headlines New hotel, restaurant could be coming to downtown Aiken Two Wendy's restaurants in Aiken under new ownership Williston man dies, another man injured in wreck near Montmorenci 'Ridge' recognized: Palmetto Golf Club's 7th hole named one of America's best Investigation underway after FCI Edgefield inmate dies Karen Jones becomes Burnettown's first female mayor 21-year-old male identified as victim in deadly Barnwell County collision Dunkin' on Whiskey Road celebrates grand reopening with ribbon-cutting Investigation underway after FCI Edgefield inmate dies Area students receive scholarships from SRP\n\n\"All these troops came to liberate a country that they didn't know for an ideology -- democracy, freedom -- that is under severe strain now,\" he said.\n\nFor Warren Goss, a 99-year-old American veteran of D-Day who landed in the first waves on Utah Beach, a visit years later to the same place where he watched a comrade fall to incoming fire confirmed that the sacrifice was worthy.\n\n\"I looked at the beach and it was beautiful, all the people, the kids were playing and I see the boys and girls were walking, holding hands, with their life back,\" he told the Danish king and prime minister, who hung on his every word.\n\nThe fair-like atmosphere fueled by World War II-era jeeps and trucks tearing down hedge-rowed lanes so deadly for Allied troops who fought dug-in German defenders, and of reenactors playing at war on sands where D-Day soldiers fell, leave open the question of what meaning anniversaries will have once the veterans are gone.\n\nBut at the 80th, they're the VIPs of commemorations across the Normandy coast where the largest-ever land, sea and air armada punctured Hitler's defenses in Western Europe and helped precipitate his downfall 11 months later.\n\n\"They really were the golden generation, those 17-, 18-year-old guys doing something so brave,\" said James Baker, a 56-year-old from the Netherlands, reflecting on Utah Beach.\n\nFarther up the coast on Gold Beach, a military bagpiper played at precisely the time that British troops landed there 80 years ago.\n\nThe United Kingdom's King Charles III and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak were among those at a ceremony to honor the troops who landed there and on Sword Beach, while Prince William and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau joined others at ceremony for the Canadian troops at Juno Beach.\n\nIn his address, the king told the crowd that the world was fortunate that a generation \"did not flinch\" when they were called upon.\n\n\"Our obligation to remember what they stood for and what they achieved for us all can never diminish,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking in French, Charles also paid tribute to the \"unimaginable number\" of French civilians killed in the battle for Normandy, and the bravery and sacrifice of the French Resistance.\n\nThose who traveled to Normandy include women who were among the millions who built bombers, tanks and other weaponry and played other vital World War II roles that were long overshadowed by the combat exploits of men.\n\nFeted everywhere they go in wheelchairs and walking with canes, veterans are using their voices to repeat their message they hope will live eternal: Never forget.\n\n\"We weren't doing it for honors and awards. We were doing it to save our country,\" said 98-year-old Anna Mae Krier, who worked as a riveter building B-17 and B-29 bombers. \"We ended up helping save the world.\"\n\nJill Lawless in London, and

The assault began with Allied aircraft bombing German defenses in Normandy, followed by around 1,200 aircraft that carried airborne troops. As dawn broke, Allied forces started bombing German coastal defenses and shortly after that vessels began putting troops ashore on five codenamed beaches: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword. By the end of the day, nearly 160,000 Allied troops had landed in Normandy, although there were thousands of casualties.\n\nFew witnesses to history's biggest amphibious invasion remain alive today.\n\n-- How AP covered the D-Day landings and lost a photographer in the battle for Normandy\n\n-- A Jewish veteran from London prepares to commemorate the 80th anniversary\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nKEEPING ALIVE THE MEMORY OF SOLDIERS 'WHO DIED FOR OUR FREEDOM'\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the rising sun took the night's chill off Utah Beach, Christophe Receveur, 57, from Thionville in eastern France, unfurled a Stars and Stripes he bought in Gettysburg, PA, six months ago specifically to honor the Americans who fell on D-Day.\n\n\"To keep alive the memory of the soldiers who died for our freedom,\" he said. \"To forget them is to let them die all over again.\"\n\nReceveur and his daughter, Julie, 28, carefully folded the flag into a tight triangle after their quiet, reflective homage on an empty stretch of the beach, busy with hundreds of people strung out along the sands.\n\nReceveur said the Ukraine war was on his mind, too, as he honored the fallen of WWII. His great grandfather fought in WWI, his grandfather was a prisoner of war in WWII, and his father was a veteran of France's war in former North African colony Algeria.\n\n\"I don't want our freedom, for our kids, our grandkids, to be hit by ... I don't want to say a madman,\" referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"So a lot of respect for these people who died and for those who are still dying,\" he said of the WWII dead and those in Ukraine.\n\nHe said the D-Day sacrifices have to be remembered. \"Lots of emotion that all these troops came to liberate a country that they didn't know for an ideology -- democracy, freedom -- that is under severe strain now.\"\n\n'WE JUST HAVE TO REMEMBER THE SACRIFICES'\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the golden sun pierced low clouds over the seas that were thick with landing craft approaching Normandy on D-Day, Becky Kraubetz peered across the English Channel toward her native Britain, her eyes filled with tears as she thought about the scene 80 years ago.\n\n\"It's so historic and we just have to remember the sacrifices of everybody who gave us our freedom,\" said Kraubetz, whose grandfather served with the British Army during World War II and was captured in Malta.\n\n\"It gives you goosebumps, everything that happened here. Imagine just jumping into the water, freezing cold,\" said the 54-year-old who now lives in Florida, as the rays of the morning sun started to warm the hundreds of people who'd waited through the night's chill for dawn's break.\n\n\"The bravery, the courage, for people to face that is just unbelievable -- very, very humbled to be here.\"\n\nTHE SUN RISES OVER NORMANDY BEACHES AS THE WORLD REMEMBERS D-DAY\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the sun sets on the D-Day generation, it's rising again over Normandy beaches where soldiers fought and died exactly 80 years ago, kicking off intense anniversary commemorations Thursday against the backdrop of renewed war in Europe, in Ukraine.\n\nEver-dwindling numbers of World War II veterans, and Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, make this anniversary particularly meaningful, mixing poignant remembrances for D-Day sacrifices with an Allied show of solidarity for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, among the guests.\n\nBut host France hasn't invited World War II ally Russia, citing its \"war of aggression against Ukraine that has intensified in recent weeks.\"\n\nHUNDREDS GATHER AT DAWN AT UTAH BEACH TO MARK D-DAY'S 80TH ANNIVERSARY\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Hundreds of people, some in WWII-era uniforms, arrived before dawn to stretch out across the now peaceful sands of Utah Beach, one of the five Allied landing zones on D-Day where troops waded into cold seas through hails of fire exactly 80 years ago.\n\n\"It's our way of paying homage, and better understanding what really happened in the 1944 landings,\" said Dimitri Picot, a 33-year-old from the nearby Normandy town of Carentan who works as a rat and pest catcher.\n\nPicot said he often dives on a wrecked ship that was hit and exploded, its wreckage visible Thursday as night gave way to day. Growing up amid the June 6, 1944, landing zones, he said he has become accustomed to seeing walls still pockmarked by bullets, shrapnel and other reminders of that fateful day.\n\nBut on the 80th anniversary \"to think that they liberated us\" hammered home the emotion, he said.", "source": {"uri": "greenfieldreporter.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Greenfield Daily Reporter"}, "authors":

Now, this WWII veteran warns against Holocaust denial\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN MEETS WITH AMERICAN VETERANS\n\nCOLLEVILLE-SUR-MER, France -- U.S. President Joe Biden met with American veterans of D-Day as he marked the invasion's 80th anniversary.\n\nVeterans who could stand were helped out of wheelchairs to pose for photos with the president and first lady Jill Biden. One hugged Biden, another saluted. When Biden learned it was the birthday of one of the veterans, he led the audience in singing 'Happy Birthday.'\n\nThe first lady clutched the arm of another veteran, Robert Gibson, to help him stand next to Biden as they shook hands. \"Don't get old,\" the 100-year-old man joked to the 81-year-old president, who was a toddler when D-Day took place.\n\nSteve Spielberg and Tom Hanks, the Hollywood heavyweights behind movies and television shows about World War II, were nearby.\n\nKING CHARLES AND QUEEN CAMILLA LEAD D-DAY COMMEMORATIONS AT NEW MEMORIAL IN FRANCE\n\nVER-SUR-MER, France -- King Charles III and Queen Camilla led commemorations at the new British Normandy Memorial in Ver-sur-Mer.\n\nCamilla wiped away a tear as actor Martin Freeman read words by 99-year-old D-Day veteran Joe Mines, recalling that \"I was 19 when I landed, but I was still a boy. I don't care what people say, I wasn't a man, I was a boy. And I didn't have any idea of war and killing.\"\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak and Labour Party leader Keir Starmer took a break from campaigning for Britain's July 4 election to travel to France for the ceremony.\n\nSunak paid tribute to veterans, saying their \"actions freed a continent and built a better world.\"\n\n\"You risked everything and we owe you everything,\" he said. \"We cannot possibly hope to repay that debt but we can and we must pledge never to forget.\"\n\nWelsh singer Tom Jones, 83, sang his song \"I Won't Crumble With You If You Fall,\" before the king addressed the audience in French and English.\n\nCharles said that while the number of living veterans was dwindling, \"our obligation to remember what they stood for and what they achieved for us all can never diminish.\"\n\nSpeaking in French, Charles paid tribute to the \"unimaginable number\" of French civilians killed in the battle for Normandy, and the bravery and sacrifice of the French Resistance.\n\nMAN HONORS A GRANDFATHER HE NEVER KNEW, AN OFFICER WHO SMUGGLED HIMSELF ON A LANDING CRAFT\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Among the thousands who flocked to D-Day beach Utah was the grandson of an American colonel who smuggled himself aboard a landing craft so he could join his men in the first waves of the June 6, 1944, invasion.\n\nJohn Reistrup, 55, never met his grandfather, Eugene M. Caffey, who died in 1961. Coming back to Utah for the 80th anniversary was his way of carrying \"the torch for someone you never met that had such an impact on so many lives.\"\n\nA plaque at the beach that honors his grandfather says the colonel led the 19,500 men of the 1st Engineer Special Brigade tasked on that fateful day with the logistics of the landing on Utah, one of five invasion beaches.\n\nNot scheduled to land until 0900, Caffey, a 49-year-old father of nine, had smuggled himself, with no equipment except an empty rifle, aboard an 8th Infantry landing craft.

Utah and Omaha were taken -- at the cost of hundreds of lives -- by American forces, with the others stormed by troops from Britain and Canada, also killing many hundreds, plus others from France.\n\nThe long stretch of the Normandy coast is where the largest-ever land, sea and air armada punctured Hitler's defenses in Western Europe and helped precipitate his downfall 11 months later.\n\nA fair-like atmosphere is fueled by World War II-era jeeps and trucks tearing down hedge-rowed lanes so deadly for Allied troops who fought dug-in German defenders, and of reenactors playing at war on sands where D-Day soldiers fell.\n\nSurviving veterans, who are around 100 years old now, are the VIPs of the day's events.\n\nNation & World\n\nAt 100, this vet says the 'greatest generation' moniker fits 'because we saved the world'\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n2 min to read\n\n'FREEDOM COSTS,' DENMARK'S PRIME MINISTER SAYS AS SHE MARKS D-DAY'S 80TH ANNIVERSARY\n\nCOPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Denmark's prime minister said that this year's observances of the D-Day landings, which come as Russia is at war against Ukraine, are a reminder that there is a price for defending freedom.\n\n\"From D-Day we have learned that freedom costs,\" Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said in a statement as she headed to Normandy for ceremonies marking the 80th anniversary of the Allied landings.\n\n\"Eighty years later, Europe once again finds itself at a fateful moment. Where freedom is once again being fought for on our own continent,\" she said, \"against an aggressive and brutal enemy who will dictate country borders with brute force and leave a trail of death and destruction.\"\n\nIMAGINING THE HORROR AND CELEBRATING FREEDOM\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Because freedom is worth celebrating and passing on to children, too, Alexandra Hamon, 35, drank champagne and shared the sunrise with her boys, Karl and Neils, both 13, as the day dawned Thursday over the beaches where Allied soldiers landed on D-Day.\n\nThe family was among a crowd several thousands strong that stretched for kilometers along Utah beach -- one of the five beaches along the coast of Normandy where Allied troops landed. Utah and Omaha were taken -- at the cost of hundreds of lives -- by American forces, with the others stormed by troops from Britain and Canada, also killing many hundreds, plus others from France. The other code-named beaches are Juno, Sword and Gold.\n\nKarl sat perched on the hood of their 1943 Dodge truck, lovingly restored by her husband, Enogat, as the family from Saint Malo, a French coastal city that was badly damaged in major fighting about two months after D-Day, stared out across the English Channel.\n\nThe waters Thursday were still and peaceful -- unlike on that fateful day that helped change the course of WWII and precipitate Adolf Hitler's downfall 11 months later.\n\n\"It's indescribable, just imagining the chaos. Now it's peaceful, almost festive, we try to imagine but I think it's unimaginable,\" she said.\n\n\"You think of all those guys, everything they went through,\" she added of the fast-dwindling D-Day veterans. \"They say they aren't heroes. But they are, they are. Those guys really should never die. I imagine the boats, the guys arriving, the sounds. It must have been horrible, yes, horrible.\"\n\nKEEPING ALIVE THE MEMORY OF SOLDIERS 'WHO DIED FOR OUR FREEDOM'\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the rising sun took the night's chill off Utah Beach, Christophe Receveur, 57, from Thionville in eastern France, unfurled a Stars and Stripes he bought in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, six months ago specifically to honor the Americans who fell on D-Day.\n\n\"To keep alive the memory of the soldiers who died for our freedom,\" he said. \"To forget them is to let them die all over again.\"\n\nReceveur and his daughter, Julie, 28, carefully folded the flag into a tight triangle after their quiet, reflective homage on an empty stretch of the beach, busy with hundreds of people strung out along the sands.\n\nReceveur said the Ukraine war was on his mind, too, as he honored the fallen of WWII. His great grandfather fought in WWI, his grandfather was a prisoner of war in WWII, and his father was a veteran of France's war in former North African colony Algeria.\n\n\"I don't want our freedom, for our kids, our grandkids, to be hit by ... I don't want to say a madman,\" referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"So a lot of respect for these people who died and for those who are still dying,\" he said of the WWII dead and those in Ukraine.\n\nHe said the D-Day sacrifices have to be remembered. \"Lots of emotion that all these troops came to liberate a country that they didn't know for an ideology -- democracy, freedom -- that is under severe strain now.\"\n\n'WE JUST HAVE TO REMEMBER THE SACRIFICES'\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the golden sun pierced low clouds over the seas that were thick with landing craft approaching Normandy on D-Day, Becky Kraubetz peered across the English Channel toward her native Britain, her eyes filled with tears as she thought about the scene 80 years ago.\n\n\"It's so historic and we just have to remember the sacrifices of everybody who gave us our freedom,\" said Kraubetz, whose grandfather served with the British Army during World War II and was captured in Malta.\n\n\"It gives you goosebumps, everything that happened here. Imagine just jumping into the water, freezing cold,\" said the 54-year-old who now lives in Florida, as the rays of the morning sun started to warm the hundreds of people who'd waited through the night's chill for dawn's break.\n\n\"The bravery, the courage, for people to face that is just unbelievable -- very, very humbled to be here.\"\n\nTHE SUN RISES OVER NORMANDY BEACHES AS THE WORLD REMEMBERS D-DAY\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the sun sets on the D-Day generation, it's rising again over Normandy beaches where soldiers fought and died exactly 80 years ago, kicking off intense anniversary commemorations Thursday against the backdrop of renewed war in Europe, in Ukraine.\n\nEver-dwindling numbers of World War II veterans, and Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, make this anniversary particularly meaningful, mixing poignant remembrances for D-Day sacrifices with an Allied show of solidarity for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, among the guests.\n\nBut host France hasn't invited World War II ally Russia, citing its \"war of aggression against Ukraine that has intensified in recent weeks.\"\n\nHUNDREDS GATHER AT DAWN AT UTAH BEACH TO MARK D-DAY'S 80TH ANNIVERSARY\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Hundreds of people, some in WWII-era uniforms, arrived before dawn to stretch out across the now peaceful sands of Utah Beach, one of the five Allied landing zones on D-Day where troops waded into cold seas through hails of fire exactly 80 years ago.\n\n\"It's our way of paying homage, and better understanding what really happened in the 1944 landings,\" said Dimitri Picot, a 33-year-old from the nearby Normandy town of Carentan who works as a rat and pest catcher.\n\nPicot said he often dives on a wrecked ship that was hit and exploded, its wreckage visible Thursday as night gave way to day. Growing up amid the June 6, 1944, landing zones, he said he has become accustomed to seeing walls still pockmarked by bullets, shrapnel and other reminders of that fateful day.\n\nBut on the 80th anniversary \"to think that they liberated us\" hammered home the emotion, he said.", "source": {"uri": "dailyprogress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Progress"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The assault began with Allied aircraft bombing German defenses in Normandy, followed by around 1,200 aircraft that carried airborne troops. As dawn broke, Allied forces started bombing German coastal defenses and shortly after that vessels began putting troops ashore on five codenamed beaches: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword. By the end of the day, nearly 160,000 Allied troops had landed in Normandy, although there were thousands of casualties.\n\nFew witnesses to history's biggest amphibious invasion remain alive today.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- Hour by hour: A brief timeline of the Allies' invasion of occupied France\n\n-- With time short, veterans seize the chance to keep their D-Day memories alive for others\n\n-- Women were barred from combat. But they helped D-Day succeed in other ways\n\n-- How AP covered the D-Day landings and lost a photographer in the battle for Normandy\n\n-- A Jewish veteran from London prepares to commemorate the 80th anniversary\n\nCOLLEVILLE-SUR-MER, France -- French President Emmanuel Macron has awarded 11 U.S. WWII veterans with the Legion of Honor, France's highest distinction, during commemorations marking the 80th anniversary of D-Day.\n\n\"You came here because the free world needed each and every one of you, and you answered the call,\" Macron told them. \"You came here to make France a free nation. You're back here today at home, if I may say.\"\n\nThe men are now 98 to 104 years old.\n\nMacron kissed each veteran on both cheeks and greeted them warmly as he pinned medals on their lapels.\n\nAmong the men was Hilbert Margol, who joined an artillery battalion that operated in eastern France. He is part of American forces that liberated the Dachau concentration camp. Another, Ray Tweedel, landed by sea in Normandy on the night of June 8, 1944, and took part in the war as an oil tanker and ambulance driver.\n\nUKRAINE'S ZELENSKYY ARRIVES IN NORMANDY FOR D-DAY EVENTS\n\nOMAHA BEACH, France -- Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has arrived in Normandy, France, to commemorate the anniversary of the D-Day invasion with Western leaders.\n\nZelenskyy said on X that he is going to attend important meetings aimed at strengthening his nation at war, and that he is honored to be participating in the D-Day commemoration with President Joe Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron and others.\n\n\"This event and day serve as a reminder of the courage and determination demonstrated in the pursuit of freedom and democracy,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\n\"Allies defended Europe's freedom then, and Ukrainians do so now. Unity prevailed then, and true unity can prevail today.\"\n\n103-YEAR-OLD FEMALE VETERAN GIVEN LEGION OF HONOR AWARD\n\nVER-SUR-MER, France -- French President Emmanuel Macron bestowed a Legion of Honor award on a 103-year-old female British veteran officer who created detailed maps that guided the crews of landing craft on D-Day.\n\nChristian Lamb sat in a wheelchair as Macron bent down to pin the medal on her and kissed her on both cheeks.\n\nHe told her she was one of the \"heroes in the shadows\" as he described how she was studying in Normandy in 1939 when her father, a Royal Navy admiral, called her back to London on the eve of World War II.\n\nIn a recent interview with The Associated Press, Lamb recalled creating maps that \"showed railways, roads, churches, castles, every possible feature that could be visible to an incoming invader and from every angle,\" Lamb.\n\n\"It was intense and exciting work, and obviously detail was vital. It was crucial that the maps were 100% accurate,\" she said.\n\nPRINCE WILLIAM PRAISES CANADIAN TROOPS IN NORMANDY\n\nJUNO BEACH, France -- Prince William has praised the bravery and sacrifice of Canadian troops as he addressed a D-Day anniversary ceremony on Juno Beach.\n\nThe royal was joined by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal and Canadian D-Day veterans.\n\nSome 14,000 Canadians were part of the 150,000 Allied troops who landed or parachuted into Normandy in 1944.\n\n\"Far from home they stormed these very sand dunes behind me, shoulder to shoulder with thousands of British troops,\" William said.\n\nAddressing veterans at the ceremony, the royal added: \"Thank you for our freedom, and thank you for your service.\"\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN MEETS WITH AMERICAN VETERANS\n\nCOLLEVILLE-SUR-MER, France -- U.S. President Joe Biden met with American veterans of D-Day as he marked the invasion's 80th anniversary.\n\nVeterans who could stand were helped out of wheelchairs to pose for photos with the president and first lady Jill Biden. One hugged Biden, another saluted. When Biden learned it was the birthday of one of the veterans, he led the audience in singing 'Happy Birthday.'\n\nThe first lady clutched the arm of another veteran, Robert Gibson, to help him stand next to Biden as they shook hands. \"Don't get old,\" the 100-year-old man joked to the 81-year-old president, who was a toddler when D-Day took place.\n\nSteve Spielberg and Tom Hanks, the Hollywood heavyweights behind movies and television shows about World War II, were nearby.\n\nKING CHARLES AND QUEEN CAMILLA LEAD D-DAY COMMEMORATIONS AT NEW MEMORIAL IN FRANCE\n\nVER-SUR-MER, France -- King Charles III and Queen Camilla led commemorations at the new British Normandy Memorial in Ver-sur-Mer.\n\nCamilla wiped away a tear as actor Martin Freeman read words by 99-year-old D-Day veteran Joe Mines, recalling that \"I was 19 when I landed, but I was still a boy. I don't care what people say, I wasn't a man, I was a boy. And I didn't have any idea of war and killing.\"\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak and Labour Party leader Keir Starmer took a break from campaigning for Britain's July 4 election to travel to France for the ceremony.\n\nSunak paid tribute to veterans, saying their \"actions freed a continent and built a better world.\"\n\n\"You risked everything and we owe you everything,\" he said. \"We cannot possibly hope to repay that debt but we can and we must pledge never to forget.\"\n\nWelsh singer Tom Jones, 83, sang his song \"I Won't Crumble With You If You Fall,\" before the king addressed the audience in French and English.\n\nCharles said that while the number of living veterans was dwindling, \"our obligation to remember what they stood for and what they achieved for us all can never diminish.\"\n\nSpeaking in French, Charles paid tribute to the \"unimaginable number\" of French civilians killed in the battle for Normandy, and the bravery and sacrifice of the French Resistance.\n\nMAN HONORS A GRANDFATHER HE NEVER KNEW, AN OFFICER WHO SMUGGLED HIMSELF ON A LANDING CRAFT\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Among the thousands who flocked to D-Day beach Utah was the grandson of an American colonel who smuggled himself aboard a landing craft so he could join his men in the first waves of the June 6, 1944, invasion.\n\nJohn Reistrup, 55, never met his grandfather, Eugene M. Caffey, who died in 1961. Coming back to Utah for the 80th anniversary was his way of carrying \"the torch for someone you never met that had such an impact on so many lives.\"\n\nA plaque at the beach that honors his grandfather says the colonel led the 19,500 men of the 1st Engineer Special Brigade tasked on that fateful day with the logistics of the landing on Utah, one of five invasion beaches.\n\nNot scheduled to land until 0900, Caffey, a 49-year-old father of nine, had smuggled himself, with no equipment except an empty rifle, aboard an 8th Infantry landing craft. En route he managed to load his rifle by taking up a collection of one bullet each from eight infantrymen. He arrived ashore very early in the assault, Reistrup said.\n\n\"No officers were allowed on the first waves of the landing but he said, 'Hell, no, I'm going with my guys.'\"\n\nA Nazi bunker captured on the beach then became his grandfather's office, he said. Caffey's portrait hangs there, inside, to this day.\n\nForging ahead into fire on D-Day \"has got to be the greatest courage you could ever have,\" said Reistrup, who has visited Normandy about 10 times since his first visit as a kid in 1974.\n\nTHOUSANDS OF PEOPLE DOT FRANCE'S UTAH BEACH FOR D-DAY COMMEMORATIONS\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Thousands of people, including many people in World War II-era uniforms, were stretched for several kilometers (miles) along Utah Beach ahead of commemorations marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings.\n\nUtah was one of the five landing beaches along the coast of Normandy where Allied troops landed on June 6, 2024. Utah and Omaha were taken -- at the cost of hundreds of lives -- by American forces, with the others stormed by troops from Britain and Canada, also killing many hundreds, plus others from France.\n\nThe long stretch of the Normandy coast is where the largest-ever land, sea and air armada punctured Hitler's defenses in Western Europe and helped precipitate his downfall 11 months later.\n\nA fair-like atmosphere is fueled by World War II-era jeeps and trucks tearing down hedge-rowed lanes so deadly for Allied troops who fought dug-in German defenders, and of reenactors playing at war on sands where D-Day soldiers fell.\n\nSurviving veterans, who are around 100 years old now, are the VIPs of the day's events.\n\n'FREEDOM COSTS,' DENMARK'S PRIME MINISTER SAYS AS SHE MARKS D-DAY'S 80TH ANNIVERSARY\n\nCOPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Denmark's prime minister said that this year's observances of the D-Day landings, which come as Russia is at war against Ukraine, are a reminder that there is a price for defending freedom.\n\n\"From D-Day we have learned that freedom costs,\" Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said in a statement as she headed to Normandy for ceremonies marking the 80th anniversary of the Allied landings.\n\n\"Eighty years later, Europe once again finds itself at a fateful moment. Where freedom is once again being fought for on our own continent,\" she said, \"against an aggressive and brutal enemy who will dictate country borders with brute force and leave a trail of death and destruction.\"\n\nIMAGINING THE HORROR AND CELEBRATING FREEDOM\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Because freedom is worth celebrating and passing on to children, too, Alexandra Hamon, 35, drank champagne and shared the sunrise with her boys, Karl and Neils, both 13, as the day dawned Thursday over the beaches where Allied soldiers landed on D-Day.\n\nThe family was among a crowd several thousands strong that stretched for kilometers along Utah beach -- one of the five beaches along the coast of Normandy where Allied troops landed. Utah and Omaha were taken -- at the cost of hundreds of lives -- by American forces, with the others stormed by troops from Britain and Canada, also killing many hundreds, plus others from France. The other code-named beaches are Juno, Sword and Gold.\n\nKarl sat perched on the hood of their 1943 Dodge truck, lovingly restored by her husband, Enogat, as the family from Saint Malo, a French coastal city that was badly damaged in major fighting about two months after D-Day, stared out across the English Channel.\n\nThe waters Thursday were still and peaceful -- unlike on that fateful day that helped change the course of WWII and precipitate Adolf Hitler's downfall 11 months later.\n\n\"It's indescribable, just imagining the chaos. Now it's peaceful, almost festive, we try to imagine but I think it's unimaginable,\" she said.\n\n\"You think of all those guys, everything they went through,\" she added of the fast-dwindling D-Day veterans. \"They say they aren't heroes. But they are, they are.\"\n\nKEEPING ALIVE THE MEMORY OF SOLDIERS 'WHO DIED FOR OUR FREEDOM'\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the rising sun took the night's chill off Utah Beach, Christophe Receveur, 57, from Thionville in eastern France, unfurled a Stars and Stripes he bought in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, six months ago specifically to honor the Americans who fell on D-Day.\n\n\"To keep alive the memory of the soldiers who died for our freedom,\" he said. \"To forget them is to let them die all over again.\"\n\nReceveur and his daughter, Julie, 28, carefully folded the flag into a tight triangle after their quiet, reflective homage on an empty stretch of the beach, busy with hundreds of people strung out along the sands.\n\nReceveur said the Ukraine war was on his mind, too, as he honored the fallen of WWII. His great grandfather fought in WWI, his grandfather was a prisoner of war in WWII, and his father was a veteran of France's war in former North African colony Algeria.\n\n\"I don't want our freedom, for our kids, our grandkids, to be hit by ... I don't want to say a madman,\" referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"So a lot of respect for these people who died and for those who are still dying,\" he said of the WWII dead and those in Ukraine.\n\n'WE JUST HAVE TO REMEMBER THE SACRIFICES'\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the golden sun pierced low clouds over the seas that were thick with landing craft approaching Normandy on D-Day, Becky Kraubetz peered across the English Channel toward her native Britain, her eyes filled with tears as she thought about the scene 80 years ago.\n\n\"It's so historic and we just have to remember the sacrifices of everybody who gave us our freedom,\" said Kraubetz, whose grandfather served with the British Army during World War II and was captured in Malta.\n\n\"It gives you goosebumps, everything that happened here. Imagine just jumping into the water, freezing cold,\" said the 54-year-old who now lives in Florida, as the rays of the morning sun started to warm the hundreds of people who'd waited through the night's chill for dawn's break.\n\n\"The bravery, the courage, for people to face that is just unbelievable -- very, very humbled to be here.\"\n\nTHE SUN RISES OVER NORMANDY BEACHES AS THE WORLD REMEMBERS D-DAY\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the sun sets on the D-Day generation, it's rising again over Normandy beaches where soldiers fought and died exactly 80 years ago, kicking off intense anniversary commemorations Thursday against the backdrop of renewed war in Europe, in Ukraine.\n\nEver-dwindling numbers of World War II veterans, and Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, make this anniversary particularly meaningful, mixing poignant remembrances for D-Day sacrifices with an Allied show of solidarity for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, among the guests.\n\nBut host France hasn't invited World War II ally Russia, citing its \"war of aggression against Ukraine that has intensified in recent weeks.\"\n\nHUNDREDS GATHER AT DAWN AT UTAH BEACH TO MARK D-DAY'S 80TH ANNIVERSARY\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Hundreds of people, some in WWII-era uniforms, arrived before dawn to stretch out across the now peaceful sands of Utah Beach, one of the five Allied landing zones on D-Day where troops waded into cold seas through hails of fire exactly 80 years ago.\n\n\"It's our way of paying homage, and better understanding what really happened in the 1944 landings,\" said Dimitri Picot, a 33-year-old from the nearby Normandy town of Carentan who works as a rat and pest catcher.\n\nPicot said he often dives on a wrecked ship that was hit and exploded, its wreckage visible Thursday as night gave way to day. Growing up amid the June 6, 1944, landing zones, he said he has become accustomed to seeing walls still pockmarked by bullets, shrapnel and other reminders of that fateful day.\n\nBut on the 80th anniversary \"to think that they liberated us\" hammered home the emotion, he said.", "source": {"uri": "seattletimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Seattle Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

On Thursday, a dwindling number of World War II veterans in a parade of wheelchairs joined a new generation of leaders to honor the dead, the living and the fight for democracy in moving commemorations on and around those same beaches where they landed exactly 80 years ago on D-Day.\n\nThe war in Ukraine shadowed the ceremonies, a grim modern-day example of lives and cities that are again suffering through war in Europe.\n\nWorld War II ally Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, wasn't invited, and U.S. President Joe Biden directly linked Ukraine's fight for its young democracy to the battle to defeat Nazi Germany.\n\n\"We'll learn one of these days, but I won't be around for that,\" he said.\n\nAs now-centenarian veterans revisited old memories and fallen comrades buried in Normandy graves, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's presence at the international D-Day commemoration was met with loud applause, fusing World War II's awful past with the fraught present. More applause followed when a giant screen showed the Ukrainian leader speaking with U.S. veterans.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron awarded the Legion of Honor to 11 U.S. veterans and a British female veteran. Among the Americans was Edward Berthold, a pilot who carried out his three missions over France in May 1944, before taking part in an operation in Saint-Lo, in Normandy, on D-Day. He flew 35 combat missions in all during World War II.\n\n\"You came here because the free world needed each and every one of you, and you answered the call,\" Macron said. \"You came here to make France a free nation. You're back here today at home, if I may say.\"\n\nMacron also bestowed the Legion of Honor on 103-year-old Christian Lamb, the daughter of a Royal Navy admiral who was studying in Normandy in 1939 when her father called her back to London. There, Lamb created detailed maps that guided the crews of landing craft on D-Day.\n\nThe French president bent down to Lamb in a wheelchair, pin the medal and kiss her on both cheeks, describing her as one of the \"heroes in the shadows.\"\n\n\"We just have to remember the sacrifices of everybody who gave us our freedom,\" said Becky Kraubetz, a Briton now living in Florida whose grandfather served with the British Army during World War II and was captured in Malta. She was among a crowd of thousands of people that stretched for several kilometers (miles) along Utah Beach, the westernmost of the D-Day beaches.\n\nIn a quiet spot away from the official ceremonies, France's Christophe Receveur performed his own tribute, unfurling an American flag he had bought on a trip to Pennsylvania to honor those who died on D-Day.\n\n\"All these troops came to liberate a country that they didn't know for an ideology -- democracy, freedom -- that is under severe strain now,\" he said.\n\nFor Warren Goss, a 99-year-old American veteran of D-Day who landed in the first waves on Utah Beach, a visit years later to the same place where he watched a comrade fall to incoming fire confirmed that the sacrifice was worthy.\n\n\"I looked at the beach and it was beautiful, all the people, the kids were playing and I see the boys and girls were walking, holding hands, with their life back,\" he told the Danish king and prime minister, who hung on his every word.\n\nBut at the 80th, they're the VIPs of commemorations across the Normandy coast where the largest-ever land, sea and air armada punctured Hitler's defenses in Western Europe and helped precipitate his downfall 11 months later.\n\n\"They really were the golden generation, those 17-, 18-year-old guys doing something so brave,\" said James Baker, a 56-year-old from the Netherlands, reflecting on Utah Beach.\n\nFarther up the coast on Gold Beach, a military bagpiper played at precisely the time that British troops landed there 80 years ago.\n\nThe United Kingdom's King Charles III and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak were among those at a ceremony to honor the troops who landed there and on Sword Beach, while Prince William and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau joined others at ceremony for the Canadian troops at Juno Beach.\n\nIn his address, the king told the crowd that the world was fortunate that a generation \"did not flinch\" when they were called upon.\n\n\"Our obligation to remember what they stood for and what they achieved for us all can never diminish,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking in French, Charles also paid tribute to the \"unimaginable number\" of French civilians killed in the battle for Normandy, and the bravery and sacrifice of the French Resistance.\n\nThose who traveled to Normandy include women who were among the millions who built bombers, tanks and other weaponry and played other vital World War II roles that were long overshadowed by the combat exploits of men.\n\nFeted everywhere they go in wheelchairs and walking with canes, veterans are using their voices to repeat their message they hope will live eternal: Never forget.\n\n\"We weren't doing it for honors and awards. We were doing it to save our country,\" said 98-year-old Anna Mae Krier, who worked as a riveter building B-17 and B-29 bombers. \"We ended up helping save the world.\"", "source": {"uri":

The assault began with Allied aircraft bombing German defenses in Normandy, followed by around 1,200 aircraft that carried airborne troops. As dawn broke, Allied forces started bombing German coastal defenses and shortly after that vessels began putting troops ashore on five codenamed beaches: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword. By the end of the day, nearly 160,000 Allied troops had landed in Normandy, although there were thousands of casualties.\n\nFew witnesses to history's biggest amphibious invasion remain alive today.\n\n-- How AP covered the D-Day landings and lost a photographer in the battle for Normandy\n\n-- A Jewish veteran from London prepares to commemorate the 80th anniversary\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nCOLLEVILLE-SUR-MER, France -- French President Emmanuel Macron has awarded 11 U.S. WWII veterans with the Legion of Honor, France's highest distinction, during commemorations marking the 80th anniversary of D-Day.\n\n\"You came here because the free world needed each and every one of you, and you answered the call,\" Macron told them. \"You came here to make France a free nation. You're back here today at home, if I may say.\"\n\nThe men are now 98 to 104 years old.\n\nMacron kissed each veteran on both cheeks and greeted them warmly as he pinned medals on their lapels.\n\nAmong the men was Hilbert Margol, who joined an artillery battalion that operated in eastern France. He is part of American forces that liberated the Dachau concentration camp. Another, Ray Tweedel, landed by sea in Normandy on the night of June 8, 1944, and took part in the war as an oil tanker and ambulance driver.\n\nOMAHA BEACH, France -- Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has arrived in Normandy, France, to commemorate the anniversary of the D-Day invasion with Western leaders.\n\nZelenskyy said on X that he is going to attend important meetings aimed at strengthening his nation at war, and that he is honored to be participating in the D-Day commemoration with President Joe Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron and others.\n\n\"This event and day serve as a reminder of the courage and determination demonstrated in the pursuit of freedom and democracy,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\n\"Allies defended Europe's freedom then, and Ukrainians do so now. Unity prevailed then, and true unity can prevail today.\"\n\nVER-SUR-MER, France -- French President Emmanuel Macron bestowed a Legion of Honor award on a 103-year-old female British veteran officer who created detailed maps that guided the crews of landing craft on D-Day.\n\nChristian Lamb sat in a wheelchair as Macron bent down to pin the medal on her and kissed her on both cheeks.\n\nHe told her she was one of the \"heroes in the shadows\" as he described how she was studying in Normandy in 1939 when her father, a Royal Navy admiral, called her back to London on the eve of World War II.\n\nIn a recent interview with The Associated Press, Lamb recalled creating maps that \"showed railways, roads, churches, castles, every possible feature that could be visible to an incoming invader and from every angle,\" Lamb.\n\n\"It was intense and exciting work, and obviously detail was vital. It was crucial that the maps were 100% accurate,\" she said.\n\nJUNO BEACH, France -- Prince William has praised the bravery and sacrifice of Canadian troops as he addressed a D-Day anniversary ceremony on Juno Beach.\n\nThe royal was joined by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal and Canadian D-Day veterans.\n\nSome 14,000 Canadians were part of the 150,000 Allied troops who landed or parachuted into Normandy in 1944.\n\n\"Far from home they stormed these very sand dunes behind me, shoulder to shoulder with thousands of British troops,\" William said.\n\nAddressing veterans at the ceremony, the royal added: \"Thank you for our freedom, and thank you for your service.\"\n\nCOLLEVILLE-SUR-MER, France -- U.S. President Joe Biden met with American veterans of D-Day as he marked the invasion's 80th anniversary.\n\nVeterans who could stand were helped out of wheelchairs to pose for photos with the president and first lady Jill Biden. One hugged Biden, another saluted. When Biden learned it was the birthday of one of the veterans, he led the audience in singing 'Happy Birthday.'\n\nThe first lady clutched the arm of another veteran, Robert Gibson, to help him stand next to Biden as they shook hands. \"Don't get old,\" the 100-year-old man joked to the 81-year-old president, who was a toddler when D-Day took place.\n\nSteve Spielberg and Tom Hanks, the Hollywood heavyweights behind movies and television shows about World War II, were nearby.\n\nVER-SUR-MER, France -- King Charles III and Queen Camilla led commemorations at the new British Normandy Memorial in Ver-sur-Mer.\n\nCamilla wiped away a tear as actor Martin Freeman read words by 99-year-old D-Day veteran Joe Mines, recalling that \"I was 19 when I landed, but I was still a boy. I don't care what people say, I wasn't a man, I was a boy. And I didn't have any idea of war and killing.\"\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak and Labour Party leader Keir Starmer took a break from campaigning for Britain's July 4 election to travel to France for the ceremony.\n\nSunak paid tribute to veterans, saying their \"actions freed a continent and built a better world.\"\n\n\"You risked everything and we owe you everything,\" he said. \"We cannot possibly hope to repay that debt but we can and we must pledge never to forget.\"\n\nWelsh singer Tom Jones, 83, sang his song \"I Won't Crumble With You If You Fall,\" before the king addressed the audience in French and English.\n\nCharles said that while the number of living veterans was dwindling, \"our obligation to remember what they stood for and what they achieved for us all can never diminish.\"\n\nSpeaking in French, Charles paid tribute to the \"unimaginable number\" of French civilians killed in the battle for Normandy, and the bravery and sacrifice of the French Resistance.\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Among the thousands who flocked to D-Day beach Utah was the grandson of an American colonel who smuggled himself aboard a landing craft so he could join his men in the first waves of the June 6, 1944, invasion.\n\nJohn Reistrup, 55, never met his grandfather, Eugene M. Caffey, who died in 1961. Coming back to Utah for the 80th anniversary was his way of carrying \"the torch for someone you never met that had such an impact on so many lives.\"\n\nA plaque at the beach that honors his grandfather says the colonel led the 19,500 men of the 1st Engineer Special Brigade tasked on that fateful day with the logistics of the landing on Utah, one of five invasion beaches.\n\nNot scheduled to land until 0900, Caffey, a 49-year-old father of nine, had smuggled himself, with no equipment except an empty rifle, aboard an 8th Infantry landing craft. En route he managed to load his rifle by taking up a collection of one bullet each from eight infantrymen. He arrived ashore very early in the assault, Reistrup said.\n\n\"No officers were allowed on the first waves of the landing but he said, 'Hell, no, I'm going with my guys.'\"\n\nA Nazi bunker captured on the beach then became his grandfather's office, he said. Caffey's portrait hangs there, inside, to this day.\n\nForging ahead into fire on D-Day \"has got to be the greatest courage you could ever have,\" said Reistrup, who has visited Normandy about 10 times since his first visit as a kid in 1974.\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Thousands of people, including many people in World War II-era uniforms, were stretched for several kilometers (miles) along Utah Beach ahead of commemorations marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings.\n\nUtah was one of the five landing beaches along the coast of Normandy where Allied troops landed on June 6, 2024. Utah and Omaha were taken -- at the cost of hundreds of lives -- by American forces, with the others stormed by troops from Britain and Canada, also killing many hundreds, plus others from France.\n\nThe long stretch of the Normandy coast is where the largest-ever land, sea and air armada punctured Hitler's defenses in Western Europe and helped precipitate his downfall 11 months later.\n\nA fair-like atmosphere is fueled by World War II-era jeeps and trucks tearing down hedge-rowed lanes so deadly for Allied troops who fought dug-in German defenders, and of reenactors playing at war on sands where D-Day soldiers fell.\n\nSurviving veterans, who are around 100 years old now, are the VIPs of the day's events.\n\nCOPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Denmark's prime minister said that this year's observances of the D-Day landings, which come as Russia is at war against Ukraine, are a reminder that there is a price for defending freedom.\n\n\"From D-Day we have learned that freedom costs,\" Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said in a statement as she headed to Normandy for ceremonies marking the 80th anniversary of the Allied landings.\n\n\"Eighty years later, Europe once again finds itself at a fateful moment. Where freedom is once again being fought for on our own continent,\" she said, \"against an aggressive and brutal enemy who will dictate country borders with brute force and leave a trail of death and destruction.\"\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Because freedom is worth celebrating and passing on to children, too, Alexandra Hamon, 35, drank champagne and shared the sunrise with her boys, Karl and Neils, both 13, as the day dawned Thursday over the beaches where Allied soldiers landed on D-Day.\n\nThe family was among a crowd several thousands strong that stretched for kilometers along Utah beach -- one of the five beaches along the coast of Normandy where Allied troops landed. Utah and Omaha were taken -- at the cost of hundreds of lives -- by American forces, with the others stormed by troops from Britain and Canada, also killing many hundreds, plus others from France. The other code-named beaches are Juno, Sword and Gold.\n\nKarl sat perched on the hood of their 1943 Dodge truck, lovingly restored by her husband, Enogat, as the family from Saint Malo, a French coastal city that was badly damaged in major fighting about two months after D-Day, stared out across the English Channel.\n\nThe waters Thursday were still and peaceful -- unlike on that fateful day that helped change the course of WWII and precipitate Adolf Hitler's downfall 11 months later.\n\n\"It's indescribable, just imagining the chaos. Now it's peaceful, almost festive, we try to imagine but I think it's unimaginable,\" she said.\n\n\"You think of all those guys, everything they went through,\" she added of the fast-dwindling D-Day veterans. \"They say they aren't heroes. But they are, they are.\"\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the rising sun took the night's chill off Utah Beach, Christophe Receveur, 57, from Thionville in eastern France, unfurled a Stars and Stripes he bought in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, six months ago specifically to honor the Americans who fell on D-Day.\n\n\"To keep alive the memory of the soldiers who died for our freedom,\" he said. \"To forget them is to let them die all over again.\"\n\nReceveur and his daughter, Julie, 28, carefully folded the flag into a tight triangle after their quiet, reflective homage on an empty stretch of the beach, busy with hundreds of people strung out along the sands.\n\nReceveur said the Ukraine war was on his mind, too, as he honored the fallen of WWII. His great grandfather fought in WWI, his grandfather was a prisoner of war in WWII, and his father was a veteran of France's war in former North African colony Algeria.\n\n\"I don't want our freedom, for our kids, our grandkids, to be hit by ... I don't want to say a madman,\" referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"So a lot of respect for these people who died and for those who are still dying,\" he said of the WWII dead and those in Ukraine.\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the golden sun pierced low clouds over the seas that were thick with landing craft approaching Normandy on D-Day, Becky Kraubetz peered across the English Channel toward her native Britain, her eyes filled with tears as she thought about the scene 80 years ago.\n\n\"It's so historic and we just have to remember the sacrifices of everybody who gave us our freedom,\" said Kraubetz, whose grandfather served with the British Army during World War II and was captured in Malta.\n\n\"It gives you goosebumps, everything that happened here. Imagine just jumping into the water, freezing cold,\" said the 54-year-old who now lives in Florida, as the rays of the morning sun started to warm the hundreds of people who'd waited through the night's chill for dawn's break.\n\n\"The bravery, the courage, for people to face that is just unbelievable -- very, very humbled to be here.\"\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the sun sets on the D-Day generation, it's rising again over Normandy beaches where soldiers fought and died exactly 80 years ago, kicking off intense anniversary commemorations Thursday against the backdrop of renewed war in Europe, in Ukraine.\n\nEver-dwindling numbers of World War II veterans, and Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, make this anniversary particularly meaningful, mixing poignant remembrances for D-Day sacrifices with an Allied show of solidarity for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, among the guests.\n\nBut host France hasn't invited World War II ally Russia, citing its \"war of aggression against Ukraine that has intensified in recent weeks.\"\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Hundreds of people, some in WWII-era uniforms, arrived before dawn to stretch out across the now peaceful sands of Utah Beach, one of the five Allied landing zones on D-Day where troops waded into cold seas through hails of fire exactly 80 years ago.\n\n\"It's our way of paying homage, and better understanding what really happened in the 1944 landings,\" said Dimitri Picot, a 33-year-old from the nearby Normandy town of Carentan who works as a rat and pest catcher.\n\nPicot said he often dives on a wrecked ship that was hit and exploded, its wreckage visible Thursday as night gave way to day. Growing up amid the June 6, 1944, landing zones, he said he has become accustomed to seeing walls still pockmarked by bullets, shrapnel and other reminders of that fateful day.\n\nBut on the 80th anniversary \"to think that they liberated us\" hammered home the emotion, he said.", "source": {"uri": "twincities.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Twin Cities"}, "authors": [{"uri":

On Thursday, a dwindling number of World War II veterans were joined by a new generation of leaders to honor the dead, the living and the fight for democracy in moving commemorations on and around those same beaches where they landed exactly 80 years ago on D-Day.\n\nThe war in Ukraine shadowed the ceremonies, a grim modern-day example of lives and cities that are again suffering through war in Europe.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nThe break of dawn eight decades after Allied troops landed on five code-named beaches -- Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword -- started the day of remembrance by Allied nations now standing together again behind Ukraine.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nWorld War II ally Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, wasn't invited, and U.S. President Joe Biden directly linked Ukraine's fight for its young democracy to the battle to defeat Nazi Germany.\n\n\"To surrender to bullies, to bow down to dictators is simply unthinkable,\" Biden said. \"If we were to do that, it means we'd be forgetting what happened here on these hallowed beaches.\"\n\nWith the dead and wounded on both sides in Ukraine estimated in the hundreds of thousands, commemorations for the more than 4,400 Allied dead on D-Day and many tens of thousands more, including French civilians, killed in the ensuing Battle of Normandy are tinged with concerns that World War II lessons are being lost.\n\n\"There are things worth fighting for,\" said Walter Stitt, who fought in tanks and turns 100 in July, as he visited Omaha Beach this week. \"Although I wish there was another way to do it than to try to kill each other.\"\n\n\"We'll learn one of these days, but I won't be around for that,\" he said.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAs now-centenarian veterans revisit old memories and fallen comrades buried in Normandy graves, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's presence at the D-Day commemorations with world leaders who are supporting Ukraine fused World War II's awful past with the fraught present.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron awarded the Legion of Honor to 11 U.S. veterans and a British female veteran. Among the Americans was Edward Berthold, a pilot who carried out his three missions over France in May 1944, before taking part in an operation in Saint-Lo, in Normandy, on D-Day. He flew 35 combat missions in all during World War II.\n\n\"You came here because the free world needed each and every one of you, and you answered the call,\" Macron said. \"You came here to make France a free nation. You're back here today at home, if I may say.\"\n\nMacron also bestowed the Legion of Honor on 103-year-old Christian Lamb, the daughter of a Royal Navy admiral who was studying in Normandy in 1939 when her father called her back to London. There, Lamb created detailed maps that guided the crews of landing craft on D-Day.\n\nThe French president bent down to Lamb, in a wheelchair as were many of the veterans, to pin the medal and kiss her on both cheeks, describing her as one of the \"heroes in the shadows.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nConscious of the inevitability of age and time for World War II veterans, huge throngs of aficionados in uniforms and riding vehicles of the time, and tourists soaking up the spectacle, flooded Normandy for the 80th anniversary.\n\n\"We just have to remember the sacrifices of everybody who gave us our freedom,\" said Becky Kraubetz, a Briton now living in Florida whose grandfather served with the British Army during World War II and was captured in Malta. She was among a crowd of thousands of people that stretched for several kilometers (miles) along Utah Beach, the westernmost of the D-Day beaches.\n\nIn a quiet spot away from the official ceremonies, France's Christophe Receveur performed his own tribute, unfurling an American flag he had bought on a trip to Pennsylvania to honor those who died on D-Day.\n\n\"To forget them is to let them die all over again,\" the 57-year-old said as he and his daughter, Julie, then carefully refolded the flag into a tight triangle, adding that those now dying in Ukraine fighting the invading Russian army were also on his mind.\n\n\"All these troops came to liberate a country that they didn't know for an ideology -- democracy, freedom -- that is under severe strain now,\" he said.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe fair-like atmosphere fueled by World War II-era jeeps and trucks tearing down hedge-rowed lanes so deadly for Allied troops who fought dug-in German defenders, and of reenactors playing at war on sands where D-Day soldiers fell, leave open the question of what meaning anniversaries will have once the veterans are gone.\n\nBut at the 80th, they're the VIPs of commemorations across the Normandy coast where the largest-ever land, sea and air armada punctured Hitler's defenses in Western Europe and helped precipitate his downfall 11 months later.\n\n\"They really were the golden generation, those 17-, 18-year-old guys doing something so brave,\" said James Baker, a 56-year-old from the Netherlands, reflecting on Utah Beach.\n\nFarther up the coast on Gold Beach, a military bagpiper played at precisely the time that British troops landed there 80 years ago.\n\nThe United Kingdom's King Charles III and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak were among those at a ceremony to honor the troops who landed there and on Sword Beach, while Prince William and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau joined others at ceremony for the Canadian troops at Juno Beach.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIn his address, the king told the crowd that the world was fortunate that a generation \"did not flinch\" when they were called upon.\n\n\"Our obligation to remember what they stood for and what they achieved for us all can never diminish,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking in French, Charles also paid tribute to the \"unimaginable number\" of French civilians killed in the battle for Normandy, and the bravery and sacrifice of the French Resistance.\n\nThose who traveled to Normandy include women who were among the millions who built bombers, tanks and other weaponry and played other vital World War II roles that were long overshadowed by the combat exploits of men.\n\nFeted everywhere they go in wheelchairs and walking with canes, veterans are using their voices to repeat their message they hope will live eternal: Never forget.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"We weren't doing it for honors and awards. We were doing it to save our country,\" said 98-year-old Anna Mae Krier, who worked as a riveter building B-17 and B-29 bombers. \"We ended up helping save the world.\"\n\n___\n\nJill Lawless in

The assault began with Allied aircraft bombing German defenses in Normandy, followed by around 1,200 aircraft that carried airborne troops. As dawn broke, Allied forces started bombing German coastal defenses and shortly after that vessels began putting troops ashore on five codenamed beaches: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword. By the end of the day, nearly 160,000 Allied troops had landed in Normandy, although there were thousands of casualties.\n\nFew witnesses to history's biggest amphibious invasion remain alive today. Here's the latest:\n\n11 U.S. VETERANS AWARDED WITH LEGION OF HONOR\n\nCOLLEVILLE-SUR-MER, France -- French President Emmanuel Macron has awarded 11 U.S. WWII veterans with the Legion of Honor, France's highest distinction, during commemorations marking the 80th anniversary of D-Day.\n\n\"You came here because the free world needed each and every one of you, and you answered the call,\" Macron told them. \"You came here to make France a free nation. You're back here today at home, if I may say.\"\n\nThe men are now 98 to 104 years old.\n\nMacron kissed each veteran on both cheeks and greeted them warmly as he pinned medals on their lapels.\n\nAmong the men was Hilbert Margol, who joined an artillery battalion that operated in eastern France. He is part of American forces that liberated the Dachau concentration camp. Another, Ray Tweedel, landed by sea in Normandy on the night of June 8, 1944, and took part in the war as an oil tanker and ambulance driver.\n\nUKRAINE'S ZELENSKYY ARRIVES IN NORMANDY FOR D-DAY EVENTS\n\nOMAHA BEACH, France -- Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has arrived in Normandy, France, to commemorate the anniversary of the D-Day invasion with Western leaders.\n\nZelenskyy said on X that he is going to attend important meetings aimed at strengthening his nation at war, and that he is honored to be participating in the D-Day commemoration with President Joe Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron and others.\n\n\"This event and day serve as a reminder of the courage and determination demonstrated in the pursuit of freedom and democracy,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\n\"Allies defended Europe's freedom then, and Ukrainians do so now. Unity prevailed then, and true unity can prevail today.\"\n\n103-YEAR-OLD FEMALE VETERAN GIVEN LEGION OF HONOR AWARD\n\nVER-SUR-MER, France -- French President Emmanuel Macron bestowed a Legion of Honor award on a 103-year-old female British veteran officer who created detailed maps that guided the crews of landing craft on D-Day.\n\nChristian Lamb sat in a wheelchair as Macron bent down to pin the medal on her and kissed her on both cheeks.\n\nHe told her she was one of the \"heroes in the shadows\" as he described how she was studying in Normandy in 1939 when her father, a Royal Navy admiral, called her back to London on the eve of World War II.\n\nIn a recent interview with The Associated Press, Lamb recalled creating maps that \"showed railways, roads, churches, castles, every possible feature that could be visible to an incoming invader and from every angle,\" Lamb.\n\n\"It was intense and exciting work, and obviously detail was vital. It was crucial that the maps were 100% accurate,\" she said.\n\nPRINCE WILLIAM PRAISES CANADIAN TROOPS IN NORMANDY\n\nJUNO BEACH, France -- Prince William has praised the bravery and sacrifice of Canadian troops as he addressed a D-Day anniversary ceremony on Juno Beach.\n\nThe royal was joined by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal and Canadian D-Day veterans.\n\nSome 14,000 Canadians were part of the 150,000 Allied troops who landed or parachuted into Normandy in 1944.\n\n\"Far from home they stormed these very sand dunes behind me, shoulder to shoulder with thousands of British troops,\" William said.\n\nAddressing veterans at the ceremony, the royal added: \"Thank you for our freedom, and thank you for your service.\"\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN MEETS WITH AMERICAN VETERANS\n\nCOLLEVILLE-SUR-MER, France -- U.S. President Joe Biden met with American veterans of D-Day as he marked the invasion's 80th anniversary.\n\nVeterans who could stand were helped out of wheelchairs to pose for photos with the president and first lady Jill Biden. One hugged Biden, another saluted. When Biden learned it was the birthday of one of the veterans, he led the audience in singing 'Happy Birthday.'\n\nThe first lady clutched the arm of another veteran, Robert Gibson, to help him stand next to Biden as they shook hands. \"Don't get old,\" the 100-year-old man joked to the 81-year-old president, who was a toddler when D-Day took place.\n\nSteve Spielberg and Tom Hanks, the Hollywood heavyweights behind movies and television shows about World War II, were nearby.\n\nKING CHARLES AND QUEEN CAMILLA LEAD D-DAY COMMEMORATIONS AT NEW MEMORIAL IN FRANCE\n\nVER-SUR-MER, France -- King Charles III and Queen Camilla led commemorations at the new British Normandy Memorial in Ver-sur-Mer.\n\nCamilla wiped away a tear as actor Martin Freeman read words by 99-year-old D-Day veteran Joe Mines, recalling that \"I was 19 when I landed, but I was still a boy. I don't care what people say, I wasn't a man, I was a boy. And I didn't have any idea of war and killing.\"\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak and Labour Party leader Keir Starmer took a break from campaigning for Britain's July 4 election to travel to France for the ceremony.\n\nSunak paid tribute to veterans, saying their \"actions freed a continent and built a better world.\"\n\n\"You risked everything and we owe you everything,\" he said. \"We cannot possibly hope to repay that debt but we can and we must pledge never to forget.\"\n\nWelsh singer Tom Jones, 83, sang his song \"I Won't Crumble With You If You Fall,\" before the king addressed the audience in French and English.\n\nCharles said that while the number of living veterans was dwindling, \"our obligation to remember what they stood for and what they achieved for us all can never diminish.\"\n\nSpeaking in French, Charles paid tribute to the \"unimaginable number\" of French civilians killed in the battle for Normandy, and the bravery and sacrifice of the French Resistance.\n\nMAN HONORS A GRANDFATHER HE NEVER KNEW, AN OFFICER WHO SMUGGLED HIMSELF ON A LANDING CRAFT\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Among the thousands who flocked to D-Day beach Utah was the grandson of an American colonel who smuggled himself aboard a landing craft so he could join his men in the first waves of the June 6, 1944, invasion.\n\nJohn Reistrup, 55, never met his grandfather, Eugene M. Caffey, who died in 1961. Coming back to Utah for the 80th anniversary was his way of carrying \"the torch for someone you never met that had such an impact on so many lives.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nA plaque at the beach that honors his grandfather says the colonel led the 19,500 men of the 1st Engineer Special Brigade tasked on that fateful day with the logistics of the landing on Utah, one of five invasion beaches.\n\nNot scheduled to land until 0900, Caffey, a 49-year-old father of nine, had smuggled himself, with no equipment except an empty rifle, aboard an 8th Infantry landing craft. En route he managed to load his rifle by taking up a collection of one bullet each from eight infantrymen. He arrived ashore very early in the assault, Reistrup said.\n\n\"No officers were allowed on the first waves of the landing but he said, 'Hell, no, I'm going with my guys.'\"\n\nA Nazi bunker captured on the beach then became his grandfather's office, he said. Caffey's portrait hangs there, inside, to this day.\n\nForging ahead into fire on D-Day \"has got to be the greatest courage you could ever have,\" said Reistrup, who has visited Normandy about 10 times since his first visit as a kid in 1974.\n\nTHOUSANDS OF PEOPLE DOT FRANCE'S UTAH BEACH FOR D-DAY COMMEMORATIONS\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Thousands of people, including many people in World War II-era uniforms, were stretched for several kilometers (miles) along Utah Beach ahead of commemorations marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings.\n\nUtah was one of the five landing beaches along the coast of Normandy where Allied troops landed on June 6, 2024. Utah and Omaha were taken -- at the cost of hundreds of lives -- by American forces, with the others stormed by troops from Britain and Canada, also killing many hundreds, plus others from France.\n\nThe long stretch of the Normandy coast is where the largest-ever land, sea and air armada punctured Hitler's defenses in Western Europe and helped precipitate his downfall 11 months later.\n\nA fair-like atmosphere is fueled by World War II-era jeeps and trucks tearing down hedge-rowed lanes so deadly for Allied troops who fought dug-in German defenders, and of reenactors playing at war on sands where D-Day soldiers fell.\n\nSurviving veterans, who are around 100 years old now, are the VIPs of the day's events.\n\n'FREEDOM COSTS,' DENMARK'S PRIME MINISTER SAYS AS SHE MARKS D-DAY'S 80TH ANNIVERSARY\n\nCOPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Denmark's prime minister said that this year's observances of the D-Day landings, which come as Russia is at war against Ukraine, are a reminder that there is a price for defending freedom.\n\n\"From D-Day we have learned that freedom costs,\" Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said in a statement as she headed to Normandy for ceremonies marking the 80th anniversary of the Allied landings.\n\n\"Eighty years later, Europe once again finds itself at a fateful moment. Where freedom is once again being fought for on our own continent,\" she said, \"against an aggressive and brutal enemy who will dictate country borders with brute force and leave a trail of death and destruction.\"\n\nIMAGINING THE HORROR AND CELEBRATING FREEDOM\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Because freedom is worth celebrating and passing on to children, too, Alexandra Hamon, 35, drank champagne and shared the sunrise with her boys, Karl and Neils, both 13, as the day dawned Thursday over the beaches where Allied soldiers landed on D-Day.\n\nThe family was among a crowd several thousands strong that stretched for kilometers along Utah beach -- one of the five beaches along the coast of Normandy where Allied troops landed. Utah and Omaha were taken -- at the cost of hundreds of lives -- by American forces, with the others stormed by troops from Britain and Canada, also killing many hundreds, plus others from France. The other code-named beaches are Juno, Sword and Gold.\n\nKarl sat perched on the hood of their 1943 Dodge truck, lovingly restored by her husband, Enogat, as the family from Saint Malo, a French coastal city that was badly damaged in major fighting about two months after D-Day, stared out across the English Channel.\n\nThe waters Thursday were still and peaceful -- unlike on that fateful day that helped change the course of WWII and precipitate Adolf Hitler's downfall 11 months later.\n\n\"It's indescribable, just imagining the chaos. Now it's peaceful, almost festive, we try to imagine but I think it's unimaginable,\" she said.\n\n\"You think of all those guys, everything they went through,\" she added of the fast-dwindling D-Day veterans. \"They say they aren't heroes. But they are, they are. Those guys really should never die. I imagine the boats, the guys arriving, the sounds. It must have been horrible, yes, horrible.\"\n\nKEEPING ALIVE THE MEMORY OF SOLDIERS 'WHO DIED FOR OUR FREEDOM'\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the rising sun took the night's chill off Utah Beach, Christophe Receveur, 57, from Thionville in eastern France, unfurled a Stars and Stripes he bought in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, six months ago specifically to honor the Americans who fell on D-Day.\n\n\"To keep alive the memory of the soldiers who died for our freedom,\" he said. \"To forget them is to let them die all over again.\"\n\nReceveur and his daughter, Julie, 28, carefully folded the flag into a tight triangle after their quiet, reflective homage on an empty stretch of the beach, busy with hundreds of people strung out along the sands.\n\nReceveur said the Ukraine war was on his mind, too, as he honored the fallen of WWII. His great grandfather fought in WWI, his grandfather was a prisoner of war in WWII, and his father was a veteran of France's war in former North African colony Algeria.\n\n\"I don't want our freedom, for our kids, our grandkids, to be hit by ... I don't want to say a madman,\" referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"So a lot of respect for these people who died and for those who are still dying,\" he said of the WWII dead and those in Ukraine.\n\nHe said the D-Day sacrifices have to be remembered. \"Lots of emotion that all these troops came to liberate a country that they didn't know for an ideology -- democracy, freedom -- that is under severe strain now.\"\n\n'WE JUST HAVE TO REMEMBER THE SACRIFICES'\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the golden sun pierced low clouds over the seas that were thick with landing craft approaching Normandy on D-Day, Becky Kraubetz peered across the English Channel toward her native Britain, her eyes filled with tears as she thought about the scene 80 years ago.\n\n\"It's so historic and we just have to remember the sacrifices of everybody who gave us our freedom,\" said Kraubetz, whose grandfather served with the British Army during World War II and was captured in Malta.\n\n\"It gives you goosebumps, everything that happened here. Imagine just jumping into the water, freezing cold,\" said the 54-year-old who now lives in Florida, as the rays of the morning sun started to warm the hundreds of people who'd waited through the night's chill for dawn's break.\n\n\"The bravery, the courage, for people to face that is just unbelievable -- very, very humbled to be here.\"\n\nTHE SUN RISES OVER NORMANDY BEACHES AS THE WORLD REMEMBERS D-DAY\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the sun sets on the D-Day generation, it's rising again over Normandy beaches where soldiers fought and died exactly 80 years ago, kicking off intense anniversary commemorations Thursday against the backdrop of renewed war in Europe, in Ukraine.\n\nEver-dwindling numbers of World War II veterans, and Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, make this anniversary particularly meaningful, mixing poignant remembrances for D-Day sacrifices with an Allied show of solidarity for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, among the guests.\n\nBut host France hasn't invited World War II ally Russia, citing its \"war of aggression against Ukraine that has intensified in recent weeks.\"\n\nHUNDREDS GATHER AT DAWN AT UTAH BEACH TO MARK D-DAY'S 80TH ANNIVERSARY\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Hundreds of people, some in WWII-era uniforms, arrived before dawn to stretch out across the now peaceful sands of Utah Beach, one of the five Allied landing zones on D-Day where troops waded into cold seas through hails of fire exactly 80 years ago.\n\n\"It's our way of paying homage, and better understanding what really happened in the 1944 landings,\" said Dimitri Picot, a 33-year-old from the nearby Normandy town of Carentan who works as a rat and pest catcher.\n\nPicot said he often dives on a wrecked ship that was hit and exploded, its wreckage visible Thursday as night gave way to day. Growing up amid the June 6, 1944, landing zones, he said he has become accustomed to seeing walls still pockmarked by bullets, shrapnel and other reminders of that fateful day.\n\nBut on the 80th anniversary \"to think that they liberated us\" hammered home the emotion, he said.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The U.S. and other countries have been aiding Ukraine by sending weapons, money and other support.\n\nBiden used his speech Thursday to connect what happened during World War II to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\n\nThe president praised the power of alliances and said Russia's advance will not stop with Ukraine if the world walks away. Biden said \"Ukraine's neighbors will be threatened\" and \"all of Europe will be threatened.\"\n\nHe argued for holding strong against Putin, saying \"to surrender to bullies, to bow down to dictators is simply unthinkable\" and that to give in \"means we'd forget what happened here\" on the beaches of Normandy.\n\n11 U.S. VETERANS AWARDED WITH LEGION OF HONOR\n\nCOLLEVILLE-SUR-MER, France -- French President Emmanuel Macron has awarded 11 U.S. WWII veterans with the Legion of Honor, France's highest distinction, during commemorations marking the 80th anniversary of D-Day.\n\n\"You came here because the free world needed each and every one of you, and you answered the call,\" Macron told them. \"You came here to make France a free nation. You're back here today at home, if I may say.\"\n\nThe men are now 98 to 104 years old.\n\nMacron kissed each veteran on both cheeks and greeted them warmly as he pinned medals on their lapels.\n\nAmong the men was Hilbert Margol, who joined an artillery battalion that operated in eastern France. He is part of American forces that liberated the Dachau concentration camp. Another, Ray Tweedel, landed by sea in Normandy on the night of June 8, 1944, and took part in the war as an oil tanker and ambulance driver.\n\nUKRAINE'S ZELENSKYY ARRIVES IN NORMANDY FOR D-DAY EVENTS\n\nOMAHA BEACH, France -- Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has arrived in Normandy, France, to commemorate the anniversary of the D-Day invasion with Western leaders.\n\nZelenskyy said on X that he is going to attend important meetings aimed at strengthening his nation at war, and that he is honored to be participating in the D-Day commemoration with President Joe Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron and others.\n\n\"This event and day serve as a reminder of the courage and determination demonstrated in the pursuit of freedom and democracy,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\n\"Allies defended Europe's freedom then, and Ukrainians do so now. Unity prevailed then, and true unity can prevail today.\"\n\n103-YEAR-OLD FEMALE VETERAN GIVEN LEGION OF HONOR AWARD\n\nVER-SUR-MER, France -- French President Emmanuel Macron bestowed a Legion of Honor award on a 103-year-old female British veteran officer who created detailed maps that guided the crews of landing craft on D-Day.\n\nChristian Lamb sat in a wheelchair as Macron bent down to pin the medal on her and kissed her on both cheeks.\n\nHe told her she was one of the \"heroes in the shadows\" as he described how she was studying in Normandy in 1939 when her father, a Royal Navy admiral, called her back to London on the eve of World War II.\n\nIn a recent interview with The Associated Press, Lamb recalled creating maps that \"showed railways, roads, churches, castles, every possible feature that could be visible to an incoming invader and from every angle,\" Lamb.\n\n\"It was intense and exciting work, and obviously detail was vital. It was crucial that the maps were 100% accurate,\" she said.\n\nPRINCE WILLIAM PRAISES CANADIAN TROOPS IN NORMANDY\n\nJUNO BEACH, France -- Prince William has praised the bravery and sacrifice of Canadian troops as he addressed a D-Day anniversary ceremony on Juno Beach.\n\nThe royal was joined by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal and Canadian D-Day veterans.\n\nSome 14,000 Canadians were part of the 150,000 Allied troops who landed or parachuted into Normandy in 1944.\n\n\"Far from home they stormed these very sand dunes behind me, shoulder to shoulder with thousands of British troops,\" William said.\n\nAddressing veterans at the ceremony, the royal added: \"Thank you for our freedom, and thank you for your service.\"\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN MEETS WITH AMERICAN VETERANS\n\nCOLLEVILLE-SUR-MER, France -- U.S. President Joe Biden met with American veterans of D-Day as he marked the invasion's 80th anniversary.\n\nVeterans who could stand were helped out of wheelchairs to pose for photos with the president and first lady Jill Biden. One hugged Biden, another saluted. When Biden learned it was the birthday of one of the veterans, he led the audience in singing 'Happy Birthday.'\n\nThe first lady clutched the arm of another veteran, Robert Gibson, to help him stand next to Biden as they shook hands. \"Don't get old,\" the 100-year-old man joked to the 81-year-old president, who was a toddler when D-Day took place.\n\nSteve Spielberg and Tom Hanks, the Hollywood heavyweights behind movies and television shows about World War II, were nearby.\n\nKING CHARLES AND QUEEN CAMILLA LEAD D-DAY COMMEMORATIONS AT NEW MEMORIAL IN FRANCE\n\nVER-SUR-MER, France -- King Charles III and Queen Camilla led commemorations at the new British Normandy Memorial in Ver-sur-Mer.\n\nCamilla wiped away a tear as actor Martin Freeman read words by 99-year-old D-Day veteran Joe Mines, recalling that \"I was 19 when I landed, but I was still a boy. I don't care what people say, I wasn't a man, I was a boy. And I didn't have any idea of war and killing.\"\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak and Labour Party leader Keir Starmer took a break from campaigning for Britain's July 4 election to travel to France for the ceremony.\n\nSunak paid tribute to veterans, saying their \"actions freed a continent and built a better world.\"\n\n\"You risked everything and we owe you everything,\" he said. \"We cannot possibly hope to repay that debt but we can and we must pledge never to forget.\"\n\nWelsh singer Tom Jones, 83, sang his song \"I Won't Crumble With You If You Fall,\" before the king addressed the audience in French and English.\n\nCharles said that while the number of living veterans was dwindling, \"our obligation to remember what they stood for and what they achieved for us all can never diminish.\"\n\nSpeaking in French, Charles paid tribute to the \"unimaginable number\" of French civilians killed in the battle for Normandy, and the bravery and sacrifice of the French Resistance.\n\nMAN HONORS A GRANDFATHER HE NEVER KNEW, AN OFFICER WHO SMUGGLED HIMSELF ON A LANDING CRAFT\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Among the thousands who flocked to D-Day beach Utah was the grandson of an American colonel who smuggled himself aboard a landing craft so he could join his men in the first waves of the June 6, 1944, invasion.\n\nJohn Reistrup, 55, never met his grandfather, Eugene M. Caffey, who died in 1961. Coming back to Utah for the 80th anniversary was his way of carrying \"the torch for someone you never met that had such an impact on so many lives.\"\n\nA plaque at the beach that honors his grandfather says the colonel led the 19,500 men of the 1st Engineer Special Brigade tasked on that fateful day with the logistics of the landing on Utah, one of five invasion beaches.\n\nNot scheduled to land until 0900, Caffey, a 49-year-old father of nine, had smuggled himself, with no equipment except an empty rifle, aboard an 8th Infantry landing craft. En route he managed to load his rifle by taking up a collection of one bullet each from eight infantrymen. He arrived ashore very early in the assault, Reistrup said.\n\n\"No officers were allowed on the first waves of the landing but he said, 'Hell, no, I'm going with my guys.'\"\n\nA Nazi bunker captured on the beach then became his grandfather's office, he said. Caffey's portrait hangs there, inside, to this day.\n\nForging ahead into fire on D-Day \"has got to be the greatest courage you could ever have,\" said Reistrup, who has visited Normandy about 10 times since his first visit as a kid in 1974.\n\nTHOUSANDS OF PEOPLE DOT FRANCE'S UTAH BEACH FOR D-DAY COMMEMORATIONS\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Thousands of people, including many people in World War II-era uniforms, were stretched for several kilometers (miles) along Utah Beach ahead of commemorations marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings.\n\nUtah was one of the five landing beaches along the coast of Normandy where Allied troops landed on June 6, 2024. Utah and Omaha were taken -- at the cost of hundreds of lives -- by American forces, with the others stormed by troops from Britain and Canada, also killing many hundreds, plus others from France.\n\nThe long stretch of the Normandy coast is where the largest-ever land, sea and air armada punctured Hitler's defenses in Western Europe and helped precipitate his downfall 11 months later.\n\nA fair-like atmosphere is fueled by World War II-era jeeps and trucks tearing down hedge-rowed lanes so deadly for Allied troops who fought dug-in German defenders, and of reenactors playing at war on sands where D-Day soldiers fell.\n\nSurviving veterans, who are around 100 years old now, are the VIPs of the day's events.\n\n'FREEDOM COSTS,' DENMARK'S PRIME MINISTER SAYS AS SHE MARKS D-DAY'S 80TH ANNIVERSARY\n\nCOPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Denmark's prime minister said that this year's observances of the D-Day landings, which come as Russia is at war against Ukraine, are a reminder that there is a price for defending freedom.\n\n\"From D-Day we have learned that freedom costs,\" Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said in a statement as she headed to Normandy for ceremonies marking the 80th anniversary of the Allied landings.\n\n\"Eighty years later, Europe once again finds itself at a fateful moment. Where freedom is once again being fought for on our own continent,\" she said, \"against an aggressive and brutal enemy who will dictate country borders with brute force and leave a trail of death and destruction.\"\n\nIMAGINING THE HORROR AND CELEBRATING FREEDOM\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Because freedom is worth celebrating and passing on to children, too, Alexandra Hamon, 35, drank champagne and shared the sunrise with her boys, Karl and Neils, both 13, as the day dawned Thursday over the beaches where Allied soldiers landed on D-Day.\n\nThe family was among a crowd several thousands strong that stretched for kilometers along Utah beach -- one of the five beaches along the coast of Normandy where Allied troops landed. Utah and Omaha were taken -- at the cost of hundreds of lives -- by American forces, with the others stormed by troops from Britain and Canada, also killing many hundreds, plus others from France. The other code-named beaches are Juno, Sword and Gold.\n\nKarl sat perched on the hood of their 1943 Dodge truck, lovingly restored by her husband, Enogat, as the family from Saint Malo, a French coastal city that was badly damaged in major fighting about two months after D-Day, stared out across the English Channel.\n\nThe waters Thursday were still and peaceful -- unlike on that fateful day that helped change the course of WWII and precipitate Adolf Hitler's downfall 11 months later.\n\n\"It's indescribable, just imagining the chaos. Now it's peaceful, almost festive, we try to imagine but I think it's unimaginable,\" she said.\n\n\"You think of all those guys, everything they went through,\" she added of the fast-dwindling D-Day veterans. \"They say they aren't heroes. But they are, they are.\"\n\nKEEPING ALIVE THE MEMORY OF SOLDIERS 'WHO DIED FOR OUR FREEDOM'\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the rising sun took the night's chill off Utah Beach, Christophe Receveur, 57, from Thionville in eastern France, unfurled a Stars and Stripes he bought in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, six months ago specifically to honor the Americans who fell on D-Day.\n\n\"To keep alive the memory of the soldiers who died for our freedom,\" he said. \"To forget them is to let them die all over again.\"\n\nReceveur and his daughter, Julie, 28, carefully folded the flag into a tight triangle after their quiet, reflective homage on an empty stretch of the beach, busy with hundreds of people strung out along the sands.\n\nReceveur said the Ukraine war was on his mind, too, as he honored the fallen of WWII. His great grandfather fought in WWI, his grandfather was a prisoner of war in WWII, and his father was a veteran of France's war in former North African colony Algeria.\n\n\"I don't want our freedom, for our kids, our grandkids, to be hit by ... I don't want to say a madman,\" referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"So a lot of respect for these people who died and for those who are still dying,\" he said of the WWII dead and those in Ukraine.\n\n'WE JUST HAVE TO REMEMBER THE SACRIFICES'\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the golden sun pierced low clouds over the seas that were thick with landing craft approaching Normandy on D-Day, Becky Kraubetz peered across the English Channel toward her native Britain, her eyes filled with tears as she thought about the scene 80 years ago.\n\n\"It's so historic and we just have to remember the sacrifices of everybody who gave us our freedom,\" said Kraubetz, whose grandfather served with the British Army during World War II and was captured in Malta.\n\n\"It gives you goosebumps, everything that happened here. Imagine just jumping into the water, freezing cold,\" said the 54-year-old who now lives in Florida, as the rays of the morning sun started to warm the hundreds of people who'd waited through the night's chill for dawn's break.\n\n\"The bravery, the courage, for people to face that is just unbelievable -- very, very humbled to be here.\"\n\nTHE SUN RISES OVER NORMANDY BEACHES AS THE WORLD REMEMBERS D-DAY\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the sun sets on the D-Day generation, it's rising again over Normandy beaches where soldiers fought and died exactly 80 years ago, kicking off intense anniversary commemorations Thursday against the backdrop of renewed war in Europe, in Ukraine.\n\nEver-dwindling numbers of World War II veterans, and Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, make this anniversary particularly meaningful, mixing poignant remembrances for D-Day sacrifices with an Allied show of solidarity for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, among the guests.\n\nBut host France hasn't invited World War II ally Russia, citing its \"war of aggression against Ukraine that has intensified in recent weeks.\"\n\nHUNDREDS GATHER AT DAWN AT UTAH BEACH TO MARK D-DAY'S 80TH ANNIVERSARY\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Hundreds of people, some in WWII-era uniforms, arrived before dawn to stretch out across the now peaceful sands of Utah Beach, one of the five Allied landing zones on D-Day where troops waded into cold seas through hails of fire exactly 80 years ago.\n\n\"It's our way of paying homage, and better understanding what really happened in the 1944 landings,\" said Dimitri Picot, a 33-year-old from the nearby Normandy town of Carentan who works as a rat and pest catcher.\n\nPicot said he often dives on a wrecked ship that was hit and exploded, its wreckage visible Thursday as night gave way to day. Growing up amid the June 6, 1944, landing zones, he said he has become accustomed to seeing walls still pockmarked by bullets, shrapnel and other reminders of that fateful day.\n\nBut on the 80th anniversary \"to think that they liberated us\" hammered home the emotion, he said.", "source": {"uri": "wxow.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WXOW"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Nearly 160,000 Allied troops landed in Normandy on the day. Of those, 73,000 were from the United States, 83,000 from Britain and Canada. Forces from several other countries were also involved, including French troops. The Allies faced around 50,000 German forces. File Image/AP\n\nThursday (6 June, 2024), marks the 80th anniversary of D-Day, the Allied invasion of Nazi-occupied Normandy, France, during World War II. This momentous event, codenamed Operation Overlord, was unprecedented in its scale and strategic importance, ultimately leading to the downfall of Nazi Germany.\n\nThis year's 80th anniversary is particularly poignant as it may be the last major commemoration involving living veterans, given their advanced ages, reported CNN. Approximately 150 American veterans, 15 Canadian veterans, and more than 40 British WWII veterans are expected to attend the events in Normandy.\n\nThese veterans, now in their late 90s and beyond, will be joined by around 25 heads of state and government, including US President Joe Biden, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Russian President Vladimir Putin was not invited due to the ongoing war in Ukraine, but Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is expected to attend.\n\nThe French Interior Ministry has deployed a massive contingent of 12,000 security personnel to ensure the safety of the attendees.\n\nAs the world commemorates this historic day, we delve into the details of the invasion, the sacrifices made, and the message it sends to this day:\n\nWhat is D-Day?\n\nOriginally slated for 5 June, 1944, when favorable conditions of a full moon, low tides, and good weather were anticipated, D-Day faced a 24-hour delay due to storms.\n\nIn military terminology, 'D-Day' served as a code for the onset of a significant military operation, with the initial 'D' representing 'Day.' Essentially, 'D-Day' translates to 'Day-Day.' Prior to the Allied invasion in June 1944, the term 'D-Day' was relatively common. However, following Operation Overlord, the two became synonymous, and 'D-Day' now universally denotes the initiation of this operation.\n\nD-Day witnessed an unparalleled collaboration among international armed forces, with over 2 million troops stationed in the UK in readiness for the invasion, as per the Imperial War Museums (IWM).\n\nAlthough primarily comprised of American, British, and Canadian troops, reports from the IWM indicate the presence of forces from Australia, Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Greece, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), and Poland in the Operation Overlord campaign.\n\nA look at the invasion: Planning, execution and deception\n\nThe planning for D-Day began over a year in advance and involved substantial military deception to mislead the Germans about the time and place of the invasion. This deception strategy, known as Operation Bodyguard, included Operation Fortitude, which aimed to convince the Nazis that the main invasion would occur in Norway (Fortitude North) and Pas de Calais (Fortitude South), not Normandy.\n\nAlso Read: Top 10 deadliest World War II battles\n\nOn 6 June, 1944, at 6:30 am, the largest amphibious assault in history commenced. Nearly 160,000 Allied troops, including 73,000 Americans and 83,000 from Britain and Canada, landed on five code-named beaches: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno, and Sword. Supporting these troops were around 11,000 aircraft, 7,000 ships and boats, and thousands of other vehicles.\n\nFactoring in the human cost: Sacrifices and casualties\n\nThe human cost of D-Day was immense. On that single day, 4,414 Allied troops were killed, including 2,501 Americans, with more than 5,000 wounded. German casualties are estimated to be between 4,000 and 9,000. The ensuing Battle of Normandy, which lasted 77 days, saw 73,000 Allied forces killed and 153,000 wounded. Additionally, around 20,000 French civilians were killed due to Allied bombings.\n\nAmong the many stories of bravery and sacrifice, the \"Bedford Boys\" from Bedford, Virginia, stand out. Of the 44 men from Bedford who stormed the beaches, 20 were killed on D-Day, marking the highest per capita D-Day loss in the United States.\n\nTurning the tide of World War II\n\nD-Day is often referred to as the \"beginning of the end\" of Hitler's regime. The successful landings allowed the Allies to establish a foothold in Western Europe, leading to the liberation of France and the eventual defeat of Nazi Germany.\n\nThe operation's success was crucial in ensuring that the Allies could continue their advance into Europe. On 7 May, 1945, less than a year after D-Day, Nazi Germany surrendered unconditionally, marking the end of World War II in Europe.\n\nThis year's commemoration is especially significant given the current geopolitical climate, with a major ground war once again raging in Europe due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.", "source": {"uri": "firstpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Firstpost"},

The day altered the trajectory of World War II and sent more than 70,000 American troops overseas to combat the Nazis.\n\nD-Day marks the largest amphibious landing in military history. Within days of D-Day, around 326,000 troops and more than 50,000 vehicles landed on the beaches of Normandy, according to History.com. The Nazis surrendered 11 months after the invasion.\n\nWhat should you know about the day historians consider the beginning of the end of World War II?\n\nWhen was D-Day?\n\nD-Day took place on June 6, 1944. Thursday marks the 80th anniversary of the historic date.\n\nMore: With most of Iowa's D-Day veterans gone, their bravery and sacrifice are still remembered\n\nWhat is D-Day?\n\nD-Day marks the day when the Allied Forces including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and others invaded the beaches of Normandy during World War II. The attack was on both land and water with roughly 156,000 Allied soldiers landing on the beaches of Normandy by the end of the day, according to History.com. There were roughly 4,000 Allied troops killed by German soldiers, according to History.com.\n\nThe hard-fought battle began to pay off by August 1944 when all of northern France was liberated. By the spring of 1945, the Allies won and the Germans surrendered.\n\nHow many Iowans were in D-Day?\n\nThe total number of Iowans who fought in D-Day is still undetermined. However, there are more than 180 Iowans buried in the American Cemetery in Normandy, said Arizona State University history professor Jacob Flaws, an Iowa native.\n\nWhere is Normandy beach?\n\nThe beaches of Normandy, France, are located in northwestern Europe. The Allied troops used code names for the 50-miles stretch of the Normandy coast. The five code names were Utah Beach, Omaha Beach, Gold Beach, Sword Beach and Juno Beach.\n\nWhat does D-Day stand for?\n\nThere are different opinions from experts for what the \"D'\" in D-Day stands for, according to the U.S Department of Defense. Some say the D stood for \"day,\" which was a code used for any major military operation. While others believe it's just an alliteration of \"H-Hour,\" which is when a military assault begins, according to the DOD.", "source": {"uri": "desmoinesregister.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Des Moines Register"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy_landings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Normandy landings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nazism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphibious_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amphibious warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Iowa"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberation_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Liberation of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Beach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gold Beach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword_Beach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sword Beach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha_Beach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Omaha Beach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_Beach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Utah Beach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_Beach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Juno Beach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_operation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Military operation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Defense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Trade_Shows", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Trade Shows", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Cao_Dai", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Cao Dai", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/06/05/USAT/f6f2f6c0-5dfe-4aaa-afd2-3d856a0b220c-18849.jpg?auto=webp&crop=2829,1582,x0,y238&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628959", "eventUri": "eng-9628959", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

Caffey, who died in 1961. Coming back to Utah for the 80th anniversary was his way of carrying \"the torch for someone you never met that had such an impact on so many lives.\"\n\nA plaque at the beach that honors his grandfather says the colonel led the 19,500 men of the 1st Engineer Special Brigade tasked on that fateful day with the logistics of the landing on Utah, one of five invasion beaches.\n\nNot scheduled to land until 0900, Caffey, a 49-year-old father of nine, had smuggled himself, with no equipment except an empty rifle, aboard an 8th Infantry landing craft. En route he managed to load his rifle by taking up a collection of one bullet each from eight infantrymen. He arrived ashore very early in the assault, Reistrup said.\n\n\"No officers were allowed on the first waves of the landing but he said, 'Hell, no, I'm going with my guys.'\"\n\nA Nazi bunker captured on the beach then became his grandfather's office, he said. Caffey's portrait hangs there, inside, to this day.\n\nForging ahead into fire on D-Day \"has got to be the greatest courage you could ever have,\" said Reistrup, who has visited Normandy about 10 times since his first visit as a kid in 1974.\n\nTHOUSANDS OF PEOPLE DOT FRANCE'S UTAH BEACH FOR D-DAY COMMEMORATIONS\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Thousands of people, including many people in World War II-era uniforms, were stretched for several kilometers (miles) along Utah Beach ahead of commemorations marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings.\n\nUtah was one of the five landing beaches along the coast of Normandy where Allied troops landed on June 6, 2024. Utah and Omaha were taken -- at the cost of hundreds of lives -- by American forces, with the others stormed by troops from Britain and Canada, also killing many hundreds, plus others from France.\n\nThe long stretch of the Normandy coast is where the largest-ever land, sea and air armada punctured Hitler's defenses in Western Europe and helped precipitate his downfall 11 months later.\n\nA fair-like atmosphere is fueled by World War II-era jeeps and trucks tearing down hedge-rowed lanes so deadly for Allied troops who fought dug-in German defenders, and of reenactors playing at war on sands where D-Day soldiers fell.\n\nSurviving veterans, who are around 100 years old now, are the VIPs of the day's events.\n\n'FREEDOM COSTS,' DENMARK'S PRIME MINISTER SAYS AS SHE MARKS D-DAY'S 80TH ANNIVERSARY\n\nCOPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Denmark's prime minister said that this year's observances of the D-Day landings, which come as Russia is at war against Ukraine, are a reminder that there is a price for defending freedom.\n\n\"From D-Day we have learned that freedom costs,\" Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said in a statement as she headed to Normandy for ceremonies marking the 80th anniversary of the Allied landings.\n\n\"Eighty years later, Europe once again finds itself at a fateful moment. Where freedom is once again being fought for on our own continent,\" she said, \"against an aggressive and brutal enemy who will dictate country borders with brute force and leave a trail of death and destruction.\"\n\nIMAGINING THE HORROR AND CELEBRATING FREEDOM\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Because freedom is worth celebrating and passing on to children, too, Alexandra Hamon, 35, drank champagne and shared the sunrise with her boys, Karl and Neils, both 13, as the day dawned Thursday over the beaches where Allied soldiers landed on D-Day.\n\nThe family was among a crowd several thousands strong that stretched for kilometers along Utah beach -- one of the five beaches along the coast of Normandy where Allied troops landed. Utah and Omaha were taken -- at the cost of hundreds of lives -- by American forces, with the others stormed by troops from Britain and Canada, also killing many hundreds, plus others from France. The other code-named beaches are Juno, Sword and Gold.\n\nKarl sat perched on the hood of their 1943 Dodge truck, lovingly restored by her husband, Enogat, as the family from Saint Malo, a French coastal city that was badly damaged in major fighting about two months after D-Day, stared out across the English Channel.\n\nThe waters Thursday were still and peaceful -- unlike on that fateful day that helped change the course of WWII and precipitate Adolf Hitler's downfall 11 months later.\n\n\"It's indescribable, just imagining the chaos. Now it's peaceful, almost festive, we try to imagine but I think it's unimaginable,\" she said.\n\n\"You think of all those guys, everything they went through,\" she added of the fast-dwindling D-Day veterans. \"They say they aren't heroes. But they are, they are. Those guys really should never die. I imagine the boats, the guys arriving, the sounds. It must have been horrible, yes, horrible.\"\n\nKEEPING ALIVE THE MEMORY OF SOLDIERS 'WHO DIED FOR OUR FREEDOM'\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the rising sun took the night's chill off Utah Beach, Christophe Receveur, 57, from Thionville in eastern France, unfurled a Stars and Stripes he bought in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, six months ago specifically to honor the Americans who fell on D-Day.\n\n\"To keep alive the memory of the soldiers who died for our freedom,\" he said. \"To forget them is to let them die all over again.\"\n\nReceveur and his daughter, Julie, 28, carefully folded the flag into a tight triangle after their quiet, reflective homage on an empty stretch of the beach, busy with hundreds of people strung out along the sands.\n\nReceveur said the Ukraine war was on his mind, too, as he honored the fallen of WWII. His great grandfather fought in WWI, his grandfather was a prisoner of war in WWII, and his father was a veteran of France's war in former North African colony Algeria.\n\n\"I don't want our freedom, for our kids, our grandkids, to be hit by ... I don't want to say a madman,\" referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"So a lot of respect for these people who died and for those who are still dying,\" he said of the WWII dead and those in Ukraine.\n\nHe said the D-Day sacrifices have to be remembered. \"Lots of emotion that all these troops came to liberate a country that they didn't know for an ideology -- democracy, freedom -- that is under severe strain now.\"\n\n'WE JUST HAVE TO REMEMBER THE SACRIFICES'\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the golden sun pierced low clouds over the seas that were thick with landing craft approaching Normandy on D-Day, Becky Kraubetz peered across the English Channel toward her native Britain, her eyes filled with tears as she thought about the scene 80 years ago.\n\n\"It's so historic and we just have to remember the sacrifices of everybody who gave us our freedom,\" said Kraubetz, whose grandfather served with the British Army during World War II and was captured in Malta.\n\n\"It gives you goosebumps, everything that happened here. Imagine just jumping into the water, freezing cold,\" said the 54-year-old who now lives in Florida, as the rays of the morning sun started to warm the hundreds of people who'd waited through the night's chill for dawn's break.\n\n\"The bravery, the courage, for people to face that is just unbelievable -- very, very humbled to be here.\"\n\nTHE SUN RISES OVER NORMANDY BEACHES AS THE WORLD REMEMBERS D-DAY\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the sun sets on the D-Day generation, it's rising again over Normandy beaches where soldiers fought and died exactly 80 years ago, kicking off intense anniversary commemorations Thursday against the backdrop of renewed war in Europe, in Ukraine.\n\nEver-dwindling numbers of World War II veterans, and Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, make this anniversary particularly meaningful, mixing poignant remembrances for D-Day sacrifices with an Allied show of solidarity for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, among the guests.\n\nBut host France hasn't invited World War II ally Russia, citing its \"war of aggression against Ukraine that has intensified in recent weeks.\"\n\nHUNDREDS GATHER AT DAWN AT UTAH BEACH TO MARK D-DAY'S 80TH ANNIVERSARY\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Hundreds of people, some in WWII-era uniforms, arrived before dawn to stretch out across the now peaceful sands of Utah Beach, one of the five Allied landing zones on D-Day where troops waded into cold seas through hails of fire exactly 80 years ago.\n\n\"It's our way of paying homage, and better understanding what really happened in the 1944 landings,\" said Dimitri Picot, a 33-year-old from the nearby Normandy town of Carentan who works as a rat and pest catcher.\n\nPicot said he often dives on a wrecked ship that was hit and exploded, its wreckage visible Thursday as night gave way to day. Growing up amid the June 6, 1944, landing zones, he said he has become accustomed to seeing walls still pockmarked by bullets, shrapnel and other reminders of that fateful day.\n\nBut on the 80th anniversary \"to think that they liberated us\" hammered home the emotion, he said.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Where freedom is once again being fought for on our own continent,\" she said, \"against an aggressive and brutal enemy who will dictate country borders with brute force and leave a trail of death and destruction.\"\n\nIMAGINING THE HORROR AND CELEBRATING FREEDOM\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Because freedom is worth celebrating and passing on to children, too, Alexandra Hamon, 35, drank champagne and shared the sunrise with her boys, Karl and Neils, both 13, as the day dawned Thursday over the beaches where Allied soldiers landed on D-Day.\n\nThe family was among a crowd several thousands strong that stretched for kilometers along Utah beach -- one of the five beaches along the coast of Normandy where Allied troops landed. Utah and Omaha were taken -- at the cost of hundreds of lives -- by American forces, with the others stormed by troops from Britain and Canada, also killing many hundreds, plus others from France. The other code-named beaches are Juno, Sword and Gold.\n\nKarl sat perched on the hood of their 1943 Dodge truck, lovingly restored by her husband, Enogat, as the family from Saint Malo, a French coastal city that was badly damaged in major fighting about two months after D-Day, stared out across the English Channel.\n\nThe waters Thursday were still and peaceful -- unlike on that fateful day that helped change the course of WWII and precipitate Adolf Hitler's downfall 11 months later.\n\n\"It's indescribable, just imagining the chaos. Now it's peaceful, almost festive, we try to imagine but I think it's unimaginable,\" she said.\n\n\"You think of all those guys, everything they went through,\" she added of the fast-dwindling D-Day veterans. \"They say they aren't heroes. But they are, they are. Those guys really should never die. I imagine the boats, the guys arriving, the sounds. It must have been horrible, yes, horrible.\"\n\nKEEPING ALIVE THE MEMORY OF SOLDIERS 'WHO DIED FOR OUR FREEDOM'\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the rising sun took the night's chill off Utah Beach, Christophe Receveur, 57, from Thionville in eastern France, unfurled a Stars and Stripes he bought in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, six months ago specifically to honor the Americans who fell on D-Day.\n\n\"To keep alive the memory of the soldiers who died for our freedom,\" he said. \"To forget them is to let them die all over again.\"\n\nReceveur and his daughter, Julie, 28, carefully folded the flag into a tight triangle after their quiet, reflective homage on an empty stretch of the beach, busy with hundreds of people strung out along the sands.\n\nReceveur said the Ukraine war was on his mind, too, as he honored the fallen of WWII. His great grandfather fought in WWI, his grandfather was a prisoner of war in WWII, and his father was a veteran of France's war in former North African colony Algeria.\n\n\"I don't want our freedom, for our kids, our grandkids, to be hit by ... I don't want to say a madman,\" referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"So a lot of respect for these people who died and for those who are still dying,\" he said of the WWII dead and those in Ukraine.\n\nHe said the D-Day sacrifices have to be remembered. \"Lots of emotion that all these troops came to liberate a country that they didn't know for an ideology -- democracy, freedom -- that is under severe strain now.\"\n\n'WE JUST HAVE TO REMEMBER THE SACRIFICES'\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the golden sun pierced low clouds over the seas that were thick with landing craft approaching Normandy on D-Day, Becky Kraubetz peered across the English Channel toward her native Britain, her eyes filled with tears as she thought about the scene 80 years ago.\n\n\"It's so historic and we just have to remember the sacrifices of everybody who gave us our freedom,\" said Kraubetz, whose grandfather served with the British Army during World War II and was captured in Malta.\n\n\"It gives you goosebumps, everything that happened here. Imagine just jumping into the water, freezing cold,\" said the 54-year-old who now lives in Florida, as the rays of the morning sun started to warm the hundreds of people who'd waited through the night's chill for dawn's break.\n\n\"The bravery, the courage, for people to face that is just unbelievable -- very, very humbled to be here.\"\n\nTHE SUN RISES OVER NORMANDY BEACHES AS THE WORLD REMEMBERS D-DAY\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the sun sets on the D-Day generation, it's rising again over Normandy beaches where soldiers fought and died exactly 80 years ago, kicking off intense anniversary commemorations Thursday against the backdrop of renewed war in Europe, in Ukraine.\n\nEver-dwindling numbers of World War II veterans, and Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, make this anniversary particularly meaningful, mixing poignant remembrances for D-Day sacrifices with an Allied show of solidarity for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, among the guests.\n\nBut host France hasn't invited World War II ally Russia, citing its \"war of aggression against Ukraine that has intensified in recent weeks.\"\n\nHUNDREDS GATHER AT DAWN AT UTAH BEACH TO MARK D-DAY'S 80TH ANNIVERSARY\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Hundreds of people, some in WWII-era uniforms, arrived before dawn to stretch out across the now peaceful sands of Utah Beach, one of the five Allied landing zones on D-Day where troops waded into cold seas through hails of fire exactly 80 years ago.\n\n\"It's our way of paying homage, and better understanding what really happened in the 1944 landings,\" said Dimitri Picot, a 33-year-old from the nearby Normandy town of Carentan who works as a rat and pest catcher.\n\nPicot said he often dives on a wrecked ship that was hit and exploded, its wreckage visible Thursday as night gave way to day. Growing up amid the June 6, 1944, landing zones, he said he has become accustomed to seeing walls still pockmarked by bullets, shrapnel and other reminders of that fateful day.\n\nBut on the 80th anniversary \"to think that they liberated us\" hammered home the emotion, he said.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The assault began with Allied aircraft bombing German defenses in Normandy, followed by around 1,200 aircraft that carried airborne troops. As dawn broke, Allied forces started bombing German coastal defenses and shortly after that vessels began putting troops ashore on five codenamed beaches: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword.

When Biden learned it was the birthday of one of the veterans, he led the audience in singing 'Happy Birthday.'\n\nThe first lady clutched the arm of another veteran, Robert Gibson, to help him stand next to Biden as they shook hands. \"Don't get old,\" the 100-year-old man joked to the 81-year-old president, who was a toddler when D-Day took place.\n\nSteve Spielberg and Tom Hanks, the Hollywood heavyweights behind movies and television shows about World War II, were nearby.\n\nKING CHARLES AND QUEEN CAMILLA LEAD D-DAY COMMEMORATIONS AT NEW MEMORIAL IN FRANCE\n\nVER-SUR-MER, France -- King Charles III and Queen Camilla led commemorations at the new British Normandy Memorial in Ver-sur-Mer.\n\nCamilla wiped away a tear as actor Martin Freeman read words by 99-year-old D-Day veteran Joe Mines, recalling that \"I was 19 when I landed, but I was still a boy.

Caffey, who died in 1961. Coming back to Utah for the 80th anniversary was his way of carrying \"the torch for someone you never met that had such an impact on so many lives.\"\n\nA plaque at the beach that honors his grandfather says the colonel led the 19,500 men of the 1st Engineer Special Brigade tasked on that fateful day with the logistics of the landing on Utah, one of five invasion beaches.\n\nNot scheduled to land until 0900, Caffey, a 49-year-old father of nine, had smuggled himself, with no equipment except an empty rifle, aboard an 8th Infantry landing craft. En route he managed to load his rifle by taking up a collection of one bullet each from eight infantrymen. He arrived ashore very early in the assault, Reistrup said.\n\n\"No officers were allowed on the first waves of the landing but he said, 'Hell, no, I'm going with my guys.'\"\n\nA Nazi bunker captured on the beach then became his grandfather's office, he said.

Where freedom is once again being fought for on our own continent,\" she said, \"against an aggressive and brutal enemy who will dictate country borders with brute force and leave a trail of death and destruction.\"\n\nIMAGINING THE HORROR AND CELEBRATING FREEDOM\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Because freedom is worth celebrating and passing on to children, too, Alexandra Hamon, 35, drank champagne and shared the sunrise with her boys, Karl and Neils, both 13, as the day dawned Thursday over the beaches where Allied soldiers landed on D-Day.\n\nThe family was among a crowd several thousands strong that stretched for kilometers along Utah beach -- one of the five beaches along the coast of Normandy where Allied troops landed. Utah and Omaha were taken -- at the cost of hundreds of lives -- by American forces, with the others stormed by troops from Britain and Canada, also killing many hundreds, plus others from France. The other code-named beaches are Juno, Sword and Gold.\n\nKarl sat perched on the hood of their 1943 Dodge truck, lovingly restored by her husband, Enogat, as the family from Saint Malo, a French coastal city that was badly damaged in major fighting about two months after D-Day, stared out across the English Channel.\n\nThe waters Thursday were still and peaceful -- unlike on that fateful day that helped change the course of WWII and precipitate Adolf Hitler's downfall 11 months later.\n\n\"It's indescribable, just imagining the chaos. Now it's peaceful, almost festive, we try to imagine but I think it's unimaginable,\" she said.\n\n\"You think of all those guys, everything they went through,\" she added of the fast-dwindling D-Day veterans. \"They say they aren't heroes. But they are, they are. Those guys really should never die. I imagine the boats, the guys arriving, the sounds. It must have been horrible, yes, horrible.\"\n\nKEEPING ALIVE THE MEMORY OF SOLDIERS 'WHO DIED FOR OUR FREEDOM'\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the rising sun took the night's chill off Utah Beach, Christophe Receveur, 57, from Thionville in eastern France, unfurled a Stars and Stripes he bought in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, six months ago specifically to honor the Americans who fell on D-Day.\n\n\"To keep alive the memory of the soldiers who died for our freedom,\" he said. \"To forget them is to let them die all over again.\"\n\nReceveur and his daughter, Julie, 28, carefully folded the flag into a tight triangle after their quiet, reflective homage on an empty stretch of the beach, busy with hundreds of people strung out along the sands.\n\nReceveur said the Ukraine war was on his mind, too, as he honored the fallen of WWII. His great grandfather fought in WWI, his grandfather was a prisoner of war in WWII, and his father was a veteran of France's war in former North African colony Algeria.\n\n\"I don't want our freedom, for our kids, our grandkids, to be hit by ... I don't want to say a madman,\" referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"So a lot of respect for these people who died and for those who are still dying,\" he said of the WWII dead and those in Ukraine.\n\nHe said the D-Day sacrifices have to be remembered. \"Lots of emotion that all these troops came to liberate a country that they didn't know for an ideology -- democracy, freedom -- that is under severe strain now.\"\n\n'WE JUST HAVE TO REMEMBER THE SACRIFICES'\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the golden sun pierced low clouds over the seas that were thick with landing craft approaching Normandy on D-Day, Becky Kraubetz peered across the English Channel toward her native Britain, her eyes filled with tears as she thought about the scene 80 years ago.\n\n\"It's so historic and we just have to remember the sacrifices of everybody who gave us our freedom,\" said Kraubetz, whose grandfather served with the British Army during World War II and was captured in Malta.\n\n\"It gives you goosebumps, everything that happened here. Imagine just jumping into the water, freezing cold,\" said the 54-year-old who now lives in Florida, as the rays of the morning sun started to warm the hundreds of people who'd waited through the night's chill for dawn's break.\n\n\"The bravery, the courage, for people to face that is just unbelievable -- very, very humbled to be here.\"\n\nTHE SUN RISES OVER NORMANDY BEACHES AS THE WORLD REMEMBERS D-DAY\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the sun sets on the D-Day generation, it's rising again over Normandy beaches where soldiers fought and died exactly 80 years ago, kicking off intense anniversary commemorations Thursday against the backdrop of renewed war in Europe, in Ukraine.\n\nEver-dwindling numbers of World War II veterans, and Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, make this anniversary particularly meaningful, mixing poignant remembrances for D-Day sacrifices with an Allied show of solidarity for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, among the guests.\n\nBut host France hasn't invited World War II ally Russia, citing its \"war of aggression against Ukraine that has intensified in recent weeks.\"\n\nHUNDREDS GATHER AT DAWN AT UTAH BEACH TO MARK D-DAY'S 80TH ANNIVERSARY\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Hundreds of people, some in WWII-era uniforms, arrived before dawn to stretch out across the now peaceful sands of Utah Beach, one of the five Allied landing zones on D-Day where troops waded into cold seas through hails of fire exactly 80 years ago.\n\n\"It's our way of paying homage, and better understanding what really happened in the 1944 landings,\" said Dimitri Picot, a 33-year-old from the nearby Normandy town of Carentan who works as a rat and pest catcher.\n\nPicot said he often dives on a wrecked ship that was hit and exploded, its wreckage visible Thursday as night gave way to day. Growing up amid the June 6, 1944, landing zones, he said he has become accustomed to seeing walls still pockmarked by bullets, shrapnel and other reminders of that fateful day.\n\nBut on the 80th anniversary \"to think that they liberated us\" hammered home the emotion, he said.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The assault began with Allied aircraft bombing German defenses in Normandy, followed by around 1,200 aircraft that carried airborne troops. As dawn broke, Allied forces started bombing German coastal defenses and shortly after that vessels began putting troops ashore on five codenamed beaches: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword. By the end of the day, nearly 160,000 Allied troops had landed in Normandy, although there were thousands of casualties.\n\nFew witnesses to history's biggest amphibious invasion remain alive today.\n\nHere's the latest:\n\n103-YEAR-OLD FEMALE VETERAN GIVEN LEGION OF HONOR AWARD\n\nVER-SUR-MER, France -- French President Emmanuel Macron bestowed a Legion of Honor award on a 103-year-old female British veteran officer who created detailed maps that guided the crews of landing craft on D-Day.\n\nChristian Lamb sat in a wheelchair as Macron bent down to pin the medal on her and kissed her on both cheeks.\n\nHe told her she was one of the \"heroes in the shadows\" as he described how she was studying in Normandy in 1939 when her father, a Royal Navy admiral, called her back to London on the eve of World War II.\n\nIn a recent interview with The Associated Press, Lamb recalled creating maps that \"showed railways, roads, churches, castles, every possible feature that could be visible to an incoming invader and from every angle,\" Lamb.\n\n\"It was intense and exciting work, and obviously detail was vital. It was crucial that the maps were 100% accurate,\" she said.\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN MEETS WITH AMERICAN VETERANS\n\nCOLLEVILLE-SUR-MER, France -- U.S. President Joe Biden met with American veterans of D-Day as he marked the invasion's 80th anniversary.\n\nVeterans who could stand were helped out of wheelchairs to pose for photos with the president and first lady Jill Biden. One hugged Biden, another saluted. When Biden learned it was the birthday of one of the veterans, he led the audience in singing 'Happy Birthday.'\n\nThe first lady clutched the arm of another veteran, Robert Gibson, to help him stand next to Biden as they shook hands. \"Don't get old,\" the 100-year-old man joked to the 81-year-old president, who was a toddler when D-Day took place.\n\nSteve Spielberg and Tom Hanks, the Hollywood heavyweights behind movies and television shows about World War II, were nearby.\n\nPRINCE WILLIAM PRAISES CANADIAN TROOPS IN NORMANDY\n\nJUNO BEACH, France -- Prince William has praised the bravery and sacrifice of Canadian troops as he addressed a D-Day anniversary ceremony on Juno Beach.\n\nThe royal was joined by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal and Canadian D-Day veterans.\n\nSome 14,000 Canadians were part of the 150,000 Allied troops who landed or parachuted into Normandy in 1944.\n\n\"Far from home they stormed these very sand dunes behind me, shoulder to shoulder with thousands of British troops,\" William said.\n\nAddressing veterans at the ceremony, the royal added: \"Thank you for our freedom, and thank you for your service.\"\n\nKING CHARLES AND QUEEN CAMILLA LEAD D-DAY COMMEMORATIONS AT NEW MEMORIAL IN FRANCE\n\nVER-SUR-MER, France -- King Charles III and Queen Camilla led commemorations at the new British Normandy Memorial in Ver-sur-Mer.\n\nCamilla wiped away a tear as actor Martin Freeman read words by 99-year-old D-Day veteran Joe Mines, recalling that \"I was 19 when I landed, but I was still a boy. I don't care what people say, I wasn't a man, I was a boy. And I didn't have any idea of war and killing.\"\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak and Labour Party leader Keir Starmer took a break from campaigning for Britain's July 4 election to travel to France for the ceremony.\n\nSunak paid tribute to veterans, saying their \"actions freed a continent and built a better world.\"\n\n\"You risked everything and we owe you everything,\" he said. \"We cannot possibly hope to repay that debt but we can and we must pledge never to forget.\"\n\nWelsh singer Tom Jones, 83, sang his song \"I Won't Crumble With You If You Fall,\" before the king addressed the audience in French and English.\n\nCharles said that while the number of living veterans was dwindling, \"our obligation to remember what they stood for and what they achieved for us all can never diminish.\"\n\nSpeaking in French, Charles paid tribute to the \"unimaginable number\" of French civilians killed in the battle for Normandy, and the bravery and sacrifice of the French Resistance.\n\nMAN HONORS A GRANDFATHER HE NEVER KNEW, AN OFFICER WHO SMUGGLED HIMSELF ON A LANDING CRAFT\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Among the thousands who flocked to D-Day beach Utah was the grandson of an American colonel who smuggled himself aboard a landing craft so he could join his men in the first waves of the June 6, 1944, invasion.\n\nJohn Reistrup, 55, never met his grandfather, Eugene M. Caffey, who died in 1961. Coming back to Utah for the 80th anniversary was his way of carrying \"the torch for someone you never met that had such an impact on so many lives.\"\n\nA plaque at the beach that honors his grandfather says the colonel led the 19,500 men of the 1st Engineer Special Brigade tasked on that fateful day with the logistics of the landing on Utah, one of five invasion beaches.\n\nNot scheduled to land until 0900, Caffey, a 49-year-old father of nine, had smuggled himself, with no equipment except an empty rifle, aboard an 8th Infantry landing craft. En route he managed to load his rifle by taking up a collection of one bullet each from eight infantrymen. He arrived ashore very early in the assault, Reistrup said.\n\n\"No officers were allowed on the first waves of the landing but he said, 'Hell, no, I'm going with my guys.'\"\n\nA Nazi bunker captured on the beach then became his grandfather's office, he said. Caffey's portrait hangs there, inside, to this day.\n\nForging ahead into fire on D-Day \"has got to be the greatest courage you could ever have,\" said Reistrup, who has visited Normandy about 10 times since his first visit as a kid in 1974.\n\nTHOUSANDS OF PEOPLE DOT FRANCE'S UTAH BEACH FOR D-DAY COMMEMORATIONS\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Thousands of people, including many people in World War II-era uniforms, were stretched for several kilometers (miles) along Utah Beach ahead of commemorations marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings.\n\nUtah was one of the five landing beaches along the coast of Normandy where Allied troops landed on June 6, 2024. Utah and Omaha were taken -- at the cost of hundreds of lives -- by American forces, with the others stormed by troops from Britain and Canada, also killing many hundreds, plus others from France.\n\nThe long stretch of the Normandy coast is where the largest-ever land, sea and air armada punctured Hitler's defenses in Western Europe and helped precipitate his downfall 11 months later.\n\nA fair-like atmosphere is fueled by World War II-era jeeps and trucks tearing down hedge-rowed lanes so deadly for Allied troops who fought dug-in German defenders, and of reenactors playing at war on sands where D-Day soldiers fell.\n\nSurviving veterans, who are around 100 years old now, are the VIPs of the day's events.\n\n'FREEDOM COSTS,' DENMARK'S PRIME MINISTER SAYS AS SHE MARKS D-DAY'S 80TH ANNIVERSARY\n\nCOPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Denmark's prime minister said that this year's observances of the D-Day landings, which come as Russia is at war against Ukraine, are a reminder that there is a price for defending freedom.\n\n\"From D-Day we have learned that freedom costs,\" Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said in a statement as she headed to Normandy for ceremonies marking the 80th anniversary of the Allied landings.\n\n\"Eighty years later, Europe once again finds itself at a fateful moment. Where freedom is once again being fought for on our own continent,\" she said, \"against an aggressive and brutal enemy who will dictate country borders with brute force and leave a trail of death and destruction.\"\n\nIMAGINING THE HORROR AND CELEBRATING FREEDOM\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Because freedom is worth celebrating and passing on to children, too, Alexandra Hamon, 35, drank champagne and shared the sunrise with her boys, Karl and Neils, both 13, as the day dawned Thursday over the beaches where Allied soldiers landed on D-Day.\n\nThe family was among a crowd several thousands strong that stretched for kilometers along Utah beach -- one of the five beaches along the coast of Normandy where Allied troops landed. Utah and Omaha were taken -- at the cost of hundreds of lives -- by American forces, with the others stormed by troops from Britain and Canada, also killing many hundreds, plus others from France. The other code-named beaches are Juno, Sword and Gold.\n\nKarl sat perched on the hood of their 1943 Dodge truck, lovingly restored by her husband, Enogat, as the family from Saint Malo, a French coastal city that was badly damaged in major fighting about two months after D-Day, stared out across the English Channel.\n\nThe waters Thursday were still and peaceful -- unlike on that fateful day that helped change the course of WWII and precipitate Adolf Hitler's downfall 11 months later.\n\n\"It's indescribable, just imagining the chaos. Now it's peaceful, almost festive, we try to imagine but I think it's unimaginable,\" she said.\n\n\"You think of all those guys, everything they went through,\" she added of the fast-dwindling D-Day veterans. \"They say they aren't heroes. But they are, they are.\"\n\nKEEPING ALIVE THE MEMORY OF SOLDIERS 'WHO DIED FOR OUR FREEDOM'\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the rising sun took the night's chill off Utah Beach, Christophe Receveur, 57, from Thionville in eastern France, unfurled a Stars and Stripes he bought in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, six months ago specifically to honor the Americans who fell on D-Day.\n\n\"To keep alive the memory of the soldiers who died for our freedom,\" he said. \"To forget them is to let them die all over again.\"\n\nReceveur and his daughter, Julie, 28, carefully folded the flag into a tight triangle after their quiet, reflective homage on an empty stretch of the beach, busy with hundreds of people strung out along the sands.\n\nReceveur said the Ukraine war was on his mind, too, as he honored the fallen of WWII. His great grandfather fought in WWI, his grandfather was a prisoner of war in WWII, and his father was a veteran of France's war in former North African colony Algeria.\n\n\"I don't want our freedom, for our kids, our grandkids, to be hit by I don't want to say a madman,\" referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"So a lot of respect for these people who died and for those who are still dying,\" he said of the WWII dead and those in Ukraine.\n\n'WE JUST HAVE TO REMEMBER THE SACRIFICES'\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the golden sun pierced low clouds over the seas that were thick with landing craft approaching Normandy on D-Day, Becky Kraubetz peered across the English Channel toward her native Britain, her eyes filled with tears as she thought about the scene 80 years ago.\n\n\"It's so historic and we just have to remember the sacrifices of everybody who gave us our freedom,\" said Kraubetz, whose grandfather served with the British Army during World War II and was captured in Malta.\n\n\"It gives you goosebumps, everything that happened here. Imagine just jumping into the water, freezing cold,\" said the 54-year-old who now lives in Florida, as the rays of the morning sun started to warm the hundreds of people who'd waited through the night's chill for dawn's break.\n\n\"The bravery, the courage, for people to face that is just unbelievable -- very, very humbled to be here.\"\n\nTHE SUN RISES OVER NORMANDY BEACHES AS THE WORLD REMEMBERS D-DAY\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the sun sets on the D-Day generation, it's rising again over Normandy beaches where soldiers fought and died exactly 80 years ago, kicking off intense anniversary commemorations Thursday against the backdrop of renewed war in Europe, in Ukraine.\n\nEver-dwindling numbers of World War II veterans, and Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, make this anniversary particularly meaningful, mixing poignant remembrances for D-Day sacrifices with an Allied show of solidarity for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, among the guests.\n\nBut host France hasn't invited World War II ally Russia, citing its \"war of aggression against Ukraine that has intensified in recent weeks.\"\n\nHUNDREDS GATHER AT DAWN AT UTAH BEACH TO MARK D-DAY'S 80TH ANNIVERSARY\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Hundreds of people, some in WWII-era uniforms, arrived before dawn to stretch out across the now peaceful sands of Utah Beach, one of the five Allied landing zones on D-Day where troops waded into cold seas through hails of fire exactly 80 years ago.\n\n\"It's our way of paying homage, and better understanding what really happened in the 1944 landings,\" said Dimitri Picot, a 33-year-old from the nearby Normandy town of Carentan who works as a rat and pest catcher.\n\nPicot said he often dives on a wrecked ship that was hit and exploded, its wreckage visible Thursday as night gave way to day. Growing up amid the June 6, 1944, landing zones, he said he has become accustomed to seeing walls still pockmarked by bullets, shrapnel and other reminders of that fateful day.\n\nBut on the 80th anniversary \"to think that they liberated us\" hammered home the emotion, he said.\n\nUKRAINE'S ZELENSKYY ARRIVES IN NORMANDY FOR D-DAY EVENTS\n\nOMAHA BEACH, France -- Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has arrived in Normandy, France, to commemorate the anniversary of the D-Day invasion with Western leaders.\n\nZelenskyy said on X that he is going to attend important meetings aimed at strengthening his nation at war, and that he is honored to be participating in the D-Day commemoration with President Joe Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron and others.\n\n\"This event and day serve as a reminder of the courage and determination demonstrated in the pursuit of freedom and democracy,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\n\"Allies defended Europe's freedom then, and Ukrainians do so now. Unity prevailed then, and true unity can prevail today.\"", "source": {"uri": "wsbt.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WSBT"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@wsbt.com", "name": "Associated

Caffey, who died in 1961. Coming back to Utah for the 80th anniversary was his way of carrying \"the torch for someone you never met that had such an impact on so many lives.\"\n\nA plaque at the beach that honors his grandfather says the colonel led the 19,500 men of the 1st Engineer Special Brigade tasked on that fateful day with the logistics of the landing on Utah, one of five invasion beaches.\n\nNot scheduled to land until 0900, Caffey, a 49-year-old father of nine, had smuggled himself, with no equipment except an empty rifle, aboard an 8th Infantry landing craft. En route he managed to load his rifle by taking up a collection of one bullet each from eight infantrymen. He arrived ashore very early in the assault, Reistrup said.\n\n\"No officers were allowed on the first waves of the landing but he said, 'Hell, no, I'm going with my guys.'\"\n\nA Nazi bunker captured on the beach then became his grandfather's office, he said.

Now it's peaceful, almost festive, we try to imagine but I think it's unimaginable,\" she said.\n\n\"You think of all those guys, everything they went through,\" she added of the fast-dwindling D-Day veterans. \"They say they aren't heroes. But they are, they are. Those guys really should never die. I imagine the boats, the guys arriving, the sounds. It must have been horrible, yes, horrible.\"\n\nKEEPING ALIVE THE MEMORY OF SOLDIERS 'WHO DIED FOR OUR FREEDOM'\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the rising sun took the night's chill off Utah Beach, Christophe Receveur, 57, from Thionville in eastern France, unfurled a Stars and Stripes he bought in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, six months ago specifically to honor the Americans who fell on D-Day.\n\n\"To keep alive the memory of the soldiers who died for our freedom,\" he said. \"To forget them is to let them die all over again.\"\n\nReceveur and his daughter, Julie, 28, carefully folded the flag into a tight triangle after their quiet, reflective homage on an empty stretch of the beach, busy with hundreds of people strung out along the sands.\n\nReceveur said the Ukraine war was on his mind, too, as he honored the fallen of WWII. His great grandfather fought in WWI, his grandfather was a prisoner of war in WWII, and his father was a veteran of France's war in former North African colony Algeria.\n\n\"I don't want our freedom, for our kids, our grandkids, to be hit by ... I don't want to say a madman,\" referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"So a lot of respect for these people who died and for those who are still dying,\" he said of the WWII dead and those in Ukraine.\n\nHe said the D-Day sacrifices have to be remembered. \"Lots of emotion that all these troops came to liberate a country that they didn't know for an ideology -- democracy, freedom -- that is under severe strain now.\"\n\n'WE JUST HAVE TO REMEMBER THE SACRIFICES'\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the golden sun pierced low clouds over the seas that were thick with landing craft approaching Normandy on D-Day, Becky Kraubetz peered across the English Channel toward her native Britain, her eyes filled with tears as she thought about the scene 80 years ago.\n\n\"It's so historic and we just have to remember the sacrifices of everybody who gave us our freedom,\" said Kraubetz, whose grandfather served with the British Army during World War II and was captured in Malta.\n\n\"It gives you goosebumps, everything that happened here. Imagine just jumping into the water, freezing cold,\" said the 54-year-old who now lives in Florida, as the rays of the morning sun started to warm the hundreds of people who'd waited through the night's chill for dawn's break.\n\n\"The bravery, the courage, for people to face that is just unbelievable -- very, very humbled to be here.\"\n\nTHE SUN RISES OVER NORMANDY BEACHES AS THE WORLD REMEMBERS D-DAY\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the sun sets on the D-Day generation, it's rising again over Normandy beaches where soldiers fought and died exactly 80 years ago, kicking off intense anniversary commemorations Thursday against the backdrop of renewed war in Europe, in Ukraine.\n\nEver-dwindling numbers of World War II veterans, and Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, make this anniversary particularly meaningful, mixing poignant remembrances for D-Day sacrifices with an Allied show of solidarity for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, among the guests.\n\nBut host France hasn't invited World War II ally Russia, citing its \"war of aggression against Ukraine that has intensified in recent weeks.\"\n\nHUNDREDS GATHER AT DAWN AT UTAH BEACH TO MARK D-DAY'S 80TH ANNIVERSARY\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Hundreds of people, some in WWII-era uniforms, arrived before dawn to stretch out across the now peaceful sands of Utah Beach, one of the five Allied landing zones on D-Day where troops waded into cold seas through hails of fire exactly 80 years ago.\n\n\"It's our way of paying homage, and better understanding what really happened in the 1944 landings,\" said Dimitri Picot, a 33-year-old from the nearby Normandy town of Carentan who works as a rat and pest catcher.\n\nPicot said he often dives on a wrecked ship that was hit and exploded, its wreckage visible Thursday as night gave way to day. Growing up amid the June 6, 1944, landing zones, he said he has become accustomed to seeing walls still pockmarked by bullets, shrapnel and other reminders of that fateful day.\n\nBut on the 80th anniversary \"to think that they liberated us\" hammered home the emotion, he said.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Young Americans fail to identify what D-Day is", "body": "Many had no idea what it was or confused it with other events in World War II\n\nEighty years ago to this day, one of the most consequential military operations in world history unfolded on the beaches of Normandy, Northwest France.\n\nThe D-Day landings, when allied forces stormed Nazi-occupied France and changed the course of the Second World War, were commemorated today by President Joe Biden and other world leaders who delivered a poignant message: 'We will never forget.'\n\nBut it seems many young Americans have forgotten - or never learned about the landings at all.\n\n'Do you mean like doomsday?' one NYU student responded when DailyMail.com asked if they knew what D-Day refers to.\n\nShe was just one of several who were clueless about today's anniversary, or confused D-Day with other World War II events like the attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\n'I believe bombs were involved but I don't know anything else,' said one young woman\n\nSome people were able to correctly identify that D-Day refers to the Allied landings on Normandy\n\nRead More D-Day, hour by hour: MailOnline's visualisations relive Operation Overlord in forensic detail\n\nA reporter questioned people young and old in Washington Square Park, which neighbors the NYU campus, about what they knew of the event - and whether it should still be commemorated today.\n\nD-Day occurred on June 6, 1944 when 160,000 Allied troops crossed the English Channel and landed on the beaches of Normandy, beginning a major assault that would ultimately liberate France from Nazi occupation and secure victory in Europe.\n\nAbout 73,000 troops were from the United states and 83,000 were from Britain and Canada. Many thousands more from around a dozen more Allied nations also played a crucial role in the landings, codenamed Operation Neptune.\n\n'I believe bombs were involved but I don't know anything else,' said one young woman.\n\n'I believe it's the day we won the Second World War,' said another.\n\nThere was also some confusion among New York's finest. 'Wasn't that Pearl Harbor?' said an NYPD officer when asked if he knew what D-Day was, before a drawn-out 'ohh, yeah!' when told it was, in fact, the Normandy landings.\n\nSome were able to recall more facts about the events after they were told it related to landings in Normandy.\n\nThose we knew what D-Day referred to also said it was important to educate people about significant moments in history. Several cited the adage that those who don't know history are doomed to repeat it.\n\nA 2004 poll by Gallup found 40 percent of Americans could not identify what D-Day referred to. Young adults were least like to know about it.\n\nU.S. soldiers Sargeant R.A. Forbis, Private John Krisa, and Corporal V.E. Holtz from the Army Corps of Engineers read letters on an unidentified beach captured on D-Day\n\nAllied ships, boats and barrage balloons off Omaha Beach after the successful D-Day invasion. The bloody landing cost up to 5,000 Allied soldiers their lives\n\nAmerican soldiers form the 4th Infantry Division firing a 105mm HM3 Howitzer in the days after the D-Day landings in Carentan, a French town close to both Utah and Omaha beaches\n\nA separate poll conducted this year in Britain found fewer that half of young adults know what D-Day is, while one in five think it should no longer be commemorated.\n\nThe survey, by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, polled 2,000 adults and found that fewer than half (48 per cent) of those aged 18 to 34 could recognise D-Day as the day Allied forces crossed the English Channel to launch an offensive on the Nazi occupation in Normandy.\n\nOverall, 59 per cent of those polled could identify it correctly.\n\nA small section thought it was the evacuation from Dunkirk (9 per cent) and 8 per cent thought it was the day of victory in the Battle of Britain. One in ten thought it was the day Hitler's Germany surrendered.\n\nBiden led the commemoration events in Normandy on Thursday alongside King Charles III, French President Emmanuel Macron and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, first lady Jill Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron, his wife Brigitte Macron, walk on stage during ceremonies to mark the 80th anniversary of D-Day\n\nWorld War II veterans at the American Cemetery in Normandy - 11 were awarded the French Legion of Honor\n\nThe US president used his speech to warn that democracy around the world was at risk and also referred to the ongoing war in Ukraine following Russia's invasion.\n\nThe commemorations also provided a hugely symbolic backdrop to talks on how Kyiv can regain ground after Russian advances, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky attending an international ceremony with all the leaders.\n\nBiden said D-Day showed the need for international alliances and vowed never to abandon Ukraine in its fight against Russia, in a pointed swipe at his election rival ex-president Donald Trump who has publicly questioned the importance of organizations such as NATO.\n\n'We're living in a time when democracy is more at risk across the world than at any point since the end of World War II,' Biden said.\n\n'Isolationism was not the answer 80 years ago and is not the answer today,' he said.\n\n'Real alliances make us stronger - a lesson that I pray we Americans never forget.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"},

The assault began with Allied aircraft bombing German defenses in Normandy, followed by around 1,200 aircraft that carried airborne troops. As dawn broke, Allied forces started bombing German coastal defenses and shortly after that vessels began putting troops ashore on five codenamed beaches: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword. By the end of the day, nearly 160,000 Allied troops had landed in Normandy, although there were thousands of casualties.\n\nFew witnesses to history's biggest amphibious invasion remain alive today.

One hugged Biden, another saluted. When Biden learned it was the birthday of one of the veterans, he led the audience in singing 'Happy Birthday.'\n\nThe first lady clutched the arm of another veteran, Robert Gibson, to help him stand next to Biden as they shook hands. \"Don't get old,\" the 100-year-old man joked to the 81-year-old president, who was a toddler when D-Day took place.\n\nSteve Spielberg and Tom Hanks, the Hollywood heavyweights behind movies and television shows about World War II, were nearby.\n\nKING CHARLES AND QUEEN CAMILLA LEAD D-DAY COMMEMORATIONS AT NEW MEMORIAL IN FRANCE\n\nVER-SUR-MER, France -- King Charles III and Queen Camilla led commemorations at the new British Normandy Memorial in Ver-sur-Mer.\n\nCamilla wiped away a tear as actor Martin Freeman read words by 99-year-old D-Day veteran Joe Mines, recalling that \"I was 19 when I landed, but I was still a boy.

And I didn't have any idea of war and killing.\"\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak and Labour Party leader Keir Starmer took a break from campaigning for Britain's July 4 election to travel to France for the ceremony.\n\nSunak paid tribute to veterans, saying their \"actions freed a continent and built a better world.\"\n\n\"You risked everything and we owe you everything,\" he said. \"We cannot possibly hope to repay that debt but we can and we must pledge never to forget.\"\n\nWelsh singer Tom Jones, 83, sang his song \"I Won't Crumble With You If You Fall,\" before the king addressed the audience in French and English.\n\nCharles said that while the number of living veterans was dwindling, \"our obligation to remember what they stood for and what they achieved for us all can never diminish.\"\n\nSpeaking in French, Charles paid tribute to the \"unimaginable number\" of French civilians killed in the battle for Normandy, and the bravery and sacrifice of the French Resistance.\n\nMAN HONORS A GRANDFATHER HE NEVER KNEW, AN OFFICER WHO SMUGGLED HIMSELF ON A LANDING CRAFT\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Among the thousands who flocked to D-Day beach Utah was the grandson of an American colonel who smuggled himself aboard a landing craft so he could join his men in the first waves of the June 6, 1944, invasion.\n\nJohn Reistrup, 55, never met his grandfather, Eugene M. Caffey, who died in 1961. Coming back to Utah for the 80th anniversary was his way of carrying \"the torch for someone you never met that had such an impact on so many lives.\"\n\nA plaque at the beach that honors his grandfather says the colonel led the 19,500 men of the 1st Engineer Special Brigade tasked on that fateful day with the logistics of the landing on Utah, one of five invasion beaches.\n\nNot scheduled to land until 0900, Caffey, a 49-year-old father of nine, had smuggled himself, with no equipment except an empty rifle, aboard an 8th Infantry landing craft. En route he managed to load his rifle by taking up a collection of one bullet each from eight infantrymen. He arrived ashore very early in the assault, Reistrup said.\n\n\"No officers were allowed on the first waves of the landing but he said, 'Hell, no, I'm going with my guys.'\"\n\nA Nazi bunker captured on the beach then became his grandfather's office, he said. Caffey's portrait hangs there, inside, to this day.\n\nForging ahead into fire on D-Day \"has got to be the greatest courage you could ever have,\" said Reistrup, who has visited Normandy about 10 times since his first visit as a kid in 1974.\n\nNation & World Jewish veteran from London prepares to commemorate 80th anniversary of D-Day landings DANICA KIRKA Associated Press 4 min to read THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE DOT FRANCE'S UTAH BEACH FOR D-DAY COMMEMORATIONS\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Thousands of people, including many people in World War II-era uniforms, were stretched for several kilometers (miles) along Utah Beach ahead of commemorations marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings.\n\nUtah was one of the five landing beaches along the coast of Normandy where Allied troops landed on June 6, 2024. Utah and Omaha were taken -- at the cost of hundreds of lives -- by American forces, with the others stormed by troops from Britain and Canada, also killing many hundreds, plus others from France.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe long stretch of the Normandy coast is where the largest-ever land, sea and air armada punctured Hitler's defenses in Western Europe and helped precipitate his downfall 11 months later.\n\nA fair-like atmosphere is fueled by World War II-era jeeps and trucks tearing down hedge-rowed lanes so deadly for Allied troops who fought dug-in German defenders, and of reenactors playing at war on sands where D-Day soldiers fell.\n\nSurviving veterans, who are around 100 years old now, are the VIPs of the day's events.\n\nNation & World At 100, this vet says the 'greatest generation' moniker fits 'because we saved the world' ASSOCIATED PRESS 2 min to read 'FREEDOM COSTS,' DENMARK'S PRIME MINISTER SAYS AS SHE MARKS D-DAY'S 80TH ANNIVERSARY\n\nCOPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Denmark's prime minister said that this year's observances of the D-Day landings, which come as Russia is at war against Ukraine, are a reminder that there is a price for defending freedom.\n\n\"From D-Day we have learned that freedom costs,\" Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said in a statement as she headed to Normandy for ceremonies marking the 80th anniversary of the Allied landings.\n\n\"Eighty years later, Europe once again finds itself at a fateful moment. Where freedom is once again being fought for on our own continent,\" she said, \"against an aggressive and brutal enemy who will dictate country borders with brute force and leave a trail of death and destruction.\"\n\nIMAGINING THE HORROR AND CELEBRATING FREEDOM\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Because freedom is worth celebrating and passing on to children, too, Alexandra Hamon, 35, drank champagne and shared the sunrise with her boys, Karl and Neils, both 13, as the day dawned Thursday over the beaches where Allied soldiers landed on D-Day.\n\nThe family was among a crowd several thousands strong that stretched for kilometers along Utah beach -- one of the five beaches along the coast of Normandy where Allied troops landed. Utah and Omaha were taken -- at the cost of hundreds of lives -- by American forces, with the others stormed by troops from Britain and Canada, also killing many hundreds, plus others from France. The other code-named beaches are Juno, Sword and Gold.\n\nKarl sat perched on the hood of their 1943 Dodge truck, lovingly restored by her husband, Enogat, as the family from Saint Malo, a French coastal city that was badly damaged in major fighting about two months after D-Day, stared out across the English Channel.\n\nThe waters Thursday were still and peaceful -- unlike on that fateful day that helped change the course of WWII and precipitate Adolf Hitler's downfall 11 months later.\n\n\"It's indescribable, just imagining the chaos. Now it's peaceful, almost festive, we try to imagine but I think it's unimaginable,\" she said.\n\n\"You think of all those guys, everything they went through,\" she added of the fast-dwindling D-Day veterans. \"They say they aren't heroes. But they are, they are. Those guys really should never die. I imagine the boats, the guys arriving, the sounds. It must have been horrible, yes, horrible.\"\n\nKEEPING ALIVE THE MEMORY OF SOLDIERS 'WHO DIED FOR OUR FREEDOM'\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the rising sun took the night's chill off Utah Beach, Christophe Receveur, 57, from Thionville in eastern France, unfurled a Stars and Stripes he bought in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, six months ago specifically to honor the Americans who fell on D-Day.\n\n\"To keep alive the memory of the soldiers who died for our freedom,\" he said. \"To forget them is to let them die all over again.\"\n\nReceveur and his daughter, Julie, 28, carefully folded the flag into a tight triangle after their quiet, reflective homage on an empty stretch of the beach, busy with hundreds of people strung out along the sands.\n\nReceveur said the Ukraine war was on his mind, too, as he honored the fallen of WWII. His great grandfather fought in WWI, his grandfather was a prisoner of war in WWII, and his father was a veteran of France's war in former North African colony Algeria.\n\n\"I don't want our freedom, for our kids, our grandkids, to be hit by ... I don't want to say a madman,\" referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"So a lot of respect for these people who died and for those who are still dying,\" he said of the WWII dead and those in Ukraine.\n\nHe said the D-Day sacrifices have to be remembered. \"Lots of emotion that all these troops came to liberate a country that they didn't know for an ideology -- democracy, freedom -- that is under severe strain now.\"\n\n'WE JUST HAVE TO REMEMBER THE SACRIFICES'\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the golden sun pierced low clouds over the seas that were thick with landing craft approaching Normandy on D-Day, Becky Kraubetz peered across the English Channel toward her native Britain, her eyes filled with tears as she thought about the scene 80 years ago.\n\n\"It's so historic and we just have to remember the sacrifices of everybody who gave us our freedom,\" said Kraubetz, whose grandfather served with the British Army during World War II and was captured in Malta.\n\n\"It gives you goosebumps, everything that happened here. Imagine just jumping into the water, freezing cold,\" said the 54-year-old who now lives in Florida, as the rays of the morning sun started to warm the hundreds of people who'd waited through the night's chill for dawn's break.\n\n\"The bravery, the courage, for people to face that is just unbelievable -- very, very humbled to be here.\"\n\nTHE SUN RISES OVER NORMANDY BEACHES AS THE WORLD REMEMBERS D-DAY\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the sun sets on the D-Day generation, it's rising again over Normandy beaches where soldiers fought and died exactly 80 years ago, kicking off intense anniversary commemorations Thursday against the backdrop of renewed war in Europe, in Ukraine.\n\nEver-dwindling numbers of World War II veterans, and Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, make this anniversary particularly meaningful, mixing poignant remembrances for D-Day sacrifices with an Allied show of solidarity for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, among the guests.\n\nBut host France hasn't invited World War II ally Russia, citing its \"war of aggression against Ukraine that has intensified in recent weeks.\"\n\nHUNDREDS GATHER AT DAWN AT UTAH BEACH TO MARK D-DAY'S 80TH ANNIVERSARY\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Hundreds of people, some in WWII-era uniforms, arrived before dawn to stretch out across the now peaceful sands of Utah Beach, one of the five Allied landing zones on D-Day where troops waded into cold seas through hails of fire exactly 80 years ago.\n\n\"It's our way of paying homage, and better understanding what really happened in the 1944 landings,\" said Dimitri Picot, a 33-year-old from the nearby Normandy town of Carentan who works as a rat and pest catcher.\n\nPicot said he often dives on a wrecked ship that was hit and exploded, its wreckage visible Thursday as night gave way to day. Growing up amid the June 6, 1944, landing zones, he said he has become accustomed to seeing walls still pockmarked by bullets, shrapnel and other reminders of that fateful day.\n\nBut on the 80th anniversary \"to think that they liberated us\" hammered home the emotion, he said.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The assault began with Allied aircraft bombing German defenses in Normandy, followed by around 1,200 aircraft that carried airborne troops. As dawn broke, Allied forces started bombing German coastal defenses and shortly after that vessels began putting troops ashore on five codenamed beaches: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword. By the end of the day, nearly 160,000 Allied troops had landed in Normandy, although there were thousands of casualties.\n\nFew witnesses to history's biggest amphibious invasion remain alive today.

Now, this WWII veteran warns against Holocaust denial ASSOCIATED PRESS PRESIDENT BIDEN MEETS WITH AMERICAN VETERANS\n\nCOLLEVILLE-SUR-MER, France -- U.S. President Joe Biden met with American veterans of D-Day as he marked the invasion's 80th anniversary.\n\nVeterans who could stand were helped out of wheelchairs to pose for photos with the president and first lady Jill Biden. One hugged Biden, another saluted. When Biden learned it was the birthday of one of the veterans, he led the audience in singing 'Happy Birthday.'\n\nThe first lady clutched the arm of another veteran, Robert Gibson, to help him stand next to Biden as they shook hands. \"Don't get old,\" the 100-year-old man joked to the 81-year-old president, who was a toddler when D-Day took place.\n\nSteve Spielberg and Tom Hanks, the Hollywood heavyweights behind movies and television shows about World War II, were nearby.\n\nKING CHARLES AND QUEEN CAMILLA LEAD D-DAY COMMEMORATIONS AT NEW MEMORIAL IN FRANCE\n\nVER-SUR-MER, France -- King Charles III and Queen Camilla led commemorations at the new British Normandy Memorial in Ver-sur-Mer.\n\nCamilla wiped away a tear as actor Martin Freeman read words by 99-year-old D-Day veteran Joe Mines, recalling that \"I was 19 when I landed, but I was still a boy. I don't care what people say, I wasn't a man, I was a boy. And I didn't have any idea of war and killing.\"\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak and Labour Party leader Keir Starmer took a break from campaigning for Britain's July 4 election to travel to France for the ceremony.\n\nSunak paid tribute to veterans, saying their \"actions freed a continent and built a better world.\"\n\n\"You risked everything and we owe you everything,\" he said. \"We cannot possibly hope to repay that debt but we can and we must pledge never to forget.\"\n\nWelsh singer Tom Jones, 83, sang his song \"I Won't Crumble With You If You Fall,\" before the king addressed the audience in French and English.\n\nCharles said that while the number of living veterans was dwindling, \"our obligation to remember what they stood for and what they achieved for us all can never diminish.\"\n\nSpeaking in French, Charles paid tribute to the \"unimaginable number\" of French civilians killed in the battle for Normandy, and the bravery and sacrifice of the French Resistance.\n\nMAN HONORS A GRANDFATHER HE NEVER KNEW, AN OFFICER WHO SMUGGLED HIMSELF ON A LANDING CRAFT\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Among the thousands who flocked to D-Day beach Utah was the grandson of an American colonel who smuggled himself aboard a landing craft so he could join his men in the first waves of the June 6, 1944, invasion.\n\nJohn Reistrup, 55, never met his grandfather, Eugene M. Caffey, who died in 1961. Coming back to Utah for the 80th anniversary was his way of carrying \"the torch for someone you never met that had such an impact on so many lives.\"\n\nA plaque at the beach that honors his grandfather says the colonel led the 19,500 men of the 1st Engineer Special Brigade tasked on that fateful day with the logistics of the landing on Utah, one of five invasion beaches.\n\nNot scheduled to land until 0900, Caffey, a 49-year-old father of nine, had smuggled himself, with no equipment except an empty rifle, aboard an 8th Infantry landing craft. En route he managed to load his rifle by taking up a collection of one bullet each from eight infantrymen. He arrived ashore very early in the assault, Reistrup said.\n\n\"No officers were allowed on the first waves of the landing but he said, 'Hell, no, I'm going with my guys.'\"\n\nA Nazi bunker captured on the beach then became his grandfather's office, he said. Caffey's portrait hangs there, inside, to this day.\n\nForging ahead into fire on D-Day \"has got to be the greatest courage you could ever have,\" said Reistrup, who has visited Normandy about 10 times since his first visit as a kid in 1974.\n\nNation & World Jewish veteran from London prepares to commemorate 80th anniversary of D-Day landings DANICA KIRKA Associated Press 4 min to read THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE DOT FRANCE'S UTAH BEACH FOR D-DAY COMMEMORATIONS\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Thousands of people, including many people in World War II-era uniforms, were stretched for several kilometers (miles) along Utah Beach ahead of commemorations marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings.\n\nUtah was one of the five landing beaches along the coast of Normandy where Allied troops landed on June 6, 2024. Utah and Omaha were taken -- at the cost of hundreds of lives -- by American forces, with the others stormed by troops from Britain and Canada, also killing many hundreds, plus others from France.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe long stretch of the Normandy coast is where the largest-ever land, sea and air armada punctured Hitler's defenses in Western Europe and helped precipitate his downfall 11 months later.\n\nA fair-like atmosphere is fueled by World War II-era jeeps and trucks tearing down hedge-rowed lanes so deadly for Allied troops who fought dug-in German defenders, and of reenactors playing at war on sands where D-Day soldiers fell.\n\nSurviving veterans, who are around 100 years old now, are the VIPs of the day's events.\n\nNation & World At 100, this vet says the 'greatest generation' moniker fits 'because we saved the world' ASSOCIATED PRESS 2 min to read 'FREEDOM COSTS,' DENMARK'S PRIME MINISTER SAYS AS SHE MARKS D-DAY'S 80TH ANNIVERSARY\n\nCOPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Denmark's prime minister said that this year's observances of the D-Day landings, which come as Russia is at war against Ukraine, are a reminder that there is a price for defending freedom.\n\n\"From D-Day we have learned that freedom costs,\" Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said in a statement as she headed to Normandy for ceremonies marking the 80th anniversary of the Allied landings.\n\n\"Eighty years later, Europe once again finds itself at a fateful moment. Where freedom is once again being fought for on our own continent,\" she said, \"against an aggressive and brutal enemy who will dictate country borders with brute force and leave a trail of death and destruction.\"\n\nIMAGINING THE HORROR AND CELEBRATING FREEDOM\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Because freedom is worth celebrating and passing on to children, too, Alexandra Hamon, 35, drank champagne and shared the sunrise with her boys, Karl and Neils, both 13, as the day dawned Thursday over the beaches where Allied soldiers landed on D-Day.\n\nThe family was among a crowd several thousands strong that stretched for kilometers along Utah beach -- one of the five beaches along the coast of Normandy where Allied troops landed. Utah and Omaha were taken -- at the cost of hundreds of lives -- by American forces, with the others stormed by troops from Britain and Canada, also killing many hundreds, plus others from France. The other code-named beaches are Juno, Sword and Gold.\n\nKarl sat perched on the hood of their 1943 Dodge truck, lovingly restored by her husband, Enogat, as the family from Saint Malo, a French coastal city that was badly damaged in major fighting about two months after D-Day, stared out across the English Channel.\n\nThe waters Thursday were still and peaceful -- unlike on that fateful day that helped change the course of WWII and precipitate Adolf Hitler's downfall 11 months later.\n\n\"It's indescribable, just imagining the chaos. Now it's peaceful, almost festive, we try to imagine but I think it's unimaginable,\" she said.\n\n\"You think of all those guys, everything they went through,\" she added of the fast-dwindling D-Day veterans. \"They say they aren't heroes. But they are, they are. Those guys really should never die. I imagine the boats, the guys arriving, the sounds. It must have been horrible, yes, horrible.\"\n\nKEEPING ALIVE THE MEMORY OF SOLDIERS 'WHO DIED FOR OUR FREEDOM'\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the rising sun took the night's chill off Utah Beach, Christophe Receveur, 57, from Thionville in eastern France, unfurled a Stars and Stripes he bought in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, six months ago specifically to honor the Americans who fell on D-Day.\n\n\"To keep alive the memory of the soldiers who died for our freedom,\" he said. \"To forget them is to let them die all over again.\"\n\nReceveur and his daughter, Julie, 28, carefully folded the flag into a tight triangle after their quiet, reflective homage on an empty stretch of the beach, busy with hundreds of people strung out along the sands.\n\nReceveur said the Ukraine war was on his mind, too, as he honored the fallen of WWII. His great grandfather fought in WWI, his grandfather was a prisoner of war in WWII, and his father was a veteran of France's war in former North African colony Algeria.\n\n\"I don't want our freedom, for our kids, our grandkids, to be hit by ... I don't want to say a madman,\" referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"So a lot of respect for these people who died and for those who are still dying,\" he said of the WWII dead and those in Ukraine.\n\nHe said the D-Day sacrifices have to be remembered. \"Lots of emotion that all these troops came to liberate a country that they didn't know for an ideology -- democracy, freedom -- that is under severe strain now.\"\n\n'WE JUST HAVE TO REMEMBER THE SACRIFICES'\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the golden sun pierced low clouds over the seas that were thick with landing craft approaching Normandy on D-Day, Becky Kraubetz peered across the English Channel toward her native Britain, her eyes filled with tears as she thought about the scene 80 years ago.\n\n\"It's so historic and we just have to remember the sacrifices of everybody who gave us our freedom,\" said Kraubetz, whose grandfather served with the British Army during World War II and was captured in Malta.\n\n\"It gives you goosebumps, everything that happened here. Imagine just jumping into the water, freezing cold,\" said the 54-year-old who now lives in Florida, as the rays of the morning sun started to warm the hundreds of people who'd waited through the night's chill for dawn's break.\n\n\"The bravery, the courage, for people to face that is just unbelievable -- very, very humbled to be here.\"\n\nTHE SUN RISES OVER NORMANDY BEACHES AS THE WORLD REMEMBERS D-DAY\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the sun sets on the D-Day generation, it's rising again over Normandy beaches where soldiers fought and died exactly 80 years ago, kicking off intense anniversary commemorations Thursday against the backdrop of renewed war in Europe, in Ukraine.\n\nEver-dwindling numbers of World War II veterans, and Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, make this anniversary particularly meaningful, mixing poignant remembrances for D-Day sacrifices with an Allied show of solidarity for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, among the guests.\n\nBut host France hasn't invited World War II ally Russia, citing its \"war of aggression against Ukraine that has intensified in recent weeks.\"\n\nHUNDREDS GATHER AT DAWN AT UTAH BEACH TO MARK D-DAY'S 80TH ANNIVERSARY\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Hundreds of people, some in WWII-era uniforms, arrived before dawn to stretch out across the now peaceful sands of Utah Beach, one of the five Allied landing zones on D-Day where troops waded into cold seas through hails of fire exactly 80 years ago.\n\n\"It's our way of paying homage, and better understanding what really happened in the 1944 landings,\" said Dimitri Picot, a 33-year-old from the nearby Normandy town of Carentan who works as a rat and pest catcher.\n\nPicot said he often dives on a wrecked ship that was hit and exploded, its wreckage visible Thursday as night gave way to day. Growing up amid the June 6, 1944, landing zones, he said he has become accustomed to seeing walls still pockmarked by bullets, shrapnel and other reminders of that fateful day.\n\nBut on the 80th anniversary \"to think that they liberated us\" hammered home the emotion, he said.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The assault began with Allied aircraft bombing German defenses in Normandy, followed by around 1,200 aircraft that carried airborne troops. As dawn broke, Allied forces started bombing German coastal defenses and shortly after that vessels began putting troops ashore on five codenamed beaches: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword. By the end of the day, nearly 160,000 Allied troops had landed in Normandy, although there were thousands of casualties.\n\nFew witnesses to history's biggest amphibious invasion remain alive today.\n\nCurrently:\n\n-- Hour by hour: A brief timeline of the Allies' invasion of occupied France\n\n-- With time short, veterans seize the chance to keep their D-Day memories alive for others\n\n-- Women were barred from combat. But they helped D-Day succeed in other ways\n\n-- How AP covered the D-Day landings and lost a photographer in the battle for Normandy\n\n-- A Jewish veteran from London prepares to commemorate the 80th anniversary\n\nHere's the latest:\n\nHUGE APPLAUSE FOR ZELENSKYY AT INTERNATIONAL CEREMONY\n\nOMAHA BEACH, France -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been greeted with huge applause and cheers as he arrived for a D-Day anniversary ceremony attended by international leaders.\n\nZelenskyy is joining other world leaders, heads of state and veterans on the promenade along Omaha Beach for the ceremony, set to begin shortly.\n\nEarlier, he wrote on X that he was honored to be participating in the D-Day commemoration with President Joe Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron and others.\n\n\"This event and day serve as a reminder of the courage and determination demonstrated in the pursuit of freedom and democracy,\" Zelenskyy said. \"Allies defended Europe's freedom then, and Ukrainians do so now. Unity prevailed then, and true unity can prevail today.\"\n\n99-YEAR-OLD U.S. VETERAN TELLS HIS STORY TO DANISH KING\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- An 99-year-old American veteran of D-Day who landed in the first waves on Utah Beach has told the king of Denmark that seeing French families years later playing and holding hands on the same sands in Normandy, France, made the June 6, 1944, Allied invasion feel worth it to him.\n\nWarren Goss, a Pittsburgh, PA., native drafted at age 18, landed with the U.S. Army 4th Infantry Division's 531st Special Brigade. He said he jumped over the side of his landing craft after soldiers in front of him were hit by gunfire, falling chest-deep into the cold waters of the English Channel.\n\nHe abandoned much of his gear, keeping his rifle, ammunition, grenades and a backpack with food, so he could wade to shore and fight his way up the beach, raked by machine-gun fire. A soldier beside him had a leg ripped off by heavy-caliber round \"and that boy got up three times to run, and he fell three times and quit,\" he recalled.\n\nDenmark's King Frederik X treated Goss like the VVIP when they met on the 80th anniversary of D-Day on Thursday.\n\n\"I'm very honored to meet somebody who ran over this beach, to liberate, to give freedom,\" the king said.\n\n\"I feel good about it. Yeah,\" Goss replied.\n\nBIDEN DRAWS PARALLELS BETWEEN UKRAINE WAR AND WWII\n\nCOLLEVILLE-SUR-MER, France -- U.S. President Joe Biden has reaffirmed America's commitment to the defense of Ukraine, saying in his D-Day anniversary speech that \"we will not walk away\" and give into bullies.\n\nBiden's comment about bullies was a reference to Russian President Vladimir Putin, who sent his military across the border into Ukraine more than two years ago in an attempted takeover. The U.S. and other countries have been aiding Ukraine by sending weapons, money and other support.\n\nBiden used his speech Thursday to connect what happened during World War II to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\n\nThe president praised the power of alliances and said Russia's advance will not stop with Ukraine if the world walks away. Biden said \"Ukraine's neighbors will be threatened\" and \"all of Europe will be threatened.\"\n\nHe argued for holding strong against Putin, saying \"to surrender to bullies, to bow down to dictators is simply unthinkable\" and that to give in \"means we'd forget what happened here\" on the beaches of Normandy.\n\n11 U.S. VETERANS AWARDED WITH LEGION OF HONOR\n\nCOLLEVILLE-SUR-MER, France -- French President Emmanuel Macron has awarded 11 U.S. WWII veterans with the Legion of Honor, France's highest distinction, during commemorations marking the 80th anniversary of D-Day.\n\n\"You came here because the free world needed each and every one of you, and you answered the call,\" Macron told them. \"You came here to make France a free nation. You're back here today at home, if I may say.\"\n\nThe men are now 98 to 104 years old.\n\nMacron kissed each veteran on both cheeks and greeted them warmly as he pinned medals on their lapels.\n\nAmong the men was Hilbert Margol, who joined an artillery battalion that operated in eastern France. He is part of American forces that liberated the Dachau concentration camp. Another, Ray Tweedel, landed by sea in Normandy on the night of June 8, 1944, and took part in the war as an oil tanker and ambulance driver.\n\n103-YEAR-OLD FEMALE VETERAN GIVEN LEGION OF HONOR AWARD\n\nVER-SUR-MER, France -- French President Emmanuel Macron bestowed a Legion of Honor award on a 103-year-old female British veteran officer who created detailed maps that guided the crews of landing craft on D-Day.\n\nChristian Lamb sat in a wheelchair as Macron bent down to pin the medal on her and kissed her on both cheeks.\n\nHe told her she was one of the \"heroes in the shadows\" as he described how she was studying in Normandy in 1939 when her father, a Royal Navy admiral, called her back to London on the eve of World War II.\n\nIn a recent interview with The Associated Press, Lamb recalled creating maps that \"showed railways, roads, churches, castles, every possible feature that could be visible to an incoming invader and from every angle,\" Lamb.\n\n\"It was intense and exciting work, and obviously detail was vital. It was crucial that the maps were 100% accurate,\" she said.\n\nPRINCE WILLIAM PRAISES CANADIAN TROOPS IN NORMANDY\n\nJUNO BEACH, France -- Prince William has praised the bravery and sacrifice of Canadian troops as he addressed a D-Day anniversary ceremony on Juno Beach.\n\nThe royal was joined by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal and Canadian D-Day veterans.\n\nSome 14,000 Canadians were part of the 150,000 Allied troops who landed or parachuted into Normandy in 1944.\n\n\"Far from home they stormed these very sand dunes behind me, shoulder to shoulder with thousands of British troops,\" William said.\n\nAddressing veterans at the ceremony, the royal added: \"Thank you for our freedom, and thank you for your service.\"\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN MEETS WITH AMERICAN VETERANS\n\nCOLLEVILLE-SUR-MER, France -- U.S. President Joe Biden met with American veterans of D-Day as he marked the invasion's 80th anniversary.\n\nVeterans who could stand were helped out of wheelchairs to pose for photos with the president and first lady Jill Biden. One hugged Biden, another saluted. When Biden learned it was the birthday of one of the veterans, he led the audience in singing 'Happy Birthday.'\n\nThe first lady clutched the arm of another veteran, Robert Gibson, to help him stand next to Biden as they shook hands. \"Don't get old,\" the 100-year-old man joked to the 81-year-old president, who was a toddler when D-Day took place.\n\nSteve Spielberg and Tom Hanks, the Hollywood heavyweights behind movies and television shows about World War II, were nearby.\n\nKING CHARLES AND QUEEN CAMILLA LEAD D-DAY COMMEMORATIONS AT NEW MEMORIAL IN FRANCE\n\nVER-SUR-MER, France -- King Charles III and Queen Camilla led commemorations at the new British Normandy Memorial in Ver-sur-Mer.\n\nCamilla wiped away a tear as actor Martin Freeman read words by 99-year-old D-Day veteran Joe Mines, recalling that \"I was 19 when I landed, but I was still a boy. I don't care what people say, I wasn't a man, I was a boy. And I didn't have any idea of war and killing.\"\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak and Labour Party leader Keir Starmer took a break from campaigning for Britain's July 4 election to travel to France for the ceremony.\n\nSunak paid tribute to veterans, saying their \"actions freed a continent and built a better world.\"\n\n\"You risked everything and we owe you everything,\" he said. \"We cannot possibly hope to repay that debt but we can and we must pledge never to forget.\"\n\nWelsh singer Tom Jones, 83, sang his song \"I Won't Crumble With You If You Fall,\" before the king addressed the audience in French and English.\n\nCharles said that while the number of living veterans was dwindling, \"our obligation to remember what they stood for and what they achieved for us all can never diminish.\"\n\nSpeaking in French, Charles paid tribute to the \"unimaginable number\" of French civilians killed in the battle for Normandy, and the bravery and sacrifice of the French Resistance.\n\nMAN HONORS A GRANDFATHER HE NEVER KNEW, AN OFFICER WHO SMUGGLED HIMSELF ON A LANDING CRAFT\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Among the thousands who flocked to D-Day beach Utah was the grandson of an American colonel who smuggled himself aboard a landing craft so he could join his men in the first waves of the June 6, 1944, invasion.\n\nJohn Reistrup, 55, never met his grandfather, Eugene M. Caffey, who died in 1961. Coming back to Utah for the 80th anniversary was his way of carrying \"the torch for someone you never met that had such an impact on so many lives.\"\n\nA plaque at the beach that honors his grandfather says the colonel led the 19,500 men of the 1st Engineer Special Brigade tasked on that fateful day with the logistics of the landing on Utah, one of five invasion beaches.\n\nNot scheduled to land until 0900, Caffey, a 49-year-old father of nine, had smuggled himself, with no equipment except an empty rifle, aboard an 8th Infantry landing craft. En route he managed to load his rifle by taking up a collection of one bullet each from eight infantrymen. He arrived ashore very early in the assault, Reistrup said.\n\n\"No officers were allowed on the first waves of the landing but he said, 'Hell, no, I'm going with my guys.'\"\n\nA Nazi bunker captured on the beach then became his grandfather's office, he said. Caffey's portrait hangs there, inside, to this day.\n\nForging ahead into fire on D-Day \"has got to be the greatest courage you could ever have,\" said Reistrup, who has visited Normandy about 10 times since his first visit as a kid in 1974.\n\nTHOUSANDS OF PEOPLE DOT FRANCE'S UTAH BEACH FOR D-DAY COMMEMORATIONS\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Thousands of people, including many people in World War II-era uniforms, were stretched for several kilometers (miles) along Utah Beach ahead of commemorations marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings.\n\nUtah was one of the five landing beaches along the coast of Normandy where Allied troops landed on June 6, 2024. Utah and Omaha were taken -- at the cost of hundreds of lives -- by American forces, with the others stormed by troops from Britain and Canada, also killing many hundreds, plus others from France.\n\nThe long stretch of the Normandy coast is where the largest-ever land, sea and air armada punctured Hitler's defenses in Western Europe and helped precipitate his downfall 11 months later.\n\nA fair-like atmosphere is fueled by World War II-era jeeps and trucks tearing down hedge-rowed lanes so deadly for Allied troops who fought dug-in German defenders, and of reenactors playing at war on sands where D-Day soldiers fell.\n\nSurviving veterans, who are around 100 years old now, are the VIPs of the day's events.\n\n'FREEDOM COSTS,' DENMARK'S PRIME MINISTER SAYS AS SHE MARKS D-DAY'S 80TH ANNIVERSARY\n\nCOPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Denmark's prime minister said that this year's observances of the D-Day landings, which come as Russia is at war against Ukraine, are a reminder that there is a price for defending freedom.\n\n\"From D-Day we have learned that freedom costs,\" Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said in a statement as she headed to Normandy for ceremonies marking the 80th anniversary of the Allied landings.\n\n\"Eighty years later, Europe once again finds itself at a fateful moment. Where freedom is once again being fought for on our own continent,\" she said, \"against an aggressive and brutal enemy who will dictate country borders with brute force and leave a trail of death and destruction.\"\n\nIMAGINING THE HORROR AND CELEBRATING FREEDOM\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Because freedom is worth celebrating and passing on to children, too, Alexandra Hamon, 35, drank champagne and shared the sunrise with her boys, Karl and Neils, both 13, as the day dawned Thursday over the beaches where Allied soldiers landed on D-Day.\n\nThe family was among a crowd several thousands strong that stretched for kilometers along Utah beach -- one of the five beaches along the coast of Normandy where Allied troops landed. Utah and Omaha were taken -- at the cost of hundreds of lives -- by American forces, with the others stormed by troops from Britain and Canada, also killing many hundreds, plus others from France. The other code-named beaches are Juno, Sword and Gold.\n\nKarl sat perched on the hood of their 1943 Dodge truck, lovingly restored by her husband, Enogat, as the family from Saint Malo, a French coastal city that was badly damaged in major fighting about two months after D-Day, stared out across the English Channel.\n\nThe waters Thursday were still and peaceful -- unlike on that fateful day that helped change the course of WWII and precipitate Adolf Hitler's downfall 11 months later.\n\n\"It's indescribable, just imagining the chaos. Now it's peaceful, almost festive, we try to imagine but I think it's unimaginable,\" she said.\n\n\"You think of all those guys, everything they went through,\" she added of the fast-dwindling D-Day veterans. \"They say they aren't heroes. But they are, they are.\"\n\nKEEPING ALIVE THE MEMORY OF SOLDIERS 'WHO DIED FOR OUR FREEDOM'\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the rising sun took the night's chill off Utah Beach, Christophe Receveur, 57, from Thionville in eastern France, unfurled a Stars and Stripes he bought in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, six months ago specifically to honor the Americans who fell on D-Day.\n\n\"To keep alive the memory of the soldiers who died for our freedom,\" he said. \"To forget them is to let them die all over again.\"\n\nReceveur and his daughter, Julie, 28, carefully folded the flag into a tight triangle after their quiet, reflective homage on an empty stretch of the beach, busy with hundreds of people strung out along the sands.\n\nReceveur said the Ukraine war was on his mind, too, as he honored the fallen of WWII. His great grandfather fought in WWI, his grandfather was a prisoner of war in WWII, and his father was a veteran of France's war in former North African colony Algeria.\n\n\"I don't want our freedom, for our kids, our grandkids, to be hit by ... I don't want to say a madman,\" referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"So a lot of respect for these people who died and for those who are still dying,\" he said of the WWII dead and those in Ukraine.\n\n'WE JUST HAVE TO REMEMBER THE SACRIFICES'\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the golden sun pierced low clouds over the seas that were thick with landing craft approaching Normandy on D-Day, Becky Kraubetz peered across the English Channel toward her native Britain, her eyes filled with tears as she thought about the scene 80 years ago.\n\n\"It's so historic and we just have to remember the sacrifices of everybody who gave us our freedom,\" said Kraubetz, whose grandfather served with the British Army during World War II and was captured in Malta.\n\n\"It gives you goosebumps, everything that happened here. Imagine just jumping into the water, freezing cold,\" said the 54-year-old who now lives in Florida, as the rays of the morning sun started to warm the hundreds of people who'd waited through the night's chill for dawn's break.\n\n\"The bravery, the courage, for people to face that is just unbelievable -- very, very humbled to be here.\"\n\nTHE SUN RISES OVER NORMANDY BEACHES AS THE WORLD REMEMBERS D-DAY\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the sun sets on the D-Day generation, it's rising again over Normandy beaches where soldiers fought and died exactly 80 years ago, kicking off intense anniversary commemorations Thursday against the backdrop of renewed war in Europe, in Ukraine.\n\nEver-dwindling numbers of World War II veterans, and Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, make this anniversary particularly meaningful, mixing poignant remembrances for D-Day sacrifices with an Allied show of solidarity for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, among the guests.\n\nBut host France hasn't invited World War II ally Russia, citing its \"war of aggression against Ukraine that has intensified in recent weeks.\"\n\nHUNDREDS GATHER AT DAWN AT UTAH BEACH TO MARK D-DAY'S 80TH ANNIVERSARY\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Hundreds of people, some in WWII-era uniforms, arrived before dawn to stretch out across the now peaceful sands of Utah Beach, one of the five Allied landing zones on D-Day where troops waded into cold seas through hails of fire exactly 80 years ago.\n\n\"It's our way of paying homage, and better understanding what really happened in the 1944 landings,\" said Dimitri Picot, a 33-year-old from the nearby Normandy town of Carentan who works as a rat and pest catcher.\n\nPicot said he often dives on a wrecked ship that was hit and exploded, its wreckage visible Thursday as night gave way to day. Growing up amid the June 6, 1944, landing zones, he said he has become accustomed to seeing walls still pockmarked by bullets, shrapnel and other reminders of that fateful day.\n\nBut on the 80th anniversary \"to think that they liberated us\" hammered home the emotion, he said.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2024 BY CHANNEL 3000.

Now bent with age, the dwindling number of World War II veterans joined a new generation of leaders on Thursday to honor the dead, the living and the fight for democracy on the shores where they landed 80 years ago on D-Day.\n\nThe war in Ukraine shadowed the ceremonies in Normandy, a grim modern-day example of lives and cities that are again suffering through war in Europe. Ukraine's president was greeted with a standing ovation and cheers. Russia, a crucial World War II ally whose full-scale invasion of its smaller neighbor in 2022 set Europe on a new path of war, was not invited.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nThe commemorations for the more than 4,400 Allied dead on D-Day and many tens of thousands more, including French civilians, killed in the ensuing Battle of Normandy were tinged with fear that World War II lessons are fading.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"There are things worth fighting for,\" said Walter Stitt, who fought in tanks and turns 100 in July, as he visited Omaha Beach this week. \"Although I wish there was another way to do it than to try to kill each other.\"\n\n\"We'll learn one of these days, but I won't be around for that,\" he said.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden directly linked Ukraine's fight for its young democracy to the battle to defeat Nazi Germany.\n\n\"To surrender to bullies, to bow down to dictators is simply unthinkable,\" Biden said. \"If we were to do that, it means we'd be forgetting what happened here on these hallowed beaches.\"\n\nAs now-centenarian veterans revisited old memories and fallen comrades buried in Normandy graves, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's presence at the international D-Day commemoration fused World War II's awful past with the fraught present. The dead and wounded on both sides in Ukraine are estimated in the hundreds of thousands.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nDespite Russia's absence, French President Emmanuel Macron paid homage to those who fought on the eastern front \"and the resolute commitment of the Red Army and all the people who were part of the then-Soviet Union.\"\n\nBut it was the landing on June 6, 1944, and the battles in Normandy that followed that ultimately drove the Nazis from France.\n\n\"You came here because the free world needed each and every one of you, and you answered the call,\" Macron said. \"You came here to make France a free nation. You're back here today at home, if I may say.\"\n\nThe French president awarded the Legion of Honor to 14 U.S. veterans and a British female veteran. Among the Americans was Edward Berthold, a pilot who carried out his three missions over France in May 1944, before taking part in an operation in Saint-Lo, in Normandy, on D-Day. He flew 35 combat missions in all during World War II.\n\nBerthold later read aloud a letter he'd written home the next day, showing that even as a young man he was aware of D-Day's importance.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"Wednesday night, June 7th, 1944. Dear Mom, just a few lines to tell you we are all ok. We flew mission number 10 on D-Day,\" he wrote. \"It certainly was a terrific show, what we could see. This is what everyone has been waiting for.\"\n\nMacron also bestowed the Legion of Honor on 103-year-old Christian Lamb, the daughter of a Royal Navy admiral who was studying in Normandy in 1939 when her father called her back to London. There, Lamb created detailed maps that guided the crews of landing craft on D-Day.\n\nThe French president bent down to Lamb in a wheelchair, pin the medal and kiss her on both cheeks, describing her as one of the \"heroes in the shadows.\"\n\nConscious of the inevitability of age and time for World War II veterans, throngs of aficionados in period uniforms and vehicles, along with tourists soaking up the spectacle, flooded Normandy for the 80th anniversary. At the international ceremony later, the veterans received a standing ovation as they were paraded before the stands in a stately line of wheelchairs to avoid the long walk across the beachfront promenade.\n\n\"We just have to remember the sacrifices of everybody who gave us our freedom,\" said Becky Kraubetz, a Briton now living in Florida whose grandfather served with the British Army during World War II and was captured in Malta. She was among a crowd of thousands of people that stretched for several kilometers (miles) along Utah Beach, the westernmost of the D-Day beaches.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIn a quiet spot away from the pomp, France's Christophe Receveur offered his own tribute, unfurling an American flag he had bought on a trip to Pennsylvania to honor those who died on D-Day.\n\n\"To forget them is to let them die all over again,\" the 57-year-old said as he and his daughter, Julie, carefully refolded the flag into a tight triangle. Those now dying in Ukraine fighting the invading Russian army were also on his mind.\n\n\"All these troops came to liberate a country that they didn't know for an ideology -- democracy, freedom -- that is under severe strain now,\" he said.\n\nFor Warren Goss, a 99-year-old American veteran of D-Day who landed in the first waves on Utah Beach, the sacrifice was affirmed by a visit years later to the same place where his comrades fell.\n\n\"I looked at the beach and it was beautiful, all the people, the kids were playing and I see the boys and girls were walking, holding hands, with their life back,\" he told the Danish king and prime minister, who hung on his words.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe fair-like atmosphere on the five code-named beaches -- Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword -- was fueled by World War II-era jeeps and trucks tearing down hedge-rowed lanes so deadly for Allied troops who fought dug-in German defenders, and of reenactors playing at war on sands where D-Day soldiers fell.\n\nBut the real VIPs of the commemorations across the Normandy coast were the veterans who took part in the largest-ever land, sea and air armada that punctured Hitler's defenses in Western Europe and helped precipitate his downfall 11 months later.\n\n\"They really were the golden generation, those 17-, 18-year-old guys doing something so brave,\" said James Baker, a 56-year-old from the Netherlands, reflecting on Utah Beach.\n\nFarther up the coast on Gold Beach, a military bagpiper played at precisely the time that British troops landed there 80 years ago.\n\nThe United Kingdom's King Charles III and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak were among those at a ceremony to honor the troops who landed there and on Sword Beach, while Prince William and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau joined others at ceremony for the Canadian troops at Juno Beach.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIn his address, the king told the crowd that the world was fortunate that a generation \"did not flinch\" when they were called upon.\n\n\"Our obligation to remember what they stood for and what they achieved for us all can never diminish,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking in French, Charles also paid tribute to the \"unimaginable number\" of French civilians killed in the battle for Normandy, and the bravery and sacrifice of the French Resistance.\n\nThose who traveled to Normandy include women who were among the millions who built bombers, tanks and other weaponry and played other vital World War II roles that were long overshadowed by the combat exploits of men.\n\nFeted everywhere they go in wheelchairs and walking with canes, veterans are using their voices to repeat their message they hope will live eternal: Never forget.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"We weren't doing it for honors and awards. We were doing it to save our country,\" said 98-year-old Anna Mae Krier, who worked as a riveter building B-17 and B-29 bombers. \"We ended up helping save the world.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press

One hugged Biden, another saluted. When Biden learned it was the birthday of one of the veterans, he led the audience in singing 'Happy Birthday.'\n\nThe first lady clutched the arm of another veteran, Robert Gibson, to help him stand next to Biden as they shook hands. \"Don't get old,\" the 100-year-old man joked to the 81-year-old president, who was a toddler when D-Day took place.\n\nSteve Spielberg and Tom Hanks, the Hollywood heavyweights behind movies and television shows about World War II, were nearby.\n\nKING CHARLES AND QUEEN CAMILLA LEAD D-DAY COMMEMORATIONS AT NEW MEMORIAL IN FRANCE\n\nVER-SUR-MER, France -- King Charles III and Queen Camilla led commemorations at the new British Normandy Memorial in Ver-sur-Mer.\n\nCamilla wiped away a tear as actor Martin Freeman read words by 99-year-old D-Day veteran Joe Mines, recalling that \"I was 19 when I landed, but I was still a boy.

Caffey, who died in 1961. Coming back to Utah for the 80th anniversary was his way of carrying \"the torch for someone you never met that had such an impact on so many lives.\"\n\nA plaque at the beach that honors his grandfather says the colonel led the 19,500 men of the 1st Engineer Special Brigade tasked on that fateful day with the logistics of the landing on Utah, one of five invasion beaches.\n\nNot scheduled to land until 0900, Caffey, a 49-year-old father of nine, had smuggled himself, with no equipment except an empty rifle, aboard an 8th Infantry landing craft. En route he managed to load his rifle by taking up a collection of one bullet each from eight infantrymen. He arrived ashore very early in the assault, Reistrup said.\n\n\"No officers were allowed on the first waves of the landing but he said, 'Hell, no, I'm going with my guys.'\"\n\nA Nazi bunker captured on the beach then became his grandfather's office, he said. Caffey's portrait hangs there, inside, to this day.\n\nForging ahead into fire on D-Day \"has got to be the greatest courage you could ever have,\" said Reistrup, who has visited Normandy about 10 times since his first visit as a kid in 1974.\n\nNation & World Jewish veteran from London prepares to commemorate 80th anniversary of D-Day landings DANICA KIRKA Associated Press 4 min to read THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE DOT FRANCE'S UTAH BEACH FOR D-DAY COMMEMORATIONS\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Thousands of people, including many people in World War II-era uniforms, were stretched for several kilometers (miles) along Utah Beach ahead of commemorations marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings.\n\nUtah was one of the five landing beaches along the coast of Normandy where Allied troops landed on June 6, 2024. Utah and Omaha were taken -- at the cost of hundreds of lives -- by American forces, with the others stormed by troops from Britain and Canada, also killing many hundreds, plus others from France.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe long stretch of the Normandy coast is where the largest-ever land, sea and air armada punctured Hitler's defenses in Western Europe and helped precipitate his downfall 11 months later.\n\nA fair-like atmosphere is fueled by World War II-era jeeps and trucks tearing down hedge-rowed lanes so deadly for Allied troops who fought dug-in German defenders, and of reenactors playing at war on sands where D-Day soldiers fell.\n\nSurviving veterans, who are around 100 years old now, are the VIPs of the day's events.\n\nNation & World At 100, this vet says the 'greatest generation' moniker fits 'because we saved the world' ASSOCIATED PRESS 2 min to read 'FREEDOM COSTS,' DENMARK'S PRIME MINISTER SAYS AS SHE MARKS D-DAY'S 80TH ANNIVERSARY\n\nCOPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Denmark's prime minister said that this year's observances of the D-Day landings, which come as Russia is at war against Ukraine, are a reminder that there is a price for defending freedom.\n\n\"From D-Day we have learned that freedom costs,\" Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said in a statement as she headed to Normandy for ceremonies marking the 80th anniversary of the Allied landings.\n\n\"Eighty years later, Europe once again finds itself at a fateful moment. Where freedom is once again being fought for on our own continent,\" she said, \"against an aggressive and brutal enemy who will dictate country borders with brute force and leave a trail of death and destruction.\"\n\nIMAGINING THE HORROR AND CELEBRATING FREEDOM\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Because freedom is worth celebrating and passing on to children, too, Alexandra Hamon, 35, drank champagne and shared the sunrise with her boys, Karl and Neils, both 13, as the day dawned Thursday over the beaches where Allied soldiers landed on D-Day.\n\nThe family was among a crowd several thousands strong that stretched for kilometers along Utah beach -- one of the five beaches along the coast of Normandy where Allied troops landed. Utah and Omaha were taken -- at the cost of hundreds of lives -- by American forces, with the others stormed by troops from Britain and Canada, also killing many hundreds, plus others from France. The other code-named beaches are Juno, Sword and Gold.\n\nKarl sat perched on the hood of their 1943 Dodge truck, lovingly restored by her husband, Enogat, as the family from Saint Malo, a French coastal city that was badly damaged in major fighting about two months after D-Day, stared out across the English Channel.\n\nThe waters Thursday were still and peaceful -- unlike on that fateful day that helped change the course of WWII and precipitate Adolf Hitler's downfall 11 months later.\n\n\"It's indescribable, just imagining the chaos. Now it's peaceful, almost festive, we try to imagine but I think it's unimaginable,\" she said.\n\n\"You think of all those guys, everything they went through,\" she added of the fast-dwindling D-Day veterans. \"They say they aren't heroes. But they are, they are. Those guys really should never die. I imagine the boats, the guys arriving, the sounds. It must have been horrible, yes, horrible.\"\n\nKEEPING ALIVE THE MEMORY OF SOLDIERS 'WHO DIED FOR OUR FREEDOM'\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the rising sun took the night's chill off Utah Beach, Christophe Receveur, 57, from Thionville in eastern France, unfurled a Stars and Stripes he bought in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, six months ago specifically to honor the Americans who fell on D-Day.\n\n\"To keep alive the memory of the soldiers who died for our freedom,\" he said. \"To forget them is to let them die all over again.\"\n\nReceveur and his daughter, Julie, 28, carefully folded the flag into a tight triangle after their quiet, reflective homage on an empty stretch of the beach, busy with hundreds of people strung out along the sands.\n\nReceveur said the Ukraine war was on his mind, too, as he honored the fallen of WWII. His great grandfather fought in WWI, his grandfather was a prisoner of war in WWII, and his father was a veteran of France's war in former North African colony Algeria.\n\n\"I don't want our freedom, for our kids, our grandkids, to be hit by ... I don't want to say a madman,\" referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"So a lot of respect for these people who died and for those who are still dying,\" he said of the WWII dead and those in Ukraine.\n\nHe said the D-Day sacrifices have to be remembered. \"Lots of emotion that all these troops came to liberate a country that they didn't know for an ideology -- democracy, freedom -- that is under severe strain now.\"\n\n'WE JUST HAVE TO REMEMBER THE SACRIFICES'\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the golden sun pierced low clouds over the seas that were thick with landing craft approaching Normandy on D-Day, Becky Kraubetz peered across the English Channel toward her native Britain, her eyes filled with tears as she thought about the scene 80 years ago.\n\n\"It's so historic and we just have to remember the sacrifices of everybody who gave us our freedom,\" said Kraubetz, whose grandfather served with the British Army during World War II and was captured in Malta.\n\n\"It gives you goosebumps, everything that happened here. Imagine just jumping into the water, freezing cold,\" said the 54-year-old who now lives in Florida, as the rays of the morning sun started to warm the hundreds of people who'd waited through the night's chill for dawn's break.\n\n\"The bravery, the courage, for people to face that is just unbelievable -- very, very humbled to be here.\"\n\nTHE SUN RISES OVER NORMANDY BEACHES AS THE WORLD REMEMBERS D-DAY\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the sun sets on the D-Day generation, it's rising again over Normandy beaches where soldiers fought and died exactly 80 years ago, kicking off intense anniversary commemorations Thursday against the backdrop of renewed war in Europe, in Ukraine.\n\nEver-dwindling numbers of World War II veterans, and Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, make this anniversary particularly meaningful, mixing poignant remembrances for D-Day sacrifices with an Allied show of solidarity for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, among the guests.\n\nBut host France hasn't invited World War II ally Russia, citing its \"war of aggression against Ukraine that has intensified in recent weeks.\"\n\nHUNDREDS GATHER AT DAWN AT UTAH BEACH TO MARK D-DAY'S 80TH ANNIVERSARY\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Hundreds of people, some in WWII-era uniforms, arrived before dawn to stretch out across the now peaceful sands of Utah Beach, one of the five Allied landing zones on D-Day where troops waded into cold seas through hails of fire exactly 80 years ago.\n\n\"It's our way of paying homage, and better understanding what really happened in the 1944 landings,\" said Dimitri Picot, a 33-year-old from the nearby Normandy town of Carentan who works as a rat and pest catcher.\n\nPicot said he often dives on a wrecked ship that was hit and exploded, its wreckage visible Thursday as night gave way to day. Growing up amid the June 6, 1944, landing zones, he said he has become accustomed to seeing walls still pockmarked by bullets, shrapnel and other reminders of that fateful day.\n\nBut on the 80th anniversary \"to think that they liberated us\" hammered home the emotion, he said.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The assault began with Allied aircraft bombing German defenses in Normandy, followed by around 1,200 aircraft that carried airborne troops. As dawn broke, Allied forces started bombing German coastal defenses and shortly after that vessels began putting troops ashore on five codenamed beaches: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword. By the end of the day, nearly 160,000 Allied troops had landed in Normandy, although there were thousands of casualties.\n\nFew witnesses to history's biggest amphibious invasion remain alive today.

One hugged Biden, another saluted. When Biden learned it was the birthday of one of the veterans, he led the audience in singing 'Happy Birthday.'\n\nThe first lady clutched the arm of another veteran, Robert Gibson, to help him stand next to Biden as they shook hands. \"Don't get old,\" the 100-year-old man joked to the 81-year-old president, who was a toddler when D-Day took place.\n\nSteve Spielberg and Tom Hanks, the Hollywood heavyweights behind movies and television shows about World War II, were nearby.\n\nKING CHARLES AND QUEEN CAMILLA LEAD D-DAY COMMEMORATIONS AT NEW MEMORIAL IN FRANCE\n\nVER-SUR-MER, France -- King Charles III and Queen Camilla led commemorations at the new British Normandy Memorial in Ver-sur-Mer.\n\nCamilla wiped away a tear as actor Martin Freeman read words by 99-year-old D-Day veteran Joe Mines, recalling that \"I was 19 when I landed, but I was still a boy.

And I didn't have any idea of war and killing.\"\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak and Labour Party leader Keir Starmer took a break from campaigning for Britain's July 4 election to travel to France for the ceremony.\n\nSunak paid tribute to veterans, saying their \"actions freed a continent and built a better world.\"\n\n\"You risked everything and we owe you everything,\" he said. \"We cannot possibly hope to repay that debt but we can and we must pledge never to forget.\"\n\nWelsh singer Tom Jones, 83, sang his song \"I Won't Crumble With You If You Fall,\" before the king addressed the audience in French and English.\n\nCharles said that while the number of living veterans was dwindling, \"our obligation to remember what they stood for and what they achieved for us all can never diminish.\"\n\nSpeaking in French, Charles paid tribute to the \"unimaginable number\" of French civilians killed in the battle for Normandy, and the bravery and sacrifice of the French Resistance.\n\nMAN HONORS A GRANDFATHER HE NEVER KNEW, AN OFFICER WHO SMUGGLED HIMSELF ON A LANDING CRAFT\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Among the thousands who flocked to D-Day beach Utah was the grandson of an American colonel who smuggled himself aboard a landing craft so he could join his men in the first waves of the June 6, 1944, invasion.\n\nJohn Reistrup, 55, never met his grandfather, Eugene M. Caffey, who died in 1961. Coming back to Utah for the 80th anniversary was his way of carrying \"the torch for someone you never met that had such an impact on so many lives.\"\n\nA plaque at the beach that honors his grandfather says the colonel led the 19,500 men of the 1st Engineer Special Brigade tasked on that fateful day with the logistics of the landing on Utah, one of five invasion beaches.\n\nNot scheduled to land until 0900, Caffey, a 49-year-old father of nine, had smuggled himself, with no equipment except an empty rifle, aboard an 8th Infantry landing craft. En route he managed to load his rifle by taking up a collection of one bullet each from eight infantrymen. He arrived ashore very early in the assault, Reistrup said.\n\n\"No officers were allowed on the first waves of the landing but he said, 'Hell, no, I'm going with my guys.'\"\n\nA Nazi bunker captured on the beach then became his grandfather's office, he said. Caffey's portrait hangs there, inside, to this day.\n\nForging ahead into fire on D-Day \"has got to be the greatest courage you could ever have,\" said Reistrup, who has visited Normandy about 10 times since his first visit as a kid in 1974.\n\nNation & World Jewish veteran from London prepares to commemorate 80th anniversary of D-Day landings DANICA KIRKA Associated Press 4 min to read THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE DOT FRANCE'S UTAH BEACH FOR D-DAY COMMEMORATIONS\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Thousands of people, including many people in World War II-era uniforms, were stretched for several kilometers (miles) along Utah Beach ahead of commemorations marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings.\n\nUtah was one of the five landing beaches along the coast of Normandy where Allied troops landed on June 6, 2024. Utah and Omaha were taken -- at the cost of hundreds of lives -- by American forces, with the others stormed by troops from Britain and Canada, also killing many hundreds, plus others from France.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe long stretch of the Normandy coast is where the largest-ever land, sea and air armada punctured Hitler's defenses in Western Europe and helped precipitate his downfall 11 months later.\n\nA fair-like atmosphere is fueled by World War II-era jeeps and trucks tearing down hedge-rowed lanes so deadly for Allied troops who fought dug-in German defenders, and of reenactors playing at war on sands where D-Day soldiers fell.\n\nSurviving veterans, who are around 100 years old now, are the VIPs of the day's events.\n\nNation & World At 100, this vet says the 'greatest generation' moniker fits 'because we saved the world' ASSOCIATED PRESS 2 min to read 'FREEDOM COSTS,' DENMARK'S PRIME MINISTER SAYS AS SHE MARKS D-DAY'S 80TH ANNIVERSARY\n\nCOPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Denmark's prime minister said that this year's observances of the D-Day landings, which come as Russia is at war against Ukraine, are a reminder that there is a price for defending freedom.\n\n\"From D-Day we have learned that freedom costs,\" Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said in a statement as she headed to Normandy for ceremonies marking the 80th anniversary of the Allied landings.\n\n\"Eighty years later, Europe once again finds itself at a fateful moment. Where freedom is once again being fought for on our own continent,\" she said, \"against an aggressive and brutal enemy who will dictate country borders with brute force and leave a trail of death and destruction.\"\n\nIMAGINING THE HORROR AND CELEBRATING FREEDOM\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Because freedom is worth celebrating and passing on to children, too, Alexandra Hamon, 35, drank champagne and shared the sunrise with her boys, Karl and Neils, both 13, as the day dawned Thursday over the beaches where Allied soldiers landed on D-Day.\n\nThe family was among a crowd several thousands strong that stretched for kilometers along Utah beach -- one of the five beaches along the coast of Normandy where Allied troops landed. Utah and Omaha were taken -- at the cost of hundreds of lives -- by American forces, with the others stormed by troops from Britain and Canada, also killing many hundreds, plus others from France. The other code-named beaches are Juno, Sword and Gold.\n\nKarl sat perched on the hood of their 1943 Dodge truck, lovingly restored by her husband, Enogat, as the family from Saint Malo, a French coastal city that was badly damaged in major fighting about two months after D-Day, stared out across the English Channel.\n\nThe waters Thursday were still and peaceful -- unlike on that fateful day that helped change the course of WWII and precipitate Adolf Hitler's downfall 11 months later.\n\n\"It's indescribable, just imagining the chaos. Now it's peaceful, almost festive, we try to imagine but I think it's unimaginable,\" she said.\n\n\"You think of all those guys, everything they went through,\" she added of the fast-dwindling D-Day veterans. \"They say they aren't heroes. But they are, they are. Those guys really should never die. I imagine the boats, the guys arriving, the sounds. It must have been horrible, yes, horrible.\"\n\nKEEPING ALIVE THE MEMORY OF SOLDIERS 'WHO DIED FOR OUR FREEDOM'\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the rising sun took the night's chill off Utah Beach, Christophe Receveur, 57, from Thionville in eastern France, unfurled a Stars and Stripes he bought in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, six months ago specifically to honor the Americans who fell on D-Day.\n\n\"To keep alive the memory of the soldiers who died for our freedom,\" he said. \"To forget them is to let them die all over again.\"\n\nReceveur and his daughter, Julie, 28, carefully folded the flag into a tight triangle after their quiet, reflective homage on an empty stretch of the beach, busy with hundreds of people strung out along the sands.\n\nReceveur said the Ukraine war was on his mind, too, as he honored the fallen of WWII. His great grandfather fought in WWI, his grandfather was a prisoner of war in WWII, and his father was a veteran of France's war in former North African colony Algeria.\n\n\"I don't want our freedom, for our kids, our grandkids, to be hit by ... I don't want to say a madman,\" referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"So a lot of respect for these people who died and for those who are still dying,\" he said of the WWII dead and those in Ukraine.\n\nHe said the D-Day sacrifices have to be remembered. \"Lots of emotion that all these troops came to liberate a country that they didn't know for an ideology -- democracy, freedom -- that is under severe strain now.\"\n\n'WE JUST HAVE TO REMEMBER THE SACRIFICES'\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the golden sun pierced low clouds over the seas that were thick with landing craft approaching Normandy on D-Day, Becky Kraubetz peered across the English Channel toward her native Britain, her eyes filled with tears as she thought about the scene 80 years ago.\n\n\"It's so historic and we just have to remember the sacrifices of everybody who gave us our freedom,\" said Kraubetz, whose grandfather served with the British Army during World War II and was captured in Malta.\n\n\"It gives you goosebumps, everything that happened here. Imagine just jumping into the water, freezing cold,\" said the 54-year-old who now lives in Florida, as the rays of the morning sun started to warm the hundreds of people who'd waited through the night's chill for dawn's break.\n\n\"The bravery, the courage, for people to face that is just unbelievable -- very, very humbled to be here.\"\n\nTHE SUN RISES OVER NORMANDY BEACHES AS THE WORLD REMEMBERS D-DAY\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the sun sets on the D-Day generation, it's rising again over Normandy beaches where soldiers fought and died exactly 80 years ago, kicking off intense anniversary commemorations Thursday against the backdrop of renewed war in Europe, in Ukraine.\n\nEver-dwindling numbers of World War II veterans, and Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, make this anniversary particularly meaningful, mixing poignant remembrances for D-Day sacrifices with an Allied show of solidarity for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, among the guests.\n\nBut host France hasn't invited World War II ally Russia, citing its \"war of aggression against Ukraine that has intensified in recent weeks.\"\n\nHUNDREDS GATHER AT DAWN AT UTAH BEACH TO MARK D-DAY'S 80TH ANNIVERSARY\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Hundreds of people, some in WWII-era uniforms, arrived before dawn to stretch out across the now peaceful sands of Utah Beach, one of the five Allied landing zones on D-Day where troops waded into cold seas through hails of fire exactly 80 years ago.\n\n\"It's our way of paying homage, and better understanding what really happened in the 1944 landings,\" said Dimitri Picot, a 33-year-old from the nearby Normandy town of Carentan who works as a rat and pest catcher.\n\nPicot said he often dives on a wrecked ship that was hit and exploded, its wreckage visible Thursday as night gave way to day. Growing up amid the June 6, 1944, landing zones, he said he has become accustomed to seeing walls still pockmarked by bullets, shrapnel and other reminders of that fateful day.\n\nBut on the 80th anniversary \"to think that they liberated us\" hammered home the emotion, he said.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

In total, 6,330 ships and 10,440 aircraft were involved alongside 153,110 troops.\n\nThe forces divided across five beaches and, in less than a week, they were able to secure them, meaning the beaches could then be used to deliver more equipment, vehicles, and troops to the Allies going forward.\n\nThe operation was originally set to take place the day before, on June 5, but bad weather caused the forces to push it back.\n\nMany refer to D-Day and the Normandy landings as the \"beginning of the end\" of the Second World War and the Nazi's hold over Europe.\n\nThe estimates of how many passed away on D-Day vary. But, according to John Long, the director of education at the National D-Day Memorial Foundation, between 5,000 and 12,000 soldiers from the Allied Forces are thought to have died on D-Day.\n\nAs for German casualties, the number is predicted to be between 4,000 and 9,000, with the Allies capturing some 200,000 German prisoners of war.\n\nThe 'D' in D-Day is merely a code word used by the military to designate an occasion; it has no symbolic meaning.\n\nEven before they knew the exact date of the invasion, the military began organising the specifics of the operation. They called it D-Day to help plan things like when the troop ships should depart England.The 'D' is commonly understood to stand for day, therefore D-Day is really called Day Day.\n\nAlthough the name D-Day has been applied to other military events, the Allied invasion of Normandy is now closely linked to it.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy_landings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Normandy landings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword_Beach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sword Beach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Overlord", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Operation Overlord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charles I of England"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_military_administration_in_occupied_France_during_World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "German military administration in occupied France during World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawker_Typhoon", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hawker Typhoon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Arrows", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Red Arrows"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portsmouth", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Portsmouth"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Portsmouth"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southsea", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Southsea"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Southsea"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Channel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "English Channel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airborne_forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Airborne forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_mine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Naval mine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troopship", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Troopship"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner_of_war", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prisoner of war"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nazism"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture_and_Forestry/Trade_Shows", "label": "dmoz/Business/Agriculture and Forestry/Trade Shows", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Cao_Dai", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Cao Dai", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 69}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/evening_standard_239/4819d9c8f4b77e457824a3b532482ead", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628959", "eventUri": "eng-9628959", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-05", "textStart": 437, "textEnd": 443, "freq": 2}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 158, "relevance": 1}

The Battle of Normandy, often referred to as D-Day and codenamed \"Operation Overlord,\" has been described by historians as a major turning point for the Allied forces in World War II.\n\nThe nearly 160,000 Allied troops, made up of American, British and Canadian forces, landed on the beaches of Nazi-occupied France and were then able to push inland to Western Europe.\n\nThe bravery displayed by these troops has been depicted in many books and films, including \"Saving Private Ryan\" and the book-turned-HBO miniseries \"Band of Brothers.\"\n\nRELATED: Haunting art installation marks D-Day anniversary: See the pics\n\nWhat does \"D\" stand for in D-Day? It depends on who you ask.\n\nSome say it stands for designated day, decision day, doomsday or even death day, according to the U.S. military.\n\nOthers also said it merely stands for \"Day,\" as in Day-Day.\n\nThere have been other instances in history which utilized D-Day as a coded designation for the day of any important invasion or military operation, the U.S. military said.\n\nReferencing Stephen Ambrose's book, \"D-Day, June 6, 1944: The Climactic Battle of World War II,\" the U.S. Army's first use of D-Day was in 1918.\n\n\"For military planners (and later historians), the days before and after a D-Day were indicated using plus and minus signs: D-4 meant four days before a D-Day, while D+7 meant seven days after a D-Day,\" according to the U.S. Army website.\n\nAn unknown person allegedly wrote to General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Allied supreme commander for Operation Overlord, and asked what the \"D\" meant.\n\nHis executive assistant at the time, Brigadier Gen. Robert Schultz answered:\n\n\"General Eisenhower asked me to respond to your letter. Be advised that any amphibious operation has a 'departed date'; therefore the shortened term 'D-Day' is used,\" the Army's website reads.\n\nRELATED: D-Day veterans return to Normandy for 80th anniversary, share memories and messages for future generations\n\nAdolf Hitler's army had invaded France and was aiming to take over all of Europe. The Allies knew that a successful invasion of mainland Europe was key to winning the war.\n\nIn January 1944, Eisenhower was appointed Allied supreme commander for Operation Overlord.\n\nMany locations were considered in the planning stages of the invasion. According to the National D-Day Memorial Foundation, Normandy was ultimately chosen with one reason being its many weak sections along the Atlantic Wall, a series of concrete fortifications that Hitler ordered to be built along the coast.\n\nIn the months leading up to D-Day, the Allies set up decoy operations to confuse the Germans, according to the foundation. The code name for this deception was Operation Fortitude, and they intended to trick the Germans into thinking the main invasion target was Norway or Pas de Calais in northern France, rather than Normandy.\n\nThe Allies even created a \"dummy army\" called the First U.S. Army Group commanded by Lt. General George Patton, according to military historian and author Flint Whitlock.\n\nEisenhower and the Allied leaders postponed the planned D-Day from the beginning of May to June 5, 1944.\n\nHowever, bad weather a few days before June 5 caused further delay, pushing D-Day to June 6, according to History.com. After Eisenhower's meteorologists forecasted a short window of suitable conditions, he gave the go-ahead for Operation Overlord.\n\n\"The weather was still not perfect the day of Operation Overlord, but it allowed the Allies to gain the footing they needed on the European mainland,\" an explanation reads on the National D-Day Memorial Foundation website.\n\nThe sea landings started at 6:30 a.m., just after dawn, targeting five code-named beaches: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno, Sword. The operation also included actions inland, including overnight parachute landings on strategic German sites and U.S. Army Rangers scaling cliffs to take out German gun positions.\n\nAround 13,000 Allied aircraft, 5,000 ships and boats, and thousands of other vehicles were involved.\n\nBy the end of June, the Allies had seized the key port of Cherbourg, according to historians.\n\nApproximately 850,000 men had landed in Normandy, and the Allied forces were set to push farther across France.\n\nBy the end of August 1944, Paris was liberated and the Nazis had been removed from northwestern France. This led to the Allied troops later entering Germany, where Soviet troops were advancing in the east.\n\nThe invasion of Normandy began to \"turn the tide\" against Nazi Germany. A History Channel description called it a \"significant psychological blow,\" preventing Hitler from sending troops from France to build up his Eastern front against the Soviets.\n\nBy May 8, 1945, the Allies would formally accept Nazi Germany's unconditional surrender.\n\nA total of 4,414 Allied troops were killed on D-Day itself, including 2,501 Americans. More than 5,000 were wounded.\n\nIn the ensuing Battle of Normandy, 73,000 Allied forces were killed and 153,000 wounded. The battle -- and especially the Allied bombings of French villages and cities -- killed around 20,000 French civilians.\n\nThe exact German casualties aren't known, but historians estimate between 4,000 and 9,000 men were killed, wounded or missing during the D-Day invasion alone.

The assault began with Allied aircraft bombing German defenses in Normandy, followed by around 1,200 aircraft that carried airborne troops. As dawn broke, Allied forces started bombing German coastal defenses and shortly after that vessels began putting troops ashore on five codenamed beaches: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword. By the end of the day, nearly 160,000 Allied troops had landed in Normandy, although there were thousands of casualties.\n\nFew witnesses to history's biggest amphibious invasion remain alive today.

One hugged Biden, another saluted. When Biden learned it was the birthday of one of the veterans, he led the audience in singing 'Happy Birthday.'\n\nThe first lady clutched the arm of another veteran, Robert Gibson, to help him stand next to Biden as they shook hands. \"Don't get old,\" the 100-year-old man joked to the 81-year-old president, who was a toddler when D-Day took place.\n\nSteve Spielberg and Tom Hanks, the Hollywood heavyweights behind movies and television shows about World War II, were nearby.\n\nKING CHARLES AND QUEEN CAMILLA LEAD D-DAY COMMEMORATIONS AT NEW MEMORIAL IN FRANCE\n\nVER-SUR-MER, France -- King Charles III and Queen Camilla led commemorations at the new British Normandy Memorial in Ver-sur-Mer.\n\nCamilla wiped away a tear as actor Martin Freeman read words by 99-year-old D-Day veteran Joe Mines, recalling that \"I was 19 when I landed, but I was still a boy. I don't care what people say, I wasn't a man, I was a boy. And I didn't have any idea of war and killing.\"\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak and Labour Party leader Keir Starmer took a break from campaigning for Britain's July 4 election to travel to France for the ceremony.\n\nSunak paid tribute to veterans, saying their \"actions freed a continent and built a better world.\"\n\n\"You risked everything and we owe you everything,\" he said. \"We cannot possibly hope to repay that debt but we can and we must pledge never to forget.\"\n\nWelsh singer Tom Jones, 83, sang his song \"I Won't Crumble With You If You Fall,\" before the king addressed the audience in French and English.\n\nCharles said that while the number of living veterans was dwindling, \"our obligation to remember what they stood for and what they achieved for us all can never diminish.\"\n\nSpeaking in French, Charles paid tribute to the \"unimaginable number\" of French civilians killed in the battle for Normandy, and the bravery and sacrifice of the French Resistance.\n\nMAN HONORS A GRANDFATHER HE NEVER KNEW, AN OFFICER WHO SMUGGLED HIMSELF ON A LANDING CRAFT\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Among the thousands who flocked to D-Day beach Utah was the grandson of an American colonel who smuggled himself aboard a landing craft so he could join his men in the first waves of the June 6, 1944, invasion.\n\nJohn Reistrup, 55, never met his grandfather, Eugene M. Caffey, who died in 1961. Coming back to Utah for the 80th anniversary was his way of carrying \"the torch for someone you never met that had such an impact on so many lives.\"\n\nA plaque at the beach that honors his grandfather says the colonel led the 19,500 men of the 1st Engineer Special Brigade tasked on that fateful day with the logistics of the landing on Utah, one of five invasion beaches.\n\nNot scheduled to land until 0900, Caffey, a 49-year-old father of nine, had smuggled himself, with no equipment except an empty rifle, aboard an 8th Infantry landing craft. En route he managed to load his rifle by taking up a collection of one bullet each from eight infantrymen. He arrived ashore very early in the assault, Reistrup said.\n\n\"No officers were allowed on the first waves of the landing but he said, 'Hell, no, I'm going with my guys.'\"\n\nA Nazi bunker captured on the beach then became his grandfather's office, he said. Caffey's portrait hangs there, inside, to this day.\n\nForging ahead into fire on D-Day \"has got to be the greatest courage you could ever have,\" said Reistrup, who has visited Normandy about 10 times since his first visit as a kid in 1974.\n\nNation & World Jewish veteran from London prepares to commemorate 80th anniversary of D-Day landings DANICA KIRKA Associated Press 4 min to read THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE DOT FRANCE'S UTAH BEACH FOR D-DAY COMMEMORATIONS\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Thousands of people, including many people in World War II-era uniforms, were stretched for several kilometers (miles) along Utah Beach ahead of commemorations marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings.\n\nUtah was one of the five landing beaches along the coast of Normandy where Allied troops landed on June 6, 2024. Utah and Omaha were taken -- at the cost of hundreds of lives -- by American forces, with the others stormed by troops from Britain and Canada, also killing many hundreds, plus others from France.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe long stretch of the Normandy coast is where the largest-ever land, sea and air armada punctured Hitler's defenses in Western Europe and helped precipitate his downfall 11 months later.\n\nA fair-like atmosphere is fueled by World War II-era jeeps and trucks tearing down hedge-rowed lanes so deadly for Allied troops who fought dug-in German defenders, and of reenactors playing at war on sands where D-Day soldiers fell.\n\nSurviving veterans, who are around 100 years old now, are the VIPs of the day's events.\n\nNation & World At 100, this vet says the 'greatest generation' moniker fits 'because we saved the world' ASSOCIATED PRESS 2 min to read 'FREEDOM COSTS,' DENMARK'S PRIME MINISTER SAYS AS SHE MARKS D-DAY'S 80TH ANNIVERSARY\n\nCOPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Denmark's prime minister said that this year's observances of the D-Day landings, which come as Russia is at war against Ukraine, are a reminder that there is a price for defending freedom.\n\n\"From D-Day we have learned that freedom costs,\" Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said in a statement as she headed to Normandy for ceremonies marking the 80th anniversary of the Allied landings.\n\n\"Eighty years later, Europe once again finds itself at a fateful moment. Where freedom is once again being fought for on our own continent,\" she said, \"against an aggressive and brutal enemy who will dictate country borders with brute force and leave a trail of death and destruction.\"\n\nIMAGINING THE HORROR AND CELEBRATING FREEDOM\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Because freedom is worth celebrating and passing on to children, too, Alexandra Hamon, 35, drank champagne and shared the sunrise with her boys, Karl and Neils, both 13, as the day dawned Thursday over the beaches where Allied soldiers landed on D-Day.\n\nThe family was among a crowd several thousands strong that stretched for kilometers along Utah beach -- one of the five beaches along the coast of Normandy where Allied troops landed. Utah and Omaha were taken -- at the cost of hundreds of lives -- by American forces, with the others stormed by troops from Britain and Canada, also killing many hundreds, plus others from France. The other code-named beaches are Juno, Sword and Gold.\n\nKarl sat perched on the hood of their 1943 Dodge truck, lovingly restored by her husband, Enogat, as the family from Saint Malo, a French coastal city that was badly damaged in major fighting about two months after D-Day, stared out across the English Channel.\n\nThe waters Thursday were still and peaceful -- unlike on that fateful day that helped change the course of WWII and precipitate Adolf Hitler's downfall 11 months later.\n\n\"It's indescribable, just imagining the chaos. Now it's peaceful, almost festive, we try to imagine but I think it's unimaginable,\" she said.\n\n\"You think of all those guys, everything they went through,\" she added of the fast-dwindling D-Day veterans. \"They say they aren't heroes. But they are, they are. Those guys really should never die. I imagine the boats, the guys arriving, the sounds. It must have been horrible, yes, horrible.\"\n\nKEEPING ALIVE THE MEMORY OF SOLDIERS 'WHO DIED FOR OUR FREEDOM'\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the rising sun took the night's chill off Utah Beach, Christophe Receveur, 57, from Thionville in eastern France, unfurled a Stars and Stripes he bought in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, six months ago specifically to honor the Americans who fell on D-Day.\n\n\"To keep alive the memory of the soldiers who died for our freedom,\" he said. \"To forget them is to let them die all over again.\"\n\nReceveur and his daughter, Julie, 28, carefully folded the flag into a tight triangle after their quiet, reflective homage on an empty stretch of the beach, busy with hundreds of people strung out along the sands.\n\nReceveur said the Ukraine war was on his mind, too, as he honored the fallen of WWII. His great grandfather fought in WWI, his grandfather was a prisoner of war in WWII, and his father was a veteran of France's war in former North African colony Algeria.\n\n\"I don't want our freedom, for our kids, our grandkids, to be hit by ... I don't want to say a madman,\" referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"So a lot of respect for these people who died and for those who are still dying,\" he said of the WWII dead and those in Ukraine.\n\nHe said the D-Day sacrifices have to be remembered. \"Lots of emotion that all these troops came to liberate a country that they didn't know for an ideology -- democracy, freedom -- that is under severe strain now.\"\n\n'WE JUST HAVE TO REMEMBER THE SACRIFICES'\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the golden sun pierced low clouds over the seas that were thick with landing craft approaching Normandy on D-Day, Becky Kraubetz peered across the English Channel toward her native Britain, her eyes filled with tears as she thought about the scene 80 years ago.\n\n\"It's so historic and we just have to remember the sacrifices of everybody who gave us our freedom,\" said Kraubetz, whose grandfather served with the British Army during World War II and was captured in Malta.\n\n\"It gives you goosebumps, everything that happened here. Imagine just jumping into the water, freezing cold,\" said the 54-year-old who now lives in Florida, as the rays of the morning sun started to warm the hundreds of people who'd waited through the night's chill for dawn's break.\n\n\"The bravery, the courage, for people to face that is just unbelievable -- very, very humbled to be here.\"\n\nTHE SUN RISES OVER NORMANDY BEACHES AS THE WORLD REMEMBERS D-DAY\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the sun sets on the D-Day generation, it's rising again over Normandy beaches where soldiers fought and died exactly 80 years ago, kicking off intense anniversary commemorations Thursday against the backdrop of renewed war in Europe, in Ukraine.\n\nEver-dwindling numbers of World War II veterans, and Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, make this anniversary particularly meaningful, mixing poignant remembrances for D-Day sacrifices with an Allied show of solidarity for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, among the guests.\n\nBut host France hasn't invited World War II ally Russia, citing its \"war of aggression against Ukraine that has intensified in recent weeks.\"\n\nHUNDREDS GATHER AT DAWN AT UTAH BEACH TO MARK D-DAY'S 80TH ANNIVERSARY\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Hundreds of people, some in WWII-era uniforms, arrived before dawn to stretch out across the now peaceful sands of Utah Beach, one of the five Allied landing zones on D-Day where troops waded into cold seas through hails of fire exactly 80 years ago.\n\n\"It's our way of paying homage, and better understanding what really happened in the 1944 landings,\" said Dimitri Picot, a 33-year-old from the nearby Normandy town of Carentan who works as a rat and pest catcher.\n\nPicot said he often dives on a wrecked ship that was hit and exploded, its wreckage visible Thursday as night gave way to day. Growing up amid the June 6, 1944, landing zones, he said he has become accustomed to seeing walls still pockmarked by bullets, shrapnel and other reminders of that fateful day.\n\nBut on the 80th anniversary \"to think that they liberated us\" hammered home the emotion, he said.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

This also comes amid the ongoing war in Europe, over two years after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron hosted US president Joe Biden, King Charles III of the UK, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, representing the Allied powers whose troops made the ultimate sacrifice during the Normandy landings on June 6, 1944.This pivotal event, codenamed Operation Overlord, marked a turning point in World War II, leading to the eventual downfall of Nazi Germany.\n\nThe commemoration will see the participation of approximately 150 American veterans, 15 Canadian veterans, and over 40 British WWII veterans in Normandy.\n\nD-Day\n\nOriginally scheduled for June 5, 1944, D-Day was delayed by 24 hours due to storms, awaiting optimal conditions of a full moon, low tides, and good weather.\n\nD-Day was a generic code for the start of any significant operation, with the initial 'D' representing 'Day.' Before the Allied invasion in June 1944, this term was commonly used. However, post-Operation Overlord, 'D-Day' became synonymous with the Normandy invasion.\n\nD-Day showcased an unprecedented level of international military collaboration, with over 2 million troops positioned in the UK in preparation for the invasion, according to the Imperial War Museums (IWM).\n\nA plan that was executed after a year\n\nThe planning for D-Day began over a year earlier and included extensive military deception to mislead the Germans about the invasion's timing and location. This strategy, known as Operation Bodyguard, encompassed Operation Fortitude, which aimed to convince the Nazis that the main invasion would occur in Norway (Fortitude North) and Pas de Calais (Fortitude South), not Normandy.\n\nHuman cost of the operation\n\nThe human cost of D-Day was staggering. On that single day, 4,414 Allied troops were killed, including 2,501 Americans, with more than 5,000 wounded. German casualties ranged between 4,000 and 9,000. The subsequent Battle of Normandy, lasting 77 days, resulted in 73,000 Allied forces killed and 153,000 wounded, with around 20,000 French civilians killed due to Allied bombings.\n\nEnd of Hitler\n\nD-Day is often described as the \"beginning of the end\" of Hitler's regime. The successful landings enabled the Allies to establish a foothold in Western Europe, leading to the liberation of France and the eventual defeat of Nazi Germany. Less than a year after D-Day, on May 7, 1945, Nazi Germany surrendered unconditionally, marking the end of World War II in Europe.\n\nThis year's commemoration holds particular significance against the backdrop of the ongoing conflict in Europe due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\n( with input from agencies)\n\nAt TOI World Desk, our dedicated team of seasoned journalists and passionate writers tirelessly sifts through the vast tapestry of global events to bring you the latest news and diverse perspectives round the clock.

French President Emmanuel Macron will join him at the event.\n\nThe 172.5 acre cemetery was established by the U.S. First Army on June 8, 1944 as the first American cemetery on European soil in World War II.\n\nA French and American flag decorated each grave site. The cemetery was quiet in the early morning hours before it was filled with the 10,000 people to mark the anniversary of the landing on Omaha Beach below.\n\nThursday is a sunny, beautiful day - a sharp contrast to the weather 80 years ago, when troops battled the wind and rain to reach the beaches.\n\nThe only sounds were the birds in the trees and the waves of the English Channel. A few rabbits ran on the outskirts of the cemetery proper. The area was French farmland before it was gifted to the United States for the burial of American dead.\n\nA Navy destroyer sat off-shore, a single reminder of the 6,939 vessels that stormed the beaches 80 years ago. B-52 bombers flew overhead.\n\nThe Normandy landings, code named Operation Neptune, was the largest sea, air and land invasion in history. It was the start of the downfall of Adolf Hitler and the defeat of Nazi Germany.\n\nThe assault began with Allied aircraft bombing German defenses in Normandy, followed by around 1,200 aircraft that carried airborne troops.\n\nAs the sun rose, ships began putting troops ashore on five codenamed beaches: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword. By the end of the day, nearly 160,000 Allied troops had landed in Normandy. There were thousands of casualties.\n\nThis year's ceremony is thought to be one of the last major anniversaries that will see D-Day veterans attend. The men and women who fought in the conflict are now in their 90s or older. Less than 1% of of the 16.4 million Americans who served during World War II are alive today.\n\nU.S. military personnel arrive at the Normandy American Cemetery above Omaha Beach\n\nSun rises over Omaha Beach near Colleville-sur-Mer Normandy\n\nFrance's President Emmanuel Macron (center) and France's First Lady Brigitte Macron (second right) are welcomed by French officials as they arrive at Normandy\n\nThis photograph is believed to show E Company, 16th Regiment, 1st Infantry Division, participating in the first wave of assaults during D-Day in Normandy\n\nAlso on Thursday King Charles and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will part in a ceremony later in the day to honor them and the British troops who also landed on Sword beach, while Prince William will participate in a ceremony for the Canadian troops who landed on Juno beach that will also include Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n\nLater in the day, Biden will join international leaders in marking the solomn anniversary, which comes as the allies show solidarity to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who will be among the guests.\n\nIt will take place on Omaha Beach, site of some of the heaviest, deadliest fighting between U.S. forces and the German occupiers in France.\n\nRussia was not invited even though the role of the Soviet Red Army played a critical role in the defeat of Hitler. A decade ago, President Vladimir Putin attended the 70th anniversary celebration.\n\nBiden will return to Normandy on Friday to deliver a second speech, this time at Pointe du Hoc, where Army Rangers scaled the cliffs as German gunfire rained down on them.\n\nHe will make what the White House is billing as a major speech, where he will warn about the threats to democracy and the rise of dictators.\n\n'It's going to be action packed and, I think, extremely moving,' Sullivan said, adding that it's an 'opportunity for him to say thank you directly to the veterans who saved democracy, saved the free world, and set the stage for the decades of peace and prosperity that followed.'", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [],

The assault began with Allied aircraft bombing German defenses in Normandy, followed by around 1,200 aircraft that carried airborne troops. As dawn broke, Allied forces started bombing German coastal defenses and shortly after that vessels began putting troops ashore on five codenamed beaches: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword. By the end of the day, nearly 160,000 Allied troops had landed in Normandy, although there were thousands of casualties.\n\nFew witnesses to history's biggest amphibious invasion remain alive today.

One hugged Biden, another saluted. When Biden learned it was the birthday of one of the veterans, he led the audience in singing 'Happy Birthday.'\n\nThe first lady clutched the arm of another veteran, Robert Gibson, to help him stand next to Biden as they shook hands. \"Don't get old,\" the 100-year-old man joked to the 81-year-old president, who was a toddler when D-Day took place.\n\nSteve Spielberg and Tom Hanks, the Hollywood heavyweights behind movies and television shows about World War II, were nearby.\n\nKING CHARLES AND QUEEN CAMILLA LEAD D-DAY COMMEMORATIONS AT NEW MEMORIAL IN FRANCE\n\nVER-SUR-MER, France -- King Charles III and Queen Camilla led commemorations at the new British Normandy Memorial in Ver-sur-Mer.\n\nCamilla wiped away a tear as actor Martin Freeman read words by 99-year-old D-Day veteran Joe Mines, recalling that \"I was 19 when I landed, but I was still a boy. I don't care what people say, I wasn't a man, I was a boy. And I didn't have any idea of war and killing.\"\n\nPrime Minister Rishi Sunak and Labour Party leader Keir Starmer took a break from campaigning for Britain's July 4 election to travel to France for the ceremony.\n\nSunak paid tribute to veterans, saying their \"actions freed a continent and built a better world.\"\n\n\"You risked everything and we owe you everything,\" he said. \"We cannot possibly hope to repay that debt but we can and we must pledge never to forget.\"\n\nWelsh singer Tom Jones, 83, sang his song \"I Won't Crumble With You If You Fall,\" before the king addressed the audience in French and English.\n\nCharles said that while the number of living veterans was dwindling, \"our obligation to remember what they stood for and what they achieved for us all can never diminish.\"\n\nSpeaking in French, Charles paid tribute to the \"unimaginable number\" of French civilians killed in the battle for Normandy, and the bravery and sacrifice of the French Resistance.\n\nMAN HONORS A GRANDFATHER HE NEVER KNEW, AN OFFICER WHO SMUGGLED HIMSELF ON A LANDING CRAFT\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Among the thousands who flocked to D-Day beach Utah was the grandson of an American colonel who smuggled himself aboard a landing craft so he could join his men in the first waves of the June 6, 1944, invasion.\n\nJohn Reistrup, 55, never met his grandfather, Eugene M. Caffey, who died in 1961. Coming back to Utah for the 80th anniversary was his way of carrying \"the torch for someone you never met that had such an impact on so many lives.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nA plaque at the beach that honors his grandfather says the colonel led the 19,500 men of the 1st Engineer Special Brigade tasked on that fateful day with the logistics of the landing on Utah, one of five invasion beaches.\n\nNot scheduled to land until 0900, Caffey, a 49-year-old father of nine, had smuggled himself, with no equipment except an empty rifle, aboard an 8th Infantry landing craft. En route he managed to load his rifle by taking up a collection of one bullet each from eight infantrymen. He arrived ashore very early in the assault, Reistrup said.\n\n\"No officers were allowed on the first waves of the landing but he said, 'Hell, no, I'm going with my guys.'\"\n\nA Nazi bunker captured on the beach then became his grandfather's office, he said. Caffey's portrait hangs there, inside, to this day.\n\nForging ahead into fire on D-Day \"has got to be the greatest courage you could ever have,\" said Reistrup, who has visited Normandy about 10 times since his first visit as a kid in 1974.\n\nNation & World Jewish veteran from London prepares to commemorate 80th anniversary of D-Day landings DANICA KIRKA Associated Press 4 min to read THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE DOT FRANCE'S UTAH BEACH FOR D-DAY COMMEMORATIONS\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Thousands of people, including many people in World War II-era uniforms, were stretched for several kilometers (miles) along Utah Beach ahead of commemorations marking the 80th anniversary of the D-Day landings.\n\nUtah was one of the five landing beaches along the coast of Normandy where Allied troops landed on June 6, 2024. Utah and Omaha were taken -- at the cost of hundreds of lives -- by American forces, with the others stormed by troops from Britain and Canada, also killing many hundreds, plus others from France.\n\nThe long stretch of the Normandy coast is where the largest-ever land, sea and air armada punctured Hitler's defenses in Western Europe and helped precipitate his downfall 11 months later.\n\nA fair-like atmosphere is fueled by World War II-era jeeps and trucks tearing down hedge-rowed lanes so deadly for Allied troops who fought dug-in German defenders, and of reenactors playing at war on sands where D-Day soldiers fell.\n\nSurviving veterans, who are around 100 years old now, are the VIPs of the day's events.\n\nNation & World At 100, this vet says the 'greatest generation' moniker fits 'because we saved the world' ASSOCIATED PRESS 2 min to read 'FREEDOM COSTS,' DENMARK'S PRIME MINISTER SAYS AS SHE MARKS D-DAY'S 80TH ANNIVERSARY\n\nCOPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Denmark's prime minister said that this year's observances of the D-Day landings, which come as Russia is at war against Ukraine, are a reminder that there is a price for defending freedom.\n\n\"From D-Day we have learned that freedom costs,\" Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said in a statement as she headed to Normandy for ceremonies marking the 80th anniversary of the Allied landings.\n\n\"Eighty years later, Europe once again finds itself at a fateful moment. Where freedom is once again being fought for on our own continent,\" she said, \"against an aggressive and brutal enemy who will dictate country borders with brute force and leave a trail of death and destruction.\"\n\nIMAGINING THE HORROR AND CELEBRATING FREEDOM\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Because freedom is worth celebrating and passing on to children, too, Alexandra Hamon, 35, drank champagne and shared the sunrise with her boys, Karl and Neils, both 13, as the day dawned Thursday over the beaches where Allied soldiers landed on D-Day.\n\nThe family was among a crowd several thousands strong that stretched for kilometers along Utah beach -- one of the five beaches along the coast of Normandy where Allied troops landed. Utah and Omaha were taken -- at the cost of hundreds of lives -- by American forces, with the others stormed by troops from Britain and Canada, also killing many hundreds, plus others from France. The other code-named beaches are Juno, Sword and Gold.\n\nKarl sat perched on the hood of their 1943 Dodge truck, lovingly restored by her husband, Enogat, as the family from Saint Malo, a French coastal city that was badly damaged in major fighting about two months after D-Day, stared out across the English Channel.\n\nThe waters Thursday were still and peaceful -- unlike on that fateful day that helped change the course of WWII and precipitate Adolf Hitler's downfall 11 months later.\n\n\"It's indescribable, just imagining the chaos. Now it's peaceful, almost festive, we try to imagine but I think it's unimaginable,\" she said.\n\n\"You think of all those guys, everything they went through,\" she added of the fast-dwindling D-Day veterans. \"They say they aren't heroes. But they are, they are. Those guys really should never die. I imagine the boats, the guys arriving, the sounds. It must have been horrible, yes, horrible.\"\n\nKEEPING ALIVE THE MEMORY OF SOLDIERS 'WHO DIED FOR OUR FREEDOM'\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the rising sun took the night's chill off Utah Beach, Christophe Receveur, 57, from Thionville in eastern France, unfurled a Stars and Stripes he bought in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, six months ago specifically to honor the Americans who fell on D-Day.\n\n\"To keep alive the memory of the soldiers who died for our freedom,\" he said. \"To forget them is to let them die all over again.\"\n\nReceveur and his daughter, Julie, 28, carefully folded the flag into a tight triangle after their quiet, reflective homage on an empty stretch of the beach, busy with hundreds of people strung out along the sands.\n\nReceveur said the Ukraine war was on his mind, too, as he honored the fallen of WWII. His great grandfather fought in WWI, his grandfather was a prisoner of war in WWII, and his father was a veteran of France's war in former North African colony Algeria.\n\n\"I don't want our freedom, for our kids, our grandkids, to be hit by ... I don't want to say a madman,\" referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"So a lot of respect for these people who died and for those who are still dying,\" he said of the WWII dead and those in Ukraine.\n\nHe said the D-Day sacrifices have to be remembered. \"Lots of emotion that all these troops came to liberate a country that they didn't know for an ideology -- democracy, freedom -- that is under severe strain now.\"\n\n'WE JUST HAVE TO REMEMBER THE SACRIFICES'\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the golden sun pierced low clouds over the seas that were thick with landing craft approaching Normandy on D-Day, Becky Kraubetz peered across the English Channel toward her native Britain, her eyes filled with tears as she thought about the scene 80 years ago.\n\n\"It's so historic and we just have to remember the sacrifices of everybody who gave us our freedom,\" said Kraubetz, whose grandfather served with the British Army during World War II and was captured in Malta.\n\n\"It gives you goosebumps, everything that happened here. Imagine just jumping into the water, freezing cold,\" said the 54-year-old who now lives in Florida, as the rays of the morning sun started to warm the hundreds of people who'd waited through the night's chill for dawn's break.\n\n\"The bravery, the courage, for people to face that is just unbelievable -- very, very humbled to be here.\"\n\nTHE SUN RISES OVER NORMANDY BEACHES AS THE WORLD REMEMBERS D-DAY\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- As the sun sets on the D-Day generation, it's rising again over Normandy beaches where soldiers fought and died exactly 80 years ago, kicking off intense anniversary commemorations Thursday against the backdrop of renewed war in Europe, in Ukraine.\n\nEver-dwindling numbers of World War II veterans, and Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, make this anniversary particularly meaningful, mixing poignant remembrances for D-Day sacrifices with an Allied show of solidarity for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, among the guests.\n\nBut host France hasn't invited World War II ally Russia, citing its \"war of aggression against Ukraine that has intensified in recent weeks.\"\n\nHUNDREDS GATHER AT DAWN AT UTAH BEACH TO MARK D-DAY'S 80TH ANNIVERSARY\n\nUTAH BEACH, France -- Hundreds of people, some in WWII-era uniforms, arrived before dawn to stretch out across the now peaceful sands of Utah Beach, one of the five Allied landing zones on D-Day where troops waded into cold seas through hails of fire exactly 80 years ago.\n\n\"It's our way of paying homage, and better understanding what really happened in the 1944 landings,\" said Dimitri Picot, a 33-year-old from the nearby Normandy town of Carentan who works as a rat and pest catcher.\n\nPicot said he often dives on a wrecked ship that was hit and exploded, its wreckage visible Thursday as night gave way to day. Growing up amid the June 6, 1944, landing zones, he said he has become accustomed to seeing walls still pockmarked by bullets, shrapnel and other reminders of that fateful day.\n\nBut on the 80th anniversary \"to think that they liberated us\" hammered home the emotion, he said.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

On June 6, shortly after midnight, 2,200 Allied bombers attacked German positions to soften the landing zones for amphibious troops. One of the reasons Omaha Beach was so bloody is that thick cloud coverage in that area rendered the bombing campaign at Omaha ineffective, leaving enemy infrastructure -- and guns -- in perfect working order.\n\nOMAHA BEACH, France (AP) -- The June 6, 1944, D-Day invasion of Nazi-occupied France was unprecedented in scale and audacity, using the largest-ever armada of ships, troops, planes and vehicles to punch a hole in Adolf Hitler's defenses in western Europe and change the course of World War II.\n\nWith veterans and world dignitaries gathering in Normandy to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the landings, here's a look at some details about how the operation unfolded.\n\nWHO TOOK PART\n\nNearly 160,000 Allied troops landed in Normandy on June 6, 1944. Of those, 73,000 were from the United States and 83,000 from Britain and Canada. Forces from several other countries were also involved, including French troops fighting with Gen. Charles de Gaulle.\n\nThe Allies faced around 50,000 German forces.\n\nMore than 2 million Allied soldiers, sailors, pilots, medics and other people from a dozen countries were involved in the overall Operation Overlord, the battle to wrest western France from Nazi control that started on D-Day.\n\nWHERE AND WHEN\n\nThe sea landings started at 6:30 a.m., just after dawn, targeting five code-named beaches: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno, Sword. The operation also included actions inland, including overnight parachute landings on strategic German sites and U.S. Army Rangers scaling cliffs to take out German gun positions.\n\nAround 11,000 Allied aircraft, 7,000 ships and boats, and thousands of other vehicles were involved.\n\nMANY DEATHS ON ALL SIDES\n\nA total of 4,414 Allied troops were killed on D-Day itself, including 2,501 Americans. More than 5,000 were wounded.\n\nIn the ensuing Battle of Normandy, 73,000 Allied forces were killed and 153,000 wounded. The battle -- and especially Allied bombings of French villages and cities -- killed around 20,000 French civilians.\n\nThe exact German casualties aren't known, but historians estimate between 4,000 and 9,000 men were killed, wounded or missing during the D-Day invasion alone. About 22,000 German soldiers are among the many buried around Normandy.\n\nSURVIVORS\n\nInevitably, the number of survivors attending major anniversary commemorations in France continues to dwindle. The youngest survivors are now in their late 90s. It's unclear how many D-Day veterans are still alive. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs says it doesn't track their numbers.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2024 BY CHANNEL 3000. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

On this 80th anniversary of that date, it's good to remember that it's \"one of the most famous single days in all of human history,\" writes historian Garrett Graff in his new book out this week, \"When the Sea Came Alive: An Oral History of D-Day.\"\"Though there have been other days over the course of the last century that have re-routed our collective historical trajectory, one could argue that none has had more of an impact than the day 160,000 troops stormed the beaches of Normandy,\" he writes.\n\nIn addition to feelings of gratitude, this 80th anniversary also evokes feelings of melancholy \"as we also mark the final passing of the Greatest Generation and the event slips fully from memory into history,\" Graff told USA TODAY.\n\n\"Of the million or so Allied participants in Operation Overlord, there are only a few thousand left alive today,\" he said. \"That means that the memories and first-person experiences we have of D-Day now are, effectively, all the memories we will ever have.\"\n\nHere's everything to know about D-Day and why it's still so important today.\n\nD-Day remembrance: World War II veterans return to Normandy on 80th anniversary of invasion.\n\nWhat is D-Day? When did it happen?\n\nIt would be more than four years into World War II - Germany's invasion of Poland in September 1939 set off the global conflict - when the major Allied forces including the U.S., Great Britain, France and Russia sought an invasion to weaken an already spread-thin German army, according to History.com.\n\nThe operation involving the largest sea and air armada ever assembled, Graff notes in his book, had been in the works for years.\n\nCrucial preparation began in December 1943 after President Franklin D. Roosevelt named General Dwight D. Eisenhower the Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force, notes the National World War II Museum.\n\nWhy is D-Day still important today?\n\nIt's simple, President Clinton said during events observing the 50th anniversary in France. \"They gave us our world,\" he said.\n\nThose troops who executed the invasion \"mean everything to us,\" said Sgt. Nathan Rogers, a 23-year-old Army Ranger at the time attending the ceremony. \"We wouldn't have existed if not for them. They definitely set the standard.\"\n\nIn collecting more than 5,000 personal stories of participants in D-Day in writing his new book, Graff said he learned crucial insights from the participants.\n\n\"Sure, we recognize now that D-Day was a Herculean heroic triumph, but listen to the voices of the Allied troops crossing the Channel on an armada of ships on the night of June 5th and there's little sense that what they're doing is historic or heroic,\" he said. \"They have no idea what lies ahead. They're concerned about whether they'll live to see the end of the day.\"\n\nWhat does D-Day stand for?\n\nThe answer is simpler than you might think. The D actually stands for \"Day,\" because it is a coded designation used for the day of any important invasion or military operation. So actions four days ahead of the actual operation, for instance, would be D-4, according to the U.S. Army.\n\nWhat was Operation Overlord?\n\nOperation Overlord, the code name for the D-Day invasion, involved transporting of more than 150,000 infantry troops across the English Channel into German-occupied France.\n\nMore than 1.5 million U.S. Army personnel had arrived in the U.K. by the end of May 1944 to participate or support the operation, according to the National World War II Museum. Overall, more than 2 million soldiers from the U.S. and 250,000 from Canada had arrived by June in preparation for, and to support, the invasion, according to History.com. Also delivered: 450,000 tons of ammunition as part of 7 million tons of supplies.\n\nOperation Overlord also contained a fake operation called Operation Fortitude to convince Hitler the Allies would attempt to land in Norway and Pas-de-Calais in France, according to the Imperial War Museum. The plot, concocted over months, included a fake army, led by General George Patton, and readying in England for the channel crossing, notes History.com.\n\nAnother fictitious force, the British Fourth Army, stationed in Scotland to threaten Norway where Hitler's U-boats were based, \"existed only on the airwaves,\" wrote historian Stephen Ambrose in \"D-Day: June 6, 1944: The Climactic Battle of World War II.\" British officers and German spies sent realistic radio messages to convince the Germans of the operation's authenticity and wooden fake bombers were deployed.\n\nThese ruses were successful enough that Hitler considered the Normandy invasion, as it was initiated, was actually a ploy to divert attention from Calais. \"They had placed the bulk of their panzer divisions north and east of the Seine River, where they were unavailable for counterattack in Normandy,\" wrote Ambrose, who also authored \"Band of Brothers.\"\n\nDid D-Day go according to plan?\n\nAfter years of planning for Operation Overlord, soldiers still faced incredible challenges upon landing on the beaches of Normandy as the intricate operation didn't go according to plan.\n\n\"Even with ... tactical and strategic advantages and more than a year of planning, D-Day's success was a close call, achieved only at an astounding cost of more than 10,000 Allied troops killed, wounded or missing,\" said now-retired Gen. Jeff Harrigian, who penned a D-Day anniversary observance editorial on USATODAY.com in 2021. At the time, Harrigian was the commander of the U.S. Air Forces Europe, U.S. Air Forces Africa and Allied Air Command at Ramstein Air Base in Germany.\n\nComplications began when weather caused cancellation of the original date Eisenhower had chosen, which was June 5, 1944.\n\nAnti-aircraft fire caused pilots to fly planes faster than expected and that meant paratroopers, dropped in the morning behind enemy lines to cut off supply routes, missed their landing targets, History.com details.\n\nDuring the Allied forces' landing, the U.S. landing force for Utah Beach was blown off course. The U.S. landing at Omaha Beach, where the fiercest fighting was seen, was affected by winds and tide, too.\n\nAs troops emerged from landing boats on the long, flat Omaha Beach, they were pinned down by enemy machine-gun fire from the cliffs above. \"If you (stayed) there you were going to die,\" Lieutenant Colonel Bill Friedman told the National World War II Museum. \"We just had to ... try to get to the bottom of the cliffs on which the Germans had mounted their defenses.\"\n\nU.S. and British destroyers arrived to attack enemy positions and support the troops including those attempting to commandeer the critical Pointe du Hoc, a German-held clifftop between Omaha and Utah beaches, according to the Naval History and Heritage Command site.\n\nBy the end of the day, about 156,000 Allied troops had successfully landed and taken Normandy's beaches.\n\nHow did D-Day succeed?\n\nOperation Overlord involved more than 11,000 planes and more than 5,000 ships and landing craft, along with 50,000 vehicles, according to the National World War II Museum.\n\n\"The plan had called for the air and naval bombardments, followed by tanks and dozers, to blast a path through the exits so that the infantry could march up the draws (ravines) and engage the enemy, but the plan had failed, utterly and completely failed,\" Ambrose wrote. \"As is almost always the case in war, it was up to the infantry. It became the infantry's job to open the exits so that the vehicles could drive up the draws and engage the enemy.\"\n\nJunior officers and noncommissioned officers \"saw at once that the intricate plan ... bore no relationship whatsoever to the tactical problem they faced,\" he wrote.\n\nTheir training \"had prepared them for this challenge. They sized up the situation, saw what had to be done, and did it,\" Ambrose wrote.\n\nSgt. John Ellery, of the 16th Infantry Regiment of the First Infantry Brigade, also known as \"The Big Red One,\" was in the first wave to hit Omaha Beach. He told survivors around him, \"we had to get off the beach and that I'd lead the way,\" and climbed up the bluff to use grenades to take out a machine gun position, Ambrose wrote in \"D-Day.\"\n\n\"We sometimes forget, I think, that you can manufacture weapons, and you can purchase ammunition,\" Ellery is quoted by Ambrose, \"but you can't buy valor and you can't pull heroes off an assembly line.\"\n\nNow many soldiers died on D-Day?\n\nThe invasion proved successful: Paris was liberated from the Germans on Aug. 25, 1944 and on May 7, 1945, less than a year after the D-Day invasion, Germany surrendered.\n\nSpecial online D-Day observations\n\nHere are some ways to observe the 80th anniversary of D-Day.\n\nFollow Mike Snider on X and Threads: @mikesnider & mikegsnider.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?

Of those, 73,000 were from the United States and 83,000 from Britain and Canada. Forces from several other countries were also involved, including French troops fighting with Gen. Charles de Gaulle.\n\nThe Allies faced around 50,000 German forces.\n\nMore than 2 million Allied soldiers, sailors, pilots, medics and other people from a dozen countries were involved in the overall Operation Overlord, the battle to wrest western France from Nazi control that started on D-Day.\n\nWhere and when\n\nThe sea landings started at 6:30 a.m., just after dawn, targeting five code-named beaches: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno, Sword. The operation also included actions inland, including overnight parachute landings on strategic German sites and U.S. Army Rangers scaling cliffs to take out German gun positions.\n\nToday's Top Headlines New hotel, restaurant could be coming to downtown Aiken Williston man dies, another man injured in wreck near Montmorenci Two Wendy's restaurants in Aiken under new ownership 'Ridge' recognized: Palmetto Golf Club's 7th hole named one of America's best Karen Jones becomes Burnettown's first female mayor Investigation underway after FCI Edgefield inmate dies Second person in 2021 murder and kidnapping of Jhaz Allison pleads guilty; sentenced to life in prison 21-year-old male identified as victim in deadly Barnwell County collision 'This is the real thing:' Local residents ponder impact, memories of D-Day on 80th anniversary Dunkin' on Whiskey Road celebrates grand reopening with ribbon-cutting\n\nAround 11,000 Allied aircraft, 7,000 ships and boats, and thousands of other vehicles were involved.\n\nMany deaths on all sides\n\nA total of 4,414 Allied troops were killed on D-Day itself, including 2,501 Americans. More than 5,000 were wounded.\n\nIn the ensuing Battle of Normandy, 73,000 Allied forces were killed and 153,000 wounded. The battle -- and especially Allied bombings of French villages and cities -- killed around 20,000 French civilians.\n\nThe exact German casualties aren't known, but historians estimate between 4,000 and 9,000 men were killed, wounded or missing during the D-Day invasion alone. About 22,000 German soldiers are among the many buried around Normandy.\n\nSurvivors\n\nInevitably, the number of survivors attending major anniversary commemorations in France continues to dwindle. The youngest survivors are now in their late 90s. It's unclear how many D-Day veterans are still alive. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs says it doesn't track their numbers.", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri":

At day's end, nearly 160,000 Allied troops landed in Normandy -- with thousands of casualties, including more than 4,400 Allied forces confirmed dead.\n\n\"The men who fought here became heroes,\" Biden said. \"Not because they were the strongest or the toughest or the fiercest, although they were, but because they were given an audactious mission, knowing -- every one of them knw -- that the probability of dying was real. But they did it anyway.\"\n\n\"They knew, beyond any doubt, there are things that are worth fighting and dying for,\" he continued. \"Freedom is worth it, democracy is worth it, America is worth it, the world is worth it -- then, now and always.\"\n\nWhile the war would not end for several months, Biden noted, \"here the tide turned in our favor. Here we proved the forces of liberty are the forces of conquest. Here we proved that the ideals of our democracy are stronger than any army or combination of armies in the entire world.\"\n\nHe also said that the men who fought on D-Day also proved \"the unbreakable unity of the Allies,\" celebrating that U.S. forces served alongside those \"wearing different flags on their arms,\" but fought \"with the same courage, for the same purpose.\"\n\n\"What the Allies did together 80 years ago far surpassed anything we could have done on our own,\" Biden said. \"It was a powerful illustration of how alliances, real alliances, make us stronger, a lesson I pray we Americans never forget.\"\n\nBiden hailed the rebuilding of Europe that followed the war and the establishment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which now stands at 32 member nations with the recent accession of Finland and Sweden.\n\nThe president tied the strength of the alliances forged after the war, as well as Nazi aggression in World War II, to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent global response.\n\n\"America is invested in our alliances and forged new ones, not simply out of altruism but out of our own self-interest as well,\" Biden said. \"America's unique ability to bring countries together is an undeniable source of our strength and our power. Isolation was not the answer 80 years ago and is not the answer today.\"\n\n\"We know the dark forces that these heroes fought against 80 years ago,\" he continued. \"They never fade, aggression and greed, the desire to dominate and control, to change borders by force, these are perennial, and the struggle between a dictatorship and freedom is unending. Here in Europe, we see one stark example: Ukraine has been invaded by a tyrant bent on domination. Ukrainians are fighting with extraordinary courage, suffering great losses, but never backing down.\"\n\nOf the alliances formed against Russia, Biden vowed: \"We will not walk away, because if we do, Ukraine will be subjugated, and it will not end there. Ukraine's neighbors will be threatened, all of Europe will be threatened, and make no mistake, the autocrats of the world are watching closely to see what happens in Ukraine, to see if we let this illegal aggression go unchecked.\n\n\"We cannot let that happen,\" he continued. \"To surrender to bullies, to bow down to dictators, it's simply unthinkable. Were we to do that, it means we'd be forgetting what happened here on these hallowed beaches.\"\n\n\"Make no mistake: We will not bow down,\" Biden vowed. \"We will not forget.\"\n\n\"If you want to know the price of freedom, come here to Normandy and look,\" the president said, adding: \"Remember: the price of unchecked tyranny is the blood of the young and the brave, and their generation, in their hour of trial, the Allied forces of D-Day did their duty. Now the question for us is in our trial, will we do ours?\"\n\nThe president and first lady Jill Biden arrived at the ceremony with French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, first lady Brigitte Macron.\n\nDelivering his remarks mostly in French, Macron said that \"we are linked by the grandeur of a people ready to die on a land that is not their own, but a cause that is theirs.\"\n\n\"You left everything, crossed the ocean and landed on the coast of France eight decades ago,\" Macron said of the soldiers who stormed the beaches of Normandy. \"You left everything and risked everything for our independence, for our freedom. That we will never forget.\"\n\n\"You came here because the free world needed each and every one of you, and you answered the call,'' he said in English. ''You came here to make France a free nation. You're back here today at home, if I may say.\"\n\nMacron concluded his remarks by the National Order of the Legion of Honour, France's highest honor, to American veterans. Biden warmly embraced the veterans after Macron presented them with the award.\n\nGuests at the event included foreign dignitaries, U.S. lawmakers, and even celebrities like Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, the director and star, respectively, of Academy Award-winning World War II film \"Saving Private Ryan.\"\n\nAt a separate ceremony at the British Normandy Memorial in Ver-sur-Mer, France, King Charles III of the United Kingdom said that the Allied forces faced the \"supreme test\" on D-Day, and that when the time came to face it, \"they did not flinch.\"\n\nThe king's use of \"supreme test\" echoed an iconic speech delivered by his grandfather, King George VI, who said in an iconic speech on the eve of D-Day: \"Once more a supreme test has to be faced. This time the challenge is not to fight to survive, but to fight to win the final victory for the good cause.\"\n\nThe current king honored the \"remarkable wartime generation,\" saying: \"It is with the most profound sense of gratitude that we remember them, and all those that served at that critical time.\"\n\n\"Our gratitude is unfailing, and our admiration eternal,\" he added.\n\nKing Charles III laid a wreath at the British Normandy Memorial in Ver-sur-Mer, and his son, William, Prince of Wales, joined Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal to lay a wreath on Normandy Beach during the Canadian commemoration ceremony.\n\nEarlier Thursday, the president and first lady met with D-Day veterans in a location overlooking Omaha Beach, where U.S. and other Allied forces landed 80 years ago as they began their march to defeat Nazi Germany.\n\nEach veteran was announced in turn, brought up by an active service member, according to the White House pool. Those in wheelchairs who could stand got up and stood for the president, who offered a salute and a handshake before posing for a photograph with the commander in chief.\n\nBiden told one veteran that it was \"a great honor\" to meet them. To another, the president called them \"the greatest generation ever, man.\" He offered another veteran a simple message: \"You saved the world.\"\n\nThe president handed each veteran a special commemorative challenge coin he had commissioned for the event. According to the White House, the coin bears the image of troops approaching the beaches of Normandy with B-17 aircraft flying overhead, the number \"9,388\" to honor the number of Americans who rest in Normandy, and a quote from the great poet John Milton: \"They also serve who only stand and wait.\" It also bears the Presidential Seal, adorned with a blue star and a gold star to reference the service of military families.\n\nOne veteran told Biden that his birthday was on Saturday, and the president encouraged everyone -- including gathered press -- to sing \"Happy Birthday.\"\n\n\"God love ya,\" the president said after the song concluded.", "source": {"uri": "baynews9.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spectrum News Bay News 9"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Over 4,000 Allied troops were killed during the invasion, according to records from the National D-Day Memorial Project.\n\nNow recognized as the greatest amphibious landing in history, D-Day paved the way for the Allied forces to liberate France and ultimately defeat Adolf Hitler's Germany.\n\nFor World War II veterans, though, such victories still can bring up complicated emotions.\n\n\"D-Day is a tremendous complex of responses,\" Indergand said. \"It'd be like, if you had a family, and there were eight in your family, and four of you were living and four of you were dead, you'd have tremendous relief and satisfaction that four of you were alive -- but you'd feel terrible about the other four.\n\n\"Almost all victory days are mixed,\" he added. \"They're wonderful and they're a deadly mixture, too -- all at the same time.\"\n\nIndergand spent a year as a member of the 80th Infantry and the 14th Armored Division in the European Theater of Operations, according to his Separation Qualification Record, attending intelligence briefings and preparing for battle in France.\n\n\"I was very impressed with how well the people in Normandy lived,\" Indergand said. \"I was impressed with their toughness and staying power.

It is an interesting moment to kind of pause and to reflect upon that,\" Allport said.\n\nPresident Biden, who arrived in France on Wednesday ahead of the commemorations, will seek to assuage fears of the future of the alliance when he attends D-Day celebrations in Normandy, part of a five-day trip to show U.S. commitment.\n\nBiden's remarks will focus on democracy and freedom and he will meet with American and Allied veterans who participated in the June 6, 1944 invasion.\n\n\"President Biden has made revitalizing our relationships a key priority, recognizing of course that we are stronger when we act together and that today's challenges require global solutions and global responses,\" White House national security communications adviser John Kirby said Tuesday.\n\nThere are more than 100 events for the veterans linked to D-Day, according to the Pentagon, with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin also set to speak as part of the celebrations.\n\nBeginning at dawn on June 6, 1944, more than 150,000 Allied troops landed in Nazi-occupied France, including 73,000 Americans.\n\nOff the coast of Normandy, 4,266 transport vessels and 722 warships protected by more than 10,000 airplanes approached the shore, an air and sea operation code named \"Overlord\" that was the largest in history.\n\nAround 4,500 Allies died, including more than 2,500 Americans, but the operation allowed the Allies to open a new front in western Europe against Nazi Germany, turning the tide of the war.\n\nThe win was seen as so monumental that for decades afterward, Normandy holds an annual festival of remembrance attended by American veterans who saw the horrors of D-Day first-hand.\n\n\"This anniversary is more than just a remembrance for the events at Normandy and recognition of the great human toll this hard-earned victory demanded,\" according to Charles Djou, the secretary of the American Battle Monuments Commission, which oversees cemeteries and memorials abroad.\n\n\"It is also a reminder for us -- today, in the present -- that we as a people, as a nation and a humanity, must always be vigilant in standing up for freedom and against tyranny.\"\n\nIt's not known exactly how many D-Day veterans are still alive, but about 150 Americans who took part in the Battle of Normandy, including 24 D-Day veterans, are expected to travel to France this year, NBC News reported.\n\nThe number of WWII veterans at this year's festivities is noteworthy as the figure is far fewer than those attended the 75th commemorations, let alone the earlier ones, with an ever-smaller chance any will make it to the 90th or 100th anniversaries.\n\nThe world is now reaching the point \"where it's kind of the twilight of lived experience, where from this point onwards, D-Day is going to be just a historical event that nobody who participates in commemorations had any personal memory of,\" Allport told The Hill.\n\nAt the center of the events is a ceremony attended by Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the United Kingdom's Prince William, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n\nDozens of lawmakers will also be in Europe for the 80th anniversary, including a Senate delegation of 18 to include Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.), and Joe Manchin (I-W.V.).\n\nThe group will join U.S. and French leaders and veterans at a ceremony at the American Cemetery of Colleville-sur-Mer before stopping at the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial. Members will later join heads of state representing Allied partners for an international ceremony at Omaha Beach in Saint-Laurent-sur-Mer.\n\nA bipartisan delegation of roughly 50 House lawmakers will also be in France Thursday, including House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.), House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), and Veterans' Affairs Committee ranking member Rep. Mark Takano (D-Calif.).\n\nHouse Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Michael McCaul (R-Texas) who will also be in Normandy as part of the bipartisan delegation, said in a statement he was \"honored to have the opportunity to shake hands with the few remaining heroes, who -- like my father -- risked everything for our nation and the values for which it stands.\"\n\nThe UK and Canada, meanwhile, are expected to hold their own ceremonies and events with veterans to commemorate those from their own countries who participated in D-Day - about 60,000 British and 15,000 Canadians, respectively.\n\nOne country not invited this year, however, is Russia.\n\nThe lack of Moscow's representation is noteworthy given the Soviet Union's participation in WWII was intrinsic to the Nazi's defeat.\n\nThe Red Army sacrificed millions of soldiers after Hitler invaded the Soviet Union, pounding Nazi advances and single-handedly securing the Eastern Front.\n\nIn earlier commemorations of D-Day, representatives either from the Soviet Union, or after 1991 from Russia, were usually in attendance.\n\nBut due to the Kremlin's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 -- the largest land war Europe has seen since WWII -- Moscow has been a pariah to its European neighbors.\n\n\"The Russians are persona non grata now, which is kind of ironic, [given] the success of the cooperation between the Western States and the Soviet Union which helped to make D-Day possible,\" Allport said.\n\n\"Of course, that's something that neither the British or the Americans or the Canadians, or, for that matter, the Russians particularly want to emphasize right now when there's so much dividing them.\"", "source": {"uri": "thehill.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Hill"}, "authors": [{"uri":

On this 80th anniversary of that date, it's good to remember that it's \"one of the most famous single days in all of human history,\" writes historian Garrett Graff in his new book out this week, \"When the Sea Came Alive: An Oral History of D-Day.\"\"Though there have been other days over the course of the last century that have re-routed our collective historical trajectory, one could argue that none has had more of an impact than the day 160,000 troops stormed the beaches of Normandy,\" he writes.\n\nIn addition to feelings of gratitude, this 80th anniversary also evokes feelings of melancholy \"as we also mark the final passing of the Greatest Generation and the event slips fully from memory into history,\" Graff told USA TODAY.\n\n\"Of the million or so Allied participants in Operation Overlord, there are only a few thousand left alive today,\" he said. \"That means that the memories and first-person experiences we have of D-Day now are, effectively, all the memories we will ever have.\"\n\nHere's everything to know about D-Day and why it's still so important today.\n\nD-Day remembrance: World War II veterans return to Normandy on 80th anniversary of invasion.\n\nIt would be more than four years into World War II - Germany's invasion of Poland in September 1939 set off the global conflict - when the major Allied forces including the U.S., Great Britain, France and Russia sought an invasion to weaken an already spread-thin German army, according to History.com.\n\nThe operation involving the largest sea and air armada ever assembled, Graff notes in his book, had been in the works for years.\n\nCrucial preparation began in December 1943 after President Franklin D. Roosevelt named General Dwight D. Eisenhower the Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force, notes the National World War II Museum.\n\nIt's simple, President Clinton said during events observing the 50th anniversary in France. \"They gave us our world,\" he said.\n\nThose troops who executed the invasion \"mean everything to us,\" said Sgt. Nathan Rogers, a 23-year-old Army Ranger at the time attending the ceremony. \"We wouldn't have existed if not for them. They definitely set the standard.\"\n\nIn collecting more than 5,000 personal stories of participants in D-Day in writing his new book, Graff said he learned crucial insights from the participants.\n\n\"Sure, we recognize now that D-Day was a Herculean heroic triumph, but listen to the voices of the Allied troops crossing the Channel on an armada of ships on the night of June 5th and there's little sense that what they're doing is historic or heroic,\" he said. \"They have no idea what lies ahead. They're concerned about whether they'll live to see the end of the day.\"\n\nThe answer is simpler than you might think. The D actually stands for \"Day,\" because it is a coded designation used for the day of any important invasion or military operation. So actions four days ahead of the actual operation, for instance, would be D-4, according to the U.S. Army.\n\nOperation Overlord, the code name for the D-Day invasion, involved transporting of more than 150,000 infantry troops across the English Channel into German-occupied France.\n\nMore than 1.5 million U.S. Army personnel had arrived in the U.K. by the end of May 1944 to participate or support the operation, according to the National World War II Museum. Overall, more than 2 million soldiers from the U.S. and 250,000 from Canada had arrived by June in preparation for, and to support, the invasion, according to History.com. Also delivered: 450,000 tons of ammunition as part of 7 million tons of supplies.\n\nOperation Overlord also contained a fake operation called Operation Fortitude to convince Hitler the Allies would attempt to land in Norway and Pas-de-Calais in France, according to the Imperial War Museum. The plot, concocted over months, included a fake army, led by General George Patton, and readying in England for the channel crossing, notes History.com.\n\nAnother fictitious force, the British Fourth Army, stationed in Scotland to threaten Norway where Hitler's U-boats were based, \"existed only on the airwaves,\" wrote historian Stephen Ambrose in \"D-Day: June 6, 1944: The Climactic Battle of World War II.\" British officers and German spies sent realistic radio messages to convince the Germans of the operation's authenticity and wooden fake bombers were deployed.\n\nThese ruses were successful enough that Hitler considered the Normandy invasion, as it was initiated, was actually a ploy to divert attention from Calais. \"They had placed the bulk of their panzer divisions north and east of the Seine River, where they were unavailable for counterattack in Normandy,\" wrote Ambrose, who also authored \"Band of Brothers.\"\n\nAfter years of planning for Operation Overlord, soldiers still faced incredible challenges upon landing on the beaches of Normandy as the intricate operation didn't go according to plan.\n\n\"Even with ... tactical and strategic advantages and more than a year of planning, D-Day's success was a close call, achieved only at an astounding cost of more than 10,000 Allied troops killed, wounded or missing,\" said now-retired Gen. Jeff Harrigian, who penned a D-Day anniversary observance editorial on USATODAY.com in 2021. At the time, Harrigian was the commander of the U.S. Air Forces Europe, U.S. Air Forces Africa and Allied Air Command at Ramstein Air Base in Germany.\n\nComplications began when weather caused cancellation of the original date Eisenhower had chosen, which was June 5, 1944.\n\nAnti-aircraft fire caused pilots to fly planes faster than expected and that meant paratroopers, dropped in the morning behind enemy lines to cut off supply routes, missed their landing targets, History.com details.\n\nDuring the Allied forces' landing, the U.S. landing force for Utah Beach was blown off course. The U.S. landing at Omaha Beach, where the fiercest fighting was seen, was affected by winds and tide, too.\n\nAs troops emerged from landing boats on the long, flat Omaha Beach, they were pinned down by enemy machine-gun fire from the cliffs above. \"If you (stayed) there you were going to die,\" Lieutenant Colonel Bill Friedman told the National World War II Museum. \"We just had to ... try to get to the bottom of the cliffs on which the Germans had mounted their defenses.\"\n\nU.S. and British destroyers arrived to attack enemy positions and support the troops including those attempting to commandeer the critical Pointe du Hoc, a German-held clifftop between Omaha and Utah beaches, according to the Naval History and Heritage Command site.\n\nBy the end of the day, about 156,000 Allied troops had successfully landed and taken Normandy's beaches.\n\nOperation Overlord involved more than 11,000 planes and more than 5,000 ships and landing craft, along with 50,000 vehicles, according to the National World War II Museum.\n\n\"The plan had called for the air and naval bombardments, followed by tanks and dozers, to blast a path through the exits so that the infantry could march up the draws (ravines) and engage the enemy, but the plan had failed, utterly and completely failed,\" Ambrose wrote. \"As is almost always the case in war, it was up to the infantry. It became the infantry's job to open the exits so that the vehicles could drive up the draws and engage the enemy.\"\n\nJunior officers and noncommissioned officers \"saw at once that the intricate plan ... bore no relationship whatsoever to the tactical problem they faced,\" he wrote.\n\nTheir training \"had prepared them for this challenge. They sized up the situation, saw what had to be done, and did it,\" Ambrose wrote.\n\nSgt. John Ellery, of the 16th Infantry Regiment of the First Infantry Brigade, also known as \"The Big Red One,\" was in the first wave to hit Omaha Beach. He told survivors around him, \"we had to get off the beach and that I'd lead the way,\" and climbed up the bluff to use grenades to take out a machine gun position, Ambrose wrote in \"D-Day.\"\n\n\"We sometimes forget, I think, that you can manufacture weapons, and you can purchase ammunition,\" Ellery is quoted by Ambrose, \"but you can't buy valor and you can't pull heroes off an assembly line.\"\n\nThe invasion proved successful: Paris was liberated from the Germans on Aug. 25, 1944 and on May 7, 1945, less than a year after the D-Day invasion, Germany surrendered.\n\nHere are some ways to observe the 80th anniversary of D-Day.\n\nFollow Mike Snider on X and Threads: @mikesnider & mikegsnider.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?

They are in our hearts today and for all time.\"\n\nIn a separate post, Trump shared a photograph of him meeting with veterans at Normandy in 2019, with the caption: \"Today, we remember those who fell -- and we honor all who fought right here in Normandy. They won back this ground for civilization.\"\n\nBiden commemorated the anniversary in a post to X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter.\n\n\"The brave service members who fought on D-Day represent the Greatest Generation in our history.

Polls suggest the race will be close, and the two are expected to face off in the first presidential debate on CNN on June 27.\n\nD-Day was the largest amphibious military operation in history,

Sign up here.\n\nBritain's King Charles III has embarked on his first overseas trip since being diagnosed with cancer, traveling across the English Channel for commemorations marking the 80th anniversary of the 1944 D-Day Landings in Normandy.\n\nNearly 160,000 Allied troops landed on five stretches of the German-occupied Normandy coastline on June 6, 1944. Operation Overlord - as D-Day was codenamed - remains, to this day, the largest amphibious invasion in history, and was a crucial turning point in defeating the Nazis in World War II.\n\nOmaha Beach was the deadliest of the landing sites as German forces were entrenched in fortified cliff positions above allowing them to fire on the first waves of US soldiers as they reached the shore.\n\nNearly 10,000 Allied troops were killed or wounded on D-Day. Exact figures of German casualties on the day are not known, however it has been estimated to be between 4,000 and 9,000 service personnel.\n\nOn Thursday morning, King Charles and Queen Camilla attended the UK Ministry of Defence and the Royal British Legion's commemorative event at the British Normandy Memorial at Ver-sur-Mer. Charles is patron of both the Royal British Legion and Normandy Memorial Trust.\n\nKing Charles and Queen Camilla were joined by French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte Macron at the British Normandy Memorial.\n\nChris Jackson/Getty Images\n\nThe King urged allies to \"recall lessons that come to us again and again,\" while addressing D-Day veterans.\n\n\"How fortunate we were and the entire free world that a generation of men and women in the United Kingdom and other allied nations did not flinch when the moment came to face that test,\" Charles said, adding that his grandfather, King George VI, described the events of D-Day as \"the supreme test.\"\n\nCharles reflected on the qualities of the armed forces involved, saying they \"carried out their duty with a humbling sense of resolve and determination.\"\n\nHe also used the speech to reflect on the past through the lens of the present, saying: \"We recall the lesson that comes to us again and again across the decades. Three nations must stand together to oppose tyranny.\"\n\nAmerican troops storm the beaches of Normandy, France, on June 6, 1944.\n\nRobert F. Sargent/Getty Images\n\nThe British Army's 50th Infantry Division lands on beaches in Normandy. Allied troops landed on five stretches of the Normandy coastline that were code-named Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword.\n\nCourtesy Imperial War Museum\n\nUS servicemen in New York read news about the D-Day invasion. The operation was led by Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, who would later become president of the United States.\n\nEd Jackson/NY Daily News Archive/Getty Images\n\nCommandos with the British Royal Navy advance on the beach. Planning for D-Day began more than a year in advance, and the Allies carried out substantial military deception to confuse the Germans as to when and where the invasion would take place.\n\nCourtesy Imperial War Museum\n\nUS Coast Guard boats are seen off Omaha Beach on the morning of D-Day. Troops left the USS Samuel Chase early that day to head to Normandy. \"When the order 'Lower Away' came, everything was quiet,\" Sargent recalled. \"Just the squeaking of the davits and the whispered comments of the men were heard. The soldiers were silent.\"\n\nUniversal History Archive/Universal Images Group/Getty Images\n\nMedics start an IV as they assist a wounded soldier on shore.

By midnight, the troops had secured their beachheads and moved further inland.\n\nCorbis/Getty Images\n\nBritish troops reach the shore in the early morning. According to the Royal British Legion, the phrase D-Day was used fairly often before the Normandy landings. After them, however, the two became synonymous, and now D-Day is commonly understood to refer to the beginning of Operation Overlord.\n\nImago/Piemags/Reuters\n\nBritish troops use radios during the move inland.\n\nImago/Piemags/Reuters\n\nFrench soldiers are transported on the Normandy beaches. Most troops on D-Day were American, British and Canadian, according to the Imperial War Museums, but troops also came from Australia, Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Greece, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) and Poland.\n\nAFP/Getty Images\n\nA B-26 from the US Air Force flies over one of the beaches during the invasion.\n\nJeffrey Markowitz/Sygma/Getty Images\n\nThese US soldiers reached Omaha Beach aboard a life raft.\n\nGalerie Bilderwelt/Getty Images\n\nBritish tanks are seen on an American landing barge crossing the English Channel.\n\nUS Coast Guard/Keystone/Hulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nUS troops huddle behind the protective front of their landing craft as it nears a beachhead in France. Smoke in the background is naval gunfire giving cover to troops on land. Germans rained mortars and artillery down on Allied troops, killing many before they could even get out of their boats. Fighting was especially fierce at Omaha Beach, where Nazi fighters nearly wiped out the first wave of invading forces and left the survivors struggling for cover.\n\nU.S. Army\n\nInjured American soldiers wait to be moved to a field hospital after storming Omaha Beach.\n\nTime Life Pictures/National Archives/Getty Images\n\nUS troops wait to disembark a landing craft on D-Day.

Instead, Prince William will represent Britain's royal family at the international ceremony at Omaha Beach.\n\nThe optics of seeing the Prince of Wales instead of his father will not be lost on those within the royal household, as well as royal-watchers. Nonetheless, CNN understands that it wasn't a deliberate orchestration.\n\nSeeing the future monarch in the company of other heads of state is a powerful visual and speaks to the longer transition which will prepare the public for King William V's reign.\n\nKing Charles also only recently returned to public engagements after getting the green light from his doctors who were \"encouraged\" by his progress.\n\nHe is continuing to receive treatment and each engagement the 75-year-old sovereign carries out is being reviewed and adapted where necessary by his medical team to ensure his continued recovery.\n\nThat simple reason of following medical advice appears to be behind the King's absence at the international commemoration on Thursday afternoon. A royal source told CNN that it was considered a step too far at this stage but that the monarch was delighted the Prince of Wales was representing the nation.\n\nWilliam, 42, has been an ever-present fixture as the royal family marked the D-Day anniversary in recent days. Earlier Thursday, the heir to the British throne paid tribute at the Canadian commemorative ceremony at the Juno Beach Centre in Courseulles-Sur-Mer, where he joined veterans as well as current serving personnel before making a speech and laying a wreath.\n\nPrince William meets Richard Rohmer, 100, one of the most decorated Canadian veterans, accompanied by the Prime Minister of France Gabriel Attal and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau during the Canadian government ceremony at Juno Beach on Thursday.\n\nJordan Pettitt/Getty Images\n\nA day earlier, William had joined Charles and Camilla at the UK's national commemorative event in Portsmouth. The city on England's south coast was one of the places Allied troops sailed from before the Normandy landings.\n\nWilliam paid tribute to veterans who \"came from across our nation and from all walks of life to join in the fight against tyranny. Many of those that took up arms had never seen combat before, some were still only in their teens.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in his own moving speech, King Charles told crowds that \"the stories of courage, resilience and solidarity\" must not be forgotten and that they are a reminder \"of what we owe to that great wartime generation.\"\n\nCharles added: \"It is our duty to ensure that we, and future generations, do not forget their service and their sacrifice.\"\n\nCNN's Jessie Gretener contributed to this story.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors":

'Let us be worthy of their sacrifice'", "body": "COLLEVILLE-SUR-MER, France - They came by the thousands, back to the hilltop overlooking the sea.\n\nOn a sunny afternoon in late spring, World War II veterans in the winter of life, many of them in wheelchairs or supported by canes, returned alongside President Joe Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron and other dignitaries to remember a bloody day that changed the world.\n\nFrom the hallowed ground where many of their fallen comrades rest beneath French soil, they honored the dead and commemorated the events of June 6, 1944, which the world now knows as D-Day.\n\n\"If you want to know the price of freedom, come here to Normandy,\" said Biden, who, at 81, was just a toddler on the day of the D-Day landings.\n\nEighty years ago, some 160,000 troops from the United States, Canada, Great Britain and other allies descended upon these shores in Normandy by air, land and seat to liberate Nazi-occupied France.\n\nThe fighting was brutal and the casualties enormous - more than 4,400 Allied troops were killed - but the unprecedented show of unified military power would mark the beginning of the end of Nazi Germany's grip on Europe.\n\n\"It is difficult to underestimate or undersell the significance of D-Day and what happened on D-Day,\" said Charles Djou, secretary of the American Battle Monuments Commission, which manages and operates 24 American military cemeteries abroad. \"Everything in this world turned on that day. And the fact that we succeeded on that day has made America and the world, the West, what it is.\"\n\nThe heroes of D-Day \"kept freedom alive,\" Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said.\n\n\"You saved the world. We must only defend it,\" he said. \"Gentlemen, we salute you.\"\n\nSome of the veterans who came back to France on Thursday for ceremonies marking the 80 anniversary of D-Day had been among the first to arrive and fight. A crowd estimated at 10,000 to 12,000 attended the ceremony at the Normandy American Cemetery, including 17 four-star officers, more than 150 members of Congress and dozens of members of the French Parliament. Other ceremonies also were scheduled and were expected to draw 25 heads of state.\n\nAn ocean breeze floated across the American cemetery, fluttering the small American and French flags on each of the graves of nearly 9,400 Americans killed in the war. Sunlight lit the white marble crosses and stars of David that mark each burial site.\n\nJust off the shore, Navy battleships stood guard in the English Channel. Men in military fatigues looked out over the sea from the grassy hillside where allied soldiers advanced and encountered German machine-gun fire.\n\nOne by one, Biden and first lady Jill Biden met with veterans ahead of the ceremony from a glass-backed gazebo overlooking Omaha Beach, where many of the soldiers came ashore eight decades ago. Biden saluted, took photos with each and handed them a coin that he said had been especially minted for the event.\n\nIn his remarks, Biden drew parallels between the Allied troops who fought to free Europe during World War II and the alliance of nations that has banded together to defend Ukraine in its war with Russia.\n\nThose who fought in World War II \"did their duty,\" he said, but \"that does not absolve us of what we have to do.\"\n\n\"In memory of those who fought here, died here, literally saved the world here, let us be worthy of their sacrifice,\" Biden said. \"Let us be the generation that, when history is written about our time ... it will be said, when the moment came, we met the moment.\"\n\nMore: As Joe Biden marks D-Day anniversary, he faces a world again embroiled in conflict\n\nBeyond the powerful symbolism of Thursday's events was the sobering reality that for many of the veterans, the ceremony would be their last. The youngest World War II veterans are in their mid-90s, and many of them are well over 100.\n\nOf the 16.4 million Americans who served in the war, just 119,000 - less than 1% of them - are still alive, according to the National World War II Museum in New Orleans. They are dying at a rate of 131 per day.\n\nSome veterans who attended the ceremony said they did so out of a sense of obligation. Others said they came because they again wanted to see where so many of their friends and brothers had died to preserve freedom.\n\n\"I'm not a very emotional guy,\" said John Gleeson, an Army Air Corps veteran from Honolulu, Hawaii, but \"I do things that I feel needs to be done.\"\n\nGleeson, who is 100, said fighting to defending American culture during the war had meant a lot to him. \"It still does,\" he said, which is one of the reasons he flew more than 7,000 miles to the events.\n\nMore: On D-Day, they changed the world. 80 years later, an incredible journey takes them back.\n\nLes Schrenk, a 100-year-old veteran from Bloomington, Minnesota, said D-Day is \"a part of my story. It's a story I've lived all these years.\"\n\nSchrenk, who joined the Amy Air Corps the day after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, was a gunner aboard a B-17 that was hit by German anticraft fire over the English Channel. The crippled plane made it to land over Denmark, but Schrenk and other crew members were forced to parachute to safety. Waiting for them on the ground were German soldiers, who captured him and took him as a prisoner of war.\n\nFor years, Schrenk wondered about the German pilot whose gunfire had shot and disabled his B-17. Who was he? Why didn't he finish off the Americans while they were still over water?\n\nWith the help of a friend, Schrenk tracked down the pilot, Hans Hermann Muller, in 2012. The two wartime enemies met in Heidelberg and formed the unlikeliest of friendship. Schrenk finally got an answer to the question that had haunted him for years.\n\n\"He said, 'Yes, I could have shot you down, but why should I,'\" Schrenk recalled\n\nIf he had shot the plane down over the water, Muller explained, the Americans would have had no chance of survival. Every one of them would have died.\n\n\"He spared my life,\" Schrenk said.\n\nMichael Collins covers the White House.

While it is certainly a time to celebrate the exploits of the Greatest Generation, given the passage of time, it will almost certainly be the last significant anniversary to see those who took were there still around to take part.\n\nAs CNN reported, Jack Foy - who is also a surviving of the Battle of the Bulge - joins the remaining veterans who made a pilgrimage back to Normandy this year. At 99 years old, Foy was described as \"the youngster among his group of friends.\"\n\nMajor commemorations have been held every five years, and organizers along with French government officials have acknowledged that 2024 will likely be the last to involve living veterans.\n\n\"We are perfectly aware that for these centenarians, this is maybe the last chance to return to the beaches where they landed, where they fought and where their brothers-in-arms fell,\" Gen. Michel Delion, the CEO of the French government agency in charge of the French commemoration efforts, Mission Liberation, told CNN.\n\nAround one-third of the adult male population served in the military during the Second World War, but according to the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs, less than one percent is still alive.\n\nGetting the Vets to France\n\nAs young men, many barely out of high school, those who would storm the beaches or parachute into France on June 6, 1944, first took a boat ride to England, where they engaged in months of training. This week, the trip was a bit more comfortable for more than five dozen World War II veterans.\n\nSixty-six of them, each accompanied by a family member or companion, gathered in Texas after being chosen to make an \"honor flight\" aboard a chartered 747 provided by American Airlines. At Dallas Forth Worth International Airport they were joined by six Medal of Honor winners from wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Vietnam as well as by two \"Rosie the Riveters\" - the women who contributed to the war effort in factories and shipyards.\n\nIn total, 280 individuals were in the entourage back to Normandy.\n\nThe average age of the 66 World War II veterans was reported to be just shy of 101, with the oldest being 107 while the youngest was 95. Those men and women arriving on the honor flight will join hundreds of others who have headed back to Normandy to mark the milestone anniversary.\n\nMass Parachute Event and a Motorcycle Parade\n\nEach spring, Normandy transforms from a relatively quiet coastal region on the English Channel in Northern France into the literal ground zero for the largest festival marking the liberation of Europe during the Second World. The region's cities and villages host parades and other celebrations, while the cemeteries hold more somber gatherings that honor those who gave their lives in the invasion and in the weeks that followed. The celebrations kicked off on Saturday, June 1, with more than 20 huge firework displays that lit up the sky simultaneously over the five landing beaches.\n\nDozens of World War II-themed events have been underway since, and that included small historic reenactments, memorials, and even a mass parachute drop. On Sunday, dozens dropped from three World War II C-47 transport aircraft - the same planes that delivered members of the British and U.S. Airborne divisions to Normandy 80 years ago.\n\nTwo of the aircraft - christened \"That's All, Brother\" and \"Placid Lassie,\" - were actual \"D-Day veterans.\" Those two planes were among the thousands of C-47s and other aircraft that took to the skies on June 6, 1944. The C-47s took off from Duxford, England, and made the same roughly 90-minute flight to Carentan, France.\n\nThis time it was a bit different, however.\n\nFor one the flight took place during the day instead of at night, and more importantly, there was no anti-aircraft fire that greeted the aircraft. Sunday's jumpers included an international civilian team of parachutists, many former soldiers. Among them was one woman, 61-year-old Dawna Bennett.\n\nOn the ground on Tuesday, approximately 150 U.S. Army vintage Harley Davidson motorcycles took part in a road parade not far from the D-Day beaches. Many of the participants donned World War II-style uniforms, helmets, and other equipment.\n\nWhile June 6, 2024, featured a gathering of Western leaders, including U.S. President Joe Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron, and the UK's King Charles, the events at Normandy began in March and will continue through October.\n\n\"Each anniversary year is the occasion to pay tribute to the fallen and to the veterans who will come to attend the commemorative events and celebrations organized in Normandy,\" the Normandy Tourism website noted. \"Lest we forget.\"\n\nTrue words indeed.", "source":

As France marks the 80th anniversary of D-Day, an American veteran reflects on the differing ways the US and France remember the war. Meanwhile, historians recall the large number of civilians killed during the Allied invasion and explain why US soldiers were not always welcomed as heroes.\n\nAs French President Emmanuel Macron welcomes world leaders, the real stars of the commemorations are the surviving veterans themselves - the men who landed on the Normandy beaches on 6 June 1944 and started liberating France from Nazi occupation. The youngest of the remaining D-Day veterans are now in their late 90s. Alan Shapiro, 99, was too young to take part in the landings, but joined the European Allied forces in the autumn of 1944 and flew transport carriers in the US air corps. He's struck by the love and recognition he's received in France, where war was a lived experience rather than a distant newsreel. He came to France through the association Retour des veterans en Normandie (Veterans Back to Normandy), based in the village of Cr\u00e9ances. Its founder, Valerie Gautier, talks about the lasting need to show gratitude for D-Day and WWII veterans. (Listen @4'20)\n\nThe story of D-Day and its aftermath is told differently depending on which side of the Atlantic you're on. American historian Mary Louise Roberts discusses how France has been erased from the US perspective on the landings. Meanwhile French historian Emmanuel Thi\u00e9bot, who directs a museum in Normandy dedicated to civilians during WWII, explains why Allied soldiers didn't always get a hero's welcome in towns that had been bombed in preparation for the invasion. And local survivor Henri, whose fianc\u00e9e and uncle were killed by Allied bombs, recalls the mixed feelings he had about the troops sent to liberate France.

This massive operation involved 12,000 aircraft, 7,000 ships, 13,000 paratroopers, and 150,000 troops from various countries, making it the largest amphibious invasion to date. The success of D-Day paved the way for the liberation of France and marked a turning point in World War II.\n\nAs we commemorate the 80th anniversary of D-Day, it is essential to remember the sacrifices made by the Allied troops. Over 4,000 soldiers lost their lives on the day of the invasion, with thousands more perishing in the ensuing battles. To honor their bravery and the historic significance of D-Day, we have curated 25 incredible and rarely-seen photographs from that fateful day.\n\n**British Troops Prepare for the Historic Invasion**\n\nIn the late hours of June 5, 1944, four 'stick' commanders from the 22nd Independent Parachute Company of the British 6th Airborne Division synchronized their watches before the daring parachute drop into Normandy. These officers, including Lieutenants Bobby de la Tour and Don Wells, were among the first Allied troops to set foot in France, marking the beginning of the liberation efforts.\n\n**American Soldiers Embark on a Mission**\n\nAmerican assault troops, led by Major Edward J. Waters, received a benediction from a Catholic Army Chaplain before hitting the beaches of France. Their determination and resolve were evident as they knelt on the British pier, ready to face the enemy and secure a foothold in Hitler's fortress.\n\n**Canadian Troops Land on Normandy Shores**\n\nCourageous Canadian soldiers, part of the Allied forces, landed on Courseulles beach in Normandy, prepared to fight for the freedom of Europe. Their unwavering commitment to the mission was reflected in their readiness to engage the enemy as soon as they touched the shore.\n\n**Remembering the Fallen**\n\nAs we reflect on the events of D-Day, it is crucial to pay tribute to the brave soldiers who made the ultimate sacrifice for freedom. Wooden crosses, soldiers' helmets, and flowers mark the graves of those who perished in battle, serving as a poignant reminder of the cost of war.\n\nAs we commemorate the 80th anniversary of D-Day, let us honor the memory of those who fought and died for a better future.

That scene depicted the start of the D-Day invasion of June 6, 1944, during World War II. D-Day began the liberation of Europe from Nazi German occupation.\n\nIt was a massive land, sea and air operation. Soldiers from the United States and the Allies bravely stormed the beaches of Normandy, France, 80 years ago on D-Day. They faced heavy fire from the German forces. Thousands of U.S. and Allied soldiers were killed or wounded. They sacrificed themselves in the battle to defeat Nazi Germany and save the world from tyranny. D-Day led to the end of World War II. Four years later, if you looked out into the waters off France you would still see armadas of ships from the United States. But these ships carried food and other aid needed to rebuild the country.\n\n\"American ships are still coming to France and will continue to come for a long time. But now these vessels do not bear engines of death and destruction. They bear materials for the reconstruction so necessary to bring peace and prosperity back to Europe\" said U.S. Ambassador Jefferson Caffery at a D-Day event in France in 1948.\n\nFor the D-Day invasion to succeed, it required the dedication and bravery of U.S. and Allied soldiers. The peace efforts that followed the war likewise needed the same spirit. For saving France and Europe from the enemies of hunger and poverty was also part of the liberation -- because war always creates hunger and poverty.\n\nIn fact, the forces to fight hunger and poverty embarked on D-Day via civil affairs units. These allied troops were to provide humanitarian aid in the liberated areas of France and beyond. This involved identifying sources of food and other supplies, and getting them where they needed to be. Shortages had to be anticipated. One report read \"it soon became clear that in the rural areas as well as in Bayeux the main difficulty was going to be shortage of wheat and flour which would make itself felt in three weeks' time.\"\n\nOne civil affairs unit set up a feeding center for refugees at a school in Amblie, France. A medical treatment facility was also established to treat refugees. A child was born in one of the camps set up by civil affairs.\n\nThe fight against hunger and poverty went on quietly behind the scenes of the U.S. and Allied invasion. And it continued for many years through the Marshall Plan, which rebuilt Europe after World War II.\n\nAs we reflect on the 80th anniversary of D-Day, let's also remember the ultimate goal of the invasion: to build a world at peace. Many lost their lives on D-Day trying to save the world. As we honor the courage of the soldiers who gave so much on D-Day, let's also continue their quest for world peace. Let's show the same courage to build peace that the soldiers of D-Day had in the invasion and winning World War II. Just as D-Day forces sought to end a war and provide humanitarian aid to the needy, we should seek to end conflicts and hunger around the globe.\n\nReflecting on D-Day, Gen. Omar Bradley in 1947 wrote in The New York Times: \"Today it seems strange that in an operation as risky as a cross-channel invasion, we could keep that confidence in success -- while in an undertaking as full of promise as peace should be, we surrender so easily to our doubts and our fears.\"\n\nD-Day showed that America, with its allies, can overcome any challenge. Courage, unity, dedication and humanitarianism made D-Day and the liberation of Europe a reality. Let's channel that same spirit and bravely pursue the world of peace that soldiers on D-Day sacrificed everything to build.", "source": {"uri": "berkshireeagle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Berkshire Eagle"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy_landings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Normandy landings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Longest_Day_(book)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Longest Day (book)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_Caffery", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jefferson Caffery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_of_World_War_II_in_Europe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "End of World War II in Europe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanitarian_aid", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Humanitarian aid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Wheat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Refugee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayeux", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bayeux"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Bayeux"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Bradley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Omar Bradley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_peace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World peace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Plan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marshall Plan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Channel", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "English Channel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Peace", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/International_Aid_and_Development", "label": "dmoz/Society/Philanthropy/International Aid and Development", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/berkshireeagle.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/94/3949b44c-21e2-11ef-8061-c30a12d5728d/665e1e6163e86.image.jpg?crop=1647%2C865%2C0%2C197&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628959", "eventUri": "eng-9628959", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 128, "relevance": 1}

At the same time, their numbers have dwindled with age and illness.\n\n\"As time passes quickly for our WWII generation, it is our duty and honor to provide this opportunity of closure and camaraderie for those who gave so much,\" Donnie Edwards, president of the non-profit Best Defense Foundation, said in a statement.\n\n\"The idea came that maybe flying directly to Normandy would be just incredible,\" Virginie Durr, Delta's enterprise sales manager, told PEOPLE ahead of the veterans' visit. \"To be honest, I thought it was such a crazy idea -- it would never happen. But it came to the ears of people like our CEO [Ted Bastian] and he said, yeah, that's the right thing to do.\"\n\n\"During COVID, we were losing World War II veterans quite rapidly,\" Durr adds. \"Basically the people of Delta rallied around what it's about: serving our veterans.\"\n\nRelated: Photographer Captures Moving Portraits of Last WWII Veterans and Learns Their Survival Stories\n\nThe successful invasion of Normandy on June 6, 1944, marked a decisive shift in the war. On that day, over 4,400 Allied troops died, with 2,500 of them Americans.\n\nOn Tuesday, June 4, the returning veterans paid tribute to their fallen comrades at Normandy American Cemetery, according to Delta. They also visited the Overlord Museum for a tank demonstration and attended a gala dinner hosted by Normandy's president, Herv\u00e9 Morin.\n\nFor Durr, the program is personal as she is originally from Normandy.\n\n\"My grandparents were liberated by people like [the American veterans],\" she says. \"So for me, it's been a lifetime journey of honoring World War II veterans every year. Now I'm in America and I grew up with this passion and love for Americans who came to liberate us.\"\n\nRelated: WWII Vet Who Escaped Nazis Finally Gets Purple Heart, Prisoner of War Medal Nearly 80 Years Later\n\nHarold Terens, 100, now lives in Florida and was one of the veterans who was recently flown to France courtesy of Delta.\n\nHe still remembers the Allied invasion of Normandy. As a member of the Army Air Forces, he communicated with the pilots who went into battle that day.

It was one of the saddest days in my first 20 years of life.\"\n\n\"Most of the pilots were my friends,\" he says. \"The average age was 26. We were all kids.\"\n\n\"Normandy was just a horror to look at,\" he goes on to add. \"I still have nightmares about the war.\"\n\nRelated: Veterans Return to Normandy on 78th Anniversary of D-Day and Remember Life-Changing Moments of WWII\n\nDuring their visit to France for this year's D-Day commemoration, the veterans will be honored with parades and ceremonies before they return to the U.S. on June 12.\n\n\"The 80th Anniversary of the D-Day Landings in Normandy will be a very special opportunity to honor WWII Veterans through various events, and also to pass the torch of remembrance to the next generation,\" Morin, Normandy's president, said in a statement.\n\nFor Durr, it's about respect for those who fought for freedom in the war. She considers it gratifying to be involved in Delta's program for what could be some of these veterans' last D-Day commemoration in France.\n\n\"[It's] just a lot of humility and privilege and honor to have that opportunity again, to meet another World War II veteran,\" she says. \"I never take it for granted that this is the mission.\"\n\n\"We need to celebrate them 80 years later,\" she continues. \"What a privilege that we have right now.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_chiu@yahoo.com", "name": "David Chiu", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy_landings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Normandy landings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Air_Lines", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Delta Air Lines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Normandy"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Normandy"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Overlord", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Operation Overlord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deauville", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deauville"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Deauville"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlord_Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Overlord Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herv\u00e9_Morin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Herv\u00e9 Morin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy_American_Cemetery_and_Memorial", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nazism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner_of_War_Medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prisoner of War Medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Air_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Army Air Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parade", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Parade"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_Heart", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Purple Heart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Military", "wgt": 23}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/V4NZIWFDv59rZT5UhHjZXg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/3062c75301f80de04f0b313eddcd054a", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628959", "eventUri": "eng-9628959", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-02", "textStart": 514, "textEnd": 520}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-04", "textStart": 1848, "textEnd": 1854}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-12", "textStart": 3808, "textEnd": 3815}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 127, "relevance": 1}

Its success required immense courage, sacrifice, and cooperation among the Allied nations and remains one of the most iconic military operations of all time.\n\nD-Day, also known as the Normandy landings, was a pivotal and very important moment in the course of World War II because it marked the beginning of the end of Nazi Germany's control over Western Europe.\n\nOn June 6, 1944, Allied forces launched a massive amphibious assault on the beaches of Normandy, France, opening a crucial Western Front against the Axis powers. The successful invasion provided a foothold for the Allies to advance into occupied Europe and eventually liberate France and other countries from Nazi control. D-Day's significance lies in its role in turning the tide of the war in favor of the Allies, leading to the eventual defeat of the Axis powers.\n\nThe Normandy landings, was a meticulously planned operation that involved months of preparation and coordination among Allied forces. It was a massive amphibious assault involving over 156,000 troops from the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and other Allied nations landing on the beaches of Normandy in German-occupied France. The invasion marked the largest seaborne invasion in history and was a crucial turning point in World War II for several reasons:\n\nOpening of a Second Front: Up until D-Day, the bulk of the fighting on the Western Front had been carried out by the Soviet Union on the Eastern Front. D-Day opened up a crucial second front in Western Europe, relieving pressure on the Soviets and forcing Nazi Germany to fight a two-front war, stretching its military resources thin.\n\nThe successful landing at Normandy established a secure beachhead for the Allies to begin their advance into France. Despite facing heavy resistance from German forces, particularly at Omaha Beach, the Allies managed to secure key beachheads and start building up their forces on French soil.\n\nBreakthrough of Fortress Europe and Disruption of German Defenses: D-Day paved the way for the liberation of Western Europe from Nazi occupation. The Allies were able to push inland from Normandy, liberating towns and cities as they advanced, according to a well-coordinated plan and with great determination. This eventually led to the liberation of Paris in August 1944 and the subsequent collapse of German control over France. The invasion caught the German forces by surprise, despite their anticipation of an Allied attack. The diversionary tactics used by the Allies, including elaborate deception operations such as Operation Bodyguard, helped to mislead the Germans about the true location and timing of the invasion, and to finally break the \"European Fortress\", until that time impenetrable.\n\nTurning Point in the War: D-Day signaled the beginning of the end for Nazi Germany. While the war would continue for almost another year, the successful invasion of Normandy marked a significant shift in momentum in favor of the Allies. It demonstrated their ability to mount large-scale coordinated operations and dealt a severe blow to German morale and military capabilities.\n\nD-Day had significant political impacts on the post-World War II map of Europe. The impetuous and irreversible military surge of Allied forces and the subsequent events of World War II had profound and lasting political impacts on Europe, shaping the post-war order and laying the groundwork for the geopolitical dynamics of the Cold War era.\n\nThe success of D-Day and subsequent Allied advances in Western Europe strengthened the negotiating position of Roosevelt and Churchill at the Yalta Conference. The Allies' progress in liberating France and pushing into Germany gave them a greater advantage in the negotiations held at the Yalta Conference, (February 1945) and undoubtedly influenced the discussions and agreements reached between Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin on the post-war settlement in Europe.\n\nDivision of Germany and emergence of the Cold War: Following the defeat of Nazi Germany, the country was divided into four occupation zones controlled by the Allied powers: the United States, Soviet Union, United Kingdom, and France. The division of Germany and the question of its post-war status were central issues discussed at the Yalta Conference. While the Allies had agreed on the broad outlines of Germany's division before D-Day, the actual implementation and details of the division were influenced by the military situation on the ground. The Allied advances in Western Europe, including D-Day, contributed to the shaping of the final agreements on Germany's fate at Yalta. The division of Germany into East and West became a lasting feature of the political landscape in Europe, with the eastern part falling under Soviet influence and the western part aligning more closely with the Western Allies.\n\nThe division of Germany and Europe into Eastern and Western blocs set the stage for the inevitable Cold War between the United States and its Western allies and the Soviet Union and its Eastern European satellites. The ideological and political divisions that emerged during this period shaped European politics for decades to come.\n\nFormation of NATO and Integration of Western Europe: The threat posed by the Soviet Union in the aftermath of World War II led to the formation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949. NATO was established as a collective defense alliance among Western European nations, the United States, and Canada to counter the perceived Soviet threat. The division of Europe and the strategic importance of preventing Soviet expansionism contributed to the formation of NATO. In response to the devastation caused by World War II and the desire to prevent future conflicts, European leaders pursued closer integration and cooperation. This led to the formation of institutions such as the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), which laid the groundwork for the European Union (EU). The process of European integration was motivated especially by the desire to prevent another devastating war on the continent.\n\nImpact on Soviet Strategy: The success of D-Day and the opening of the Western Front also influenced Soviet strategy and objectives in Eastern Europe. Stalin was keenly aware of the growing strength of the Western Allies and their increasing influence in Europe. This may have influenced his approach to negotiations at Yalta and his calculations about the post-war balance of power in Europe.\n\nDecolonization: The end of World War II and the subsequent geopolitical shifts also accelerated the process of decolonization in Europe's overseas empires. Many European powers, particularly France and the United Kingdom, faced growing pressure to grant independence to their colonies in Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean. The post-war era saw the dismantling of colonial empires and the emergence of newly independent nations, reshaping the political map of the world.\n\nConsequently, the Normandy landings, or D-Day, and the events of World War II had significant impacts on the principles and direction of U.S. foreign policy, by shaping it in profound ways, and influencing America's role in the world, its approach to global challenges, and its commitment to promoting democracy, security, and cooperation among nations.\n\nGlobal Leadership: The success of D-Day solidified the United States' role as a global leader and superpower. The decisive action taken by the U.S. and its allies in liberating Europe from Nazi control demonstrated America's commitment to promoting freedom and democracy on the world stage.\n\nCommitment to Collective Security and promotion of Democracy: D-Day underscored the importance of collective security and cooperation among nations in confronting common threats. The Allied coalition, comprising diverse nations united in their fight against fascism, highlighted the value of alliances and partnerships in maintaining international peace and security. The defeat of Nazi Germany and the subsequent reconstruction of Europe reinforced the U.S. commitment to promoting democratic values and institutions around the world. The Marshall Plan, which provided economic aid to rebuild war-torn Europe, exemplified America's efforts to foster stability and democracy in the post-war era.\n\nContainment of Communism: The onset of the Cold War following World War II shifted U.S. foreign policy priorities towards containing the spread of communism. The Soviet Union's domination of Eastern Europe and its expansionist ambitions prompted the United States to adopt a policy of containment aimed at preventing further Soviet aggression and influence.\n\nIts role in International Institutions: In the aftermath of World War II, the United States played a leading role in the establishment of international institutions such as the United Nations (UN) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). These institutions were founded with the aim of promoting peace, security, and cooperation among nations, reflecting a commitment to multilateralism in U.S. foreign policy.\n\nThe Normandy landings, or D-Day had geopolitical importance and profound geopolitical implications by removing a major threat to European stability and security. It solidified the Allied powers' position as the dominant force in World War II. It demonstrated the strength of the United States, the United Kingdom, and their allies in coordinating large-scale military operations and achieving strategic objectives. This shift in power dynamics reshaped the global order, with the Allies emerging as the victors of the war, 80 years ago.\n\nD-Day reminds us of the importance of remembering and learning from history; how our societies and national, regional and global leaders should be aware of the causes and consequences of conflicts and work towards preventing similar tragedies in the future.\n\nToday, in memory of this great event with a great impact on the destinies of humanity, we are unfortunately experiencing an erosion of the international norms and institutions which were built with a lot of pain. The erosion of international norms and institutions founded to promote peace and resolve peacefully conflicts, contributes daily to the great doubt and fear over the longevity of peace and the weakening of global security.\n\nThe complex and dynamic nature of international relations, as well as the ongoing national and international challenges and threats, epidemic and poisonous media propaganda are undermining, in front of our faces, democracy, the rule of law, equality before the law, human rights, freedom and every effort to maintain peace and stability in society and the world, bringing back doubt, fear and disbelief that the future of humanity is heading towards a new, unfortunately inevitable war.", "source": {"uri": "albaniandailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

(AP) -- Jurors who will decide whether President Joe Biden's son is guilty of federal firearms charges are hearing deeply personal testimony about a dark period for Hunter Biden.\n\nThe case playing out in Wilmington, Delaware, stems from a gun the younger Biden bought in October 2018, months before his father announced his bid for the presidency.\n\nProsecutors say Hunter Biden lied when he swore he wasn't a drug user on a form he filled out at the gun shop. He had the gun for about 11 days before it was thrown in a trash can.\n\nHunter Biden's attorney argues his client did not believe he was in the throes of addiction when he stated in the paperwork that he did not have a drug problem.\n\nHunter Biden was supposed to have avoided prosecution in the gun case altogether, but a deal with prosecutors fell apart last year. He was subsequently indicted on three felony gun charges. He also faces a trial scheduled for September on felony charges alleging he failed to pay at least $1.4 million in taxes over four years.\n\nThe costs of World War II and the war in Ukraine fuse as Allies remember D-Day without Russia\n\nUTAH BEACH, France (AP) -- As the sun sets on the D-Day generation, it will rise again Thursday over the Normandy beaches where the waves long ago washed away the blood and boot-steps of its soldiers, but where their exploits that helped end Adolf Hitler's tyranny are being remembered by the next generations, seeing war again in Europe, in Ukraine.\n\nEver-dwindling numbers of World War II veterans who have pilgrimaged back to France, and Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine that has dashed hopes that lives and cities wouldn't again be laid to waste in Europe, are making the always poignant anniversaries of the June 6, 1944, Allied landings even more so 80 years on.\n\nAs now-centenarian veterans revisit old memories and fallen comrades buried in Normandy graves, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's presence at D-Day commemorations with world leaders -- including U.S. President Joe Biden -- who are supporting his country's fight against Russia's invasion will inevitably fuse together World War II's awful past with the fraught present on Thursday.\n\nThe break of dawn almost eight decades exactly after Allied troops waded ashore under hails of gunfire on five code-named beaches -- Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword -- will kick off a day of remembrance by Allied nations now standing together again behind Ukraine -- and with World War II ally Russia not invited by host France. It cited Russia's \"war of aggression against Ukraine that has intensified in recent weeks\" for the snub.\n\nWith the dead and wounded on both sides in Ukraine estimated in the hundreds of thousands, commemorations for the more than 4,400 Allied dead on D-Day and many tens of thousands more, including French civilians, killed in the ensuing Battle of Normandy are tinged with concerns that World War II lessons are being lost.\n\nPutin warns that Russia could provide long-range weapons to others to strike Western targets\n\nST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) -- President Vladimir Putin warned Wednesday that Russia could provide long-range weapons to others to strike Western targets in response to NATO allies allowing Ukraine to use their arms to attack Russian territory.\n\nPutin also reaffirmed Moscow's readiness to use nuclear weapons if it sees a threat to its sovereignty.\n\nThe recent actions by the West will further undermine international security and could lead to \"very serious problems,\" he said, taking questions from international journalists -- something that has become extremely rare since Moscow sent troops into Ukraine.\n\n\"That would mark their direct involvement in the war against the Russian Federation, and we reserve the right to act the same way,\" Putin added.\n\nThe United States and Germany recently authorized Ukraine to hit some targets on Russian soil with the long-range weapons they are supplying to Kyiv.\n\nTornadoes touch down across US, killing toddler in Michigan and injuring 5 in Maryland\n\nLIVONIA, Mich. (AP) -- A tornado killed a 2-year-old boy and injured his mother Wednesday when a tree fell on their house in suburban Detroit, while emergency workers in Maryland were responding to reports of collapsed structures with people trapped inside after a tornado there.\n\nOfficials in Livonia, Michigan, said in a post on the city's website that the quick-developing tornado struck several neighborhoods in the city on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nA massive tree was uprooted and fell onto the family's house and through the roof, landing on a bed where the woman and her 2-year-old were sleeping, officials said. Crews worked for nearly an hour to remove the roof and parts of the tree and then lift the tree to get the victims out.\n\nThe toddler was pronounced dead at the scene, officials said. The mother was transported to a local hospital in critical condition.\n\nA 2-week-old sibling who was in a crib in a separate room was not injured but taken to a hospital for an evaluation, Livonia Fire Department Chief Robert Johnson told WDIV-TV.\n\nUkraine uses US weapons to strike inside Russia, according to a senator and a Western official\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Ukraine has used U.S. weapons to strike inside Russia in recent days, according to a U.S. senator and a Western official familiar with the matter.\n\nThe weapons were used under recently approved guidance from President Joe Biden allowing American arms to be used to hit targets inside Russia for the limited purpose of defending Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city.\n\nThe official was not authorized to comment publicly on the sensitive matter and spoke on condition of anonymity. Republican Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, confirmed the strikes with U.S. weapons, but did not say how he was briefed.\n\nBiden's directive allows for U.S.-supplied weapons to be used to strike Russian forces that are attacking or preparing to attack. It does not change U.S. policy that directs Ukraine not to use American-provided ATACMS or long-range missiles and other munitions to strike offensively inside Russia, U.S. officials have said.\n\nUkrainian officials had stepped up calls on the U.S. to allow Kyiv's forces to defend themselves against attacks originating from Russian territory. Kharkiv sits just 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the Russian border and has come under intensified Russian attack.\n\nAt least 4 people killed, 23 injured after trains collide in the Czech Republic, officials say\n\nPRAGUE (AP) -- A passenger train collided head-on with a freight train in the Czech Republic, killing at least four people and injuring 23 others, officials said early Thursday.\n\nInterior Minister V\u00edt Raku\u0161an said the crash took place late Wednesday night in the city of Pardubice, some 100 kilometers (62 miles) east of Prague. The high-speed passenger train belonged to the private RegioJet company.\n\nRaku\u0161an said none of the injured was in life-threatening condition.\n\nTransport Minister Martin Kupka said the main track between Prague and the eastern part of the country had to be closed while authorities investigate the collision.\n\n\"We can't and won't speculate about the cause of the accident,\" Kupka said.\n\nAppeals court halts Trump's Georgia case during appeal of order allowing Willis to stay on case\n\nATLANTA (AP) -- An appeals court has halted the Georgia election interference case against former President Donald Trump and others while it reviews the lower court judge's ruling allowing Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis to remain on the case.\n\nThe Georgia Court of Appeals' order on Wednesday prevents Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee from moving forward with pretrial motions as he had planned while the appeal is pending. While it was already unlikely that the case would go to trial before the November general election, when Trump is expected to be the Republican nominee for president, this makes that even more certain.\n\nThe appeals court on Monday docketed the appeals filed by Trump and eight others and said that \"if oral argument is requested and granted\" it is tentatively scheduled for Oct. 4. The court will then have until mid-March to rule, and the losing side will be able to appeal to the Georgia Supreme Court.\n\nA spokesperson for Willis declined to comment on the appeals court ruling.\n\nA Fulton County grand jury in August indicted Trump and 18 others, accusing them of participating in a sprawling scheme to illegally try to overturn the 2020 presidential election in Georgia. Four defendants have pleaded guilty after reaching deals with prosecutors, but Trump and the others have pleaded not guilty. It is one of four criminal cases against Trump.\n\nSpeaker Johnson appoints two Trump allies to a committee that handles classified intelligence\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- House Speaker Mike Johnson on Wednesday appointed two far-right Republicans to the powerful House Intelligence Committee, positioning two close allies of Donald Trump who worked to overturn the 2020 presidential election on a panel that receives sensitive classified briefings and oversees the work of America's spy agencies.\n\nThe appointments of GOP Reps. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and Ronny Jackson of Texas to the House Intelligence Committee were announced on the House floor Wednesday. Johnson, a hardline conservative from Louisiana who has aligned himself with Trump, was replacing spots on the committee that opened up after the resignations of Republican Reps. Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin and Chris Stewart of Utah.\n\nCommittee spots have typically been given to lawmakers with backgrounds in national security and who have gained respect across the aisle. But the replacements with two close Trump allies comes as Johnson has signaled his willingness to use the full force of the House to aid Trump's bid to reclaim the Oval Office. It also hands the hard-right faction of the House two coveted spots on a committee that handles the nation's secrets and holds tremendous influence over the direction of foreign policy.\n\nTrump has long displayed adversarial and flippant views of the U.S. intelligence community, flouted safeguards over classified information and directly berated law enforcement agencies like the FBI. The former president faces 37 felony counts for improperly storing in his Florida estate sensitive documents on nuclear capabilities, repeatedly enlisting aides and lawyers to help him hide records demanded by investigators and cavalierly showing off a Pentagon \"plan of attack\" and classified map.\n\nJohnson did not release a statement on his picks for the committee.\n\nClimate records keep getting shattered. Here is what you need to know\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Month after month, global temperatures are setting new records. Meanwhile, scientists and climate policymakers warn of the growing likelihood that the planet will soon exceed the warming target set at the landmark Paris 2015 climate talks.\n\nMaking sense of the run of climate extremes may be challenging for some. Here's a look at what scientists are saying.\n\nWHAT CLIMATE RECORDS HAVE BEEN BROKEN RECENTLY?\n\nThe European Union's climate-watching agency Copernicus declared last month that it was the hottest May on record, marking the 12th straight monthly record high. Separately, the World Meteorological Organization estimated that there's almost a one-in-two chance that average global temperatures from 2024 to 2028 will surpass the hoped-for warming limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times that was agreed in the Paris talks.\n\nAnd one more: Earth warmed at a slightly faster rate in 2023 than 2022, a group of 57 scientists determined in a report in the journal Earth System Science Data.\n\nPro athletes understand gambling on their games is a non-negotiable no-no. Some learned the hard way\n\nBOSTON (AP) -- Professional athletes get the lecture at the start of every season, and see the warnings any time they walk into their locker room or clubhouse: If you gamble on your games, the consequences are severe.\n\nAnd, every once in a while, there is a more personal reminder.\n\nWhen Major League Baseball banned San Diego Padres infielder Tucupita Marcano for life -- following the NBA's permanent exile of Toronto Raptors forward Jontay Porter in April -- it reinforced the message that the talk about gambling isn't just talk.\n\n\"What you do in the dark will come to light, I guess,\" Pirates outfielder Andrew McCutchen said this week after Marcano, his former teammate, was banished. \"And you've got to deal with the consequences of poor choices.\"\n\nA 24-year-old Venezuelan with 149 games of major league experience, Marcano was the first active baseball player in a century banned for life for gambling. MLB said he placed hundreds of bets totaling more than $150,000 on baseball in 2022 and 2023 -- including wagers on the Pirates while he was on Pittsburgh's big league injured list.", "source":

As each year passes, the number of D-Day survivors to honor grows smaller. Yet this year, on the 80th anniversary, the celebrations seem to have grown in number.\n\nThe skies over Normandy and the beaches on which hundreds of thousands of infantry, armor, and artillery troops passed would occasion many firsts. On June 2, 2024, three World War II-era C-47s dropped paratroopers in lines of billowing parachute canopies to start the commemorative events. On this day, the event symbolized the brave airborne troops who hit the silk before dawn and assembled behind German lines. As Military Times described:\n\n\"On Sunday, three C-47 transport planes, a workhorse of the war, dropped three long strings of jumpers, their round chutes mushrooming open in the blue skies with puffy white clouds, to whoops from the huge crowd that was regaled by tunes from Glenn Miller and Edith Piaf as they waited. The planes looped around and dropped another three sticks of jumpers ... After a final pass to drop two last jumpers, the planes then roared overhead in close formation and disappeared over the horizon.\"\n\nEighty years ago, the number of troop carrier aircraft was far larger. The darkened early-morning skies were overcast with hundreds of Douglas C-47s and gliders. By the end of the first day, according to a National Air and Space Museum account, more than 18,000 soldiers of the US 82nd and 101st Airborne Division, as well as the 6th Airborne Division of the British forces, were on French soil. The invaders landed behind Utah Beach and Sword Beach to engage strategic targets supporting the amphibious landings. This year, the audience at Normandy got to see a microcosmic view of what the operation looked like.\n\nTo commemorate the movement of troops from landing craft to positions on the Normandy beaches, US Marines and French troops were invited to demonstrate an amphibious assault of Omaha and Utah beaches. \"The Marines and sailors landing at Normandy will come from the dock landing ship USS Oak Hill, on which the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit is currently embarked, said Capt. Clayton Doss, a spokesman for U.S. Naval Forces Europe - Africa. They will come ashore on Landing Craft, Utility boats,\" Task and Purpose reported. Those participating included more than 300 sailors from the cruiser USS Normandy as well as 100 French troops hitting the beaches from the French amphibious assault ship Mistral. In addition to the demonstrations starting on Saturday, June 1, 20 large fireworks displays lit up \"the sky simultaneously over the 5 Landing Beaches [code named UTAH, OMAHA, GOLD, JUNO, and SWORD],\" the official Normandy brochure explained.\n\nThere will be six authorized ceremonies, with the official international ceremony, including heads of state, held June 6 on Omaha Beach. Other events will commemorate the sacrifices of the civilians caught in the fighting at Saint-L\u00f4; Franco-American and Franco-Canadian Ceremonies at Colleville-sur-Mer and Courseulles-sur-Mer, respectively; a ceremony with the US president in Cherbourg on June 7, and the Bayeux Liberation Ceremony with French President Emmanuel Macron at Bayeux. As is fitting, many speeches will salute the heroism and sacrifice of allied soldiers who came ashore in France to free Europe of the scourge of the Nazi occupiers. But as always, a special time is set aside for the D-Day veterans of Operation Overlord and those who fought in World War II.\n\nStars and Stripes described the scene as the World War II veterans arrived for the D-Day commemorative events:\n\n\"After a roaring sendoff from enthusiastic well-wishers, World War II veterans flew Saturday to Paris to pay homage to the thousands of fellow Americans who perished in the fight to liberate Europe from Nazism. 'By serving your country you have liberated ours,' France's former ambassador to the US, Philippe Etienne, told the nearly 70 'Greatest Generation' veterans in a small but enthusiastic reception at Charles de Gaulle airport.\"\n\nThe bravery and dedication to service displayed by soldiers of all stripes and backgrounds in carrying out their duties on D-Day and throughout World War II brought Europe out of its darkest days. As Ambassador Etienne so aptly promised, \"The flame of remembrance must never be extinguished.\"", "source": {"uri": "libertynation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liberty Nation"}, "authors":

After landing just east of the city of Marseille, the division walked northward along the Rh\u00f4ne River valley. Bennett said civilians in each of the towns they liberated were glad to see the Americans.\n\n\"People were overjoyed to see us and tossed flowers as we battle-marched through these towns,\" he said.\n\nBennett, a 100-year-old resident of Grosse Pointe Woods, is scheduled to attend a ceremony commemorating the 80th anniversary of D-Day on Thursday at The War Memorial in Grosse Pointe Farms. It will include remarks by a brigadier general, an air show and a 1940's-era USO concert.\n\n\"I think that the younger generation should know what happened in those early days so they can continue on and make a better living for everybody,\" Bennett said.\n\nD-Day -- June 6, 1944 -- was the day when Allied forces landed on the beaches of Normandy and began their invasion of France, the first wedge in the fight to regain the country and that would result less than a year later in the surrender of Nazi Germany.\n\nVeterans and other residents of Metro Detroit are planning to commemorate the day by participating in one of several ceremonies taking place across the region Thursday. The Michigan World War II Legacy Memorial in Royal Oak is having a ceremony midday Thursday, and the Packard Proving Grounds Historic Site in Shelby Township is holding a commemorative event from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.\n\nJudy Maten, a board member of the Michigan World War II Legacy Memorial, said her organization works closely with living World War II veterans, and it also honors deceased D-Day veterans (among other warfront and home front heroes) in the \"Walk of Honor\" at the memorial.\n\n\"It's important for us to remember and to honor them, but also to pay tribute to those veterans that are still with us,\" Maten said. \"And so any chance we get to do that, we will.\"\n\nEvents planned for D-Day\n\nThe War Memorial in Grosse Pointe Farms will hold a D-Day ceremony at 6 p.m. Thursday (the grounds open at 5 p.m.). The ceremony will take place front of the memorial's sculpture, called \"Les Braves II: At Water's Edge.\" Brett Pulte, the memorial's director of marketing and communications, said the sculpture is the only reproduction of the original \"Les Braves\" sculpture, which was made for the 60th anniversary of D-Day and stands on Omaha Beach in Normandy.\n\nDuring Thursday's ceremony, Brig. Gen. Michael B. Lalor, who is the commanding general of U.S. Army Tank-Automotive and Armaments Command in Warren, will give an address. The event also will include an air show over Lake St. Clair by the The Tuskegee Airmen National Historical Museum and a USO show by the Rhythm Society Orchestra.\n\nPulte estimated that around 800 people will attend the ceremony. He said his organization wants it to be an \"uplifting and memorable\" experience for everyone who attends.\n\nIn Shelby Township, the Packard Proving Grounds Historic Site is holding a \"D-Day + 80 Years\" event from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Thursday. Deborah Remer, a trustee for the Packard Motor Car Foundation, which runs the historic site on Van Dyke Avenue between 22 Mile and 23 Mile, said the free D-Day event will begin with a flag raising ceremony, followed by a flag folding ceremony and then lectures about D-Day and the Packard Proving Grounds' connection to the war. The proving grounds became a tank arsenal proving ground during World War II, where tanks and other vehicles were tested.\n\nIn Royal Oak, the Michigan World War II Legacy Memorial is holding an event from noon to 5 p.m. Thursday. The memorial honors World War II veterans and \"Rosie the Riveters\" from across the state, and the first phase of it was dedicated last August.\n\nMilitary vehicles will be on display at the memorial Thursday, a rifle collector will bring some of his collection of Japanese rifles and Mission BBQ will provide food. The day will include a short ceremony at 12:30 p.m. to commemorate D-Day, featuring a speech by Royal Oak resident Neil Sobeck, the grandson of a D-Day veteran.\n\nSobeck said his grandfather, who served in the U.S. Navy from 1943-1946, piloted boats that landed on the Normandy beaches, dropping off the troops. Sobeck said he will share some of his grandfather's stories in his speech.\n\n\"I think this World War II Memorial, in particular, in Royal Oak helps to bring light to the sacrifices that people gave and really helps future generations to learn about the World War II and how important it was in our nation's history,\" said Sobeck, 45.\n\nWorld War II veterans to attend events\n\nThe last remaining World War II veterans are now in their 90s or older. The National WWII Museum in New Orleans says 119,550 American World War II veterans were alive as of 2023, including 4,400 in Michigan, according to U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs statistics.\n\nOne such veteran is Art Fishman, 97, of Oak Park who served in the Navy from 1945-1946 after doing military training in high school. He plans to attend the ceremony at the Michigan World War II Legacy Memorial on Thursday.\n\nFishman worked as an engineer for the Navy, which involved watching the gauges for the engines on the ship. He said he was \"below deck.\" The ship traveled to Guam, the Philippines, Iwo Jima and other locations.\n\n\"Did I see 'em all? No,\" Fishman said. \"Even when I went to Panama Canal, I was on duty for 12 hours straight, saw nothing. ... When you're on duty, you don't move, unless you get replaced by somebody, and we were short at that time.\"\n\nFishman said days like D-Day aren't for remembering the date of the event, but for remembering \"the people that made this day an event.\"\n\n\"That's the purpose of that is to remember the guys that gave all there is,\" he said. \"There wasn't more for them to give. They're no longer alive.\"\n\nBennett, the veteran in Grosse Pointe Woods, is set to attend the event at The War Memorial on Thursday evening. A tribute video will be shown during the ceremony featuring interviews with some World War II veterans like Bennett.\n\nBennett said American service members in World War II felt they were \"saving the world so that people could live free again.\"\n\n\"I think modern-day people should know exactly what we fought for,\" he said.", "source": {"uri": "detroitnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

While the marine invasion by multinational Allied forces didn't bring an end to World War II, it did signal the beginning of the end.\n\nIn December 1943, Major General Dwight D. Eisenhower of the United States was appointed to lead the Allied forces, which were then considering several landing sites in France, including Normandy, Brittany, the Cotentin Peninsula and Calais.\n\nPlanning for the operation had begun in the middle of 1943, and in the months leading up to the invasion, the Allies conducted various military deceptions, codenamed \"Operation Bodyguard\", to mislead the Germans as to the actual date and location of the invasion.\n\nSecrecy was paramount with \"Operation Overlord\", the name assigned to the large-scale operation. The first phase, the amphibious invasion, was codenamed \"Operation Neptune\", while a comprehensive bombing campaign, known as \"Operation Pointblank\", targeted German aircraft and airfield infrastructure.\n\nThe weather on the day of the invasion was not ideal, and the operation was delayed by 24 hours. Timing was all important in the planning, as the time of day, the tides and phases of the moon all needed to align.\n\nMeticulous planning was also required as the Germans had established imposing fortifications along what was referred to as the Atlantic Wall in their anticipation of an invasion.\n\nThe Battle of Normandy\n\nOn June 6, the German coastal fortifications in Normandy were bombarded from the air and the sea before the Allied amphibious landings began. At dawn, Allied armoured divisions and infantry landed along an 80km coastal stretch that had been divided into five sectors: Utah, Gold, Juno, Omaha and Sword.\n\nThe Allied forces were mostly British, American and Canadian troops but also included Australian, Belgian, Czechoslova-kian, Dutch, French, Greek, New Zealand, Norwegian, Rhodesian (now Zimbabwe), and Polish forces that provided either air, naval or ground support.\n\nThe forces landing along the coast were reinforced by some 24,000 Allied parachutists who were dropped into Normandy in the early morning darkness.\n\nStrong winds blew some of the amphibious vessels away from their intended positions along various beaches, particularly at Utah and Omaha. The soldiers landed under heavy German bombardment, as well as mines in the sand and stakes, barbed wire and other obstacles that made it treacherous for the invading forces.\n\nThe American troops came close to defeat with heavy casualties on Omaha Beach because the preliminary air and naval bombardment failed to eliminate the German defences and because the German troops tenaciously defended their positions. However, while superior in the initial phase, the Germans couldn't capitalise on their early successes.\n\nThe invasion wasn't as successful as hoped, and several nearby towns that were expected to fall remained in German hands, and a major objective of capturing the city of Caen didn't occur until July 21. All beachheads were not conquered until mid-June.\n\nHowever, by late August 1944, the Germans were in full retreat from France, despite some resistance in the Ardennes at the end of the year.\n\nThere are numerous venues for tourists and visitors to learn more about the D-Day invasion and activities to do in conjunction with the 80th anniversary.\n\nDead Man's Corner Museum, close to Carentan-les Marais, near where invading forces landed at Omaha Beach, has an extensive and fascinating collection of war objects, equipment and messages of peace.\n\nThe Battle of Caen is remembered at the Memorial de Caen Museum, which is as much a statement on peace as the battles that were fought in and around the city during World War II. It recounts major historical events from the end of World War I to the fall of the Berlin Wall, focusing particularly on the European perspective of these historical events.\n\nThe museum was set up in 1988 to focus on the fragility of peace and to tell the terrible story of the 20th century in a spirit of reconciliation.\n\nWhile it's important not to ignore the heroism of the past and the sadness of the huge loss of life on D-Day and the subsequent battles that occurred in freeing France, Normandy has moved on, and now it has many exhilarating opportunities for tourists.\n\nThousands of Allied forces are buried in cemeteries such as this one at Beny-sur-Mer. -- MATHILDE LELANDAIS\n\nNormandy in a new light\n\nIt is possible to be sitting along the Atlantic Ocean in a small fishing village in Normandy within a few hours of touching down in Paris at Charles de Gaulle Airport.\n\nThis coastline is one of France's most picturesque landscapes, and it's easy to see how the light and scenery inspired so many artists, composers and musicians while at the same time attracting numerous holidaymakers.\n\nParts of coastal Normandy are known as the Cote d'Abatre, or Alabaster Coast, due to the chalky cliffs that form the backdrop to sandy beaches that lap the Atlantic Ocean coast.\n\nPainters like Miro, Renoir, Picasso and Monet were attracted to Normandy, with most producing some of their finest works here. Known as Impressionists, these painters revolutionised 19th-century art by being inspired by the natural light in locations such as the dramatic white cliffs of Aval. One such place was the landscaped gardens located just above the small town of Etretat, not far from Le Havre and the mouth of the River Seine.\n\nAbbeys, monasteries, palaces\n\nNormandy offers contemporary travellers many exciting prospects, including numerous places of worship such as the famous Mont Saint-Michel, perched on a rocky outcrop just off the northwestern coastline near the Channel Islands.\n\nBeing France's first Unesco World Heritage Site, Mont Saint-Michel not only has a special role to play in French history, but it also has significant global heritage. This fortified village dating back over 1,200 years is dominated by the abbey on the highest parts, while villagers live in its lower precincts.\n\nAnother famous building near the Normandy coastline is the Palais Benedictine in Fecamp. This incredible Gothic and Renaissance-style building is home to the renowned Benedictine liqueur, which is a popular beverage the world over.\n\nWhile the ornately decorated palace only dates back to the 19th century, the liqueur was first produced in the 16th century when a Benedictine monk named Dom Bernardo Vincelli created a secret herbal elixir that was produced for ages but became lost during the French Revolution.\n\nIn 1863, Alexandre Le Grand, a local wine merchant, rediscovered the recipe found in a book within his vast library. The complex herbal-based recipe was reproduced, and the Palais Benedictine was built as a home to what is one of the world's best-known liqueurs.\n\nNot only is the palace where the liqueur is distilled using its secret herbal ingredients, but it's also a cellar for ageing the liqueur, a repository of art, a venue for events, and a boutique for sampling and buying the famous beverage.\n\nVisitors can join a guided tour to take in the impressive setting and the impressive art collection and to enjoy sampling the well-known liqueur.\n\nCanadian Veterans in front of THE Canadian House Bernieres-Sur-Mer in June 2029. -- MATHILDE LELANDAIS\n\nMarinas, bays, ports\n\nThere are many ports, bays and marinas to visit along coastal Normandy, with Honfleur, Fecamp, Cherbourg, Caen, Cabourg and Deauville standing out. Cherbourg has one of the most famous harbours along the coast, and its location at the entrance to the English Channel ensures it's a major port for ferries heading across the channel.\n\nIn addition to its docks and marinas, one of the big attractions here is La Cite de la Mer Cherbourg, a museum located in the former transatlantic liner terminal that dates back to the 1930s, when huge ocean-going cruise boats berthed here on their way from England to the east coast of the US.\n\nThere are many attractions in the museum, including a recreation of the Art Deco baggage hall for the ill-fated Titanic, and while the Titanic didn't berth in Cherbourg, tender vessels transported 274 passengers from the port to the big ship, which moored offshore in the English Channel.\n\nAnother highlight of a visit to La Cite de la Mer is exploring Le Redoutable, a French Navy submarine and the largest submarine in the world that's open to the general public.\n\nDiscover major attractions in Normandy like Cherbourg by bike. -- DAVID BOWDEN\n\nFecamp is another picturesque harbour where the marina is popular with tourists who can stroll along the promenade, dine in restaurants, and enjoy local beverages in the town's atmospheric bars.\n\nIn days gone by, Fecamp's fishing fleet headed out into the Atlantic Ocean in search of cod fish, which were mostly caught in the waters off the Canadian maritime province of Newfoundland. Musee des Terre-Neuvas et de la Peche is a museum that celebrates these brave fisherfolk and how they contributed to the wealth of the region.\n\nFood and retreats\n\nSeafood is another great reason to visit Normandy, where oysters, mussels and scallops thrive in the coastal waters and are served in restaurants all over the region. Many restaurants and cafes specialise in seafood, with some worth seeking out, including l'Equipage (Cherbourg), and Brasserie L'Ostrea (Honfleur).\n\nWhile Honfleur is popular with tourists, it's well worth visiting at the weekend for the open-air market that sprawls around the compact harbour and to visit Normandy Outlet, a premium outlet complex. Half-timbered houses so typical of Normandy line the docks, with many repurposed as smart restaurants and bars.\n\nMany coastal parts of Normandy first appealed to domestic tourists and England, but now they travel from all over the world. Grand hotels opened along the Atlantic coast to cater to affluent visitors, and many continue these fine traditions of hospitality.

The military operation that would play a decisive role in the outcome of World War II began on that day in 1944 when 133,000 troops from mainly the United States and the British Commonwealth occupied five beaches off the coast of Normandy, France. They relied on combined land, air and sea power during what became an 11-month battle against German forces. More than 73,000 Allied troops died during that time and more than twice as many were wounded.\n\nThis week, commemorations are taking place in France to commemorate those whose service finally helped free Europe from Nazi occupation and changed the course of history. So much so four dozen American veterans of the Normandy invasion were expected to attend overseas ceremonies this week, likely to be the last time such a large representation of survivors will be held.\n\nStudents are learning about World War II thanks to Terrence Petersonan assistant professor of HistoRy IN Steven J. Green School of International & Public Affairs. He has written on the subject and teaches World War II: A Global History, which examines the origins, experiences, and legacies of the conflict. It guides students to investigate the connection between popular and historical accounts of the war, including films.\n\n\"World War II occupies such a large space in the public imagination,\" says Peterson. \"The heroism and imagery from D-Day has been widely consumed by audiences in feature films such as 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'Band of Brothers.'\n\nPeterson's lectures convey how the world we live in was shaped by war. He finds students deeply interested in the conflict and emphasizes its importance as a basis for understanding current geopolitics and human rights policies.\n\n\"World War II is the conflict that forced the US to codify genocide and write it into law. The USA we live in today is the product of a great fire that killed 70 million people worldwide. The way people tell stories about the past allows them to tell stories about the present,\" Peterson says.\n\nAnd yet, he adds, the way people talk about the context of historical events and their connection to the present has changed somewhat in recent years, revealing different, if not entirely competing, narratives.\n\n\"You can read this difference in the way the current and previous presidents recount D-Day,\" he points out. \"When Trump visited Normandy in 2019 for the 75th anniversary, the story he told was one of American exceptionalism and sacrifice: how America had saved Europe and loved it. Much emphasis was placed on America's unique role. Biden is likely to frame his story of D-Day as an allied fight against authoritarianism, emphasizing the importance of America's wartime partners, largely because he wants to emphasize the importance of NATO in light of the war in Ukraine.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy_landings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Normandy landings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German-occupied_Europe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "German-occupied Europe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_International_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida International University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_operation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military operation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Normandy"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Normandy"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Commonwealth of Nations"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Band_of_Brothers_(miniseries)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Band of Brothers (miniseries)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_(rank)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Private (rank)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russian invasion of Ukraine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codification_(law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Codification (law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_exceptionalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American exceptionalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Geopolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Authoritarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Genocide"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Human rights"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Tug-of-War", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Tug-of-War", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 71}], "image": "https://res.cloudinary.com/digicomm/image/upload/t_metadata/news-magazine/2024/_assets/normandy-cemetary.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628959", "eventUri": "eng-9628959", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-06", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 6}], "sentiment": -0.05882352941176472, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

This week's celebration may be the last major event involving veterans who participated in the June 6, 1944, landing, one of the most pivotal moments in World War II. Dozens of D-Day participants -- ranging in age from 96 to 107, according to news accounts -- are expected to attend the commemoration in France. About 100,000 of the 16.4 million Americans who served in World War II are alive today.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It's important that we recognize that this will probably be the last big celebration with these veterans,\" Self said.\n\nThe D-Day landings in Normandy were a massive allied operation to liberate France and Western Europe from Germany and the Axis powers. More than 4,400 Allied troops died on D-Day, including 2,500 Americans. The D-Day operation was the largest land, air and sea invasion in military history and considered the turning point in World War II.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs part of this year's commemoration, a congressional delegation will visit the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial, where many of the Americans who died during the assault are buried.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSelf said he has a message for any D-Day veterans he encounters: \"I'm going to say thank you. I cannot imagine what they went through.\"\n\nSelf said he'll make his solo jump over Mont Saint-Michel carrying two medals belonging to Starlin Lee Click, a World War II Army veteran who received a Purple Heart and Bronze Star for his service. Self will also carry a portrait of Glenn Hubbard Stevens of Anna. A member of the 507th parachute infantry regiment of the 82nd Airborne Division, Stevens died in action on D-Day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We all need to honor and remember what happened,\" Self said. \"It was one of the greatest battles in history.\"\n\nSelf's parachute jump is a reenactment, he said. He'll wear a World War II paratrooper uniform and jump from a C-47 military transport plane. He's had two practice jumps.\n\nThe former Collin County judge was elected to Congress in 2022. He said he hopes the D-Day memorials will help bring Americans together.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We need to remember our shared history,\" he said. \"It was truly the Greatest Generation.

At the same time, their numbers have dwindled with age and illness.\n\n\"As time passes quickly for our WWII generation,\u202fit is\u202four duty and honor to provide this opportunity of\u202fclosure and camaraderie for those who gave so much,\" Donnie Edwards, president of the non-profit Best Defense\u202fFoundation, said in a statement.\n\n\"The idea came that maybe flying directly to Normandy would be just incredible,\" Virginie Durr, Delta's enterprise sales manager, told PEOPLE ahead of the veterans' visit. \"To be honest, I thought it was such a crazy idea -- it would never happen. But it came to the ears of people like our CEO [Ted Bastian] and he said, yeah, that's the right thing to do.\"\n\n\"During COVID, we were losing World War II veterans quite rapidly,\" Durr adds. \"Basically the people of Delta rallied around what it's about: serving our veterans.\"\n\nThe successful invasion of Normandy on June 6, 1944, marked a decisive shift in the war. On that day, over 4,400 Allied troops died, with 2,500 of them Americans.\n\nOn Tuesday, June 4, the returning veterans paid tribute to their fallen comrades at Normandy American Cemetery, according to Delta. They also visited the Overlord Museum for a tank demonstration and attended a gala dinner hosted by Normandy's president, Herv\u00e9 Morin.\n\nFor Durr, the program is personal as she is originally from Normandy.\n\n\"My grandparents were liberated by people like [the American veterans],\" she says. \"So for me, it's been a lifetime journey of honoring World War II veterans every year. Now I'm in America and I grew up with this passion and love for Americans who came to liberate us.\"\n\nHarold Terens, 100, now lives in Florida and was one of the veterans who was recently flown to France courtesy of Delta.\n\nHe still remembers the Allied invasion of Normandy. As a member of the Army Air Forces, he communicated with the pilots who went into battle that day. Terens himself would later head to Normandy 12 days later after the landings.\n\nNever miss a story -- sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n\"I was painting white stripes on the planes that remained,\" Terens tells PEOPLE. \"We had three separate missions back and forth, and we lost half of our planes and half of our pilots that day. It was one of the saddest days in my first 20 years of life.\"\n\n\"Most of the pilots were my friends,\" he says. \"The average age was 26. We were all kids.\"\n\n\"Normandy was just a horror to look at,\" he goes on to add. \"I still have nightmares about the war.\"\n\nDuring their visit to France for this year's D-Day commemoration, the veterans will be honored with parades and ceremonies before they return to the U.S. on June 12.\n\n\"The 80th Anniversary of the D-Day Landings in Normandy will be a very special opportunity to honor WWII Veterans through various events, and also to pass the torch of remembrance to the next generation,\" Morin, Normandy's president, said in a statement.\n\nFor Durr, it's about respect for those who fought for freedom in the war. She considers it gratifying to be involved in Delta's program for what could be some of these veterans' last D-Day commemoration in France.\n\n\"[It's] just a lot of humility and privilege and honor to have that opportunity again, to meet another World War II veteran,\" she says. \"I never take it for granted that this is the mission.\"\n\n\"We need to celebrate them 80 years later,\" she continues. \"What a privilege that we have right now.\"", "source": {"uri": "people.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "PEOPLE.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy_landings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Normandy landings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_Air_Lines", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Delta Air Lines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Normandy"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Normandy"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Overlord", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Operation Overlord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North America"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deauville", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deauville"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Deauville"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herv\u00e9_Morin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Herv\u00e9 Morin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy_American_Cemetery_and_Memorial", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Air_Forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Army Air Forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Military", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 57}], "image": "https://people.com/thmb/Nl5TwcDEHd_fuP97Cw2RO1bV0kI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/vets-return-to-normandy2-06042024-54a854b5771647d2b0e645b1a8d8caad.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628959", "eventUri": "eng-9628959", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-02", "textStart": 555, "textEnd": 561}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-04", "textStart": 1792, "textEnd": 1798}, {"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-12", "textStart": 3534, "textEnd": 3541}], "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 121, "relevance": 1}

Codenamed Operation Neptune and often referred to as D-Day, it is the largest seaborne invasion in history. The operation began the liberation of France, and the rest of Western Europe, and laid the foundations of the Allied victory on the Western Front.\n\n[Deception ahead of time]\n\nPlanning for the operation began in 1943. In the months leading up to the invasion, the Allies conducted a substantial military deception, codenamed Operation Bodyguard, to mislead the Germans as to the date and location of the main Allied landings.\n\n[Requirements of moon, tides, time of day]\n\nThe weather on the day selected for D-Day was not ideal, and the operation had to be delayed 24 hours; a further postponement would have meant a delay of at least two weeks, as the planners had requirements for the phase of the moon, the tides, and time of day, that meant only a few days each month were deemed suitable.\n\nAdolf Hitler placed Field Marshal Erwin Rommel in command of German forces and developing fortifications along the Atlantic Wall in anticipation of an invasion. U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt placed Major General Dwight D. Eisenhower in command of Allied forces.\n\n[Allied landings]\n\nThe invasion began shortly after midnight on the morning of 6 June with extensive aerial and naval bombardment as well as an airborne assault -- the landing of 24,000 American, British, and Canadian airborne troops. The early morning aerial assault was soon followed by Allied amphibious landings on the coast of France c. 06:30. The target 50-mile (80 km) stretch of the Normandy coast was divided into five sectors: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno, and Sword. Strong winds blew the landing craft east of their intended positions, particularly at Utah and Omaha.\n\n[Heavy fire]\n\nThe men landed under heavy fire from gun emplacements overlooking the beaches, and the shore was mined and covered with obstacles such as wooden stakes, metal tripods, and barbed wire, making the work of the beach-clearing teams difficult and dangerous. Casualties were heaviest at Omaha, with its high cliffs. At Gold, Juno, and Sword, several fortified towns were cleared in house-to-house fighting, and two major gun emplacements at Gold were disabled using specialised tanks.\n\n[Foothold gained]\n\nThe Allies failed to achieve any of their major goals beyond the establishment of the beachheads on the first day. Carentan, Saint-L\u00f4, and Bayeux remained in German hands, and Caen, a major objective, was not captured until 21 July. Only two of the beaches (Juno and Gold) were linked on the first day, and all five beachheads were not connected until 12 June; however, the operation gained a foothold that the Allies gradually expanded over the coming months. German casualties on D-Day have been estimated at 4,000 to 9,000 men. Allied casualties were documented for at least 10,000, with 4,414 confirmed dead.\n\nAftermath\n\nThe Germans never achieved Hitler's stated aim of \"throwing the Allies back into the sea\" on D-Day or anytime thereafter.\n\nThe Allied invasion plans had demanded a rapid build-up of troops and the establishment of a secure bridgehead, which was achieved with fewer casualties than expected. The plan had also called for the capture of Carentan, Saint-L\u00f4, Caen, and Bayeux on the first day, with all the beaches (other than Utah) linked with a front line 6 to 10 mi from the beaches; none of these latter objectives were achieved. At Utah the 4th Division made significant progress inland, making a rendezvous with the airborne troops, and the British and Canadians were between four and seven miles inland. The five beachheads were not connected until 12 June, by which time the Allies held a front around 60 mi long and 15 mi deep.\n\nCaen, a major objective, was still in German hands at the end of D-Day and would not be completely captured until 21 July. The Germans had ordered French civilians other than those deemed essential to the war effort to leave potential combat zones in Normandy. Civilian casualties on D-Day and D+1 are estimated at 3,000.\n\nThe Allied victory in Normandy stemmed from several factors. German preparations along the Atlantic Wall were only partially finished; shortly before D-Day Rommel reported that construction was only 18 per cent complete in some areas as resources were diverted elsewhere. The deceptions undertaken in Operation Fortitude were successful, leaving the Germans obliged to defend a huge stretch of coastline.\n\nRommel was in Berlin and the forecasted stormy weather meant that some German other commanders and troops were not present in Normandy. The Allies achieved and maintained air supremacy, which meant that the Germans were unable to make observations of the preparations underway in Britain and were unable to interfere via bomber attacks.\n\nInfrastructure for transport in France was severely disrupted by Allied bombers and the French Resistance, making it difficult for the Germans to bring up reinforcements and supplies. Some of the opening bombardment was off-target or not concentrated enough to have any impact, but the specialised armour worked well except on Omaha (where most of it had been lost at sea), providing close artillery support for the troops as they disembarked onto the beaches. Indecisiveness and an overly complicated command structure on the part of the German high command were also factors in the Allied success.\n\n\"\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy_landings\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nOn This Day: Robert F.

George S. Patton once remarked, \"It is foolish and wrong to mourn the men who died. Rather, we should thank God that such men lived.\"\n\nThese words resonate deeply with me as we recently concluded another Memorial Day and now mark the 80th anniversary of D-Day.\n\nJune 6, 1944, stands as one of the most pivotal moments in modern history. Seven thousand Allied ships, including more than 4,000 landing craft, sailed across the English Channel in the largest armada ever assembled.\n\nAfter the 100-mile crossing, over 150,000 Allied service members stormed the beaches of Normandy, France. They joined thousands of American, British and Canadian paratroopers dropped earlier behind enemy lines to open a much-needed Western Front in Europe.\n\nAmong these courageous few were many from our state. Indeed, walk the Normandy American Cemetery, in France, and you'll find the names of over 500 Illinois World War II veterans eternally chiseled in stone, 59 of whom died on D-Day.\n\nIn total, more than 200 Illinois service members died on June 6, 1944, alongside over 4,400 American and Allied forces. Approximately 19,000 Illinois residents and more than 400,000 Americans would perish throughout the war's duration.\n\nThe 16 million American veterans of World War II are often called the Greatest Generation for their courage, sacrifice and unwavering commitment during some of the United States' darkest and most difficult days.\n\nBorn in the early 1900s and into the 1920s, they grew up under the shadow of World War 1, coming of age during the Great Depression and the rise of fascism and communism across the globe. Yet, as time marches on, we lose more of these firsthand witnesses to history.\n\nAccording to the National World War II Museum, less than 1% of American World War II veterans are still alive today. In 10 years, fewer than 1,000 may remain.\n\nIt's a loss I've experienced. When I began my nursing career with the Department of Veterans Affairs over two decades ago, World War II veterans were our most prominent group. Caring for them and learning their stories was a privilege. But now, as director of Edward Hines Jr. VA Hospital, I meet fewer and fewer every year.\n\nEach veteran lost reminds us to preserve their legacy before it is too late. We owe a debt of gratitude to these heroes, a debt that can never be fully repaid. But by honoring and supporting our veterans, we can ensure that their sacrifices continue to inspire and guide us in our pursuit of a better, more just world.\n\nThere are many ways to show support and appreciation for veterans. One of the most direct ways is volunteering with local veterans' organizations, VA facilities, or national cemeteries.\n\nYou can also celebrate our veterans' service during parades and ceremonies. The Normandy American Cemetery will livestream a D-Day 80th Anniversary celebration Thursday at 7:30 a.m.\n\nThe Greatest Generation didn't end the war on the beaches of Normandy on June 6, 1944. However, their victory marked the beginning of the end for fascist Germany, who surrendered 11 months later. Japan surrendered soon after, on Sept. 2, 1945, concluding history's largest and bloodiest conflict.\n\nOne day soon, the U.S. will lose its last member of our Greatest Generation, and the world will be a little darker for it. However, when that day comes, I'll once again reflect on General Patton's words, \"We should thank God that such men lived.\"\n\nJames Doelling is the hospital director of Edward Hines Jr. VA Hospital.\n\nThe Sun-Times welcomes letters to the editor and op-eds.

Six divisions were to land on the first day; three U.S., two British and one Canadian. Two more British divisions and one U.S. division were to follow up after the assault had cleared the way through the beach defenses.\n\nDisorganization, confusion, incomplete or faulty implementation of plans characterized the initial phases of the landings. This was especially true of the airborne landings that were badly scattered, as well as the first wave units landing on the assault beaches. To their great credit, most of the troops adapted to the disorganization. In the end, the Allies achieved their objective.\n\nThe cost in lives on D-Day was high.

The war led to the death of millions of people, both soldiers and civilians, disrupted the lives of millions of more people and led to the disruption of the economy and every other section of the society. In that war, the Normandy landings played a critical role in deciding the fate of the battle.\n\nThe Normandy landings were the landing operations and the airborne operations related to them which took place on June 6, 1944. The operations were carried out by the Allied forces of Normandy in Operation Overlord and were given the codenames D-Day and Operation Neptune. The Normandy landings are said to be history's largest seaborne invasion and gave France its freedom from the clutches of Nazi Germany. Also, it was a massive relief in starting the liberation of the rest of Western Europe and laid the foundations of the Allied victory on the Western Front.\n\nThe planning for the Normandy landings started in 1943 and the Allies did extensive military deception under Operation Bodyguard to make the Germans think that they were landing on a different date and location. However, on D-Day, the operation had to be delayed by 24 hours due to bad weather. A further postponement was not possible as Hitler gave Field Marshal Erwin Rommel the command of German forces and made preparations against the invasion. The Allied forces were commanded by Major General Dwight D. Eisenhower.\n\nOn the morning of June 6, the invasion began as the Allies deployed extensive aerial and naval bombardment and also airborne attacks. Around 24,000 American, British, and Canadian airborne troops landed and faced heavy fire from guns placed on the beaches by Axis forces, particularly Hitler. They were mines, wooden stakes, and barbed wire to thwart the invading forces. The Allies could not make much breakthrough till June 12. Since then, the Allies slowly but steadily increased their domination over the coming months. It is estimated that 4,000 to 9,000 German men lost their lives on the D-Day and the Allied forces lost at least 10,000 men.", "source": {"uri": "news9live.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News9live"}, "authors": [{"uri": "swapnajit_kundu@news9live.com", "name": "Swapnajit Kundu", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy_landings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Normandy landings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airborne_forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airborne forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Bodyguard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Operation Bodyguard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_deception", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Military deception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Overlord", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Operation Overlord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Front_(World_War_I)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Western Front (World War I)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_name", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Code name"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Europe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Western Europe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Rommel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Erwin Rommel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbed_wire", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Barbed wire"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_general", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Major general"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dwight D.

Over 4,000 Allied troops were killed during the invasion, according to records from the National D-Day Memorial Project.\n\nNow recognized as the greatest amphibious landing in history, D-Day paved the way for the Allied forces to liberate France and ultimately defeat Adolf Hitler's Germany.\n\nFor World War II veterans, though, such victories still can bring up complicated emotions.\n\n\"D-Day is a tremendous complex of responses,\" Indergand said. \"It'd be like, if you had a family, and there were eight in your family, and four of you were living and four of you were dead, you'd have tremendous relief and satisfaction that four of you were alive -- but you'd feel terrible about the other four.\n\n\"Almost all victory days are mixed,\" he added. \"They're wonderful and they're a deadly mixture, too -- all at the same time.\"\n\nIndergand spent a year as a member of the 80th Infantry and the 14th Armored Division in the European Theater of Operations, according to his Separation Qualification Record, attending intelligence briefings and preparing for battle in France.\n\n\"I was very impressed with how well the people in Normandy lived,\" Indergand said. \"I was impressed with their toughness and staying power. They had endured a tremendous amount of conflict right in their backyard.\"\n\nThe U.S. Army and Allied forces used tanks, artillery and machine guns to force the Nazis to retreat during battle, Indergand said.\n\n\"I felt closed in and cut off from the world, but I also felt that the Army and our intention of filling the world with American soldiers, which seemed to be the primary idea of both Dwight Eisenhower and Franklin Roosevelt, was a very good approach to war,\" he added. \"The more battles you fight, the more battles you can win.\"\n\nIn September 1944, Indergand suffered his first battle injury.\n\n\"We entered a French village that intelligence said was empty, but we found German troops that were still leaving,\" Indergand said. \"We met weak resistance, but there were still lots of bullets flying around. I was shot in the left leg, but it was a minor wound.\"\n\nHe spent a week in a field hospital and then returned to full duty.\n\nIndergand was injured a second time in March 1945 just outside of Paris.\n\n\"I was wounded by the explosion of an artillery shell nearby, it was a shrapnel wound in my left thigh that caused left sciatic nerve damage,\" he said.\n\nIndergand was evacuated to a field hospital in England before returning to the U.S., where he was treated at Letterman General Hospital in San Francisco. That's where he met his future wife, a Jewish woman who emigrated to the U.S. in 1939 after Nazi Germany annexed her home in Vienna, Austria.\n\n\"Surgery that was experimental at the time was performed, allowing me to recover,\" he said, adding that it took him almost three years, with two years of outpatient treatment, to recover from the nerve damage and learn how to walk again.\n\nAfter completing treatment in 1948, Indergand was discharged from the Army.\n\n\"I thought his service was amazing,\" Bob Indergand, John's 70-year-old son, who also lives in metro Denver, said. \"I have a lot of respect for that. Imagine how scary that is.\"\n\nIndergand received three medals for his service: a Bronze Star for achievement in active ground combat, a Purple Heart with an oak leaf cluster for his two injuries and a Combat Infantry Badge, recognizing that the infantryman \"continuously operated under the worst conditions,\" he said.\n\nHe was awarded the Purple Heart and Combat Infantry Badge in 1944 after his first injury. After his second injury in 1945, Indergand said he was told they were out of oak leaf clusters, which soldiers who already have Purple Hearts receive for subsequent injuries. He said he was given a piece of paper he could redeem for the award, though he later lost that.\n\nNearly 70 years passed before Indergand received the Bronze Star and oak leaf cluster he was promised.\n\nAt a luncheon in 2013, U.S. Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-California, overhead Indergand discussing the missing awards. Eshoo spoke to Indergand and collected his service number and documentation, and, in 2014, the veteran finally received the oak leaf cluster and Bronze Star.\n\n\"I was very proud to get them,\" Indergand said. \"The medals probably meant more to me when I got them so late than they would have at the time. At the time, everybody was getting medals for largely good things that were not terribly relevant. I think I appreciated them more.\"\n\nIndergand is one of the 1,910 veterans of World War II still alive and living in Colorado as of last year, out of 119,550 living American World War II veterans, according to the New Orleans National WWII Museum. Around 16 million American men and women served in the war.\n\nOn Friday, one day after the 80th anniversary of D-Day, Indergand will turn 100.\n\n\"The 80th anniversary of D-Day means everything,\" Indergand said. \"Winning World War II was essential to the future. The people who fought wanted to be there and they knew they had to win at all costs.\"", "source": {"uri": "denverpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Denver Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "julianna_o_clair@denverpost.com", "name": "Julianna O'Clair", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy_landings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Normandy landings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberation_of_France", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Liberation of France"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_D-Day_Memorial", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National D-Day Memorial"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_military_administration_in_occupied_France_during_World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "German military administration in occupied France during World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphibious_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Amphibious warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infantry", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Infantry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Corporal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Normandy"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Normandy"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adolf Hitler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airborne_forces", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Airborne forces"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Utah"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha,_Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Omaha, Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Canada"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Theater_of_Operations,_United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "European Theater of Operations, United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/14th_Armored_Division_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "14th Armored Division (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_leaf_cluster", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Oak leaf cluster"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrapnel_shell", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shrapnel shell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(projectile)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shell (projectile)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_hospital", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Field hospital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dwight D.

The World War II generation is nearly gone, with just 119,550 of the 16.4 million Americans who served during the war alive at the end of 2023. Figures for D-Day participants are harder to come by, but comparatively few of the nearly 160,000 Allied troops who landed or parachuted into France that day remain.\n\nSo, this 80th anniversary takes on even more meaning. It's not just a chance to say thank you and recall the sacrifice made by thousands who were killed or wounded. It's an opportunity to say goodbye and, perhaps more importantly, let them know we will never forget.\n\nFrance, where gratitude has never wavered, is welcoming veterans to Normandy; nearly 70 arrived courtesy of Fort Worth-based American Airlines. President Joe Biden will speak Thursday from Pointe du Hoc, the cliff that Army Rangers painstakingly climbed to help clear the way for troops on the beaches below.\n\nLet's remember and thank the World War II generation, too, for what it did when it came home. Many veterans settled in Fort Worth, staffing the important Strategic Air Command center at Carswell Air Force Base. Others built the General Dynamics planes (now Lockheed Martin) and Bell helicopters that helped secure victory in the Cold War. In so doing, they fueled the economic growth and power that our area enjoys today.\n\nIt's proper to shower the men of D-Day and all the men and women of the World War II generation with gratitude while they are here. We can honor them further by never forgetting what ordinary people did to become extraordinary heroes.\n\nAnd we must give them the ultimate tribute of pledging to meet the moment ourselves when human liberty and dignity and democracy are on the line. We can't know when or where or how that will be necessary.\n\nBut we can begin to be ready by vowing that what those brave Americans and their allies did will never be in vain.\n\nWhen the 90th anniversary of D-Day arrives, there may be no participant left to honor in person. If we carry in our hearts gratitude for the legacy of what they achieved, though, we can ensure they'll never disappear.", "source": {"uri": "star-telegram.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Fort Worth Star-Telegram"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy_landings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Normandy landings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachute", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Parachute"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_military_administration_in_occupied_France_during_World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "German military administration in occupied France during World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_history", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Military history"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomber", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bomber"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortification", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fortification"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nazism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointe_du_Hoc", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pointe du Hoc"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Rangers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Army Rangers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Airlines"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carswell_Air_Force_Base", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carswell Air Force Base"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_Air_Command", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Strategic Air Command"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Dynamics", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General Dynamics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lockheed Martin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cold War"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Helicopter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Worth,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Fort Worth, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Fort Worth, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Tug-of-War", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Tug-of-War", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 47}], "image": "https://www.star-telegram.com/latest-news/48deiw/picture289043999/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/Imagn-23455910.JPG", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628959", "eventUri": "eng-9628959", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.08235294117647063, "wgt": 116, "relevance": 1}

In his quest to rule the world, he had toppled France. Free countries, morally superior to Hitler's National Socialist German Workers' regime, had to stop Germany's aggression before it was too late.\n\nIn a shared quest to save the world from antisemitic tyranny, 133,000 troops from the United States, Canada, the British Commonwealth and an assortment of British allies stormed the beaches of Normandy, overcoming booby traps and other obstacles established to stop them. Today we honor that heroic defense of liberty, acknowledging an occasion no less significant than the Fourth of July.\n\nThis should be a solemn day of mourning for more than 4,400 Allied troops, including 2,500 Americans, who died in the D-Day offensive to save the free world from Nazi aggression. The invasion involved more than 175,000 personnel who crossed the English Channel in ships, airplanes and gliders.\n\nBy June 30, 1944, more than 850,000 men and 570,000 tons of supplies arriving in 148,000 vehicles had joined the raid, making it history's largest land, sea and ground invasion.\n\nOn this 80th anniversary, we should honor D-Day survivors -- along with other veterans of World War II -- as if we won't see them for another marquee D-Day celebration. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs estimates that only 1% of American D-Day veterans -- about 730 -- remain alive. By the 90th anniversary of D-Day, the number of survivors likely will be none.\n\nToday's D-Day veterans, most in their 90s and 100s, speak of the invasion as if it were yesterday. It has haunted them, inspired them and defined them.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nThis year's commemoration is so important that thousands of veterans from around the globe are visiting Normandy to socialize and watch reenactments of the beach landings. The Greatest Generations Foundation, based in Colorado, is paying for the costs of U.S. veterans to travel and visit the landmark.\n\nHatred has always been a bane of humanity, and it shows no sign of letting up. Just as Hitler attempted to wipe out Jews, modern antisemitic rulers want to fulfill his agenda.\n\n\"I hope that God will liberate Palestine as soon as possible, and we witness the final moments of Israel's existence and celebrate its end,\" said Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi in late 2023, who died last month in a helicopter crash.\n\nIncredibly, despite enjoying the fruits of good defeating evil in World War II, entitled college professors, naive students and paid agitators support modern anti-Jewish aggression as if they learned nothing from World War II.\n\nHumanity should hope and pray for a world that never sees World War III. Yet, a nation of free people who prioritize civil rights should always be ready, able and willing to take on tyranny before it leads to another war.\n\nTo give honor where it is due and avoid another bloodbath, let's remember the high cost of D-Day and the rewards it provided for free and peaceable people around the globe.\n\nThe Gazette Editorial Board", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com",

As we honour the memory of those who fought and died, we also pay tribute to the enduring spirit of freedom and democracy that has guided Canada's history.\n\n\"Throughout the course of the war, thousands of Canadians joined the armed forces voluntarily.

Like Memorial and Veteran's Day, the new holiday would celebrate the bravery, service, and sacrifices of American service members. But more importantly, the day would commemorate what may be America's finest hour. On June 6, 1944, the world was saved.\n\nD-Day, and the months of battle that followed it, was a triumph of will, sacrifice, and courage. Hitler was defeated. Without the success of D-Day, you might be reading this column in German, assuming, of course, that you were alive.\n\nLike most Americans, my knowledge of D-Day comes from books, documentaries, and movies. As a teenager, I remember watching The Longest Day and a TV series titled \"Combat!\" I remember reading Dwight Eisenhower's Crusade in Europe. Recently, I watched Band of Brothers. My \"take-away\" from these and other readings and watchings is that in 1944 we collectively knew what had to be done and made the necessary sacrifices to succeed.\n\nD-Day saw 160,000 troops land in Normandy, 73,000 of them Americans. They were met by 50,000 German troops. By the end of the day 2,501 Americans were dead. In total, 73,000 Allied troops were killed, and 153,000 were wounded in the full Battle of Normandy. Not calculated was the impact the battle had on the soldiers involved. Many suffered years of pain from injuries and the memories of what they experienced in the battle.\n\nHonoring the D-Day troops and what the invasion represents is particularly appropriate at a time when America arguably has lost its way. Today, America doubts its own role in the world. Leading politicians seek to abdicate America's world leadership and return to the isolationist policies that contributed to World War II. By remembering D-Day we will be reminded of the necessity of American leadership as well as its rewards.\n\nThe state of mind of America in 1944 was dramatically different than it is today. That is to be expected. A lot has happened since the end of World War II, including the Vietnam War and other conflicts where brave Americans died which are not celebrated like \"the Greatest Generation.\" That is unfortunate because everyone who served in the military deserves our respect. Even if the war they fought in did not produce a dramatic \"win\" for the United States, their service helped get us to where we are today -- still free after 248 years.\n\nThe America of today tends to downplay the positive role it has played in the world. That is unfortunate despite things in our history that we wish could have been different. The Vietnam War was a mistake made by well-intentioned people. Other parts of American history are more troubling, especially slavery and its aftermath. It is good that America recognizes these mistakes and tragedies but that doesn't mean we cannot or should not celebrate those parts of our history that help define who we are as a nation.\n\nIf Congress were to make D-Day a national holiday, it should be a day of national reflection. It should be a reminder that when America shares a vision, it can accomplish anything. That vision, of course, needs to reflect our democratic values.\n\nMore than 16 million Americans served in World War II. Fewer than 116,000 of those heroes remain alive. Wouldn't it be wonderful if the national holiday of D-Day were created while some of them could witness it?", "source": {"uri": "chestertownspy.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Chestertown Spy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "j_e_dean@chestertownspy.org", "name": "J.E.

She is a veteran advocate and travel blogger. She works at Syracuse University in media relations, and previously worked for the university's D'Aniello Institute for Veterans and Military Families (IVMF) and Office of Veteran and Military Affairs (OVMA) for six years.\n\nSgt. Kenneth H. Thayer, then in his late 20s, was called to deploy overseas during World War II. He was a member of the 71st Signal Company, a joint assault signal company for the U.S. Army.\n\nHis unit was responsible for coordinating and controlling naval gunfire and close air support for American land forces during World War II. Over his four years there, he served in France, French Moroccoand Sicily and in the Rome-Arno campaign. According to the Rome Daily Sentinel, he is believed to be the first veteran of my hometown of Rome, New York, to serve in both the European theater and the Pacific theater. He was my great uncle Kenny, and his service is always one that I admire most.\n\nMy great uncle's World War II story is just one of many that must not be forgotten. My grandfathers, Abram Van Vechten and Steve Slachta, both served in the Pacific during World War II, and I hope to find more about their service somehow like I did with my uncle. I feel it's my duty to learn as many service stories as I can to help others always remember, especially in a world today where military service is less recognized.\n\nJune 6, 2024, marks 80 years since the D-Day invasion, the landing of Allied forces in Normandy, France. Since the end of World War II, our world has experienced more wars, terrorism and mass killings, with younger generations becoming further and further out of touch from the World Wars.\n\nAs my colleague Syracuse University Vice Chancellor Mike Haynie told Fox News at the end of 2023, the younger generations are also slowly becoming less connected to war since the establishment of the all-volunteer force in 1973. In the decades following the World Wars, most people seemed to always know someone who was in a war or had a family member who was. And while many of us have grandparents and other family members who were connected to these wars, the understanding of the Greatest Generation is slowly fading from our collective memory.\n\nThis is why I'm taking time to highlight the D-Day anniversary -- as a way to inspire others to get uncomfortable by learning the war stories so we can collectively never forget. I'm focused on visiting as many World War II sites as I can.\n\nI've visited Hiroshima, Japan, the site of the world's first atomic bomb deployment; Dachau concentration camp outside of Munich, Germany, the longest-running concentration camp; and Pearl Harbor in Oahu, Hawaii, where the Japanese empire launched a surprise attack on the U.S. on Dec. 7, 1941, leading the U.S. to enter the war. I most recently visited the Normandy beaches, and, this summer, I will be going to Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp outside of Krakow, Poland -- one of the most recognized and largest concentration camps -- and Schindler's Enamel Factory, where hundreds of Jews were employed and saved by Schindler; and the house of Anne Frank in the Netherlands, where her family hid from the Nazis for about two years.\n\nI've done a lot of research and requested documents from the National Archives to see if my great uncle played a part in the D-Day invasion. He never really talked about his service until he was a lot older, and I was too young to think about asking more questions before he passed. But his service always inspired me to really look into the service and sacrifice of all of those who were part of the D-Day invasion, aka Operation Overlord, and it's something everyone should know about.\n\nIn the very early hours of June 6, 1944, American, Canadian and British troops made their landings on the Normandy beaches -- Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword. Specific to the U.S., our troops faced extreme challenges at Utah and Omaha beaches due to landing errors and intense German defense.\n\nOne example was at Pointe du Hoc, a cliff located between the Utah and Omaha beaches and not far outside the town of Sainte-M\u00e8re-\u00c9glise. The U.S. Army's 2nd Ranger Battalion had what seemed like an impossible task: to scale the 100-foot cliffs to take out the Germans. They were surprised to find the German weapons had moved inland, but they were able to locate and destroy them. According to The Army Historical Foundation, of the 2nd Ranger Battalion members who served on D-Day, 77 were killed, 152 were wounded and 38 were missing in action. Despite this, the Rangers successfully completed their mission.\n\nMy husband, Ryan (who serves in the U.S. Army), and I also stopped at La Cambe German War Cemetery in Normandy. It is crucial to remember that many German soldiers were unwilling participants, forced into the war by Adolf Hitler's regime. It's important to honor their memory as well, recognizing the tragedy on both sides, much like the current situation in Ukraine, where many Russians do not support the conflict.\n\nI'm not a scholar, and I have never served in the military. I am 35 years old, come from a military family, have done a lot of research on my grandfathers' and great uncle's WWII deployments, and as mentioned, visited some WWII sites. Every person should visit these sites to open their eyes into what these heroes went through to have a deeper appreciation for their sacrifices, as well as remembering to honor them. It is the least we can do for all they've done for us. Many of those fighting back then didn't have the privilege of refusing to become involved in a war -- a privilege that we have in the U.S. today.\n\nMy great uncle Kenny didn't have children, so family members like me must help his stories live on. These stories are becoming more and more faint as the years go by. We can't let them die, because then they die for good. For those who don't care about history or what our generations did before us, I urge you to become uncomfortable with learning what they went through and visit these sites. It's important in our uncertain world today where we never know what could happen next.\n\nWe must never forget those lives lost on June 6, 1944, and beyond.", "source": {"uri": "syracuse.com",

International Holocaust Remembrance Day takes place on January 27, the date when Auschwitz was liberated by the Red Army in 1945, while Yom Hashoah (Holocaust and Ghetto Uprising Remembrance Day) is observed on the Hebrew date of the 27th of Nisan (which falls in April or May), the day the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising began.\n\nBut there is another date, seemingly less directly connected to the Holocaust, which also urgently needs remembrance.\n\nThis Thursday June 6th, the 80th anniversary of D-Day will be commemorated in Europe. An estimated 160,000 Allied troops (including soldiers from USA, Britai%n, Canada, Free French, and other Commonwealth countries) landed in Normandy, making it the largest seaborne invasion in human history. It marked the beginning of the liberation of France and the rest of Western Europe, laying the foundations for the Allied victory on the Western Front. A true turning point in this great battle for the soul of Europe and beyond.\n\nGet The Jewish News Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Free Sign Up\n\nWhile this gallant display of mass courage was on display, the Nazis were accelerating their evil plans, systematically murdering Hungarian Jews by their thousands daily. However, without D-Day, and the successful Red Army assaults in the east already underway, the Holocaust - the greatest human crime in world history - would likely have been even worse.\n\nD-Day began soon after midnight on June 6, 1944 (after being postponed for 24 hours because of bad weather), when paratroopers landed in German-occupied France. They were followed by Allied planes and warships, before troops landed on a 50-mile stretch of coastline divided into five beaches codenamed Gold, Juno, Omaha, Sword and Utah.\n\nAlthough 4,414 Allied troops died that day, the landings were ultimately successful. A month later, the Allies liberated the vital city of Caen, and while there would be another 11 months to go before liberation, this was undoubtedly the beginning of the end for the Nazis.\n\nMajor commemorations are held every five years, and organizers say this year's event could be one of the last to feature living veterans. In an interview, Gen. Michel Delion, the CEO of the French government agency in charge of the French commemoration efforts, said: \"We are perfectly aware that for these centenarians, this is maybe the last chance to return to the beaches where they landed, where they fought and where their brothers-in-arms fell.\" During the event, national ceremonies are held at the American, British, and Canadian cemeteries, while the French organize the main international commemoration, alongside other local events.\n\nJust like the Holocaust, for years veterans have played a key role in telling the story of D-Day, doing a better job than any textbook could. Sadly, also like the Holocaust, only a few of the Allied troops are still alive to tell their tales.\n\nAccording to statistics from the US Department of Veteran Affairs, out of the 16.4 million Americans who served in World War II, fewer than 100,000 are expected to be alive by the end of the year. Most of them are thought to be in their late nineties, meaning that soon there will be no surviving veterans left. It is estimated that over 4,000 of the Allied soldiers who participated in D-Day were Jewish, and 52 of them died.\n\nExpressing sentiment that is very familiar to our annual March of the Living in Poland, the military historian Ben Brands recently noted, \"People are realizing this generation is passing and they're passing rapidly now, and it's important to keep their stories alive, to keep the memories of those who died and are buried at Normandy, but also those who fought and survived because they can no longer be with us for that much longer to tell these stories.\"\n\nWorld War II may seem like ancient history to some, but with antisemitism rampant once again, its significance is greater than ever. Indeed, once again, the free world is being called to stand up with courage and unite around its blessed values of freedom and tolerance, democracy and human rights.\n\nD-Day - and the courage and unity it embodies, in the face of the most horrific evil - deserves to take its place alongside International Holocaust Memorial Day and Yom HaShoah as one of the most important dates commemorating the defeat the Nazis and the triumph of freedom.\n\nAs Jewish educators, it is therefore incumbent upon us to work hard to transmit D-Day's spirit of courage and hope to the next generations.",

A few months shy of his 98th birthday, Hita was a paratrooper who made 39 jumps during the war, mainly in the Pacific region. But it was the events on D-Day that inspired him to serve.\n\nBorn in Puerto Rico, he always loved what America represented, especially in the summer of 1944. While visiting his grandfather in New York, they went to the movies -- and back then, movie theaters gave updates on the war before the featured attractions.\n\nREAD: D-Day 2024: Bay Area veterans travel to Normandy for 80th anniversary\n\n\"They showed footage of the invasion and reported how we had heavy losses, but our soldiers didn't give up and kept fighting,\" he said passionately.\n\nThat's the moment his patriotic heart awakened. He went straight to the Army recruiting office the next day and signed up.\n\n\"When I saw those young kids struggling but determined, I said, 'I want to be one of those.' That's the reason I joined the Army,\" he told FOX 13's Mark Wilson, who is traveling in France with him and about two dozen other veterans to the D-Day anniversary memorial events.\n\nREAD: D-Day veterans return to Normandy for 80th anniversary, share memories and messages for future generations\n\nHita did have one request from Wilson before he sat down for their interview: he insisted on wearing his uniform. That's how devoted he is to his country.\n\nHis service was eventful. The day he joined the Army, they were asking for volunteers to be paratroopers.\n\n\"I raised my hand, and I didn't know what a paratrooper was. I just came from Puerto Rico, so I could hardly speak English,\" he said with a chuckle.\n\nBefore he knew it, he was leaping out of C-47s over Japan, where the Japanese were waiting for him.\n\nREAD: Tampa veterans fly to France ahead of D-Day 80th anniversary commemorations\n\nHita made 39 jumps and one in particular will remain with him forever, as will a particular knife. It was a gift his comrade, his friend, gave him as he lay dying from a Japanese bullet.\n\n\"He took the knife, and he gave it to me. Then he died right in my hands,\" Hita said. \"He gave me his knife right before he died.\"\n\nWhile Hita is looking forward to walking the sandy beaches of Normandy to reflect on his role and the many others across the globe who changed the course of European history, there's one four-letter word he doesn't want to hear.\n\nREAD: Army veteran turns young lives around at Pasco County school\n\n\"I am not a hero. A hero is the one who died that tried to do their best and got killed,\" he said with a tear in his eye. \"I'm lucky that I could run.\"\n\nA prideful life with no regrets and a love of country thicker than the wool that covers his heart.\n\n\"I'm glad I went and fought for this country. I love America. I love this country,\" Hita shared. \"If I got to go back again, I'd do it. Believe me.\"\n\nHita still jumps. He completed his 50th jump on his 95th birthday, and he promises it's not his last.", "source": {"uri": "fox13news.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 13 Tampa Bay"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mark_wilson@fox13news.com", "name": "Mark Wilson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy_landings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Normandy landings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Bay Area"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hita,_\u014cita", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Hita, \u014cita"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Hita, \u014cita"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paratrooper", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paratrooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movie_theater", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Movie theater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Normandy"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Normandy"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adolf Hitler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pacific Ocean"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasco_County,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pasco County, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pasco County, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Puerto Rico"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Germany"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Germany"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Japan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_C-47_Skytrain", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Douglas C-47 Skytrain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wool", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wool"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "English language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tampa, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Camps/Day", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Military", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Military", "wgt": 12}], "image": "https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox13news.com/www.fox13news.com/content/uploads/2024/06/1280/720/hector-hita-main-image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628959", "eventUri": "eng-9628959", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Normandy"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 111, "relevance": 1}

He let us go through his backyard when we were setting up a basketball hoop.\n\nWhat I did not know about Mr. Burke until years later, long after we had moved away, was he was a hero in the D-Day invasion of World War II. On June 6, 1944 United States and Allied soldiers stormed the beaches of France to liberate Europe from Nazi German occupation. Mr. Milton Burke was one of the first U.S. soldiers on D-Day to reach Omaha Beach, a crucial landing zone for Allied forces.\n\nMilton Burke's 2014 obituary reads \"He had the military distinction of being among those in the first hour, first wave invasion at Omaha Beach on D Day, June 6, 1944 and was the recipient of the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart.\"\n\nWith German forces firing their guns on the Allied troops arriving on the beaches below, D-Day was the most dangerous mission. Many U.S. and Allied soldiers lost their lives in the initial attack to seize control of the beaches and climb the cliffs to knock out German guns.\n\nMy father Vincent could see how much loss there was when his 786th Army engineers unit arrived on Omaha Beach. The 786th engineers job was to clear mines so gasoline storage depots could be set up to fuel tanks and vehicles.\n\nIn his personal memoir my father wrote \"Before we started to work we went down to the water's edge, carefully sticking to the cleared path, and saw a sea of packs lying on the beach, each belonging to a dead or wounded soldier. ..... How many packs were lying on the beach? I would say hundreds. Walking among those packs gives an eerie feeling and you cannot help but wonder what happened there on June 6, and how our soldiers overcame the enemy strongholds and moved inland.\"\n\nMy father was injured on Omaha Beach when a mine went off nearby and shrapnel struck his leg. He was hospitalized and received a purple heart.\n\nThink of all the families that suffered loss or injury and the sacrifice they made for the D-Day invasion to succeed. It was the heroics of all the U.S. and Allied soldiers that changed the world.\n\nAs President Ronald Reagan said to veterans at the 40th D-Day anniversary in 1984 \"you risked everything here. Why? Why did you do it? What impelled you to put aside the instinct for self-preservation and risk your lives to take these cliffs? What inspired all the men of the armies that met here? We look at you, and somehow we know the answer. It was faith and belief; it was loyalty and love.\"\n\nNow 80 years later we have challenges to face today, but D-Day reminds us that if we are united we can overcome anything. It was Americans united with allies that defeated the Nazi German forces and won the war.\n\nD-Day's ultimate goal was to create a world of peace where people could live free from aggression, terror and dictators. As the Supreme Allied Commander on D-Day, Gen. Dwight Eisenhower believed we must never give up on that goal.\n\nEisenhower said \"The courage, devotion and faith which brought us through the perils of war will inevitably bring us success in our unremitting search for peace, security and freedom.\"\n\nAs we remember D-Day let's bravely move forward to build that world of peace that so many have sacrificed to obtain.\n\nWilliam Lambers is the author of The Road to Peace and partnered with the U.N.

Yet their heroism will never be forgotten.\n\nOne who was there and survived was Walter D. Ehlers, who lived in Buena Park until his death in 2014. Writing for us in 1997 on the 53rd anniversary of D-Day, he remembered, \"My brother had returned from the hospital in Africa. At the embarkation was the last time I saw him. He was killed in the D-Day landings on Omaha Beach.\"\n\nHe continued, \"I went on to receive several decorations including three Purple Hearts and the Medal of Honor. I am a survivor. My brother and many of my close friends paid the supreme sacrifice. Because of them, hundreds of thousands of them, you and I are here today.\"\n\nBeginning with his occupation of the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia in 1938, followed by his invasion of Poland in September 1939, Hitler had enslaved almost all of continental Europe, imposing tyranny and mass death, including the Holocaust deaths of 6 million Jews. But his doom was sealed when he declared war on the United States on Dec. 11, 1941. That brought our vast Arsenal of Democracy and 16 million troops into the war against him.\n\nUsing the United Kingdom as a base, 73,000 American, 60,000 British and 15,000 Canadian troops trained for months before the June 6, 1944 invasion. It never was a sure thing penetrating Hitler's \"Atlantic Wall.\" The weather that day crossing the English Channel was harsh. Supreme Allied Commander Dwight D. Eisenhower even prepared a speech taking responsibility for a potential failure, which said, \"any blame or fault ... is mine alone.\"\n\nFortunately, the invasion succeeded, but at an immense cost. Time magazine tallied more than 2,500 Americans killed, plus 1,900 British and Canadians. Over the entire Battle of Normandy, codename Operation Overlord, which lasted until Aug. 30, 73,000 Allied troops were killed and 155,000 wounded. Freedom has a price in blood.\n\nThe invasion led to another 11 months of intense combat until Hitler killed himself in a Berlin bunker on April 30, 1945, followed by Germany surrendering on May 7.\n\nIt's not known how many D-Day veterans survive today. But 66 of them flew over to France for the 80th anniversary observance on \"an honor flight aboard a chartered Boeing 787 provided by American Airlines,\" reported USA Today. The youngest is 95, the oldest 107. And the average age is 100.8. It's likely the last time they will pay remembrance to the comrades who fell next to them on the beachheads codenamed Omaha Beach and Utah Beach.\n\nThe beaches secured, the troops moved inland to begin the long slog of liberation, first of France, then on into Nazi Germany. For America, the final toll in both Europe and the Pacific was 405,399 dead and 670,846 wounded.\n\nIt's estimated only 1% of the 16 million American men and women who served in the U.S. military during World War II remain alive. Their heroism always will be remembered so long as the love of liberty remains in the hearts of men and women.", "source": {"uri": "ocregister.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Orange County Register"}, "authors": [{"uri": "editorial_board@ocregister.com", "name": "Editorial Board", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy_landings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Normandy landings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Overlord", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Operation Overlord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Adolf Hitler"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United Kingdom"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha_Beach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Omaha Beach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_Honor", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Medal of Honor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_Heart", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Purple Heart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Africa"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Holocaust"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_declaration_of_war_against_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "German declaration of war against the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Wall", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Wall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Allied_Commander", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Allied Commander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudetenland", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sudetenland"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_Poland", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Invasion of Poland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czechoslovakia", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Czechoslovakia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Czechoslovakia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Serbia and montenegro"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Europe", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Continental Europe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dwight D.

He let us go through his backyard when we were setting up a basketball hoop.\n\nWhat I did not know about Mr. Burke until years later, long after we had moved away, was that he was a hero in the D-Day invasion of World War II. On June 6, 1944, United States and Allied soldiers stormed the beaches of France to liberate Europe from Nazi German occupation. Mr. Milton Burke was one of the first U.S. soldiers on D-Day to reach Omaha Beach, a crucial landing zone for Allied forces.\n\nMilton Burke's 2014 obituary reads: \"He had the military distinction of being among those in the first hour, first wave invasion at Omaha Beach on D Day, June 6, 1944 and was the recipient of the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart.\"\n\nWith German forces firing their guns on the Allied troops arriving on the beaches below, D-Day was the most dangerous mission. Many U.S. and Allied soldiers lost their lives in the initial attack to seize control of the beaches and climb the cliffs to knock out German guns.\n\nMy father Vincent could see how much loss there was when his 786th Army engineers unit arrived on Omaha Beach. The 786th engineers job was to clear mines so gasoline storage depots could be set up to fuel tanks and vehicles.\n\nIn his personal memoir my father wrote: \"Before we started to work we went down to the water's edge, carefully sticking to the cleared path, and saw a sea of packs lying on the beach, each belonging to a dead or wounded soldier. ... How many packs were lying on the beach? I would say hundreds. Walking among those packs gives an eerie feeling and you cannot help but wonder what happened there on June 6, and how our soldiers overcame the enemy strongholds and moved inland.\"\n\nMy father was injured on Omaha Beach when a mine went off nearby and shrapnel struck his leg. He was hospitalized and received a purple heart.\n\nThink of all the families that suffered loss or injury and the sacrifice they made for the D-Day invasion to succeed. It was the heroics of all the U.S. and Allied soldiers that changed the world.\n\nAs President Ronald Reagan said to veterans at the 40th D-Day anniversary in 1984: \"You risked everything here. Why? Why did you do it? What impelled you to put aside the instinct for self-preservation and risk your lives to take these cliffs? What inspired all the men of the armies that met here? We look at you, and somehow we know the answer. It was faith and belief; it was loyalty and love.\"\n\nNow 80 years later, we must keep that faith and spirit alive. We have challenges to face today, but D-Day reminds us that if we are united we can overcome anything. It was Americans united with allies that defeated the Nazi German forces and won the war.\n\nD-Day's ultimate goal was to create a world of peace where people could live free from aggression, terror and dictators. As the Supreme Allied Commander on D-Day, Gen. Dwight Eisenhower believed we must never give up on that goal. We must show the same courage for peace that soldiers did on D-day.\n\nEisenhower said, \"The courage, devotion and faith which brought us through the perils of war will inevitably bring us success in our unremitting search for peace, security and freedom.\"\n\nAs we remember D-Day, let's bravely move forward to build that world of peace that so many have sacrificed to obtain.", "source": {"uri": "bangordailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bangor Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omaha_Beach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Omaha Beach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Allied_Commander", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Allied Commander"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Burke", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Edmund Burke"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy_landings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Normandy landings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Plain_Dealer", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Plain Dealer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsweek", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newsweek"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_Heart", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Purple Heart"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andover,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Andover, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Andover, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Corps_of_Engineers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Army Corps of Engineers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Star_Medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bronze Star Medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tank"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gasoline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_mine", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Naval mine"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictator", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dictator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dwight D.

To commemorate the milestone anniversary, the organization Forever Young Veterans took local surviving D-Day veterans back to the battle site, flying out a group from Philadelphia International Airport earlier this week.\n\n\"It's an honor to be able to come here, and celebrate the 80th anniversary, in honor of the soldiers who lost their lives during the invasion,\" said World War II veteran Andrew Tim Kiniry.\n\nKiniry is 102 years old, and he's made the pilgrimage back to his former battlegrounds where he served as a medic, caring for wounded soldiers. He landed on June 16, 10 days after the Normandy campaign began on D-Day, with the 45th Evacuation Hospital.\n\n\"Today I plan on, and I know we are going to Omaha Beach, maybe walk on the sand, up the hill if possible,\" Kiniry said.\n\nD-Day led to the liberation of France and Europe. It's no surprise that as our veterans walked through the streets of Normandy, people showed them the utmost respect. A woman approached Kiniry and thanked him for his service, shaking his hand.\n\nAnother World War II veteran, 100-year-old May Brill, has made it her life mission to make sure women veterans are remembered.\n\n\"You take one day at a time,\" is Brill's life motto.\n\nAt 20 years old, she enlisted with the WAVES, a branch of the U.S. Naval Reserve for women. Although she worked side-by-side with men, she said women never receive any credit.\n\n\"Everything the men had to do in the Navy. We worked together in supplying the Pacific fleet and the Pacific bases. And we supplied them with everything that they needed,\" Brill said.\n\nWomen's service was recognized, Brill said.\n\n\"After two years when I was discharged they said, oh good you put in two years. ...

Code-named \"Operation Overlord,\" the invasion involved 156,000 Allied troops, half of them Americans, who launched a bold assault on five German-occupied and heavily fortified beaches. Morning wire sat down with Michael Reagan, son of America's beloved 40th President Ronald Reagan, who famously traveled to Normandy four decades ago to honor the brave soldiers who stormed those beaches.\n\n* * *\n\nJOHN: Joining us now to discuss the 80th anniversary of D-Day is Michael Reagan. Michael, thank you for coming on.\n\nMICHAEL: Well, because this anniversary would be the last big anniversary where anyone who came out of a plane on D-Day 80 years ago is going to be present there in Normandy, France. There are a million people there right now. There are 46,000 people there right now guarding the million people and the president who's going to be arriving. It is a huge, huge day, this 80th anniversary of D-Day. I've been there on two or three occasions. They were large, but this one is humongous.\n\nJOHN: Now, many have commented that today's youth and military look a lot different than the generation that stormed the beaches. What aspects of the Greatest Generation are missing that you think need to be brought back into today's culture?\n\nMICHAEL: I think today's youth would dive out of planes to save the world as these did back 80 years ago. My problem is the people who are in school who don't even know why D-Day exists. Not too many years ago I played golf with a young man, and I was invited to Normandy to raise the American flag at the American Cemetery. I was telling him I was headed to France to do that. And he asked me, \"Why is there an American cemetery in France?\" He had no idea, no concept. I looked at him and I said, \"Did you think D-Day is when your report card came out?\" He had no concept why there was a cemetery in France. If you run a survey of high school kids today, probably even college kids, and ask them about D-Day -- they have no idea about D-Day, why we have a cemetery there, why it existed and why we saved that part of the world and actually saved the whole world. That is the thing that bothers me. Not the ones who are in the military now, who have given their lives, their arms, pieces of their body and what have you. The ones who are really scary to me are the kids in school who have no concept why and what we've done.\n\nJOHN: And what could be done to remedy this? How can we best go about educating today's students on World War II and the Holocaust?\n\nMICHAEL: You know how I learned it? I learned it from my dad. Sitting in the right front seat of a station wagon any given Saturday morning. Picking me up from my mom's house. Driving me out to the ranch in Malibu. You all remember the ranch dad had during the presidency. This is the ranch I grew up on in Malibu. And regaling me -- Songs, military, Army. Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard -- and telling me about this country, telling me about how great it was and is, telling me stories. Too often we parents, conservatives also, leave it up to the schools to educate our kids. Well, how's that working out? It's not working out. So we've got to take it back ourselves, homeschool the kids or at least educate them on this D-Day, this 80th anniversary, and what these people were willing to do and willing to give to save the world.\n\nJOHN: You mentioned your father. Can you explain your father's significance around recognizing formally D-Day?\n\nMICHAEL: Well, it's interesting because President Biden is going to Normandy to speak on D-Day, but it was my father 40 years ago who was the first president to actually go to Normandy on D-Day and speak as he did.\n\nJOHN: Right, a truly historic moment in 1984. Here's a bit of that famous speech:\n\nWhen men like Private Zanata and all our Allied Forces stormed the beaches of Normandy 40 years ago they came not as conquerors but as liberators when these troops swept across the French Countryside and into the forests of Belgium and Luxembourg they came not to take but to return what had been wrongly seized. When our forces marched into Germany they came not to prey on a brave and defeated people but to nurture the seeds of democracy among those who yearn to be free again and we salute them.\n\nMICHAEL: I would also suggest going to YouTube and pulling up dad's speech at Pointe du Hoc, about the boys at Pointe du Hoc, and watch those videos. The cliff these kids climbed at 17 -- some lied about their age at 16-, 17-, 18-years-old -- going up these cliffs with machine gun fire, firing down at them. Listen to that speech. He was the first president to speak on D-Day in Normandy, France, and now every president since my father has followed suit and been in Normandy on D-Day to speak.\n\nJOHN: The education of young conservatives continues through the efforts of the Reagan Library and the Reagan Ranch. Is that the legacy of your father?\n\nMICHAEL: Absolutely right. The library does a great job. Big events, like celebrating the 20th anniversary of my dad's passing this week. Of course, the 40th anniversary of him going to Normandy. What they do there, the scholarship programs that they have there. I go there so often, I'm probably there once a month, I take people on tours, I play docent for a day, if you will. I love doing it. They refer to me at the library as the prequel because I have stories to tell behind the stories that they tell, which is great. I work a lot with the Young America's Foundation, who bought the ranch back in 1998. I'll be speaking to 200 high school students at the Ranch Center in Santa Barbara on the 19th of this month. They'll be able to walk in the footsteps of my father, see the building. The ranch house is exactly the way it was the last time my dad was there. He didn't know he wasn't going back because of Alzheimer's, and Young America's Foundation has done a phenomenal job of taking care of it. They now have bought the boyhood home in Illinois, they're in charge of the home. He was born in Tampico, Illinois, and they bring kids from the Midwest -- all over the world, actually -- to come in and learn about my father. That's where the legacy is. It's through the Young America's Foundation, and the ranch, and the homes, and the, and the Reagan library, with what his accomplishments were prior to becoming president, but also as president. If you haven't been to any of those places, you need to go.\n\nJOHN: And why do you think it's important for younger generations to understand who Ronald Reagan was, and what do you think they need to know about him and his beliefs?\n\nMICHAEL: The humility. We've lost humility in this country. Nobody's humble anymore. One of my dad's greatest lines was, don't worry who gets the credit. You can accomplish so many things if you don't worry who gets the credit. And today there's too many people taking credit and not giving credit. I mean, look at what he accomplished with Mikhail Gorbachev, because he was willing to give him credit. He knew he had to build up Mikhail Gorbachev in Russia in order to ultimately get what he needed, which is the Berlin Wall coming down. He had to work with many people to do that. You talked about this country with leadership and where we are, but there are no leaders in the world. There are no leaders like Margaret Thatcher, V\u00e1clav Havel, Helmut Kohl, Mikhail Gorbachev, Pope John Paul. None of those people exist today. Dad found a way to work with all of them to accomplish ending the Cold War and bringing down the Berlin Wall. Through my Reagan Legacy Foundation, (ReaganLegacyFoundation.org) we have a scholarship program for the kids that serve on the USS Ronald Reagan. We provide them scholarships, not only for them but for their family members at home waiting for them, trying to get a better education. We have a brick project. You can go online and purchase a brick for 250 bucks with tax deductible, 501(c)(3), put a name on it. Or, if you don't donate the money to the foundation, we'll put the name of someone who dove out of a plane in the European Theater 80 years ago, and we'll honor them with a brick at Saint-M\u00e8re-\u00c9glise , Normandy, France, which is the first town freed by America on D-Day at 4:00 AM in the morning. So, go there and see what we're doing. If you really want to get involved, that's the way to get involved.\n\nJOHN: Final question, have you seen the new Reagan film starring Dennis Quaid?\n\nMICHAEL: No. There's a big preview of it on August 20th here in Hollywood, and I think it opens on Labor Day weekend.\n\nJOHN: Are you excited or nervous about watching it?\n\nMICHAEL: I'm always nervous when I see somebody play my dad. I've known Mark Joseph forever, So I trust him, but I always get nervous. My family will be there on the 20th of August to see the whole thing.", "source": {"uri": "dailywire.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Wire"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Peters also shared the story of his father's military service in France during World War II, where he met and married Peters' mother. Peters' father, Herb Peters, served as a First Lieutenant in the U.S. Army in France following the invasion of Normandy, and his mother, Madeleine Vignier, grew up in Reims, France and lived under the difficult conditions of Nazi occupation. Madeleine Vignier Peters' oral history of her experience during World War II was recorded for the National World War II Museum in New Orleans, Louisiana, and can be viewed by clicking here.\n\n\"Today is a very important day in history. 80 years ago, Allied soldiers stormed the beaches of Normandy to liberate France and all of Europe from Nazi occupation,\"Peters said. \"It is an important part of history. But it is also an important part of my family history. My father served during World War II. He did not invade the beaches on D-Day, but he did deploy four months later across Omaha Beach which was the center of the American force attack.\"\n\n\"But it's not just my father, it's also my mother. My mother was a young French girl growing up in France, and was forced to live under Nazi occupation for several years,\" Peters continued.\n\n\"Something that I will always take the heart is to remember what people went through in that horrible war. The sacrifice that people went through,\" Peters continued. \"It reminds me in an incredibly personal way, from the stories from both my mother and father, that our freedoms, our democracy, our liberties, should never, ever be taken for granted. We should all remember that as we take our days each day at a time, we are literally standing on the shoulders of men and women who have gone through tremendous hardship to fight for and to protect the freedoms that we love so much.\"\n\nOn June 6th, 1944, more than 160,000 Allied troops landed along a 50-mile stretch of heavily fortified French coastline to fight Nazi Germany on the beaches of Normandy, France. More than 5,000 ships and 13,000 aircraft supported the D-Day invasion, and by day's end, the Allied Forces gained a foothold in Continental Europe. This operation, known as D-Day, was the largest amphibious invasion in military history and ultimately the turning point in World War II that led to the Allied Forces' victory.\n\nClick HERE for video of Senator Peters' remarks. Below is the text as delivered:\n\n\"Today is a very important day in history. 80 years ago, Allied soldiers stormed the beaches of Normandy to liberate France and all of Europe from Nazi occupation.\n\n\"It is an important part of history. But it is also an important part of my family history. This is very personal to me.\n\n\"My father served during World War II. He did not invade the beaches on D-Day, but he did deploy four months later across Omaha Beach which was the center of the American force attack.\n\n\"He walked across that beach after being dropped off from a landing craft to begin his service in Europe as an Army lieutenant in the Signal Corps.\n\n\"He talked about what that meant to him and his fellow soldiers as they walked across the beach in a very solemn march because they understood the incredible sacrifice of the men who died on that beach, as he then went inland to continue the war effort across Europe.\n\n\"But it's not just my father, it's also my mother. My mother was a young French girl growing up in France, and was forced to live under Nazi occupation for several years.\n\n\"He met her during the war. And her stories of living under Nazi occupation are particularly powerful. I mean, one that I will always remember is when she talked about how they were evacuating as the Germans were coming across the border into her northern French town, and they had to evacuate.\n\n\"She remembers very vividly the evacuation and how afraid they were as they were walking on the road heading south away from the invasion. But as they were walking south, north were French soldiers marching north to head to the front.\n\n\"And while they were doing that, German Luftwaffe fighter aircraft attack that column, attacking those soldiers, but of course, civilians, like my mother were there as well. They had to jump in the ditch and get away from the machine gunfire. In fact, a truck that carried a family just ahead of them was hit by a bomb and exploded and everyone was killed.\n\n\"And then after much, much hardship, they did eventually get back to their town, and found it occupied by the Nazis and had to live several years under that oppression and she has all sorts of stories.\n\n\"My father then met her. They fell in love. They got married and she came back to the United States. But it is something that I will always take the heart is to remember what people went through in that horrible war, the sacrifice that people went through. And it reminds me in an incredibly personal way from the stories from both my mother and father, that our freedoms, our democracy, our liberties, should never ever be taken for granted. And we should all remember that as we take our days each day at a time we are literally standing on the shoulders of men and women who have gone through tremendous hardship to fight for and to protect the freedoms that we love so much.\n\n\"And on this day, this is a day for us to all just take a little moment of time to think about the sacrifices that people have made so that we can enjoy the freedoms and liberties that we have in this country.\n\n\"And we have to realize that we can never give up that fight. It's always threatened. But if we stay strong, we'll continue to be a strong Republic and a strong country for years to come.\"", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title":

The band's division was one of the hardest hit on D-Day, suffering over 1,000 casualties at Omaha Beach.\n\nA formal procession is scheduled for 11:00 a.m., in which Fletcher and his fellow veterans will take part, and following that, the museum will host an open house exhibition in the afternoon featuring the museum's \"Living History Corps,\" a group of reenactors staging interactive events from D-Day.\n\nThe first of the two days of D-Day commemoration also will include a keynote lecture from Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Rick Atkinson, whose works include the Liberation Trilogy covering the Allied Powers in the Second World War.\n\nThe symposium on Friday in the museum's Liberation Pavilion will focus on the defeat of Nazism in Europe and the lessons learned, said Maggie Hartley, director of public engagement at the museum.\n\n\"It is really an opportunity to remember what happened on D-Day but also to educate about what happened after the beaches,\" she said. That includes special talks on the two-month campaign after D-Day through Normandy and other parts of France to finally liberate Paris on August 19, 1944.\n\nThe Liberation Pavilion opened in November. It was the seventh and final major portion of the $420 million museum project that had grown over two decades from the initial $1 million exhibition focused only on D-Day. The project was the brainchild of historians Nick Mueller and Stephen Ambrose and celebrates its 24th anniversary this year.\n\nAnother battle\n\nThe D-Day action was not Fletcher's first landing of the war. He also survived the Nazi's shore guns as a crewman on the battleship U.S.S. New York, which provided support for the Allied invasion of North Africa, Operation Torch, on November 8, 1942. Later, he was also in combat against German coastal artillery near Casablanca.\n\nFletcher, whose family had survived the Great Depression as sharecroppers in Sherburne, Pointe Coupee Parish, joined the Navy at age 17, three weeks after the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor.\n\n\"Three weeks of boot camp and the next day I was on the Battleship New York,\" he said. \"Talk about a change for someone who the biggest thing I'd ever been on was a pirogue boat.\"\n\nFletcher's story is one that has been preserved by the museum in interactive recordings enhanced by artificial intelligence that allow visitors to question veterans about their experiences. The collection, called \"Voices from the Front Line\" was curated by the museum's multimedia historian Hannah Dailey.\n\nKim Guise, the museum's head curator, said there are other recently-acquired D-Day highlights that she hopes visitors will check out.\n\nThey include the Medal of Honor citation for Walter Ehlers, who fought a series of actions in Normandy on June 9th and 10th under heavy German fire. The Forbes Rare and Iconic Gallery, which opened in March, also exhibits the burial flag of Ehlers' brother, Roland, who died on Omaha beach on D-Day.\n\nFor Fletcher, he came home to Louisiana after the war. He worked for a chemical plant near Baton Rouge for more than two decades until the fumes drove him to instead use his carpentry skills and become a furniture restorer. He competed in the National Senior Games -- known as the Senior Olympics -- for 12 years until he was 84.\n\n\"I have always been thankful that not a soul got a scratch in either ship I was on despite shells falling all around us,\" he said. \"Man, we had some experiences over there.\"", "source": {"uri": "nola.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NOLA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tony_mcauley@nola.com", "name": "Tony McAuley", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy_landings", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Normandy landings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah_Beach", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Utah Beach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nazism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_National_WWII_Museum", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The National WWII Museum"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LCVP_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LCVP (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Wall", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlantic Wall"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submarine_chaser", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Submarine chaser"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Overlord", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Operation Overlord"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4th_Infantry_Division_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "4th Infantry Division (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastal_artillery", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coastal artillery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_name", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Code name"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrapnel_shell", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shrapnel shell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deck_(ship)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deck (ship)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veteran", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Veteran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Navy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nazi Germany"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anti-aircraft warfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Army"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Army_National_Guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Virginia Army National Guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Atkinson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rick Atkinson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Europe"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sainte-Marie-du-Mont,_Manche", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sainte-Marie-du-Mont, Manche"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Sainte-Marie-du-Mont, Manche"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_E._Ambrose", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen E.

He lost both his legs as a result and passed away when I was 11 due to his injuries.\n\n\"This anniversary is always an important moment to reflect on the strength of our country when we unite, and we must never forget those who answered the call.\"", "source": {"uri": "foreignaffairs.co.nz", "dataType": "news", "title": "foreignaffairs.co.nz"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mil_osi_publisher@foreignaffairs.co.nz", "name": "Mil-Osi Publisher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy_landings", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Normandy landings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "World War II"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_of_World_War_II_in_Europe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "End of World War II in Europe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "France"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "France"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Cao_Dai", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Cao Dai", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/History/On_This_Day_in_History", "label": "dmoz/Society/History/On This Day in History", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Strength_Sports/Tug-of-War", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Strength Sports/Tug-of-War", "wgt": 12}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9628959", "eventUri": "eng-9628959", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 104, "relevance": 1}

He was only 21 and he said: 'Not today.' He picked up the grenade and swiftly threw it back,\" Trudeau said.\n\nBut he said that William Cameron, a 100-year-old Canadian veteran, died just before he was to return to France.\n\nHis daughter described \"just how much he had been looking forward to being here,\" Trudeau said.\n\n\"His bags have been packed for weeks.

Two other Texas Republicans -- U.S. Reps. Dan Crenshaw, a decorated former Navy Seal from Houston, and Ronny Jackson, a former Navy physician from Amarillo -- also plan to jump.\n\nSelf made a similar jump in Normandy in 1993, when there were more World War II veterans alive. This week's celebration may be the last major event involving veterans who participated in the June 6, 1944, landing, one of the most pivotal moments in World War II. Dozens of D-Day participants -- ranging in age from 96 to 107, according to news accounts -- are expected to attend the commemoration in France. About 100,000 of the 16.4 million Americans who served in World War II are alive today.\n\n\"It's important that we recognize that this will probably be the last big celebration with these veterans,\" Self said.\n\nThe D-Day landings in Normandy were a massive allied operation to liberate France and Western Europe from Germany and the Axis powers. More than 4,400 Allied troops died on D-Day, including 2,500 Americans. The D-Day operation was the largest land, air and sea invasion in military history and considered the turning point in World War II.\n\nAs part of this year's commemoration, a congressional delegation will visit the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial, where many of the Americans who died during the assault are buried.\n\nSelf said he has a message for any D-Day veterans he encounters: \"I'm going to say thank you. I cannot imagine what they went through.\"\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nSelf said he'll make his solo jump over Mont Saint-Michel carrying two medals belonging to Starlin Lee Click, a World War II Army veteran who received a Purple Heart and Bronze Star for his service. Self will also carry a portrait of Glenn Hubbard Stevens of Anna. A member of the 507th parachute infantry regiment of the 82nd Airborne Division, Stevens died in action on D-Day.\n\n\"We all need to honor and remember what happened,\" Self said. \"It was one of the greatest battles in history.\"\n\nSelf's parachute jump is a reenactment, he said. He'll wear a World War II paratrooper uniform and jump from a C-47 military transport plane. He's had two practice jumps.\n\nThe former Collin County judge was elected to Congress in 2022. He said he hopes the D-Day memorials will help bring Americans together.\n\n\"We need to remember our shared history,\" he said. \"It was truly the Greatest Generation.

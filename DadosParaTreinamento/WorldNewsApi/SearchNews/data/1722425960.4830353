Russia\u2019s War On Ukraine: News And Information From Ukraine These Are The Likely Democratic Presidential Candidates If Biden Drops Out\u2014As Rough Debate Prompts Calls To Stand Down WWE SmackDown Winners And Grades Cody Rhodes, Team RKO Brawl With Bloodline In MSG SmackDown from Madison Square Garden opened with Cody Rhodes, Randy Orton and Kevin Owens brawling with Solo Sikoa, Tama Tonga and Tanga Loa. No sign of Jacob Fatu just yet. The babyfaces brawled with The Bloodline right into the commercial break, but not before Kevin Owens paid homage to Kofi Kingston in MSG with a Swanton Bomb over one of the Tongans through a table. There was still chaos coming out of the break with Nick Aldis and security trying to calm things down. Fans went even crazier as Randy Orton hit an RKO on a security guard and the babyfaces ran wild on security. Rhodes, Orton and Owens cut spirited promos on The Bloodline, whipping NYC into a frenzy. Aldis returned, this time with the NYPD. Fans booed as the babyfaces finally exited peacefully. An awesome opening segment. MSG Opening Segment Grade: A Tiffany Stratton Def. Candice LeRae and Jade Cargill Fans were into Jade Cargill, particularly when she put on an impressive display of strength at the expense of Tiffany Stratton and Candice LeRae. Of course, they were most into Tiffany Stratton. Nia Jax hit the ring but Bianca Belair evened the odds. Unfortunately for Jade, Indi Hartwell shoved Cargill into the ring post and knocked her out. This opened the door for Stratton to pin LeRae with the Prettiest Moonsault Ever to a huge pop. Tiffany Stratton vs. Candice LeRae and Jade Cargill Grade: B LA Knight Def. Logan Paul And Santos Escobar In a perfect example of long-term trolling, Tyrese Haliburton (who appeared in the crowd Monday night on WWE Raw in Indiana) appeared as Logan Paul\u2019s guest. The two in MSG got enough heat to continue the nationwide heatwave for the rest of 2024. Fortunately for the Kicks faithful in MSG, Jalen Brunson was in the crowd, suggesting an inevitable showdown between the two. Haliburton tried to supply super heel Logan Paul with a pair of brass knuckles, but was nullified by Jalen Brunson to a huge pop. This led to an LA Knight rollup of Paul for the win. Haliburton was booed every time he was shown on television. Fans even had to be bleeped for chanting \u201cF\u2014k the Pacers!\u201d After the match, Haliburton teased hitting LA Knight with the brass knuckles, which brought out Haliburton with a steel chair. A great modern-day New York moment in a modern-day WWE. LA Knight vs. Logan Paul and Santos Escobar Grade: B+ Naomi Def. Indi Hartwell And Blair Davenport The story of this match was Indi Hartwell looking tentative, like she was overthinking her next move. At first, it seemed like Corey Graves was just burying Hartwell\u2019s wrestling ability. Toward the end of the match, Jade Cargill walked down to the ring to get her get-back against Hartwell for costing her the Money in the Bank qualifier earlier in the night. Graves exclaimed that this is why Hartwell seemed tentative, because she knew Cargill was lurking. Jade Cargill rammed Hartwell\u2019s face into the post, then Naomi beat her with a kick. The potential of Naomi cashing in on BFF Bayley is very enticing. Naomi vs. Indi Hartwell and Blair Davenport Grade: C+ Bloodline Acknowledgment Ceremony During a backstage segment, Solo Sikoa told Paul Heyman Jacob Fatu was not in the building. Fans booed, but once again, I think Solo was lying. Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn. Check out my website or some of my other work here.

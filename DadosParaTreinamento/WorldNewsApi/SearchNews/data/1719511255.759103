{"id": 223764670, "title": "Jayson Tatum credited Joe Mazzulla for game-changing message that sparked Celtics&#8217; comeback in Game 3 win", "text": "The Celtics looked destined to lose their first road game of the postseason and watch their lead in the Eastern Conference finals shrink to 2-1 in Game 3 before winning, 114-111. Even though the Pacers were without All-NBA guard Tyrese Haliburton, they had very few missed shots within the arc in the first half of Saturday\u2019s game. They shot 69.4 percent on 2-point shots and 63.6 percent from the field in the opening two frames. Guards Andrew Nembhard and T.J. McConnell looked unstoppable on their dribble drives, with the former scoring a career-high 32 points while the latter scored 23. The Pacers\u2019 spectacular shotmaking within the arc continued in the opening minutes of the second half. A pair of consecutive buckets from McConnell ballooned the Pacers\u2019 lead up to 18, their largest of Game 3. As Jaylen Brown later remarked that \u201csome of those guys turned into [expletive] Michael Jordan or whatever\u201d after the game, Jayson Tatum shared Joe Mazzulla\u2019s message to the team in a timeout prior to McConnell\u2019s consecutive makes helped spark the turnaround. \u201cOne of those timeouts in the third quarter, Joe just kind of told us to stop feeling sorry for ourselves,\u201d Tatum told reporters. \u201cWhatever situation we\u2019re in, that\u2019s the situation that we\u2019re in. It\u2019s on us to figure it out. \u201cThings weren\u2019t going our way. We weren\u2019t hitting shots at the time. It seemed like they were coming out and scoring every single time. Maybe we were slow to bring the ball up the court. When we get scored on, we might put our head down. It felt like [expletive] wasn\u2019t going our way. Joe always talks about how it\u2019s not always going to go how we want it to or we expect it to. That\u2019s OK. It\u2019s OK to be down 15 or 17 on the road and still have an opportunity to win the game.\u201d So, the Celtics listened to their head coach and ratcheted their defensive effort. They recorded eight blocks and four steals in the final 18 minutes of Saturday\u2019s game, allowing the Pacers to score just 42 points in the second half. During a mic\u2019d up segment on ABC\u2019s broadcast of Saturday\u2019s game, Mazzulla was heard telling his Celtics team during a timeout to play one possession at a time, focusing on getting stops, and disregard what the score said. But there were changes that Mazzulla made to his rotation in the second half of Game 3 that played a role in Boston\u2019s improved defensive output. The Celtics opted to lean into bigger lineups, playing Xavier Tillman and Sam Hauser more minutes off the bench than Oshae Brissett and Payton Pritchard. The increased length off the bench made it more difficult for Indiana to get the clean looks it got in the paint in the first half. As Mazzulla has often said that defensive play begins on the offensive end during his two seasons as head coach, he seemed to acknowledge that wasn\u2019t entirely the case Saturday. \u201cIt took us a little while to figure out how we were going to match up with them in order to slow them down and put us in the best position,\u201d Mazzulla explained. \u201cWithout Haliburton, they went to some of their different stuff, and they had a lot of speed. So I never felt like it was our offense, I felt like it was our defense, and I thought we took it to another level in the second half.\u201d Now, the Celtics are a win away from making it back to the NBA Finals for the second time in three years. It would mark the first time they\u2019ve played on the NBA\u2019s highest stage with Mazzulla as head coach. Derrick White credited Mazzulla for helping the team be prepared for moments like Saturday\u2019s Game 3 as they\u2019re on the precipice of advancing. \u201cThis year, he\u2019s just been connected,\u201d White said. \u201cHis communication\u2019s really good and the trust. We\u2019ve gone through a lot of these situations in practices. He\u2019s talked about it. So, we all feel locked in, connected, and I love playing for Joe. He\u2019s been great for us.\u201d", "summary": "<p>The Celtics trailed by as many as 18 points in the second half before turning it around to take a 3-0 series lead.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.boston.com/sports/boston-celtics/2024/05/26/jayson-tatum-joe-mazzulla-celtics-pacers-game-3/\">Jayson Tatum credited Joe Mazzulla for game-changing message that sparked Celtics&#8217; comeback in Game 3 win</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.boston.com\">Boston.com</a>.</p>", "url": "https://www.boston.com/sports/boston-celtics/2024/05/26/jayson-tatum-joe-mazzulla-celtics-pacers-game-3/", "image": "https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/NZFVR3FJ722LEQYOUCWGR3MLFA-66535ea29b8e1-768x432.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 16:20:00", "author": "Conor Roche", "authors": ["Conor Roche"], "language": "en", "source_country": "US", "sentiment": -0.484}

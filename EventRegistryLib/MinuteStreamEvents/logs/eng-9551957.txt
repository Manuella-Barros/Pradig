He called dissidents' behavior toward staffers working at the time of the takeover, including two custodians and a security officer, \"an outrageous affront to working people.\"\n\nOne of the union's local branches represents 725 workers at Columbia, including custodians, security officers and electricians.\n\nOfficials should have known the building was a target given its history as the site of an occupation by students advocating for racial justice in the 1960s, he charged.\n\n\"We're exploiting every legal means at our disposal against Columbia, against the individual occupiers of the building ... [who] thought that they could hold our custodians hostage to their ideology,\" he added.\n\nThe union honcho, who also represents the 44,000-member Transport Workers Union Local 100, insisted he supports students' constitutional right to protest\n\nSamuelsen repeated a claim to which Mayor Eric Adams has been clinging since police officers responded to protests at Columbia and City College: that \"outside agitators\" snuck into student encampments and exacerbated tensions.\n\nThe NYPD arrested 109 protesters at Columbia and 173 at City College. The mayor has continued to defend the timing of police officers' response.\n\nA Columbia spokesperson declined to comment on Samuelsen's legal threat.\n\nAn organizer for Columbia University Apartheid Divest, the group that was behind the encampment but was not involved in the takeover of Hamilton, told POLITICO they could not speak to the actions committed by or words said by the autonomous group of students who occupied Hamilton.\n\n\"The vast majority of individuals involved were peaceful and only had the intention of being peaceful and treating people with respect,\" said the organizer, who was granted anonymity, adding that it's the first time they're hearing about the allegations.\n\nThe move represents a significant escalation by one of the most politically active unions in New York state, as Shafik and Adams deal with political fallout from the NYPD's crackdown on protests on campuses. The union has not shied from picking fights with powerful Democrats -- Samuelson recently launched an attack ad against Gov. Kathy Hochul amid an ongoing disagreement over a union contract.\n\nIn a letter to Shafik late Monday morning, Samuelsen urged the president to provide the names of the protesters arrested inside Hamilton Hall, access to footage from the building and information the NYPD gave to Columbia on the number of students who participated in the demonstration as well as outside actors.\n\nHe also wants to meet with Shafik and discuss steps to ensure workers' safety if the protests resume, as well as compensation for affected union members.\n\nWhen the custodians told the demonstrators that they wanted to get out of the building, at least one \"smarmy, sanctimonious, elitist ... occupier\" -- in a reference to the Gaza protests and takeover of Hamilton -- told them they would not be able to exit premises because \"this moment is bigger than you,\" Samuelsen alleged in the letter.\n\nThe custodians had to then fight their way toward one of the barricaded exits to escape, he said.\n\nThe security officer, an African American woman, managed to slip out before the barricades were set up, Samuelsen added. But she's still \"shaken\" by her run-in with the demonstrators who verbally attacked her \"in a very aggressive and extremely offensive manner,\" he said.\n\nLabor unions have been increasingly weighing in on turmoil afflicting institutions across the country. Shawn Fain, president of United Auto Workers, blasted the mass arrests. Other unions have called for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nThe Professional Staff Congress, the City University of New York's faculty and staff union, on Monday requested that CUNY Chancellor F\u00e9lix Matos Rodr\u00edguez ask Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg to drop charges against students and employees.", "source": {"uri": "politico.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

All submissions will be kept anonymous.\n\nOn Tuesday, John Samuelsen, the president of the Transport Workers Union (TWU), condemned the president of Columbia University for not calling in the New York Police Department (NYPD) earlier against students occupying a campus building to protest the genocide in Gaza.\n\nIn comments to Politico, Samuelsen claimed that the actions of the protesters towards the staffers, including two custodians and a security officer who are TWU members, were an \"outrageous affront to working people.\"\n\nHe said, \"We're exploring every legal means at our disposal against Columbia against the individual occupiers ... [who] thought that they could hold our custodians hostage to their ideology.\"\n\nWith this statement, the TWU bureaucracy has thrown its support behind the massive government crackdown on peaceful protests. In addition to sending riot cops, snipers and mounted police against students, this has involved a campaign by high-ranking politicians against campus administrators, such as Columbia University President Minouche Shafik, deemed supposedly \"too soft\" on the protests.\n\nIn New York City, the campaign Samuelsen is joining is being spearheaded by Mayor Eric Adams, a former NYPD captain. But it has broad bipartisan support, including from actual fascist antisemites such as Marjorie Taylor Greene and Elise Stefanik, and is being coordinated from the White House, which has cynically tarred students as \"antisemitic\" even though hundreds of Jewish students have been arrested.\n\nIn launching this provocation, Samuelsen is acting completely outside of the will of TWU's 155,000 members. As with workers across the world, they largely support the students and recognize the police crackdown as a major attack on their own democratic rights.\n\nRank-and-file TWU members have an obligation to mobilize to reject his slanders of students and to countermand the threatened legal campaign. Instead, Samuelsen himself must be disciplined for making these statements, and the rank and file must organize actions in defense of the students.\n\nIn a separate letter to Shafik, Samuelsen urged her to provide \"[T]he names of the occupiers arrested inside Hamilton Hall.\"\n\nThe letter also demands \"access to the CCTV footage from Hamilton Hall\" and \"directives/information provided to Columbia by the NYPD and/or other law enforcement bodies regarding the composition of protesters.\"\n\nFinally, he calls for \"An immediate meeting with the university president regarding mitigation steps necessary to avoid future placement of members in harm's way if the protests resume.\"\n\nThe chief TWU bureaucrat claimed that the custodians had to escape from barricaded exits to leave the building and deserve compensation.\n\nSamuelsen's account is a lie. The real perpetrators of the violence were not the students but the police. The Columbia Spectator, which was on site, described in graphic detail what really took place on April 30:\n\nHundreds of police officers marched down a street next to the campus and ordered reporters to move out of the way, pushing one of them, grabbing her and shoving her to the side.\n\nThey threatened bystanders with arrest. The Spectator noted, \"Officers mocked our journalists and told them to run, swearing at them and laughing as students bolted away in panic.\"\n\nThe reporters saw \"one protester was thrown down the steps of Hamilton. Another protester lay on the ground, seemingly unconscious as officers stood over them. One protester was dragged away, crying, hardly able to walk; many more were aggressively pushed and handcuffed by the police. Officers busted down barricades and sawed through the chains locking the doors of Hamilton, threw flash bangs into the lobby, and hurled metal trash cans and tables down the stairs -- without a care for whether anyone was in their line of fire.\"\n\nThere is growing demand for strike action in defense of students. This is what happened on May 1, when approximately 300 faculty and staff in the City University of New York (CUNY) staged a sickout in an act of solidarity with the student encampment at City College.\n\nIn California, graduate student members of the United Auto Workers Local 4811 are set to vote on a strike against the police crackdown at UCLA.\n\nBut the CUNY faculty union, the Professional Staff Congress (PSC), called the action an \"unauthorized sick-out not sanctioned\" by the union, and that it \"does not condone this action and discourages PSC members from participating.\"\n\nIn an attempt to cover its opposition to any struggle against the Gaza genocide, the PSC condemned the arrest of the City College students on May 1, a number of whom were body-slammed and pepper sprayed by NYPD officers.\n\nThe union bureaucracy is moving desperately to try to prevent workers from linking up with the student protests. Shawn Fain, president of the UAW, has combined bogus support for a \"ceasefire\" with the union's endorsement and close ties to \"Genocide Joe\" Biden. American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten, who has criss-crossed the world in support of US-backed wars, has joined the slander of protesters as \"antisemitic.\"\n\nSamuelsen's support for the police attack goes hand in hand with the TWU bureaucracy's sellout of its own membership. In July, the TWU executives pushed through a concessions contract for about 36,000 NYC transit workers, who operate the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in New York City, Long Island, southeastern New York state and Connecticut, the largest public transit network in the United States. The deal was critical to the transit agency's drive to save itself hundreds of millions of dollars by increasing productivity.\n\nThe contract contained wage increases below the current rate of inflation. It also included a clause called \"gainsharing,\" in which the union bureaucracy agreed to help increase \"employee availability\" to more than five days on average for the entire workforce. The bureaucracy will receive a payoff in exchange for taking on this managerial function.\n\nThe transit agency will also save money when the union agreed to cutbacks in retiree health benefits. Retirees can no longer choose basic Medicare and now can only choose from two for-profit \"Advantage\" plans, which are notorious for denying necessary procedures. It has been estimated that this will save the agency $40 million a year over a three-year contract, for a total savings of $120 million.\n\nRead moreWorkers must prepare industrial action to halt

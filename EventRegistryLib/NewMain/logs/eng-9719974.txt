Michael Bennet warns Biden could lose to Trump in 'landslide' after debate", "body": "Congressional Democrats shared their opinions on Joe Biden's status as the presidential nominee prior to a closed door meeting.\n\nWASHINGTON - Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., said Tuesday night he thinks President Joe Biden cannot beat former President Donald Trump in the November presidential election, the most stark comments from a Senate Democrat to date.\n\n\"Donald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election, and maybe win it by a landslide, and take with him the Senate and the House,\" Bennet, a three-term senator, told CNN. \"So for me, this isn't a question about polling. It's not a question about politics. It's a moral question about the future of our country.\"\n\nBennet stopped short of calling upon Biden to step out of the race, but made the case that Democrats have a \"moral obligation\" to \"do everything we can\" to beat Trump during an interview with Kaitlan Collins.\n\nHe noted that Biden was nine percentage points ahead of Trump on a national level at this point in the 2020 cycle and that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was five points ahead of Trump in the 2016 cycle. Biden is currently around two percentage points behind Trump as of Tuesday night, according to polling averages.\n\n\"I'm sure President Biden has a different view of his prospects in this election than I do, but we should be having a discussion about that,\" Bennet said.\n\n\"The White House, in the time since that disastrous debate, I think, has done nothing to really demonstrate that they have a plan to win this election, that they have a convincing plan to win in the battleground states where we have to win in order to win the election. And they need to do that,\" Bennet said.\n\nThe interview comes after Biden's debate stumbles last month kicked off a panic within the party over whether he can effectively represent them in an election many Democrats see as an existential fight against Trump and his Republican allies.\n\nSenate Democrats met for the first time in more than two weeks on Tuesday, and lawmakers leaving the caucus lunch meeting were tight-lipped about the nature of the conversations. However, they made it clear that they were unwilling to create a public firestorm that might push Biden to leave his post as the party's nominee.\n\nBennet and a handful of his colleagues, however, have been arguing that Biden must do more to show voters that he is capable of successfully prosecuting a case against Trump in the general election.\n\nIf Biden is at the top of the ticket, Bennet argued on CNN, he could also impact other races beside his own: The Colorado lawmaker said Democrats could risk losing the House and Senate in the fall, and Trump would likely have additional Supreme Court nominees if he's reelected to a second term.\n\n\"I believe the entire future of our country is at stake,\" Bennet said. \"I think it's critically important they address the concerns of the American people, not ignore them.\"\n\nBennet noted in the CNN interview that no one in the Senate's caucus meeting directly said they believe Biden should drop out of the race.\n\nBiden has made clear that he has no intention of ending his reelection bid. In a letter to Congressional Democrats Monday morning, Biden said he is \"firmly committed\" to remaining the party's nominee.\n\n\"There are a lot of days between now and election day, and the hard work of earning every single vote is far from over,\" Biden campaign spokesperson Kevin Munoz said in a statement to multiple outlets after Bennet's interview.", "source": {"uri": "coloradoan.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Coloradoan"}, "authors": [{"uri": "fort_collins_coloradoan@coloradoan.com", "name": "Fort Collins Coloradoan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide_victory", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Landslide victory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bennet", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michael Bennet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Christian_Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Christian Democracy", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/07/10/USAT/74347460007-gty-2150469318.jpg?auto=webp&crop=5999,3375,x0,y0&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719974", "eventUri": "eng-9719974", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 213, "relevance": 1}

So, I figured I should come here and say it publicly,' he said.\n\nBennet, while not explicitly calling for Biden to drop out, said that he thinks Democrats could lose more than their hold on the presidency in this election.\n\nColorado 's Michael Bennet became the first Democrat in the Senate to join several house colleagues to break with Joe Biden after his disastrous first debate\n\n'Donald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election and maybe win it by a landslide and take with him the Senate and the House,' Bennet said.\n\nRead More Some Senate Democrats express concerns but none turn on Biden... yet\n\n'I think that we could lose the whole thing,' he told CNN.\n\nBennet, unlike Tester and Brown, is not in a swing state and not even up for re-election this year.\n\nHe sees it as a matter of Democrats - who put Donald Trump on a pedestal as a unique threat to democracy - not having the right candidate to defend it in Biden.\n\n'It's not a question about politics. It's a moral question about the future of our country. And I think it's critically important for us to come to grips with what we face if together, we put this country on the path of electing Donald Trump again.'\n\nHe said the Democrats in the Senate will continue to discuss the issue this week but that people have been pressuring him about Biden's health.\n\n'These are my voters who have said to me, 'I've been through this with my mom, I've been through this with my dad.

It's going to be what the future of this country is going to be.\"\n\nAsked whether he believed Biden should step aside for a younger candidate to lead his party, Bennet didn't directly answer. But by saying Biden, 81, should step aside, he became the Senate Democrat who's come closest to calling for the president to drop out -- even though others have reportedly expressed private doubts about Biden's ability to win in November.\n\nA closed-door meeting between Senate Democrats earlier on Tuesday yielded no consensus on whether to stick with Biden. Some senators expressed support for the president, while others stayed quiet and avoided questions from the press. Sens. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) reportedly joined Bennet in expressing concerns about Biden's ability to win during the meeting.\n\nDuring his interview on CNN, Bennet said he has heard from constituents worried about Biden's fitness.\n\n\"These are my voters who said to me, 'I have been through this with my mom,' 'I have been through this with my dad.'

Michael Bennet of Colorado on Tuesday night became the first Senate Democrat to publicly say President Joe Biden can't win the election, he but stopped short of calling for him to withdraw from the race.\n\nIn an appearance on CNN, Bennet was asked whether he and Sens. Jon Tester, D-Mont., and Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, had told their colleagues during a private meeting on Capitol Hill that Biden can't defeat former President Donald Trump in the fall. He confirmed that he had made those remarks.\n\n\"Well, it's true that I said that, and I did say that behind closed doors. And you guys and others asked whether I had said it, and that is what I said. So I figured I should come here and say it publicly,\" said Bennet, who ran against Biden in the 2020 presidential primary campaign.\n\nBennet, who is in his third term, raised concerns about polling that has found Trump leading Biden less than four months before Election Day.\n\n\"Donald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election and maybe win it by a landslide and take with him the Senate and the House,\" Bennet said. \"So for me, this isn't a question about polling, it's not a question of politics. It's a moral question about the future of our country, and I think it's critically important for us to come to grips with what we face if, together, we put this country on the path of electing Donald Trump again.\"\n\nIn response to Bennet's remarks, Biden campaign spokesman Kevin Munoz said Biden isn't throwing in the towel.\n\n\"No one is more committed to defeating Donald Trump and defending our democracy than Joe Biden, and few know better than Joe Biden the importance of showing up and campaigning to earn the support of voters,\" Munoz said in a statement. \"This was always going to be a close race -- and the dynamics at play are the ones we've long anticipated: voters continue to be deeply concerned by Donald Trump and his harmful agenda, and the more we engage and reach out to voters, the more they support President Biden.\n\n\"There are a lot of days between now and election day, and the hard work of earning every single vote is far from over.\"\n\nIn conference calls and a public letter to Democratic lawmakers, Biden has been defiant, insisting that he is the party's nominee and that he won't be forced out of the race.Still, Bennet's comments are a blow to the campaign, which has been aggressively trying to limit Democratic defections and shore up support on Capitol Hill in the wake of Biden's debate debacle on June 27. And his remarks may create an opening for other skeptical or vulnerable Democrats to follow Bennet's lead in speaking out.\n\nMost Democrats leaving Tuesday's private lunch were tight-lipped, describing the discussion only as \"constructive.\" But a source said that Bennet, Brown and Tester all raised concerns that Biden wouldn't win the election. Another source said those concerns were voiced individually -- not as a group. The concerns were first reported by CNN.\n\nBrown and Tester face tough re-election bids this fall.\n\nBrown said he doesn't talk about private meetings, adding, \"I have very legitimate questions about this.\"\n\nAs he was leaving the Capitol, Tester didn't deny the report about his remarks, and he didn't comment on the matter to reporters. In a statement later Tuesday, he said: \"President Biden's bad debate performance raised serious questions about whether he's up [to] the job for the next four years. As I have said, he needs to prove to the American people, and me, that he can do it.\"\n\nIn his CNN appearance, Bennet said no Democrat in the closed-door lunch called on Biden to withdraw, and he also wouldn't go that far.\n\n\"I can understand how hard it would be if I were Joe Biden to sit there and to say to myself, after all I've worked for, after all I've accomplished, after all the extraordinary public service I've given to the American people -- which we should honor, because it has been extraordinary, one of the greatest leaders to be in that office, certainly in recent times -- and who has accomplished so much, it would be so hard to acknowledge that after all of that, you're in the race of your lifetime with somebody you can't beat,\" Bennet said.\n\n\"I think that's probably really hard for him to acknowledge.

It's going to be what the future of this country is going to be.\"\n\nAsked whether he believed Biden should step aside for a younger candidate to lead his party, Bennet didn't directly answer. But by saying Biden, 81, should step aside, he became the Senate Democrat who's come closest to calling for the president to drop out -- even though others have reportedly expressed private doubts about Biden's ability to win in November.\n\nA closed-door meeting between Senate Democrats earlier on Tuesday yielded no consensus on whether to stick with Biden. Some senators expressed support for the president, while others stayed quiet and avoided questions from the press. Sens. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) reportedly joined Bennet in expressing concerns about Biden's ability to win during the meeting.\n\nDuring his interview on CNN, Bennet said he has heard from constituents worried about Biden's fitness.\n\n\"These are my voters who said to me, 'I have been through this with my mom,' 'I have been through this with my dad.' I'm terrified what it would mean if Donald Trump is reelected in this country,\" Bennet said.\n\n\"We have a moral obligation to the people we represent,\" he added.\n\nBiden's campaign responded to Bennet's comments by pointing to statements other Democrats have made in support of the president.\n\n\"No one is more committed to defeating Donald Trump and defending our democracy than Joe Biden, and few know better than Joe Biden the importance of showing up and campaigning to earn the support of voters,\" Biden campaign spokesman Kevin Munoz said in a statement to HuffPost.\n\n\"This was always going to be a close race -- and the dynamics at play are the ones we've long anticipated: voters continue to be deeply concerned by Donald Trump and his harmful agenda, and the more we engage and reach out to voters, the more they support President Biden.

It's not a question about politics. It's a moral question about the future of our country,\" he continued, according to CNN.\n\n\"The White House, in the time since that disastrous debate, I think, has done nothing to really demonstrate that they have a plan to win this election,\" he added.\n\n\"Senator Michael Bennet (D-CO) got outed by the media for saying privately that Biden is on track to lose badly to Donald Trump. He went on CNN to own his comments publicly. Respect. This is an absolutely brutal clip if you're inside the Biden White House right now,\" Charlie Kirk commented.\n\nHis comments underscore a growing concern among congressional Democrats that Biden's reelection bid could hurt the party in down-ballot races this fall. Democrats, including those inside the administration, view this week as critical to Biden's political survival, and lawmakers on Capitol Hill gathered privately for their weekly meetings on Tuesday. Neither House nor Senate Democrats emerged from their meetings with a consensus on how to move forward, though it was clear that concerns had been aired behind closed doors.\n\nBennet, who stopped short of calling on Biden to withdraw, also warned on \"The Source\" about what's at stake in the 2024 election, saying that losing the House and Senate to Republicans would be \"an American tragedy.\"\n\n\"The stakes could not be higher,\" he said.\n\nBennet said his voters have \"deep concerns\" about whether Biden can win and urged the White House to not ignore worries about his viability.\n\nBennet's comments confirm earlier CNN reporting that Bennet told his colleagues during the private meeting between Senate Democrats Tuesday that he does not think Biden can win.\n\nThe Colorado senator's comments follow multiple House Democrats calling on Joe Biden to step aside.\n\nHigh-Ranking House Democrats Reportedly Call On Joe Biden To Withdraw From Presidential Election\n\nFrom The Guardian:\n\nPelosi, who was speaker of the House until the Republicans regained control of it in the 2022 midterm elections, told MSNBC's Morning Joe that \"it's up to the president to decide if he is going to run\" and said of House Democrats: \"We're all encouraging him to make that decision. Because time is running short.\"\n\nThe Hollywood actor and Democratic fundraiser George Clooney on Wednesday added his voice to the growing number of calls for Biden to drop out. In an opinion article for the New York Times, he expressed concern about the president's showing at a recent fundraiser in Los Angeles, where he \"wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\" Clooney called Biden a friend but said \"the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time\".\n\nBennet's and Pelosi's comments followed a lunch meeting of the Democratic Senate caucus in which Bennet and two other senators, Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Jon Tester of Montana, reportedly said they believed Biden was no longer able to win after the 27 June debate failure, in which he appeared repeatedly confused, lost his train of thought and failed to counter a spate of lies from Trump.\n\nWhile no senators have explicitly called for Biden to step aside - in contrast to seven House members who have appealed to him to abandon his re-election bid - the debate fallout has plunged the Democrats into paralysis as the campaign approaches a key phase.", "source": {"uri": "100percentfedup.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "100 Percent Fed Up"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Michael Bennet, D-Colo., said Tuesday night he thinks President Joe Biden cannot beat former President Donald Trump in the November presidential election, the most stark comments from a Senate Democrat to date.\n\nHe stopped short of calling upon Biden to step out of the race, but made the case that Democrats have a \"moral obligation\" to \"do everything we can\" to beat Trump during an interview with CNN.\n\nHe noted that Biden was nine percentage points ahead of Trump on a national level at this point in the 2020 cycle and that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was five points ahead of Trump in the 2016 cycle. Biden is currently around two percentage points behind Trump as of Tuesday night, according to polling averages.\n\n\"I'm sure President Biden has a different view of his prospects in this election than I do, but we should be having a discussion about that,\" Bennet told CNN's Katlin Collins.\n\n\"The White House, in the time since that disastrous debate, I think, has done nothing to really demonstrate that they have a plan to win this election, that they have a convincing plan to win in the battleground states where we have to win in order to win the election. And they need to do that,\" Bennet said.\n\nThe interview comes after Biden's debate stumbles last month kicked off a panic within the party over whether he can effectively represent them in an election many Democrats see as an existential fight against Trump and his Republican allies.\n\nSenate Democrats met for the first time in more than two weeks on Tuesday, and lawmakers leaving the caucus lunch meeting were tight-lipped about the nature of the conversations. However, they made it clear that they were unwilling to create a public firestorm that might push Biden to leave his post as the party's nominee.\n\nBennet and a handful of his colleagues, however, have been arguing that Biden must do more to show voters that he is capable of successfully prosecuting a case against Trump in the general election.\n\nIf Biden is at the top of the ticket, Bennet argued on CNN, he could also impact other races beside his own: The Colorado lawmaker said Democrats could risk losing the House and Senate in the fall, and Trump would likely have additional Supreme Court nominees if he's reelected to a second term.\n\n\"I believe the entire future of our country is at stake,\" Bennet said. \"I think it's critically important they address the concerns of the American people, not ignore them.\"\n\nBennet noted in the CNN interview that no one in the Senate's caucus meeting directly said they believe Biden should drop out of the race.\n\nBiden has made clear that he has no intention of ending his reelection bid. In a letter to Congressional Democrats Monday morning, Biden said he is \"firmly committed\" to remaining the party's nominee.\n\n\"There are a lot of days between now and election day, and the hard work of earning every single vote is far from over,\" Biden campaign spokesperson Kevin Munoz said in a statement to multiple outlets after Bennet's interview.", "source": {"uri": "usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "USA Today"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bennet", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michael Bennet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Christian_Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Christian Democracy", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/07/10/USAT/74347460007-gty-2150469318.jpg?auto=webp&crop=5999,3375,x0,y0&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719974", "eventUri": "eng-9719974", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 204, "relevance": 1}

On a day when most Democrats at the Capitol were in full panic mode, but were plainly unwilling to admit the depth of that panic, Bennet spoke the truth.\n\nWell, not all the truth. But at least some of it.\n\nAnd speaking much of the truth -- that he thinks Donald Trump is headed toward victory, and possibly by a landslide -- put him well ahead of most of his Democratic Senate colleagues.\n\nAnd if it doesn't scare you to hear that from Bennet, a measured politician who doesn't talk just to hear the sound of his voice, it should.\n\nIn a closed-door Senate Democratic caucus meeting Tuesday, Bennet was among the few -- others were reported to include Ohio's Sherrod Brown and Montana's Jon Tester, both of them in tight races this November -- warning that Biden and the Democrats were surely headed for disaster in November,\n\nOnce CNN reported the news, Bennet decided to go public, telling anchor Kaitlan Collins what he told his colleagues.\n\n\"Donald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election and maybe win in a landslide -- and take with him the Senate and the House,\" Bennet said on CNN.\n\n\"For me, this is not a question about polling. This isn't a question about politics. It's a moral question about the future of our country. It's critically important that we come to grips with what we face ... if we put Trump on the path to the White House.\"\n\nWhat Bennet didn't say -- and what must be said -- is that Biden, in the wake of the disastrous debate that set off questions about his fitness to take on Trump, must step aside.\n\nBennet nearly got there. He said that if Trump won -- and especially if Republicans took Congress, too -- it would be an \"American tragedy.\"\n\nAnd he said, \"I'm sure President Biden has a different vision of his prospects in this election than I do. But we should have a discussion about that. The White House, in the time since that disastrous debate, I think, has done nothing to demonstrate that they have a plan to win this election, that they have a convincing plan to win in the battleground states.\"\n\nAnd he further pointed out that Biden is now trailing in the polls by more than three points -- and that at this time in 2020, Biden was winning by nine. At this point in the race, he added, Hillary Clinton was winning by five.\n\nBut when asked repeatedly by Collins whether Biden should step aside, Bennet wouldn't go that far. Presumably, Democrats wouldn't go that far during NATO's meeting, where Biden just gave a forceful speech.\n\nThe question now is whether they ever will.\n\nOn Tuesday, as the House and Senate were returning from a long break, Democrats in both houses met separately to discuss the Biden issue -- and, inevitably, to discuss the fact that Biden has made it more than clear he has no intentions of making it easy for them.\n\nA few days ago, it seemed that Biden had little choice but to step aside. The momentum against him was too great. The post-debate image of him too dire. The stakes too high. The polls too troubling. The gathering danger of a Trumpian restoration all too clear.\n\nIt took more than a week, but Biden finally came up with a strategy to try to save his campaign. He would make it personal. He would be defiant. And for those politicians in his party who were wavering, he would try to make the fate of his campaign into a loyalty test.\n\nIt's too soon to say that congressional Democrats buckled -- there's still time for those who agree with Bennet to try to convince Biden to step aside -- but it's not too soon to say they blinked.\n\nBefore the meeting, Biden's strategy was working well enough that Bennet told reporters that an open debate about the future of the ticket \"is an act not of disloyalty, but of loyalty.\"\n\nAnd loyalty to the country, we should add, should easily trump loyalty to any president.\n\nYou have to remember how we got to this point. It was Biden who called for a June debate to change the narrative and prove to the world that he was fit to take on -- and defeat -- Donald Trump.\n\nInstead of changing the narrative, though, the debate would come to serve as an alternate version of a cognitive test, even as Biden repeatedly says he doesn't need to take a test that would measure his mental acuity.\n\nBy the way, I'm six years younger than Biden, and I've taken the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. It's what they recommend when you get, uh, older.\n\nBiden failed that debate test so utterly it seemed to many Democrats that he wasn't up to the job of saving the country from the dystopia promised by another Trump presidency. (See: Project 2025, a plan for Trump's second term so radical and so destructive and so subversive that Trump is now trying to pretend he knows nothing about it. Yeah, he's lying.)\n\nAt this point, Biden refuses to address the cognition issue, and Democrats, for the most part, have refused to call him on that. Instead, after an unimpressive showing with George Stephanopoulos Friday night, Biden turned to Morning Joe on Monday to make his case.\n\nBiden railed against the so-called elites, the press, the pundits, the Hollywood liberal establishment and the other usual suspects. He claimed they were trying to push him out, were piling on, did not credit him for his many successes and ignored Trump's lie-filled debate performance. He said he didn't believe the polls that show him trailing.\n\nIt is painful to watch Biden play the victim as he blames party elites. It's as if he had forgotten who helped clear the way for him to win the 2020 Democratic primary and who helped persuade Biden's rivals to drop out of the race to ensure that he would be the one -- and not Bernie Sanders -- to take on Trump.\n\nParty elites intervened for Biden -- because they thought he had the best chance to beat Trump -- in 2020. Now they're intervening again because they're afraid he can't.\n\nBut how deep into an intervention are they willing to go?\n\nAfter the House caucus meeting, Rep. Jerry Nadler of New York acted as if he didn't think they'd go very far. Over the weekend, he had privately called for Biden to step aside.\n\nBut after Tuesday's meeting, he had this to say: \"Whether or not I have concerns is beside the point. He is going to be our nominee, and we all have to support him.\"\n\nWhen Bennet spoke to reporters the day before the caucus meetings, he assured them that Democrats would take seriously the question of whether Biden should be the nominee at the August Democratic convention, which is now less than six weeks away.\n\n\"We're not Donald Trump's cult of personality, we're the Democratic Party,\" Bennet said.\n\nAs if that were enough.\n\nSo far, it's not nearly enough. It's time, past time, for Democrats to admit the dire situation facing the party and, more to the point, facing the country. And it's time, past time, to do what must be done.\n\nTelling the truth, the whole truth, would be a start.\n\nThe Colorado Sun is a nonpartisan news organization, and the opinions of columnists and editorial writers do not reflect the opinions of the newsroom.

Michael Bennet on Tuesday became the first Democratic senator to publicly say he doesn't believe President Joe Biden is capable of winning reelection after his disastrous debate performance last month.\n\n\"Donald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election, and maybe win it by a landslide, and take with him the Senate and the House,\" he told CNN's Kaitlan Collins. \"So for me, this isn't a question about polling. It's not a question about politics. It's a moral question about the future of our country.\"\n\n\"The White House, in the time since that disastrous debate, I think, has done nothing to really demonstrate that they have a plan to win this election,\" the Colorado Democrat said.\n\nHis comments underscore a growing concern among congressional Democrats that Biden's reelection bid could hurt the party in down-ballot races this fall. Democrats, including those inside the administration, view this week as critical to Biden's political survival, and lawmakers on Capitol Hill gathered privately for their weekly meetings on Tuesday. Neither House nor Senate Democrats emerged from their meetings with a consensus on how to move forward, though it was clear that concerns had been aired behind closed doors.\n\nBennet, who stopped short of calling on Biden to withdraw, also warned on \"The Source\" about what's at stake in the 2024 election, saying that losing the House and Senate to Republicans would be \"an American tragedy.\"\n\n\"The stakes could not be higher,\" he said.\n\nBennet said his voters have \"deep concerns\" about whether Biden can win and urged the White House to not ignore worries about his viability.\n\nBennet's comments confirm earlier CNN reporting that Bennet told his colleagues during the private meeting between Senate Democrats Tuesday that he does not think Biden can win.\n\nBiden's performance at the CNN debate in June kicked off a flurry of concern over his mental fitness and the viability of his campaign. While several House Democrats have publicly called on Biden to drop out of the race, the president has vowed to continue. He told congressional Democrats in a letter on Monday \"that despite all the speculation in the press and elsewhere,\" he is \"fully committed to staying in this race, to running this race to the end, and to beating Donald Trump.\"\n\nResponding to Bennet's comments, Biden campaign spokesperson Kevin Munoz said in a statement to CNN: \"This was always going to be a close race - and the dynamics at play are the ones we've long anticipated: voters continue to be deeply concerned by Donald Trump and his harmful agenda, and the more we engage and reach out to voters, the more they support President Biden.\"\n\n\"There are a lot of days between now and election day, and the hard work of earning every single vote is far from over,\" he added.\n\nCNN previously reported Sens. Sherrod Brown and Jon Tester also said Biden would not win during the meeting in the Capitol, according to a source familiar. Another source confirmed that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told senators at the meeting they should speak with the White House directly. Other senators also said they believed the administration is more receptive to hearing from senators directly.\n\nAfter the meeting ended, many Democratic senators declined to talk to reporters. Delaware Sen. Chris Coons, an ally of Biden, was asked if a consensus had been reached in the meeting but only said that \"it was a constructive conversation.\"\n\nCNN's Dana Bash and Ted Barrett contributed to this report.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide_victory", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Landslide victory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bennet", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michael Bennet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coattail_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Coattail effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Tester", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jon Tester"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Coons", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Coons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherrod_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sherrod Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_cnn_articles_945/db90357e5d51543140849976af585b68", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719974", "eventUri": "eng-9719974", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2010-07-", "textStart": 128, "textEnd": 135}], "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

Michael Bennet said Tuesday he thinks former President Donald Trump will beat President Biden -- potentially by \"a landslide\" -- in November and that Democrats may lose their Senate majority too.\n\nThe Colorado Democrat appeared on CNN on Tuesday evening to confirm the network's reporting from earlier in the day that, during a private Senate Democratic caucus lunch, he had told his colleagues he does not think Mr. Biden could win reelection.\n\nCNN also reported that Sens. Jon Tester of Montana and Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the two most vulnerable Democrats up for reelection this year, said they think Mr. Biden will lose.\n\nHowever Mr. Bennet, who is not up for election this cycle, would only confirm his comments.\n\n\"I did say that behind closed doors,\" he said, noting he had received many questions about his comments and \"I figured I should come here and say it publicly.\"\n\nMr. Bennet said the presidential race \"is on a trajectory that is very worrisome if you care about the future of this country.\"\n\nHe said Mr. Biden was up 9 points in the polls around this time in 2020, when he went on to beat Mr. Trump, and Hillary Clinton was up 5 points in summer 2016 before losing to Mr. Trump that fall.\n\n\"This is the first time in more than 20 years that a Republican president has been up in this part of the campaign,\" Mr. Bennet said of Mr. Trump's 3-point polling advantage. \"Donald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election -- and maybe win it by a landslide and take with him the Senate and the House.\"\n\nDespite citing polling as his evidence, Mr. Bennet said his concern is more \"moral\" than political.\n\n\"It's critically important for us to come to grips with what we face if together we put this country on the path of electing Donald Trump again,\" he said. \"We have four months to figure out how we're going to save the country from Donald Trump.\"\n\nNo Senate Democrat has yet publicly called on Mr. Biden to step aside as the party's nominee. Mr. Bennet stopped short of that in the CNN interview.\n\nWhen pressed why he wouldn't call on Mr. Biden to drop out if he thinks he will lose, Mr. Bennet said he and his colleagues are having that debate this week.\n\n\"I'm sure President Biden has a different view of his prospects in this election than I do,\" he said. \"But we should be having a discussion about that. And the White House in the time since that disastrous debate I think has done nothing to really demonstrate that they have a plan to win this election, that they have a convincing plan to win in the battleground states.\"\n\nMr. Bennet suggested the White House has been \"brushing off the American people's concerns.\"\n\nHe said he's heard from Colorado voters who have said they recognize troubling signs of Mr. Biden's aging, having gone through similar experiences with older family members.\n\nNone of the Democratic senators said during the private caucus lunch that Mr. Biden should drop out of the race, Mr. Bennet said. When pressed whether he could get to that point, he did not rule it out but signaled a preference not to go that far.\n\n\"I have no pleasure being here at all tonight just saying what I said in the caucus,\" he said. \"This is something for the president really to consider.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtontimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lindsey_mcpherson@washingtontimes.com", "name": "Lindsey McPherson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bennet_family", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Bennet family"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_Democratic_Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Senate Democratic Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Tester", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jon Tester"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherrod_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sherrod Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bennet", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Bennet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Montana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Beauty_Pageants", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Beauty Pageants", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Buzkashi", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Buzkashi", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2023/12/24/Congress_Ukraine_16230_c0-329-5270-3401_s1770x1032.jpg?db4fcfd871b4bb21ab174549d6959b9c5ae09458", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719974", "eventUri": "eng-9719974", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

This is an absolutely brutal clip if you're inside the Biden White House right now,\" Charlie Kirk commented.\n\nWATCH:\n\nPer CNN:\n\nHis comments underscore a growing concern among congressional Democrats that Biden's reelection bid could hurt the party in down-ballot races this fall. Democrats, including those inside the administration, view this week as critical to Biden's political survival, and lawmakers on Capitol Hill gathered privately for their weekly meetings on Tuesday. Neither House nor Senate Democrats emerged from their meetings with a consensus on how to move forward, though it was clear that concerns had been aired behind closed doors.\n\nBennet, who stopped short of calling on Biden to withdraw, also warned on \"The Source\" about what's at stake in the 2024 election, saying that losing the House and Senate to Republicans would be \"an American tragedy.\"\n\n\"The stakes could not be higher,\" he said.\n\nBennet said his voters have \"deep concerns\" about whether Biden can win and urged the White House to not ignore worries about his viability.\n\nBennet's comments confirm earlier CNN reporting that Bennet told his colleagues during the private meeting between Senate Democrats Tuesday that he does not think Biden can win.\n\nThe Colorado senator's comments follow multiple House Democrats calling on Joe Biden to step aside.\n\nHigh-Ranking House Democrats Reportedly Call On Joe Biden To Withdraw From Presidential Election\n\nFrom The Guardian:\n\nPelosi, who was speaker of the House until the Republicans regained control of it in the 2022 midterm elections, told MSNBC's Morning Joe that \"it's up to the president to decide if he is going to run\" and said of House Democrats: \"We're all encouraging him to make that decision. Because time is running short.\"\n\nThe Hollywood actor and Democratic fundraiser George Clooney on Wednesday added his voice to the growing number of calls for Biden to drop out. In an opinion article for the New York Times, he expressed concern about the president's showing at a recent fundraiser in Los Angeles, where he \"wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\" Clooney called Biden a friend but said \"the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time\".\n\nBennet's and Pelosi's comments followed a lunch meeting of the Democratic Senate caucus in which Bennet and two other senators, Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Jon Tester of Montana, reportedly said they believed Biden was no longer able to win after the 27 June debate failure, in which he appeared repeatedly confused, lost his train of thought and failed to counter a spate of lies from Trump.\n\nWhile no senators have explicitly called for Biden to step aside - in contrast to seven House members who have appealed to him to abandon his re-election bid - the debate fallout has plunged the Democrats into paralysis as the campaign approaches a key phase.\n\nWatch a longer clip from the interview below:", "source": {"uri": "en-volve.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "enVolve"}, "authors": [{"uri": "a_m_smith@en-volve.com", "name": "A.M.

It's not a question about politics. It's a moral question about the future of our country.\"\n\n\"The White House, in the time since that disastrous debate, I think, has done nothing to really demonstrate that they have a plan to win this election,\" the Colorado Democrat said. [Pols emphasis]\n\nBennet said a number of interesting things during his 10-minute interview on CNN. While he never specifically called for Biden to withdraw from the race for President, Bennet said everything else to make that case.\n\nOn polling numbers:\n\n\"Joe Biden was 9 point up at this time the last time he was running. Hillary Clinton was 5 points up [at this point in 2016]. This is the first time in more than 20 years that a Republican candidate has been [ahead in the polls] at this point in the campaign...\n\n...Today, as we're sitting here, [Trump] is three and a half points ahead in the polls. He was ahead before President Biden had that very unfortunate debate, and the lead has been growing. And we have four months to figure out how we're going to save the country from Donald Trump.\"\n\nOn down-ballot concerns:\n\n\"I think that we could lose the whole thing. And it's staggering to me. I mean, Donald Trump has already been President. I think he's the worst President that we've ever had.\"\n\nOn the danger of Trump:\n\n\"The stakes could not be higher. I believe that if we elect Donald Trump President again, my generation of Americans will be the first generation to leave less opportunity -- not more -- to the kids coming after us...\n\n...We cannot let that happen, and we don't have to let that happen. We have to defeat the malignant figure that is Donald Trump.\"\n\nOn why he isn't calling for Biden to drop out of the race:\n\n\"We're all here this week to have this discussion and have this debate. I'm sure President Biden has a different view of his prospects in this election than I do, but we should be having a discussion about that. And the White House, in the time since that disastrous debate, I think has done nothing to really demonstrate that they have a plan to win this election...and they need to do that. They have to demonstrate that to the American people.\"\n\nOn whether he could see himself calling for Biden to drop out:\n\n\"Look, I have no pleasure in being here tonight or just saying what I said in the caucus...\n\n...This is something for the President really to consider. And I believe that those of us who are in these elected offices have a moral obligation to the people we represent...to do everything we can to make sure that their future is as bright as it could be. And if we just sit on our hands -- if we say, 'We're going to disregard what is plainly in front of us, and plainly in front of the American people,' and we end up electing Donald Trump again as President of the United States, that's going to be a huge tragedy beyond epic proportion. And it's something I can't live with...[Pols emphasis]\"\n\n...That would be an American tragedy: If we lose the House, if we lose the Senate.\"\n\nOn what he's hearing from Colorado:\n\n\"The people I represent in Colorado have deep concerns about whether or not the President can win this race.\"\n\nWhen asked by Collins if Colorado could now be a swing state in the Presidential race, Bennet flatly stated, \"I don't think it will put Colorado in play.\"\n\nBennet also demonstrated a very human and personal understanding of what it must be like to be in Biden's shoes at the moment:\n\n\"I can understand how hard it would be, if I were Joe Biden, to sit there and to say to myself, 'After all I've worked for and after all I've accomplished, after all of the extraordinary public service I've given to the American people'...it would be so hard to acknowledge that, after all of that, you're in the race of your lifetime with somebody you can't beat. I think that's probably really hard for him to acknowledge. I think it's really hard for the people who are working for him to acknowledge. I think they have a moral obligation to look themselves in the mirror and say...we're sure that we're going to be able to win this race.\" [Pols emphasis]\n\nAgain, while Bennet did not specifically call on Biden to drop out of the race for President -- he definitely sounds like he's close to crossing that line. CNN reported earlier on Tuesday that Bennet was among three Senators at the Senate Democratic lunch -- including Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown and Montana Sen. Jon Tester -- to speak out saying that Biden is likely to lose in November.\n\nBennet confirmed to Collins on CNN that none of his fellow Senators specifically called for Biden to leave the race, but concerns are clearly growing. This morning, Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal spoke to reporters with a similar message, saying \"I am deeply concerned about Joe Biden winning this November.\" While Blumenthal then reiterated that he still supports Biden, he also seems to be calling on Biden to listen to their concerns and make his own decision to leave the race.\n\nWhatever happens next, Bennet deserves some credit for taking the plunge to say out loud what many of his colleagues are no doubt thinking to themselves. These are difficult conversations...but they are necessary.", "source": {"uri": "coloradopols.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colorado Pols"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bennet", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michael Bennet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide_victory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Landslide victory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Tester", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jon Tester"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherrod_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sherrod Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Blumenthal", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Richard Blumenthal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Montana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.coloradopols.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-10-at-10.36.50-AM-650x348.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719974", "eventUri": "eng-9719974", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

Democratic congressional candidate Adam Frisch called on Biden to step down from the presidential race, saying the country needs \"a new generation of leadership.\"\n\n\"We need a president that can unite America to realize our nation's unlimited potential. We deserve better. President Biden should withdraw from this race,\" Frisch said, adding that while he thanks the president for his years of service, \"the path ahead requires a new generation of leadership to take our country forward.\"\n\nThe Colorado Democratic Party, however, believes Biden is the party's best candidate.\n\n\"The president admitted that he had a rough night, and that's fine. But the fact remains that President Biden proved he is the only candidate in this race with a proven track record of delivering for Colorado and improving the lives of Coloradans,\" said Colorado Democratic Party Chair Shad Murib earlier this month.\n\nThe Follow Up\n\nWhat do you want Denver7 to follow up on?

Michael Bennet on Tuesday night became the first Senate Democrat to publicly say that President Joe Biden can't win the 2024 election, but stopped short of calling for him to withdraw from the race.\n\nDuring an appearance on CNN, Bennet was asked if he, along with Sens. Jon Tester, D-Mont., and Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, had told their colleagues during a private meeting on Capitol Hill that Biden can't defeat former President Donald Trump in the fall. He confirmed that he had made those remarks.\n\n\"Well, it's true that I said that, and I did say that behind closed doors. And you guys and others asked whether I had said it, and that is what I said. So I figured I should come here and say it publicly,\" said Bennet, who ran against Biden in the 2020 presidential primary.\n\nThe third-term senator raised concerns about polling that shows Trump leading Biden less than four months before Election Day.\n\n\"Donald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election and maybe win it by a landslide and take with him the Senate and the House,\" Bennet said. \"So for me, this isn't a question about polling, it's not a question of politics. It's a moral question about the future of our country, and I think it's critically important for us to come to grips with what we face if, together, we put this country on the path of electing Donald Trump again.\"\n\nIn response to Bennet's remarks on CNN, Biden campaign spokesman Kevin Munoz said Biden isn't throwing in the towel.\n\n\"No one is more committed to defeating Donald Trump and defending our democracy than Joe Biden, and few know better than Joe Biden the importance of showing up and campaigning to earn the support of voters,\" Munoz said in a statement. \"This was always going to be a close race -- and the dynamics at play are the ones we've long anticipated: voters continue to be deeply concerned by Donald Trump and his harmful agenda, and the more we engage and reach out to voters, the more they support President Biden.\n\n\"There are a lot of days between now and election day, and the hard work of earning every single vote is far from over.\"\n\nIn conference calls and a public letter to Democratic lawmakers, Biden has been defiant, insisting that he is the party's nominee and won't be forced out of the race.\n\nStill, Bennet's comments are a blow to the Biden campaign, which has been aggressively trying to limit Democratic defections and shore up support on Capitol Hill in the wake of the president's June 27 debate debacle. And his remarks may create an opening for other skeptical or vulnerable Democrats to follow Bennet's lead in speaking out.\n\nMost Democrats leaving Tuesday's private lunch were tight-lipped, describing the discussion only as \"constructive.\" But a source told NBC News that Bennet, Brown and Tester had all raised concerns that Biden would not win the 2024 election. Another source said those concerns were voiced individually -- not as a group. The concerns were first reported by CNN.\n\nBoth Brown and Tester are facing tough re-election bids this fall.\n\nBrown said he doesn't talk about private meetings, adding, \"I have very legitimate questions about this.\"\n\nTester, while leaving the Capitol, did not deny the report on his remarks but did not comment on the matter to reporters. In a statement later Tuesday, he said: \"President Biden's bad debate performance raised serious questions about whether he's up [to] the job for the next four years. As I have said, he needs to prove to the American people, and me, that he can do it.\"\n\nIn his CNN appearance, Bennet said that no Democrat in the closed-door lunch called on Biden to withdraw, and Bennet also would not go that far.\n\n\"I can understand how hard it would be if I were Joe Biden, to sit there and to to say to myself, after all I've worked for, after all I've accomplished, after all the extraordinary public service I've given to the American people, which we should honor, because it has been extraordinary, one of the greatest leaders to be in that office, certainly in recent times, and who has accomplished so much it would be so hard to acknowledge that after all of that, you're in the race of your lifetime with somebody you can't beat,\" Bennet said.\n\n\"I think that's probably really hard for him to acknowledge.

But we should be having a discussion about that,\" Bennet told CNN. \"And the White House in the time since that disastrous debate I think has done nothing to really demonstrate that they have a plan to win this election.\"\n\nThe senator stopped short of outright calling on Biden to step aside as the party's nominee -- leaving the door open to a Biden comeback.\n\nIn the CNN interview, Bennet acknowledged giving a similar analysis in the Senate Democratic lunch earlier in the day. The Colorado lawmaker is rarely one to cause a ruckus in the caucus -- but has been among those voicing grave concerns over Biden's performance at last month's debate.\n\n\"This race is on a trajectory that is very worrisome if you care about the future of this country,\" Bennet, who like Biden sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, said. He later added, \"We could lose the whole thing, and it's staggering to me.\"\n\nSen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) also told Democratic senators at Tuesday's lunch that he believes the president is in a troubling situation and needs to do more to prove his viability as a candidate, according to a senior Democratic aide who was granted anonymity to discuss the private conversation. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) reportedly did the same -- though he repeatedly declined to answer questions from reporters, citing his policy of not talking about what happens in caucus meetings.\n\nTester and Brown -- who are seeking reelection in states Trump carried by significant margins in 2020 -- are the party's two most vulnerable incumbents this fall.\n\nAs of Tuesday, there was no clear strategy among Senate Democrats on how to address the president's viability as the party's presidential nominee. While many senior Democrats, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, have said they're standing by Biden, others have insisted the president needs to prove he is up for the job.\n\n\"They have to address the American's people's concerns,\" Bennet said. \"People that I represent from Colorado have deep concerns about whether or not the president can win this race.\"\n\nBiden campaign spokesperson Kevin Munoz issued a statement in response to Bennet's interview. \"This was always going to be a close race -- and the dynamics at play are the ones we've long anticipated: Voters continue to be deeply concerned by Donald Trump and his harmful agenda, and the more we engage and reach out to voters, the more they support President Biden,\" Munoz said.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bennet", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michael Bennet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide_victory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Landslide victory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Tester", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jon Tester"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherrod_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sherrod Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Brown"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/s8dWP_utGHYqrkk5X8117w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/politico_453/09a3f04e903edfac2e60b3b343c07216", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719974", "eventUri": "eng-9719974", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 192, "relevance": 1}

Michael Bennet on Tuesday became the first Democratic senator to publicly say he doesn't believe President Joe Biden is capable of winning reelection after his disastrous debate performance last month.\n\n\"Donald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election, and maybe win it by a landslide, and take with him the Senate and the House,\" he told CNN's Kaitlan Collins. \"So for me, this isn't a question about polling. It's not a question about politics. It's a moral question about the future of our country.\"\n\n\"The White House, in the time since that disastrous debate, I think, has done nothing to really demonstrate that they have a plan to win this election,\" the Colorado Democrat said.\n\nHis comments underscore a growing concern among congressional Democrats that Biden's reelection bid could hurt the party in down-ballot races this fall. Democrats, including those inside the administration, view this week as critical to Biden's political survival, and lawmakers on Capitol Hill gathered privately for their weekly meetings on Tuesday. Neither House nor Senate Democrats emerged from their meetings with a consensus on how to move forward, though it was clear that concerns had been aired behind closed doors.\n\nBennet, who stopped short of calling on Biden to withdraw, also warned on \"The Source\" about what's at stake in the 2024 election, saying that losing the House and Senate to Republicans would be \"an American tragedy.\"\n\n\"The stakes could not be higher,\" he said.\n\nBennet said his voters have \"deep concerns\" about whether Biden can win and urged the White House to not ignore worries about his viability.\n\nBennet's comments confirm earlier CNN reporting that Bennet told his colleagues during the private meeting between Senate Democrats Tuesday that he does not think Biden can win.\n\nBiden's performance at the CNN debate in June kicked off a flurry of concern over his mental fitness and the viability of his campaign. While several House Democrats have publicly called on Biden to drop out of the race, the president has vowed to continue. He told congressional Democrats in a letter on Monday \"that despite all the speculation in the press and elsewhere,\" he is \"fully committed to staying in this race, to running this race to the end, and to beating Donald Trump.\"\n\nResponding to Bennet's comments, Biden campaign spokesperson Kevin Munoz said in a statement to CNN: \"This was always going to be a close race - and the dynamics at play are the ones we've long anticipated: voters continue to be deeply concerned by Donald Trump and his harmful agenda, and the more we engage and reach out to voters, the more they support President Biden.\"\n\n\"There are a lot of days between now and election day, and the hard work of earning every single vote is far from over,\" he added.\n\nCNN previously reported Sens. Sherrod Brown and Jon Tester also said Biden would not win during the meeting in the Capitol, according to a source familiar. Another source confirmed that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told senators at the meeting they should speak with the White House directly. Other senators also said they believed the administration is more receptive to hearing from senators directly.\n\nAfter the meeting ended, many Democratic senators declined to talk to reporters. Delaware Sen. Chris Coons, an ally of Biden, was asked if a consensus had been reached in the meeting but only said that \"it was a constructive conversation.\"\n\nCNN's Dana Bash and Ted Barrett contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

While several House Democrats have publicly called on Biden to drop out of the race, the president has vowed to continue. He told congressional Democrats in a letter on Monday \"that despite all the speculation in the press and elsewhere,\" he is \"fully committed to staying in this race, to running this race to the end, and to beating Donald Trump.\"\n\nResponding to Bennet's comments, Biden campaign spokesperson Kevin Munoz said in a statement to CNN: \"This was always going to be a close race - and the dynamics at play are the ones we've long anticipated: voters continue to be deeply concerned by Donald Trump and his harmful agenda, and the more we engage and reach out to voters, the more they support President Biden.\"\n\n\"There are a lot of days between now and election day, and the hard work of earning every single vote is far from over,\" he added.\n\nCNN previously reported Sens. Sherrod Brown and Jon Tester also said Biden would not win during the meeting in the Capitol, according to a source familiar. Another source confirmed that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told senators at the meeting they should speak with the White House directly. Other senators also said they believed the administration is more receptive to hearing from senators directly.\n\nAfter the meeting ended, many Democratic senators declined to talk to reporters.

The Democratic senators convened for the first time since Biden's contentious debate but left without a clear direction.\n\nMany senators argued that the party needs a discussion on whether Biden should remain at the top of the ticket, especially after hearing voter concerns. Despite the meeting, their positions remained unchanged, advocating for ongoing discussions about the future.\n\nDemocrats voiced concerns that Biden's nomination could hinder lower-level races, a sentiment Bennet shares. Kevin Munoz, a spokesperson for Biden's campaign, responded late Tuesday, emphasizing Biden's commitment to defeating Trump and defending democracy.\n\n\"No one has been more dedicated to defeating Trump and defending our democracy than Biden,\" Munoz stated. \"Few understand better than Joe Biden the importance of showing up and campaigning to earn voter support.

While several House Democrats have publicly called on Biden to drop out of the race, the president has vowed to continue. He told congressional Democrats in a letter on Monday \"that despite all the speculation in the press and elsewhere,\" he is \"fully committed to staying in this race, to running this race to the end, and to beating Donald Trump.\"\n\nResponding to Bennet's comments, Biden campaign spokesperson Kevin Munoz said in a statement to CNN: \"This was always going to be a close race - and the dynamics at play are the ones we've long anticipated: voters continue to be deeply concerned by Donald Trump and his harmful agenda, and the more we engage and reach out to voters, the more they support President Biden.\"\n\n\"There are a lot of days between now and election day, and the hard work of earning every single vote is far from over,\" he added.\n\nCNN previously reported Sens. Sherrod Brown and Jon Tester also said Biden would not win during the meeting in the Capitol, according to a source familiar. Another source confirmed that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told senators at the meeting they should speak with the White House directly. Other senators also said they believed the administration is more receptive to hearing from senators directly.\n\nAfter the meeting ended, many Democratic senators declined to talk to reporters. Delaware Sen. Chris Coons, an ally of Biden, was asked if a consensus had been reached in the meeting but only said that \"it was a constructive conversation.\"\n\nCNN's Dana Bash and Ted Barrett contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "piper_hudspethblackburn@cnn.com", "name": "Piper HudspethBlackburn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bennet", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michael Bennet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide_victory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Landslide victory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Tester", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jon Tester"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Coons", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Coons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherrod_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sherrod Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Delaware"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Educational", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Software/Educational", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/still-20775808-75135-still.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719974", "eventUri": "eng-9719974", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0117647058823529, "wgt": 186, "relevance": 1}

Most polls conducted after the debate in Atlanta show Biden dropping further behind Trump nationally and in several swing states, and some worry more Democratic states could get moved in play for Trump.\n\nThe Cook Political Report changed six of its state ratings on Tuesday in Trump's direction, including moving Arizona, Georgia, and Nevada, from \"toss-up\" to \"lean Republican.\" Biden beat Trump in all three of those states in 2020, while Trump won Arizona and Georgia but lost Nevada to Clinton in 2016.", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colorado Springs Gazette"}, "authors": [{"uri": "washington_examiner@gazette.com", "name": "Washington Examiner", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "jack_birle@gazette.com", "name": "Jack Birle", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bennet", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michael Bennet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RealClearPolitics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "RealClearPolitics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cook_Political_Report_with_Amy_Walter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Cook Political Report with Amy Walter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nevada"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Georgia (U.S. state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/gazette.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/a5/7a551a67-b77e-5ee1-8d00-f7175de9a036/668de8f4e735a.image.jpg?crop=800%2C420%2C0%2C56&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719974", "eventUri": "eng-9719974", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

BENNET: Trump Could Win 'By A Landslide'", "body": "In a blow to President Biden's effort to revive his candidacy, Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) said Tuesday night in a televised interview that he believes Democrats could lose the House, the Senate and the White House if Biden remains the party's nominee - calling the trajectory of the race \"very worrisome\" for the future of the country.\n\n\"This is the first time in more than 20 years that a Republican president has been up in this part of the campaign,\" Bennet said in an interview with CNN's Kaitlan Collins. \"Donald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election, and maybe win it by a landslide and take with him the Senate and the House.\"\n\n\"For me this isn't a question about polling; it's not a question about politics. It's a moral question about the future of our country,\" Bennet continued. \"It's critically important for us to come to grips with what we face, if together, we put this country on the path of electing Donald Trump again.\"\n\nSince his faltering June 27 debate performance, Biden has insisted that he has no intention of ending his candidacy and has argued that party elites are trying to force him from the race. At the same time, his aides and allies have aggressively tried to assuage the concerns of Democratic lawmakers and discourage them from speaking publicly about them. To that end, Biden sent a letter to congressional lawmakers on Monday arguing that it was time for the debate over his candidacy to end, because it was distracting from the effort to defeat Trump.\n\nThe Biden team's efforts to stanch any additional defections appeared to be paying off Monday as key party leaders including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.) and Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.), as well as members of the Congressional Black Caucus, voiced strong support for his candidacy.\n\nBut many members have continued to privately express alarm about the president's sliding poll numbers and their doubts that he will be able to regain the confidence of the broad swath of American voters who say they no longer believe he is up to the job.\n\nBennet came forward with his concerns Tuesday after a tense private luncheon with other senators on Capitol Hill. He confirmed that he had aired the same concerns with his colleagues at the lunch earlier in the day. Though he did not explicitly call for Biden to step down, he said in the CNN interview that the White House - since what he described as a \"disastrous debate\" - \"has done nothing to demonstrate that they have a plan to win this election.\"\n\n\"I think they need to do that,\" he added.\n\nDuring the luncheon, Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), who is facing a difficult reelection fight, said he seriously doubted Biden could win the presidential contest, according to two people briefed on that meeting.\n\nWhen asked for comment, Biden campaign spokesperson Kevin Munoz did not directly respond to Bennet's comments, instead maintaining that \"there are a lot of days between now and election day, and the hard work of earning every single vote is far from over.\"\n\n\"No one is more committed to defeating Donald Trump and defending our democracy than Joe Biden, and few know better than Joe Biden the importance of showing up and campaigning to earn the support of voters,\" Munoz said in a statement.", "source": {"uri": "matzav.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "matzav.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bennet", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michael Bennet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide_victory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Landslide victory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Black_Caucus", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Congressional Black Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Tester", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jon Tester"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://matzav.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Screenshot-2024-07-10-at-11.20.53\u202fAM.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719974", "eventUri": "eng-9719974", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 973, "textEnd": 980}], "sentiment": -0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

No Senate Democrats have done so yet, but Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., confirmed Tuesday he told colleagues in a closed-door meeting that he does not believe Biden can win in November.\n\n\"Donald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election, and maybe win it by a landslide, and take with him the Senate and the House,\" Bennet told CNN's Kaitlan Collins.\n\nBennet, who stopped short of calling for Biden to withdraw, cited polling showing the incumbent trailing even before the debate and said he's heard from constituents concerned about the president's age and mental acuity.\n\n\"These are my voters who said to me, 'I have been through this with my mom. I've been through this with my dad. I'm terrified about what it will mean if Donald Trump is elected president again in this country,\" Bennet said.\n\nThe Colorado lawmaker, who ran against Biden for the Democratic nomination in 2020, said he thinks Biden \"has been a really good president\" but added, \"We have to defeat the malignant figure that is Donald Trump.\"\n\n\"I believe those of us that are in these elected office have a moral obligation to the people that we represent and the future of our country ... to do everything we can to make sure their future is as bright as it could be,\" Bennet said. \"And if we just sit on our hands, if we say we're going to disregard what is plainly in front of us and plainly in front of the American people and we end up electing Donald Trump again as president of the United States, that's going to be a huge tragedy beyond epic proportion.\"\n\nDemocratic Sens. Jon Tester of Montana and Sherrod Brown of Ohio also said in Tuesday's private meeting they do not believe Biden can beat Trump, Axios reported. Both are seeking reelection this year in states Trump won in 2020.\n\nTester issued a statement Monday saying Biden \"has got to prove to the American people -- including me -- that he's up to the job for another four years.\"\n\nAlso this week, two top Democrats indicated they have doubts about Biden's electability.\n\nSenate Majority Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois told reporters Monday that Biden's debate performance \"raised a lot of questions\" about the president.\n\nAnd Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state, the longest serving Democrat in the chamber, said in a statement that \"after talking with my constituents, I believe President Biden must do more to demonstrate he can campaign strong enough to beat Donald Trump.\"\n\nAnother prominent figure loaned his voice to the chorus of those urging Biden to step aside, though not one belonging to a lawmaker: Actor George Clooney, a high-profile backer of Democrats who hosted a star-studded Hollywood fundraiser for the incumbent last month.\n\n\"We are not going to win in November with this president,\" Clooney said in an op-ed for The New York Times on Wednesday. \"On top of that, we won't win the House, and we're going to lose the Senate. This isn't only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and congress member and governor that I've spoken with in private. Every single one, irrespective of what he or she is saying publicly.\"\n\nHe urged the party to pick a new candidate ahead of next month's Democratic National Convention.\n\n\"Let's hear from Wes Moore and Kamala Harris and Gretchen Whitmer and Gavin Newsom and Andy Beshear and J.B. Pritzker and others,\" Clooney wrote. Let's agree that the candidates not attack one another but, in the short time we have, focus on what will make this country soar. Then we could go into the Democratic convention next month and figure it out.\n\n\"Would it be messy? Yes. Democracy is messy. But would it enliven our party and wake up voters who, long before the June debate, had already checked out? It sure would. The short ramp to Election Day would be a benefit for us, not a danger,\" Clooney said, later concluding: \"Joe Biden is a hero; he saved democracy in 2020. We need him to do it again in 2024.\"", "source": {"uri": "baynews9.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spectrum News Bay News 9"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_chatelain@baynews9.com", "name": "Ryan Chatelain", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bennet", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michael Bennet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Spectrum News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morning_Joe", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Morning Joe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide_victory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Landslide victory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Tester", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jon Tester"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Pritzker", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

Michael Bennet says he does not believe Biden can win the 2024 election", "body": "DENVER -- In an interview on CNN Tuesday, U.S. Senator Michael Bennet (D - Colorado) said he does not believe President Joe Biden can win the 2024 election.\n\n\"This race is on a trajectory that is very worrisome if you care about the future of this country,\" the senator told CNN's Kaitlan Collins.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, CNN's Dana Bush reported that Bennet -- along with Senators Sherrod Brown (D - Ohio) and Jon Tester (D - Montana) -- told colleagues during a Democratic Caucus lunch that they did not believe Biden could win re-election. Bennet confirmed that report Tuesday evening.\n\n\"It's true that I said that, and I did say that behind closed doors. And you guys and others asked whether I'd said it, and that is what I said. So I figured I should come here and say it publicly,\" Bennet said.\n\nQuestions have been swirling about Biden's ability to win back the presidential seat after a poor debate performance against former President Donald Trump.\n\n\"This is the first time in more than 20 years that a Republican president has been up in this part of the campaign. Donald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election, and maybe win it by a landslide and take with him the Senate and the House,\" Bennet said.\n\nThe senator also accused the White House of not properly addressing said concerns.\n\n\"The White House, in the time since that disastrous debate, I think, has done nothing to really demonstrate that they have a plan to win this election, that they have a convincing plan to win in the battleground states where we have to win in order to win this election. And they need to do that. They have to demonstrate that to the American people,\" Bennet said. \"And by the way, this is not about ignoring the American people's concerns. It's not about brushing off the American people's concerns. They have to address the American people's concerns.\"\n\nHe said he has heard concerns from his Colorado constituents.\n\n\"The people that I represent from Colorado have deep concerns about whether or not the president can win this race,\" Bennet said.\n\nThe senator, however, did not outright call on Biden to step down from the race.\n\n\"This is something for the president really to consider. And I believe those of us that are in these elected offices have a moral obligation to the people that we represent and the future of our country, to the kids that I used to work for in the Denver Public Schools, we have a moral obligation to them to do everything we can to make sure their future is as bright as it could be,\" Bennet said. \"And if we just sit on our hands, if we say we're going to disregard what is plainly in front of us and plainly in front of the American people, and we ended up electing Donald Trump again as president of the United States, that's going to be a huge tragedy beyond epic proportion.\"\n\nPolitics\n\nFallout from Biden debate performance could impact Colorado Congressional races Brandon Richard 5:34 PM, Jul 03, 2024\n\nBennet is not the only Colorado Democrat to question whether Biden should stay in the race. Democratic congressional candidate Adam Frisch called on Biden to step down from the presidential race, saying the country needs \"a new generation of leadership.\"\n\n\"We need a president that can unite America to realize our nation's unlimited potential. We deserve better. President Biden should withdraw from this race,\" Frisch said, adding that while he thanks the president for his years of service, \"the path ahead requires a new generation of leadership to take our country forward.\"\n\nThe Colorado Democratic Party, however, believes Biden is the party's best candidate.\n\n\"The president admitted that he had a rough night, and that's fine. But the fact remains that President Biden proved he is the only candidate in this race with a proven track record of delivering for Colorado and improving the lives of Coloradans,\" said Colorado Democratic Party Chair Shad Murib earlier this month.\n\nPueblo Native To Be Inducted Into The ProRodeo Hall of Fame\n\nPueblo native J.D.

It's a moral question about the future of our country, and I think it's critically important for us to come to grips with what we face if, together, we put this country on the path of electing Donald Trump again.\"\n\nPresident Biden has recently remained resolute, declaring in conference calls and a public letter to Democratic lawmakers that he is the party's nominee and will not step down.

It's not a question about politics, it's a moral question about the future of our country.\"\n\nPelosi, who was speaker of the House until the Republicans regained control of it in the 2022 midterm elections, told MSNBC's Morning Joe that \"it's up to the president to decide if he is going to run\" and said of House Democrats: \"We're all encouraging him to make that decision. Because time is running short.\"\n\nThe Hollywood actor and Democratic fundraiser George Clooney on Wednesday added his voice to the growing number of calls for Biden to drop out. In an opinion article for the New York Times, he expressed concern about the president's showing at a recent fundraiser in Los Angeles, where he \"wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\" Clooney called Biden a friend but said \"the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time\".\n\nBennet's and Pelosi's comments followed a lunch meeting of the Democratic Senate caucus in which Bennet and two other senators, Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Jon Tester of Montana, reportedly said they believed Biden was no longer able to win after the 27 June debate failure, in which he appeared repeatedly confused, lost his train of thought and failed to counter a spate of lies from Trump.\n\nRelated: Who could replace Joe Biden as Democratic nominee? Here are six possibilities\n\nWhile no senators have explicitly called for Biden to step aside - in contrast to seven House members who have appealed to him to abandon his re-election bid - the debate fallout has plunged the Democrats into paralysis as the campaign approaches a key phase.\n\nBiden has emphatically refused to yield to pressure to bow out, writing to the party's congressional contingent en masse to emphasise that he is there to stay and throwing the gauntlet down to doubters to challenge him at next month's convention in Chicago.\n\nHe has secured crucial support from the Congressional Black caucus, although on Wednesday one of its members, Marc Veasey of Texas, became the first to break ranks by telling CNN that Democrats running in tight races should \"distance themselves\" from Biden in an effort to \"do whatever it is they need to do\" to win.\n\nBennet, while stopping short of an all-out call for Biden to withdraw, said that defiant posture was unfitting to the moment - even while voicing empathy for the position of a president who had served his party and country for more than half a century.\n\n\"I'm sure President Biden has a different view of his prospects in this election than I do, but we should be having a discussion,\" he said. \"The White House in the time since that disastrous debate has done nothing to really demonstrate that they have a plan to win.\n\n\"I have not seen anything remotely approaching the kind of plan we need to see out of the White House that can demonstrate that he can actually beat Donald Trump, which is not going to be about the accomplishments that we all had, you know, three and four years ago. This is something for the president to consider.\"\n\nBennet's comments came after a meeting of House Democrats yesterday that failed to produce an expected groundswell of calls for Biden to stand aside but instead saw some previously sceptical members back down in the face of his resolve to continue. Rumbles of discontent among House members continue, however.\n\nThe president himself held a virtual meeting from the White House on Tuesday evening with about 200 Democratic mayors in which he restated his determination to remain and reportedly won their support.\n\nThe 40-minute meeting consisted of Biden talking for the first 20 minutes and taking just three questions - chosen by a moderator, Kate Gallego, the mayor of Phoenix - the New York Times reported.\n\nParticipants could not see who else was on the call or add comments to a chat screen but they were able to show their feelings by adding emojis, with many contributing smiley faces in response to Biden's words.\n\nThe president reportedly called the debate \"a lousy night\". He promised to prioritise housebuilding in his second term and warned the mayors about the consequences of another Trump presidency, focusing on the ex-president's pledge to be a dictator \"only on day one\" and stressing the Project 2025 rightwing blueprint for government, which Trump has recently, though unconvincingly, disavowed.", "source": {"uri": "aol.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title":

It's a moral question about the future of our country.\"\n\n\"We're all here this week to have this discussion, to have this debate,\" Bennet said. \"The White House, in the time since that disastrous debate, I think has done nothing to demonstrate that they have a plan to win this election ... they need to do that.\"\n\nBennet refuted Biden's claim that only the party elite wanted him to drop out of the presidential race. \"These are my voters who have said to me, 'I've been through this with my mom, I've been through this with my dad. I'm terrified about what it will mean if Donald Trump is elected president again in this country.'\"\n\nBiden campaign responded to Bennet's appearance saying, \"No one is more committed to defeating Donald Trump and defending our democracy than Joe Biden, and few know better than Joe Biden the importance of showing up and campaigning to earn the support of voters. This was always going to be a close race.\"\n\nBut last Friday, many Democrats, both in politics and the media, were shocked to hear Biden tell ABC News' George Stephanopoulos last Friday when asked how he would feel if he stayed in the race and then lost to Trump: \"As long as I gave it my all, and did as good of a job as I know I can do. That's what this is about.\"\n\nThose Democrats were wondering if Biden understood the magnitude of change a Trump victory would bring - regardless of whether one is for or against such a massive change.\n\nOther Democrats continued to whistle in the dark, like Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), co-chair of Biden's campaign, who told The Washington Post, \"We need to remember that President Biden for 30 years has been someone who has a stutter, who occasionally misspeaks ... and not judge him by too high a standard.\"\n\nMarina Hyde expressed best the sense of delusion emanating from the Democratic leadership these days, writing in The Guardian, currently a bastion of left-wing anxiety, \"This is all more than beginning to feel like the path over the edge, which the Democratic establishment has thoughtfully plotted out by its truly timeworn tactic of hoping for the best, and in no way preparing for the worst. What's the worst that can happen, ask people who already saw the worst happen once before. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice ... autocracy? As far as Biden's cognitive state is concerned, if only there had been different signs to all the signs there were...\"\n\nFinally, The New York Times offered the best headline to describe the Democrats' zeitgeist: \"On Capitol Hill, Democrats Panic About Biden but Do Nothing.\" Mind you, this is not the headline for an op-ed piece, it is a news report.", "source": {"uri": "jewishpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Jewish Press - JewishPress.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_israel@jewishpress.com", "name": "David Israel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide_victory", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Landslide victory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bennet", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michael Bennet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stephanopoulos", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Stephanopoulos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democracy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Coons", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chris Coons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Op-ed", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Op-ed"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Washington Post"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Guardian"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocracy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Autocracy"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.jewishpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Senator-Michael-Bennet-D-CO.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719974", "eventUri": "eng-9719974", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

It's not a question about politics, it's a moral question about the future of our country.\"\n\nPelosi, who was speaker of the House until the Republicans regained control of it in the 2022 midterm elections, told MSNBC's Morning Joe that \"it's up to the president to decide if he is going to run\" and said of House Democrats: \"We're all encouraging him to make that decision. Because time is running short.\"\n\nRelated: ABC anchor caught on video saying Biden cannot serve four more years\n\nThe Hollywood actor and Democratic fundraiser George Clooney on Wednesday added his voice to the growing number of calls for Biden to drop out. In an opinion article for the New York Times, he expressed concern about the president's showing at a recent fundraiser in Los Angeles, where he \"wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\" Clooney called Biden a friend but said \"the one battle he cannot win is the fight against time\".\n\nBennet's and Pelosi's comments followed a lunch meeting of the Democratic Senate caucus in which Bennet and two other senators, Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Jon Tester of Montana, reportedly said they believed Biden was no longer able to win after the 27 June debate failure, in which he appeared repeatedly confused, lost his train of thought and failed to counter a spate of lies from Trump.\n\nWhile no senators have explicitly called for Biden to step aside - in contrast to seven House members who have appealed to him to abandon his re-election bid - the debate fallout has plunged the Democrats into paralysis as the campaign approaches a key phase.\n\nBiden has emphatically refused to yield to pressure to bow out, writing to the party's congressional contingent en masse to emphasise that he is there to stay and throwing the gauntlet down to doubters to challenge him at next month's convention in Chicago.\n\nBennet, while stopping short of an all-out call for Biden to withdraw, said that defiant posture was unfitting to the moment - even while voicing empathy for the position of a president who had served his party and country for more than half a century.\n\n\"I'm sure President Biden has a different view of his prospects in this election than I do, but we should be having a discussion,\" he said. \"The White House in the time since that disastrous debate has done nothing to really demonstrate that they have a plan to win.\n\n\"I have not seen anything remotely approaching the kind of plan we need to see out of the White House that can demonstrate that he can actually beat Donald Trump, which is not going to be about the accomplishments that we all had, you know, three and four years ago. This is something for the president to consider.\"\n\nBennet's comments came after a meeting of House Democrats yesterday that failed to produce an expected groundswell of calls for Biden to stand aside but instead saw some previously sceptical members back down in the face of his resolve to continue. Rumbles of discontent among House members continue, however.\n\nThe president himself held a virtual meeting from the White House on Tuesday evening with about 200 Democratic mayors in which he restated his determination to remain and reportedly won their support.\n\nThe 40-minute meeting consisted of Biden talking for the first 20 minutes and taking just three questions - chosen by a moderator, Kate Gallego, the mayor of Phoenix - the New York Times reported.\n\nParticipants could not see who else was on the call or add comments to a chat screen but they were able to show their feelings by adding emojis, with many contributing smiley faces in response to Biden's words.\n\nThe president reportedly called the debate \"a lousy night\". He promised to prioritise housebuilding in his second term and warned the mayors about the consequences of another Trump presidency, focusing on the ex-president's pledge to be a dictator \"only on day one\" and stressing the Project 2025 rightwing blueprint for government, which Trump has recently, though unconvincingly, disavowed.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

Joe Biden was nine points up at this time, the last time he was running. Bill Clinton was five points up. This is the first time in more than 20 years that a Republican president has been up in this part of the campaign.\n\nDonald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election. And maybe win it by a landslide and take with it the Senate and the House. So, for me, this isn't a question about polling, it's not a question about politics, it's a moral question about the future of our country. And I think it's critically important for us to come to grips with what we'd face if, together, we put this country on the path of electing Donald Trump again.\n\nIn 2020, Democrats who wanted Biden to be the nominee argued that only he could help down-ballot candidates during the general election; now, several Democrats have come out publicly and said he will damage candidates in swing districts and give up the Senate majority if he remains at the top of the ticket.\n\nBennet is no fan of Trump, yet Biden loyalists will claim the Colorado Senator is a Trump sympathizer because he believes the president can't defeat Trump in November. He added:\n\nI think that we could lose the whole thing, and it's staggering to me. Donald Trump's already been president; I thought he was the worst president that we've ever had.\n\nBennet continued:\n\nI believe those of us who are in this elected office have a moral obligation to the people that we represent ... We have a moral obligation to them to do everything we can to make sure their future is as bright as it can be.\n\nBennet is correct; they do have an obligation to ensure that Americans' future is as bright as possible. However, Bennet is implying that the only way our future will be bright is if Trump loses in November and the Democrats control the Senate and House majority.\n\nThe question is: How could our country's future be bright if, under Democrat control, gas prices remain too high, home prices have reached record highs, families are living paycheck to paycheck, some need to work more than one job, small businesses can't remain open or are forced to raise their prices due to unrealistically higher wages, crime is out of control due to pro-criminal district attorneys, etc.? I know Democrats' response will be \"But Trump...\" while ignoring the issues we currently face. Most of these issues have been around for years; however, they have been accelerated due to the Democrats' left-wing policies. That could be slowed down, at the very least, if not fully stopped, if fed-up citizens make their voices heard, in droves, at the ballot box in November.", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "levon_satamian@redstate.com", "name": "Levon Satamian", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bennet", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michael Bennet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide_victory", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Landslide victory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bill Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_(politics)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Swing (politics)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/179/79faab66-ab39-4e1c-a40c-fb612eac6a5c.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719974", "eventUri": "eng-9719974", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

His performance immediately raised concerns about his ability to win in November, and he has spent the last two weeks attempting to reassure Democrats that he can beat former President Trump.\n\nThe AP reported that Blumenthal told reporters after a Senate Democratic caucus meeting on Tuesday that there was \"absolute unanimity\" in defeating Trump, but he would not say if Biden were the best person to beat Trump.\n\nDuring that caucus meeting, at least three senators -- Sens. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Jon Tester (D-Mont.) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) -- said that they think Biden will lose to Trump in November.\n\nBennet later went on to CNN with anchor Kaitlin Collins and made public his concerns.\n\n\"Donald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election, and maybe win it by a landslide and take with it the Senate and the House,\" Bennet said on CNN. \"For me, this isn't a question about polling. It's not a question about politics. It's a moral question about the future of our country and I think it's critically important for us to come to grips with what we face if together we put this country on the path of electing Donald Trump again.\"\n\nEarlier in the week, Tester had released a statement where he said that \"Biden has got to prove to the American people -- including me -- that he's up to the job for another four years,\" while Brown had said that he has \"talked to people across Ohio\" who \"have legitimate questions about whether the president should continue his campaign.\"\n\nBlumenthal is among a growing number of senior Democrats who have expressed concerns about Biden's ability to win the election.\n\nOn Tuesday, Rep. Adam Smith (D-Wash.), the House Armed Services Committee ranking member who chaired it when Democrats were in power, went public with calls for Biden to step down.\n\nBiden has worked to stem the calls from Congress, sending a letter to congressional Democrats on Monday, saying that he would not drop out. He also went on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" to slam \"elites\" in the party calling him to step down.\n\nOn Tuesday, both the House and Senate Democratic caucuses met, and many House Democrats came out in favor of Biden remaining the nominee.\n\nLater that day, Rep. Mikie Sherrill (N.J.), a moderate House Democrat who flipped a Republican seat in 2018 and is viewed as a future contender of statewide office, also joined calls for Biden to step down. On Wednesday, Rep. Pat Ryan (D-Ohio) also called on Biden to stand down, according to the New York Times.\n\nSmith, Ryan and Sherill join five other House Democrats who have called for Biden to withdraw. No senators have called for his withdrawal yet.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi went onto MSNBC's Morning Joe, where she was asked if she supports Biden as the party's nominee. Pelosi declined to comment, instead deferring to the president.\n\n\"It's up to the president to decide if he is going to run,\" Pelosi said. \"We're all encouraging him to make that decision.

But the comments from such a senior member of the party had already essentially reopened the debate about whether Biden should go.\n\nOregon's Earl Blumenauer on Wednesday became the ninth House Democrat to publicly call on Biden to step aside.\n\nThat all came on the heels of Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet on Tuesday evening voicing the concerns other Democrats have shared privately.\n\n\"Donald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election, and maybe win it by a landslide, and take with him the Senate and the House,\" he told CNN's Kaitlan Collins.\n\nAnother Democrat, Rep. Adam Smith from Washington, agreed with that landslide assessment and implored Biden to reconsider.\n\n\"Don't let this be your legacy, that you refused to step down and got him back in the White House,\" Smith said, referring to Trump, during an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer on \"the Situation Room.\"\n\nAnd New York Rep. Ritchie Torres -- a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, which has been strongly supportive of Biden -- put the potential down-ballot effects of a Biden candidacy bluntly. \"If we are going on a political suicide mission, then we should at least be honest about it,\" he told CNN.\n\nGeorge Clooney, the actor and Democratic fundraiser, is a Biden ally who spent time with him in Los Angeles and cohosted a record-breaking fundraiser for the president's campaign recently. The Biden that disastrously appeared on the debate stage is the same one that he saw in California, Clooney wrote in The New York Times on Wednesday.\n\nNow he argues that Biden needs to step aside so that capable Democrats can come forward to compete for the nomination or face losing control of the entire government. Democrats have been so \"terrified\" of a second Trump term that they ignored warning signs about Biden during the primary, Clooney said.\n\n\"Joe Biden is a hero; he saved democracy in 2020. We need him to do it again in 2024,\" Clooney wrote, appealing to Biden's sense of duty. He's not the only bold-faced Hollywood name raising the alarm. Rob Reiner and Michael Douglas, both Democratic fundraisers, are also on the record.\n\nAnd there are other fundraising concerns: Organizers for at least one Chicago fundraiser scheduled during the Democratic National Convention have decided to not to proceed with the mid-August event, a source with knowledge of the discussions told CNN.\n\nBiden told ABC's George Stephanopoulos during a high-stakes interview last week that he doesn't need to take a cognitive test and prove his fitness to lead because every day in the presidency is a cognitive test.\n\nThat's going to be Biden's curse going forward. No matter how many fiery teleprompter speeches he gives, he likely won't be able to suddenly walk without shuffling or talk in conversation with the steadiness he once did.\n\nThe next of his daily tests will come Thursday, when the president conducts a rare solo news conference at the conclusion of a NATO meeting taking place in Washington.\n\nBiden should be talking about his successful efforts to expand the treaty organization and mobilize it to stand up to Russia, but instead he will face question after question about his fitness to do the job.\n\nStephanopoulos, by the way, who spent time in direct contact with the president, told a passerby secretly recording him on a New York City street that he doesn't think Biden can serve another four years.\n\nNext week, Biden will sit down with \"NBC Nightly News\" anchor Lester Holt for an interview that will tape and air Monday, the network announced\n\nBennet, the Colorado Democrat, became the first senator in his party to publicly say he doesn't believe Biden is capable of winning reelection. Sens. Sherrod Brown and Jon Tester -- the two most vulnerable senators facing reelection -- also said Biden would not win during a meeting in the Capitol, according to a source familiar, CNN reported Tuesday.\n\n\"It's a moral question about the future of our country,\" Bennet said on CNN. \"And I think it's critically important, for us, to come to grips with what we face, if together, we put this country on the path of electing Donald Trump again.\"\n\nHe continued: \"The White House, in the time since that disastrous debate, I think, has done nothing to really demonstrate that they have a plan to win this election.\"\n\nDemocrats are already in a difficult position in the race to control the Senate, since they are defending a larger number of seats than Republicans this cycle. About a third of the Senate is up for election every two years.\n\nCNN's senior political analyst Ronald Brownstein argued Tuesday that a Biden loss could cost Democrats the Senate, which would reverberate for decades since it would give aging conservative justices on the Supreme Court, like Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, cover to resign and solidify the court's conservative majority.\n\nCNN's Road to 270 assessment of the electoral map shows Trump in position to win the election. Georgia, Michigan and Nevada -- all states that Biden won in 2020 -- are all leaning toward Republicans. If Trump wins those three state and all the states he won in 2020, he would have 272 electoral votes, enough to win the election.\n\nCNN Senior data reporter Harry Enten said polling clearly shows Trump is ahead at this point. But he notes that polling this far from the election does not generally represent the final vote.\n\n\"When we're looking at this data we should keep in mind that it's still just July and the election is in November,\" he told CNN's Jim Acosta. \"So we'll just have to wait and see how things shift as things go on from here.\"\n\nThe Democratic leader in the House, Rep. Hakeem Jefferies, has publicly backed Biden, but he has told nervous lawmakers he will take their concerns to the White House, according to CNN's Annie Grayer and Manu Raju.\n\nBut Jeffries brushed off questions about whether Biden is the most effective nominee and said he has no plans to meet with him on Wednesday.\n\n\"Over the last few days, the members of the House Democratic Caucus have had conversations that are candid, constructive and clear-eyed about the path forward, which primarily includes doing everything we can to make sure that we take back the majority in November of this year,\" he told reporters on his way into a meeting with the Congressional Black Caucus.\n\nSome Democrats want to move on from this debate, worrying that it only boosts Trump. \"Donald Trump and the Republicans have loved every minute of watching this discussion,\" Rep. Debbie Dingell, who represents the battleground state of Michigan, told CNN's Jessica Dean.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) reportedly did the same -- though he repeatedly declined to answer questions from reporters, citing his policy of not talking about what happens in caucus meetings.\n\nTester and Brown -- who are seeking reelection in states Trump carried by significant margins in 2020 -- are the party's two most vulnerable incumbents this fall.\n\nAs of Tuesday, there was no clear strategy among Senate Democrats on how to address the president's viability as the party's presidential nominee. While many senior Democrats, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, have said they're standing by Biden, others have insisted the president needs to prove he is up for the job.\n\n\"They have to address the American's people's concerns,\" Bennet said. \"People that I represent from Colorado have deep concerns about whether or not the president can win this race.\"\n\nBiden campaign spokesperson Kevin Munoz issued a statement in response to Bennet's interview. \"This was always going to be a close race -- and the dynamics at play are the ones we've long anticipated: Voters continue to be deeply concerned by Donald Trump and his harmful agenda, and the more we engage and reach out to voters, the more they support President Biden,\" Munoz said.", "source": {"uri": "politico.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "POLITICO"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bennet", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michael Bennet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Tester", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jon Tester"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherrod_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sherrod Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Equestrian/Racing", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Christian_Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Christian Democracy", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/adfbce1/2147483647/legacy_thumbnail/1200x799%3E/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fb3%2Ffa%2Fec1a96514facb291d3571caaa8d8%2Fcongress-senate-45282.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719974", "eventUri": "eng-9719974", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.0980392156862745, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

Blumenthal: 'Deeply Concerned' About Biden Bid", "body": "Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., joined the chorus of congressional Democrats who have gone on the record as saying they are concerned about President Joe Biden's chances of winning on Nov. 5.\n\n\"I am deeply concerned about Joe Biden winning this November because it is an existential threat to the country if Donald Trump wins,\" Blumenthal said Wednesday, according to The Hill. \"So, I think that we have to reach a conclusion as soon as possible, and I think Joe Biden, as the Democratic nominee, has my support.\"\n\nThe senator's remarks come nearly two weeks after Biden's shaky and halting debate performance in which he gave rambling answers in a raspy voice. The White House attempted to explain his widely-panned performance by saying the president had a cold and was exhausted from travel, but concerns were immediately raised about his ability to win his bid for reelection. Biden has been trying to reassure jittery Democrats ever since that he is capable of beating former President Donald Trump.\n\nFollowing a meeting of Senate Democrats on Tuesday, The Associated Press reported that Blumenthal said there was \"absolute unanimity\" in defeating Trump, but declined to say if Biden was the ideal candidate for the job.\n\nSens. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., Jon Tester, D-Mont., and Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, reportedly said during the senators' meeting that they think Biden will lose the election in November, with Bennet later airing his concerns publicly on CNN.\n\n\"Donald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election, and maybe win it by a landslide and take with it the Senate and the House,\" Bennet said. \"For me, this isn't a question about polling. It's not a question about politics. It's a moral question about the future of our country, and I think it's critically important for us to come to grips with what we face if together we put this country on the path of electing Donald Trump again.\"\n\nTester said in a statement earlier in the week that Biden has to \"prove ... that he's up ... for another four years,\" while Brown said people in his home state of Ohio \"have legitimate questions\" about the viability of Biden's campaign.\n\nBlumenthal, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, is one of a growing number of top Democrats who have voiced concerns about Biden's ability to win the presidential contest.\n\nOn Tuesday, House Armed Services Committee Ranking Member Adam Smith, D-Wash., called on Biden to drop out of the race.\n\nAfter a meeting of House Democrats on Tuesday, Rep. Mikie Sherrill, D-N.J., issued a call for Biden to exit the race, and Rep. Pat Ryan, D-N.Y., publicly said on Wednesday that the commander in chief should withdraw.\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., told MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" on Wednesday that \"it's up to the president to decide if he is going to run.\"\n\n\"We're all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short,\" Pelosi said.\n\nNicole Wells \u2709\n\nNicole Wells, a Newsmax general assignment reporter covers news, politics, and culture.

Michael Bennet (D-CO) became the first Senate Democrat to really pour on the pessimism. Bennet said privately, and then admitted publicly, that Biden was on track to lose and drag the whole party down with him. \"I did say that behind closed doors,\" Bennet said, reiterating publicly that \"Donald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election and maybe win it by a landslide and take with it the Senate and the House.\"\n\nDespite that, Bennet is still not willing to call on Biden to drop out. Neither is Rep. Marc Veasey (D-TX) who also doesn't think Biden can win and even called on his colleagues to abandon Biden if that was necessary for them to win reelection. Veasey's own stance is that it would be \"kind of awkward\" if Biden \"is going to come to Texas to campaign, and I said he should drop out.\"\n\nSpeaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is in the same boat. She won't give a concrete answer on whether Biden should stay in but insists that \"It's up to the president to decide if he is going to run. We're all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short.\" This, despite the fact that Biden has made his decision, repeatedly insisting he isn't leaving the race. Pelosi isn't taking yes for an answer from Biden, even as she refuses to give no as an answer on whether Biden should be running.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nUnless this is part of a strategy to slowly build pressure on Biden to drop out of the race, these are crazy things to say about the party's presidential nominee while you support his nomination. Each and every one of these comments can and will be used against Biden throughout the campaign if he stubbornly refuses to drop out, which he has less incentive to do given that Bennet, Pelosi, and Veasey are all refusing to explicitly call on him to do so. With Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY) walking back his call for Biden to withdraw, it seems the momentum in the party is building back around Biden, even as his Democratic colleagues are openly sabotaging him.\n\nDemocrats see the problem with Biden and acknowledge everyone else sees it, but (with a handful of exceptions) they refuse to try and push Biden out of the race. They want credit for acknowledging Biden's decline without actually saying he should leave the race, trying to bleed any political gain from this dilemma without admitting that they were trying to sell voters on Biden and his deteriorating mental state for another four years.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zachary_faria@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Zachary Faria", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bennet", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michael Bennet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Veasey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marc Veasey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Nadler", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Nadler"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/biden-pelosi-time-running-short.webp", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719974", "eventUri": "eng-9719974", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 161, "relevance": 1}

House Democrats had meetings about the state of the race today, in which tensions boiled over. A group of swing state Democrats met before the official meeting to vent their frustrations about the race, with some reportedly breaking down in tears. Some reporters who frequently talk to congressional Democrats admitted that not one has privately said they have the confidence that Biden can run and beat Trump.\n\nSenate Democrats also had a lunch, where Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), like a good soldier, said he's sticking with Biden. There seemed to be a realization that Biden will remain begrudgingly so. Was the dump Biden movement from Hill Democrats dead? Well, things might have been on track to settling down, and then Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO) went on CNN. He sort of had to since his remarks at the lunch got leaked, and he admitted that he was someone who said behind closed doors that Biden can't win.\n\nThe Colorado Democrat was quite dire in his remarks, adding that Donald Trump is poised to win this election in a landslide.\n\n\"I think we could lose the whole thing, and it's staggering to me,\" he told CNN's Kaitlan Collins. Yet, he also said that Biden is an accomplished president -- debatable -- and has a strong affinity for the man as a leader. It's the same chord struck for everyone in the dump Biden crowd: they either love or deeply respect the president, but he needs to go away for the sake of the party.

The film's adaptation differs from the book, with changes in characters and setting, but still retains the essence of Jane Austen's novel. Sutherland's portrayal of Mr. Bennet is one of cinema's most supportive fathers, displaying a deep care for his daughter's well-being.\n\nWith the recent and unfortunate passing of Donald Sutherland, film fans all across the globe are hopefully discovering and revisiting some of his biggest and best-known roles, the ones that have cemented his name into the annals of cinematic history. There is no doubt that fans are reliving his comedic chops from M*A*S*H, his dramatic flair from Ordinary People, or his penchant for stranger roles in Invasion of the Body Snatchers and the Hunger Games franchise, enjoying the revered actor even more so than before. However, one of his more understated performances, and one of his best, is in the 2005 adaptation of Jane Austen's Pride & Prejudice by director Joe Wright. The film tells the story of the five Bennet daughters -- Jane (Rosamund Pike), Elizabeth (Keira Knightley), Mary (Talulah Riley), Kitty (Carey Mulligan), and Lydia (Jena Malone) -- and how their mother (Brenda Blethyn) tries to find successful marriages for each of them in early 19th-century England. Donald Sutherland plays Mr Bennet, the patriarch of the family and a landed gentleman, a part of the landed gentry social class of aristocratic British life who could survive solely on rental income.\n\nSutherland's time on screen is relatively limited compared to the Bennet sisters, their mothers, and the various men with whom they are being set up. However, in his short time, Sutherland manages to create a character of immense warmth and love. The relationship his character has with Elizabeth, the main character in the whole story, is extremely close, with their particularly close bond apparent to all other members of the family. Sutherland often played more villainous figures in his lifetime, or at least anti-heroes, and that is anything but the case here. Playing against type, he brings all the generosity and warmth that the literary character from Austen's novel would require. It is a testament to his craftsmanship that he stands out in a film with such an immense wealth of talent in front of the cameras. Film fans are fortunate to have this performance, among the many others from his titanic oeuvre, left to us after his death.\n\nPride & Prejudice\n\nPG\n\nRomance\n\nDrama\n\nSparks fly when spirited Elizabeth Bennet meets single, rich, and proud Mr. Darcy. But Mr. Darcy reluctantly finds himself falling in love with a woman beneath his class. Can each overcome their own pride and prejudice?\n\nRelease Date November 23, 2005\n\nDirector joe wright\n\nCast Keira Knightley , Matthew Macfadyen , Brenda Blethyn , Donald Sutherland , Talulah Riley , Rosamund Pike , Jena Malone , Carey Mulligan\n\nRuntime 129 Minutes\n\nHow Different is the Adaptation from the Book?\n\nClose\n\nIt is worth first noting that this film takes some leniency with its source material, which can be an especially troubling move when the source material is one of the most loved, most treasured, and most re-readable novels ever written in the English language. Screenwriter Deborah Moggach had originally wanted to stay as faithful to the novel as possible for that reason, not wanting fans to appear like Kathy Bates in Misery and detest the changes she had made. However, she eventually created what she called a \"muddy hem version\" with the support of Wright in the director's chair. The film is set in a slightly earlier period than that in which the novel is set. This takes the story out of the clean Regency world of the original novel. The Longbourn family home of the Bennet family seems to be more chaotic in the film than in the novel, more rugged, modest, and naturalistic too.\n\nSome of the most significant changes made in the film, however, are in the characters. Mr Darcy, played memorably by Matthew MacFayden, is more awkward and vulnerable than his literary counterpart. Darcy in the novel is far more aloof and proud, changing over the course of the novel. Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Bennet is more spirited and forthright, showing more modern sensibilities naturally than her character in the novel. Elizabeth comes across as wittier and more intelligent in the novel, whereas her film version is more outspoken and brash. These changes do not necessarily make the tone of the film especially different from the tone of the novel, but the artistic decisions made by both Wright and Moggach have to be respected for transplanting the novel successfully onto the silver screen with the more modern sensibilities that come with making a film in the 21st century.\n\nRelated\n\nThe 15 Best Donald Sutherland Movies, Ranked\n\nFrom 'The Dirty Dozen' to 'Ordinary People' to 'The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,' this is Collider's ranking of the best Donald Sutherland movies.\n\nSutherland's character, too, is rather different from the version Jane Austen penned. Mr. Bennet is a sarcastic and detached father, always seemingly on his way to his library in the novel. His character and Elizabeth seem to have a lot more in common, with their wit and interests more in line with one another than with any other member of the family. He even comes across as a bit of a bully in the novel, scorning Mrs. Bennet for never giving him a son who will inherit the estate and chastising her for his own folly in marrying her. Sutherland's Mr Bennet, however, while retaining that sarcasm and sharpness, is a lot warmer on-screen. He is more openly affectionate towards his daughters in the film version, with physical touches a lot more prevalent than in the novel. He frequently smiles, touches their shoulders, and looks at them with a gentle, affectionate gaze. This physical closeness is indicative of a deeper emotional bond.\n\nSutherland's Mr Bennet is One of Cinema's Most Supportive Fathers\n\nMr Bennet throughout the film proves to be one of the most loving and supportive fathers seen in cinematic history, particularly towards Elizabeth but certainly towards all his daughters. He gives a tearful Mary Bennet an encouraging hug after her awkward performance on the piano at the Netherfeld Ball. It was Mr. Bennet himself who told her that she had \"delighted us long enough\" in order to get her to end her performance early and save herself from social embarrassment. That is a father looking out for his children. The wry smile and warmth on his face when he says \"Good heavens,\" as he is greeted at the door of his library by his daughters is one of the strongest moments of genuine laughter and joviality in the film.\n\nIt is his relationship with Elizabeth, though, that is far and away the closest and most supportive. One of the film's most powerful scenes is when Mrs. Bennet races to get Mr. Bennet to talk some sense into Elizabeth after she rejects the proposal of Mr Collins (Tom Hollander). Initially stunned into silence, Mr. Bennet then presents 'Lizzy' with her two options, stating that she will only be on speaking terms with one parent from this day forth. As he tells her that \"your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\", both Lizzy and Mrs. Bennet are taken aback by this impressively progressive stance. Mr. Bennet could even be considered to be one of cinema's best examples of a feminist father, though using such a term would require a lot of historical contextualization, too. For a film to watch for Father's Day, perhaps, Pride & Prejudice would not be a bad shout at all, so great is the performance of Donald Sutherland in the patriarchal role.\n\nThe other main scene where the audience sees the affection that Mr. Bennet has for Lizzy is when she enters his study room to learn of his decision about her potential marriage to Mr. Darcy. With tears in his eyes, he says \"You really do love him, don't you?\" in a moment of such sweetness and tenderness. The scene could draw water from a stone because of how beautiful it is. The soaring, gorgeous piano score by Dario Marianelli only further elevates the emotive power of the scene. As the piano swoons and the orchestra joins in, Mr Bennet says that he \"could not have parted with you, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy\" and the emotional climax of the scene is reached, with Elizabeth affectionately kissing her father's forehead. Mr. Bennet's emotional response to Elizabeth's happiness reveals, above all else, his deep care for her well-being.\n\n'Pride & Prejudice' Is One of Donald Sutherland's Best Roles\n\nDonald Sutherland plays the role of Mr. Bennet about as perfectly as any actor could have done. His performance is a lesson in richness and warmth on-screen, his long eyes gazing affectionately at his daughters continually. He defends his daughters to the ends of the earth and values their happiness over the societal expectations of them time and again. In spite of the short time for which he appears in the film, his performance leaves a mark upon the viewer that they have watched a film where familial love is one of the most prominent themes, with Mr. Bennet its most prominent defender. He helps provide the viewer with one of the great comfort watches of 21st-century cinema.\n\nThe entire filmography of Donald Sutherland is a journey through the whole spectrum of human emotion. He played the hero, the villain, and everything in between. He rarely played such a role as Mr. Bennet, however, and it is true that what is rare is wonderful. The film is marvelous anyway, but Sutherland makes it a truly wondrous watch, one that new audiences and fans of the book alike will continue to find as loving and amusing as his performance deserves. It ought to be a truth universally acknowledged that this is a glorious performance in a glorious film. May he rest in peace knowing fans can enjoy this performance forever and always.\n\nPride & Prejudice is available to rent on Amazon in the U.S.\n\nWatch on Amazon", "source": {"uri": "collider.com",

They're Doing Great.", "body": "The indecision in Congress makes sense. But it's leading toward one outcome.\n\n\"Oookey dokey,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer opened his weekly press conference on Tuesday, showing no signs that he'd just emerged from a multihour lunch with the members of his caucus, spinning their wheels about a plausible path forward for the presidential election.\n\nYou know Democrats have a problem when Schumer has studiously avoided saying much about the leading topic in the news, in this case for nearly the past two weeks. At this press conference, after Schumer and other Democratic senators did their best to push across their message about Republicans' hostility to abortion rights, the leader was ready to field questions. (\"I want to call on a woman first,\" Schumer said, since Democrats had been \"talking about abortion.\")\n\nThe first question was about whether he was confident President Joe Biden had what it takes to win in November and serve the next four years.\n\nTwo questions later, thoughts on a statement the previous night from Sen. Patty Murray -- who had conveniently left the press conference by that point -- suggesting that Biden consider dropping out?\n\n\"As I've said before, I'm with Joe.\"\n\nThe Senate Democrats' meeting, from which senators emerged with tight lips and pabulum about a \"productive meeting\" but no answers on whom Democrats should run for president, wasn't the Hill's only such gathering of the day. House Democrats held a similarly downcast chat at their morning caucus, with one member telling Punchbowl News that it felt like a \"funeral.\" Plenty of members and senators seem to think that Biden is destined to lose. Not a whole lot are willing to walk the plank publicly on telling him to drop out, given that there is still zero indication that Biden will -- and they don't want to say something they can't take back.\n\nBiden, indeed, was still the presumptive Democratic nominee for president as of Tuesday night. And so long as there's a lack of consensus about what to do -- and consensus does not appear to be just around the corner -- Biden will remain the nominee.\n\nHouse Democrats, especially, seemed a long ways away from dumping Biden after their Tuesday meeting, despite chatter that a deluge of defections was coming.\n\nBiden got the House fire under control not by pure dumb luck. For a president who has such trouble communicating clearly, Biden and his team have done an expert job constructing a wall of support in the chamber. In the fight for his survival, Biden has no bigger ally among House Democrats than the Congressional Black Caucus, the most powerful Democratic faction in the body, with whom Biden spoke on Monday night. Biden's work to save his candidacy in 2024 resembles the way he did it in 2020 after punishing losses in the first few Democratic primaries: by leaning on his core support among Black members and railing against the \"elites\" who've written him off. Biden has also protected his left flank by reaching out over the weekend to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and earning her support. He has also earned that of fellow Squad members Ilhan Omar and Ayanna Pressley.\n\n\"The matter is closed,\" Ocasio-Cortez said Monday night.\n\nIs it, though? While Biden has stayed an open revolt in the House for now, that could all change after more private polling and analytics come back -- along with some lawyering around complications that could accompany the choice to switch the ticket -- or should Biden have another well-publicized setback. And should there be a move against Biden, it would look much different from the current trickle of a member here or there. The dam would break at the instruction of House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Speaker Emeritus Nancy Pelosi.\n\nAnd Pelosi pointedly left that door open in a television interview Wednesday morning. When asked on MSNBC whether Biden had her support to remain atop the head of the ticket, Pelosi didn't give a straight answer.\n\n\"It's up to the president to decide if he is going to run,\" Pelosi said. \"We're all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short.\"\n\nBiden has not quite the anchor in the Senate that he has in the House. That doesn't mean, however, that Senate Democrats are any closer to moving against him. A plan from Virginia Sen. Mark Warner to organize a group of senators to urge Biden to reconsider his run was scuttled, with Biden campaign co-chair Cedric Richmond issuing a sharp warning to those like Warner that they risked alienating their Black base.\n\nSuch threats from the Biden campaign, though, haven't suppressed the angst. In their caucus meeting Tuesday, Sens. Jon Tester, Sherrod Brown, and Michael Bennet reportedly stated that they believed that Biden couldn't win in November. Bennet confirmed that he had said that in a television interview Tuesday night, during which he unloaded.\n\n\"Donald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election, and maybe win it by a landslide, and take with him the Senate and the House,\" Bennet told CNN, adding, \"The White House, in the time since that disastrous debate, I think, has done nothing to really demonstrate that they have a plan to win this election.\"\n\nNot all Senate Democrats were on the same page, though. Trusty Delaware Sen. Chris Coons, Biden's loyal home-state defender, made the case for Biden. And Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has argued that Biden has a path to victory by making a sharper economic contrast with Trump.\n\nSo what consensus was there from the Senate meeting?\n\n\"There was certainly consensus on this critical point,\" Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal said, \"that we need to defeat Donald Trump.\" It is indeed the organizing purpose of the Democratic Party to win elections, so it's good that they have consensus on that.\n\nIt is easy to mock congressional Democrats for their indecisiveness. I came right up to it at the end of that last paragraph and decided that it was time to wrap things up. Because the indecisiveness here does seem proportional to the weight of the decision that needs to be made. Some Democrats think that the stakes are too high to venture into the unknown mess that could arrive if Biden, who has beaten Trump once, were to drop out. The idea that a last-minute swap can be executed and solve the problem has a tinge of fantasy to it. The counter to that would be that, well, it's looking as if Trump will beat Biden, so why not try anything else? If you think about this and come down firmly on one side, you're probably not thinking hard enough.\n\nBut the upshot of this indecisiveness is that each day that congressional Democrats aren't in agreement about what to do is another day that Biden survives. And if you're the White House, you're counting five more days until the Republican National Convention could, potentially, steal the media's glare away from what has been the only politics story since the presidential debate on June 27.", "source": {"uri": "slate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Slate Magazine"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jim_newell@slate.com", "name": "Jim Newell", "type": "author",

And on Wednesday, uncertainty about the president's prospects grew with comments from former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and as actor and Democratic donor George Clooney called on Biden to voluntarily step aside.\n\nColorado Sen. Michael Bennet was among three Democrats who privately voiced fears that Biden couldn't win in November, sources told CNN's Dana Bash, and then became the first of his colleagues to go public.\n\n\"It's true that I said that,\" Bennet told CNN's Kaitlan Collins. \"Donald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election and maybe win it by a landslide and take with him the Senate and the House.\" He added: \"So for me, this isn't a question about polling. It's not a question about politics. It's a moral question about the future of our country.\"\n\n\"The White House, in the time since that disastrous debate, I think, has done nothing to really demonstrate that they have a plan to win this election.\"\n\nBennet's remarks do not represent the public position of all Democratic senators but there is no doubt the debate and its aftermath have created deep concern in the party.\n\nPelosi referred to that anxiety among members when she appeared to suggest that, despite Biden's insistence he's going nowhere, the issue of his spot on the Democratic ticket was still uncertain. \"It's up to the president to decide if he is going to run. We're all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short,\" she said on MSNBC Wednesday morning. \"I want him to do whatever he decides to do and that's the way it is.\"\n\nAnd in a remarkable op-ed in The New York Times, Clooney turned on the president after appearing alongside him at a fundraiser last month.\n\n\"It's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fund-raiser was not the Joe 'big F-ing deal' Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate,\" Clooney wrote. \"We are not going to win in November with this president,\" he warned, adding that the lawmakers he has spoken with privately shared this view.\n\nThe last two weeks have badly weakened Biden's standing in a party already unenthusiastic about his campaign. His terrible stretch threatens to further narrow an already tenuous path to reelection against an invigorated Trump, who burst back onto the campaign trail Tuesday night with a blistering rally in Florida, nine days before he accepts the Republican nomination.\n\nDeep disquiet over the president's prospects hung over shaken Democratic senators and representatives in Washington Tuesday, as venting sessions took place behind closed doors at both ends of the US Capitol.\n\nBut no critical mass of lawmakers emerged to seriously threaten Biden's hold on the nomination and the party's Senate and House leaders offered clear, if hardly effusive, support for the president. Ultimately, Biden's warning in a letter to lawmakers on Monday -- \"I am firmly committed to staying in this race\" -- and the knowledge that primary voters have spoken left his critics little leeway to act. Pelosi on Wednesday morning again implied that the question of the Democratic ticket was not closed. She advised Democrats, \"just hold off, whatever you're thinking, either tell somebody privately but you don't have to put that out on the table until we see how we go this week.\" After Pelosi's comments went viral, a spokesperson said in a statement that the former speaker \"fully supports whatever President Biden decides to do.\"\n\nAnother Democrat, Rep. Ritchie Torres, offered a stark warning to CNN about the potential down-ballot effect of Biden's reelection bid Wednesday: \"If we are going on a political suicide mission, then we should at least be honest about it.\"\n\n\"There must be a serious reckoning with the down-ballot effect of whomever we nominate,\" Torres also said in a statement.\n\nBiden will face a fresh test on Thursday when he holds a solo press conference at the end of the NATO summit. Any slip-ups or confusion would rip off the fragile patch Biden has fixed on the dam of Democratic Party support.\n\nThe spectacle of a party debating the viability, strength and mental capacity of its nominee less than four months from Election Day encapsulates the crisis that has consumed the president's campaign. There is little evidence so far that Biden is ready to throw himself into saturation-level town halls, campaign swings and media blitzes that many Democrats -- including those who think he should stay in the race -- have called on him to do. Some Democrats now see him as unlikely to win in November. And for all of them, the vibe is existential because Trump, the Republican presumptive nominee, has rarely been in a stronger political position since jumping into presidential politics.\n\nBiden survives a critical day\n\nTuesday had been seen as a critical day for Biden because it was the first time lawmakers gathered en masse since the debate late last month and the July Fourth recess that followed. But even as the number of lawmakers calling for him to step aside ticked up, the president so far this week has managed to stabilize the post-debate crisis.\n\n\"We do want to turn the page. We want to get to the other side of this,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters, although Biden's parlous political fortunes as the oldest-ever president mean this may be an impossible aspiration.\n\nStill, Biden delivered one of his strongest recent public appearances in welcoming world leaders to the NATO summit in Washington Tuesday, even if the effect of aging was obvious in his diction and movements. \"Remember, the biggest cost and the greatest risk will be if Russia wins in Ukraine. We cannot let that happen,\" he said, while lauding the \"single greatest, most effective defense alliance in the history of the world.\"\n\nThe boldness of Biden's rhetoric was a reminder that the summit should have been all about showcasing his leadership as one of the most significant leaders of the West since World War II and setting up a contrast with Trump, who spent his first term berating America's European allies. Instead, the event has turned into a test of the president's acuity.\n\nWhite House officials told CNN's Kayla Tausche that Tuesday's speech went off as planned and that staff hoped that Biden could now go back to \"business as usual.\" That's unlikely to happen because every public event by the president has turned into an excruciating vigil with everyone braced for gaffes, awkward moments or freezes. And his every on-camera appearance is refracted through the prism of a debate performance that seared an unflattering picture of a struggling Biden on the minds of 50 million viewers. It's a low bar for a president to get through a short, scripted speech on a teleprompter at a summit without having a catastrophe. And Biden's often glacial pace in big public moments creates poignant contrasts with the wise-cracking force of nature that he used to be.\n\nThe equation is unlikely to change over the next four months because it's endemic to this matchup and the president's decision to run for a new term that would end when he is 86.\n\nBiden needs one of his classic comebacks more than ever\n\nStill, it's too early to count Biden out. Voters decide elections, not critical lawmakers or scathing media commentary. The president has repeatedly defied predictions of his political demise and has found inner steel in a life scarred by personal tragedy and political disappointments. And Trump, the first former president to be a convicted criminal, has an uncanny capacity to alienate moderate, suburban, and swing voters with his extreme rhetoric and threats against his opponents. The ex-president will be back center stage next week at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, which is likely to turn into a MAGA festival that the Biden camp sees as a chance to reinforce the contrast with Trump that the president's debate nightmare obliterated for the last two weeks.\n\nMost post-debate national polls suggest Biden lost at least a couple of points to Trump in what had been a race inside the margin of error. There is little high-quality polling in swing states so far that spans the debate aftermath. But Biden was generally seen as trailing Trump in many of the battlegrounds that will decide the election before the debate, which he needed to use to reset his clash with Trump. Instead, he created reverse momentum that he's still not arrested. And it's not just a question of the horse race. Biden was unable to use his debate answers to frame a sharp contrast with Trump on the most important issues to Democrats, including abortion, taxes, character, and the ex-president's perceived threat to democracy and founding US values. This - along with Biden's somewhat delusional disbelief in his own mid-30s approval rating and the apparent state of the race - fueled Democratic despair.\n\nThat sense of disappointment with Biden was on display as lawmakers filed into their meetings on Tuesday, with many declining to speak to reporters on the way out. A source familiar with the Democratic Senate lunch told CNN's Bash that as well as Bennet, Sens. Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Jon Tester of Montana told colleagues they don't think Biden can beat Trump.\n\n\"It's true that I said that,\" Bennet told CNN's Kaitlan Collins later Tuesday. \"Donald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election and maybe win it by a landslide and take with him the Senate and the House.\"\n\nSen. Angus King, an independent from Maine who caucuses with Democrats, said senators believe Biden must take on unscripted situations to answer questions from voters. King, asked what would happen if Biden stumbled in such settings, replied: \"It seems to me that's a risk they have to take. If he's OK, it shouldn't be a problem.\"\n\nOne of Biden's most fervent supporters, Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman, defended the president. \"We concluded that Joe Biden is old; we found out, and the polling came back that he's old,\" Fetterman told CNN. \"But we also agreed that he's our guy.\"\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who is rarely reluctant to speak at length, was asked several times about Biden but only replied, \"I'm with Joe,\" in an apparent attempt to shut down the line of questioning.\n\nBiden got a boost when New York Rep. Jerrold Nadler, who had privately expressed doubts about the president's spot on the ticket, said he'd now support him. But the New York Democrat hinted that his decision had as much to do with the difficultly of pushing the presumptive party nominee aside as a feeling that he was a strong bet. \"I'm not resigned to it. He made very clear he's going to run. He's got an excellent record, one of the most excellent presidents of the last century. Trump would be an absolute disaster for democracy; so, I'm enthusiastically supporting Biden,\" Nadler said.\n\nThe president has also been bolstered by the support of the Congressional Black Caucus, a vital power player in the House Democratic Caucus. Many of the CBC's members are in solid blue districts and may be under less pressure than frontline Democrats who have criticized the president's debate performance. Texas Rep. Marc Veasey expressed concern for those vulnerable colleagues when criticizing Biden's attempt to bounce back from the debate. \"Whatever I have seen so far hasn't shown me that that's going to be enough to get there. I just don't think that dog is gonna hunt,\" Veasey told CNN's Manu Raju. \"I think that he has a long way to go and I think there are stronger candidates that would be more likely to beat Trump at this point, but if he says that he is going to stay in, (then) he's the nominee,\" Veasey said.\n\nRep. Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey lavished praise on Biden's presidency and his victory over Trump in 2020 but became the seventh House Democrat to call on him to stand aside on Tuesday. \"Because I know President Biden cares deeply about the future of our country, I am asking that he declare that he won't run for reelection and will help lead us through a process toward a new nominee.\"\n\nSome Democratic leaders sought to jump their members out of their angst by launching an attack against Trump. \"Every single member of the House Democratic Caucus is clear eyed about what the stakes of this election are,\" said Rep. Pete Aguilar, the chairman of the caucus. \"Donald Trump cannot be allowed near the Oval Office and his extremist allies must never be allowed to pass a national abortion ban or their dangerous Project 2025, which would erode our democracy and enable Trump's worst impulses,\" the California Democrat said. But the strength of his presentation in a press conference only served to highlight the lines of attack that Biden largely missed in the debate.\n\nThere was a brighter mood around the Democratic ticket in Las Vegas, where Vice President Kamala Harris displayed the forensic rhetoric of a former prosecutor to attack Trump. \"I will say that someone who vilifies immigrants, who promotes xenophobia, someone who stokes hate should never again have the chance to stand behind a microphone and the seal of the President of the United States,\" Harris said.\n\nFor those Democrats who think Harris would make a better nominee than the president, her fiery delivery was a reminder of an alternative 2024 path that Biden has acted to close off.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

It's a moral question about the future of our country.\"\n\nHe added: \"I'm sure President Biden has a different view of his prospects in this election than I do. But we should be having a discussion about that.\n\n\"We're all here this week to have this discussion, to have this debate. The White House, in the time since that disastrous debate, I think has done nothing to demonstrate that they have a plan to win this election... They need to do that.\"\n\nThere has been growing concern among Democrat politicians, advisers and donors over Mr Biden's health, mental acuity and capacity for the job - particularly following an abysmal performance in a TV debate against Trump last month. Many Democrats have expressed fears that continuing with Mr Biden as their candidate could cost them not only the White House but both houses of Congress in November.\n\nExperts were doubtful over the possibility of a Trump landslide, however. Dr Gift said: \"I'm sceptical that anyone knows how this election is going to turn out, even if you checked out now with the polls, it's still within the margin.\n\n\"[Mr Biden] can still win this, but he is down right now, and I would certainly say that the odds of a Trump landslide are greater than the odds of a Biden landslide. So it's certainly not outside the realm of possibility.\"\n\nLeslie Vinjamuri, director of the US and Americas programme at Chatham House and professor of international relations at Soas, agreed that concerns about Mr Biden's future were helping Trump, having removed focus from the Republican candidate's \"very serious\" flaws.\n\n\"But the idea of a landslide victory is predicated on the assumption that Democrats critical of Biden would switch their vote to Trump,\" she told .\n\n\"More likely they would either begrudgingly vote for Biden out of a profound fear for the threat Trump presents to democracy. Or they would stay home. Neither of these scenarios bodes well for President Biden. One deprives him of the legitimacy and support that is critical for governing, the other likely puts Trump in the White House.\"\n\nMr Biden has repeatedly said that he will not withdraw from the presidential race.\n\nOn Tuesday a seventh House Democrat, Mikie Sherrill, called on Mr Biden to declare that he would not run for re-election, posting on X: \"I realise this is hard, but we have done hard things in pursuit of democracy since the founding of this nation. It is time to do so again.\"\n\nAfter their TV debate at the end of June, Trump led Mr Biden by 2.1 percentage points, according to the national polling average from Fivethirtyeight.com, a change from just before the debate, when Mr Biden had a small lead. Polls also suggest that Trump has a lead in the battleground states of Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\nHowever, the party's leadership continues to back him publicly. Kamala Harris, the Vice-President, repeated her backing for Mr Biden at a campaign rally in Nevada on Tuesday, calling him a \"fighter\". He \"is the first to say, when you get knocked down, you get back up\", she said. Furthermore, no members of the Senate have said in public that he should stand aside.\n\nMr Biden faces a make-or-break couple of days as he hosts world leaders for the Nato summit in Washington DC, during which Republicans, allied countries, and his own party will be looking out for any sign of the gaffes or confusion of the kind he has previously displayed.\n\nAttention is focused on a press conference by Mr Biden on Thursday evening at the end of the summit, when he will take questions from the media, before heading to Michigan on Friday for a campaign rally.\n\nDr Gift said this week or next could be make or break. \"Biden is on the world stage so any gaffe or misstatement or garbled language will be magnified under the microscope, so he certainly needs to get through this week in order to salvage his candidacy,\" he said.\n\n\"He wants to avoid any leaks from private meetings where other world leaders or their aides are making pejorative comments about his age or his mental acuity. I think this next week or two are going to make or break his chances of staying in the race.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Trump, 78, has stepped up his attacks on Mr Biden and Ms Harris, indulging in a bizarre rant on Tuesday in which he insisted that Mr Biden had raised the price of bacon four-fold.\n\n\"We don't eat bacon any more,\" he said, and returning to a bizarre exchange from the debate over who was a better golf player, he challenged Mr Biden to a game.\n\n\"It will be among the most watched sporting events in history, maybe bigger than the Ryder Cup or even the Masters,\" he said.",

Michael Bennet of Colorado on Tuesday night expressed doubt that the president will be able to beat former President Donald Trump in November, in the most critical comments made publicly by a Senate Democrat so far in the aftermath of the debate.\n\n\"Donald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election, and maybe win it by a landslide, and take with him the Senate and the House,\" Bennet said on CNN, though he stopped short of calling on Mr. Biden to step aside.\n\nThe Colorado Democrat pointed to where the president stands in polls at this point, as compared to where he stood against Trump at this time in 2020, as well as where Hillary Clinton stood against Trump in 2016, saying \"this race is on a trajectory that is very worrisome.\"\n\nExplaining why he isn't calling on the president to step aside, Bennet said that \"we're all here this week, to have this discussion, to have this debate,\" about the president's prospects, though he added that the White House has \"done nothing\" to demonstrate a plan to win the election following the debate.\n\nThe comments come after congressional Democrats met on Tuesday, following a July 4 holiday recess that kept them out of Washington since the debate last month. House Democrats met Tuesday morning for what one member described as a \"listening session.\" And Senate Democrats held a lengthy meeting Tuesday afternoon that left some touting unity within the caucus, though most remained tight-lipped about the details of the meeting. Neither meeting appeared to yield a path forward for the party.\n\nParticularly in the Senate, Democrats have adopted a wait-and-see approach, with no Senate Democrats having publicly called for the president to step aside. Instead, a number of Democrats, like Sen. Patty Murray of Washington, have outlined that they want to see more from the president, saying he \"must do more to demonstrate he can campaign strong enough to beat Donald Trump.\"\n\nOutside of the Capitol, another admission about the president's ability to serve another term made waves late Tuesday, when a video surfaced from TMZ showing ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos saying about the president that \"I don't think he can serve four more years.\" Stephanopoulos conducted the first interview of the president last week since his debate about the path forward.\n\nThe developments come as top Democrats have continued to back the president, albeit with reserved statements of support. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries reiterated his support for the president this week, saying, \"I made clear publicly the day after the debate that I support President Joe Biden and the Democratic ticket. My position has not changed.\"\n\nAfter Tuesday's meeting, Jeffries told reporters that members had an opportunity to express themselves, and \"those discussions will continue throughout the balance of the week.\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, repeatedly asked about the president's ability to serve another four years during a weekly news conference following the Senate meeting, simply said \"I'm with Joe.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bennet", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Michael Bennet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NATO"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide_victory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Landslide victory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakeem_Jeffries", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hakeem Jeffries"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Schumer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chuck Schumer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Independence Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patty_Murray", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patty Murray"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_leaders_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stephanopoulos", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Stephanopoulos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ABC News"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/07/10/b536a555-4ac3-4ba1-a1e3-82fcf2c40fa9/thumbnail/1200x630g3/ee2ff1b44795b97fc01bf6eef3706117/gettyimages-2160760407.jpg?v=2287029998c5246c93d6dd038eb30603", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719974", "eventUri": "eng-9719974", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-04", "textStart": 2397, "textEnd": 2403}], "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 150, "relevance": 1}

Sherrod Brown (D-OH). He continues to stick to his \"cowardly\" remarks, though, as Bernie Moreno, the Republican nominee, has highlighted.\n\nPer NBC News' Henry Gomez, Brown claimed \"I'm not a pundit\" when asked about Biden. \"I've talked to people across Ohio. They have legitimate questions about whether the president should continue his campaign, and I'll keep listening to people,\" he also said as part of his non-answer.\n\nFormer and potentially future President Donald Trump won Ohio in 2016 and 2020 by about 8 points, and is almost certainly expected to not only win the state again in November, but do so by even wider margins.\n\n\"Sherrod Brown votes with Joe Biden nearly 100 percent of the time, so it is unsurprising that he is standing by Biden as his obvious cognitive decline and inability to lead our nation is on full display to the American people,\" said Moreno in a statement from Monday. \"Sherrod and Joe have been friends and political allies for many years, so does anyone truly believe that Sherrod wasn't fully aware of Biden's decline long before his disastrous debate performance? Voting for Biden's job-killing, open border agenda is bad enough, but helping him deceive the people of Ohio by cowardly refusing to be truthful about Joe's obvious decline is unforgivable.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, it looked like Brown was changing his tune, but going with the theme of cowardice, that he was doing so \"behind closed doors.\"\n\nCNN's Dana Bash shared over X that he, speaking from the Democratic caucus lunch, was among those who \"do not believe that President Biden can win the election.\"\n\nMontana's Jon Tester is another particularly vulnerable Democratic incumbent running for reelection. Either race could decide which party controls the Senate.\n\n\"Sherrod Brown tells Ohioans one thing and says another behind closed doors among Washington insiders,\" said Moreno in a Tuesday statement. \"Brown votes with Biden nearly 100 percent of the time and has helped this administration destroy the economy and keep our southern border wide open. Now that Biden is in trouble, Brown is running from his record of voting in lockstep with his longtime friend for Biden's disastrous agenda.\"\n\nMoreno has highlighted Brown's voting record with Biden before, just as he did with an ad released on the day of the debate on June 27.\n\nManu Raju, also of CNN, reminded over X on Wednesday morning how standoffish the vulnerable incumbent has been.\n\nBennet was also included in the names of Democratic senators who feel Biden can't run for reelection. As Matt covered earlier on Wednesday, Bennet was more willing to really sound the alarm in his Tuesday night CNN apappearance:\n\nThe Colorado Democrat was quite dire in his remarks, adding that Donald Trump is poised to win this election in a landslide.\n\n\"I think we could lose the whole thing, and it's staggering to me,\" he told CNN's Kaitlan Collins. Yet, he also said that Biden is an accomplished president -- debatable -- and has a strong affinity for the man as a leader. It's the same chord struck for everyone in the dump Biden crowd: they either love or deeply respect the president, but he needs to go away for the sake of the party. Bennet added that he doesn't think Colorado is in play, but Collins also said as the interview continued that he seemed to be navigating toward a path where he calls Biden to step aside.\n\nBennet didn't answer the question, instead saying that he feels the country's future is at stake. Well, you pretty much said that Joe Biden, senator, is the person who could sink the ship. Will Democrats s**t or get off the pot on this one?\n\nNot only was it telling how Bennet was full of dread, but he didn't even answer the question.", "source": {"uri": "townhall.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Townhall"}, "authors": [{"uri": "rebecca_downs@townhall.com", "name": "Rebecca Downs", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherrod_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sherrod Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behind_closed_doors_(sport)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Behind closed doors (sport)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coattail_effect", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Coattail effect"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate_Democratic_Caucus", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Senate Democratic Caucus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Tester", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jon Tester"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montana", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Montana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide_victory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Landslide victory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2023/4/b3502257-94e3-4171-8a5f-330d1dfde728.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719974", "eventUri": "eng-9719974", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 2715, "textEnd": 2722}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 149, "relevance": 1}

Meanwhile, Trump is a crazy felonious authoritarian.\"\n\nBut even staunch Biden supporters say he needs to show the American public that he has the mental acuity and physical stamina to run a winning campaign over the next four months to defeat Trump, let alone, if he wins, to govern through early 2029, when he would leave office at 86.\n\nCredit : Voice of America (VOA), Photo Credit : Associated

Nearly all were tight-lipped on Tuesday following caucus-wide meetings focused squarely on whether Biden should step aside after his halting and at times incoherent debate performance against former President Donald Trump.\n\nThe trend was not without exceptions. Two new House Democrats have called on Biden to drop out this week, while Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO) revealed Tuesday night that he doubted the president can win in November.\n\n\"I just think this race is on a trajectory that is very worrisome,\" Bennet told CNN. \"Donald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election and maybe win it in a landslide.\"\n\nYet the degree of restraint shown since lawmakers returned from a two-week recess stands in stark contrast to what had until this point been a public airing of grievances over Biden. A raft of operatives and sympathetic editorial boards called on him to make way for a new nominee in the days after the debate, while anonymous lawmakers spoke to the media in apocalyptic terms about their election prospects with Biden as the nominee.\n\nWashington had been bracing for the freakout to balloon as Democrats faced a deluge of questions from the Capitol Hill press corps. But leadership has largely managed to get their ranks in line as they weigh a path forward.\n\nDemocrats breezed by reporters on Tuesday, declining to divulge anything from their meetings that might hint at Biden's fate. In one moment of tension, an exacerbated Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), the No. 3 Democrat in the Senate, refused to say whether any of her colleagues called for the president to step aside at their lunch.\n\n\"No, I'm not going to. I'm not going to,\" she said. \"This was a private family discussion. I'm sorry, guys.\"\n\nThe guarded posture reflects an emerging consensus that public criticism of Biden could be politically damaging if he remains the nominee. It's also a welcome sign for the White House, which has attempted to take the wind out of critics' sails through a combination of outreach and public displays of defiance.\n\nThe president is by no means safe, however. Lawmakers will be watching intently to see if Biden fumbles at the NATO summit on Thursday when he holds a rare press conference.\n\n\"We have a ways to go,\" Sen. Peter Welch (D-VT), a critic of Biden's handling of the fallout, said upon leaving the Senate lunch.\n\nTuesday's meetings allowed Democrats to begin to get on the same page and, importantly, air their frustrations to leadership. In one of the few leaked details, CNN reported that Bennet but also two other senators, Sens. Jon Tester (D-MT) and Sherrod Brown (D-OH), predicted Biden's loss in November.\n\nLeadership, for its part, tried to avoid the appearance of putting a thumb on the scale in support of the president.\n\nSen. Dick Durbin (D-IL), the Senate majority whip, told the Washington Examiner he intended to use the session to \"listen,\" while Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) did not take sides, according to one senator who attended, only speaking to set the terms of the discussion.\n\nThe senators who did engage with reporters generally called their meeting \"constructive,\" though there was no hiding that the question of Biden's fitness continues to divide Democrats.\n\n\"I'm not going to get into the private conversation we just had in the caucus,\" said Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE), a key Biden ally, \"but folks expressed a range of views in ways that I think were constructive and positive.\"\n\nFor now, that means Democrats find themselves in a strange state of waiting. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) is among the lawmakers declining to say one way or another whether Biden should step aside.\n\nMeanwhile, the criticism that is being delivered has come with a degree of message discipline. The general line from skeptics is they want to see more \"vigor\" from Biden following the debate, a litmus test that leaves them wiggle room should he remain at the top of the ticket.\n\n\"He needs to effectively and aggressively continue making his case to the American people,\" Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) said.\n\nEven House leadership has signaled the uncertainty hanging over Biden. Schumer and Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), the top Democrat in the House, refuse to offer anything more than perfunctory statements of support for Biden.\n\nRep. Pete Aguilar (D-CA), the chairman of the House Democratic conference, gave an open-ended response Tuesday when asked if Biden is doing enough to ease the concerns of his colleagues.\n\n\"My answer is, you know, we'll see,\" he told reporters.\n\nBiden has found important congressional allies, particularly in the House. Leaders of the black and Hispanic caucuses have closed ranks around Biden, dismissing his debate performance as \"one bad night\" despite broader fears of cognitive decline.\n\nYet the debate has so unsettled the party that members are conducting a wholesale reevaluation of their campaign strategy as polls show the president and even Vice President Kamala Harris, his most likely replacement, trailing Trump.\n\n\"There was a lot of time spent talking about our lack of a compelling economic message,\" Coons said of the Senate lunch, calling Bennet and Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) \"really forceful on this point.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\n\"Some of it turned into a discussion or a debate about whether reproductive freedom, which is what we have focused on before this week, is the most compelling issue in the election, or economic inequality and opportunity,\" he added.\n\nCoons went on to describe the conversation as focused on how to \"amplify both.\"", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Michael Bennet appeared on CNN to confirm reports about what he'd said during a closed-door meeting of the Democratic Caucus about the state of the presidential election.\n\nJoining CNN's \"The Source with Kaitlan Collins,\" the host wasted no time raising a report from her colleague Dana Bash that, along with Montana Sen. Jon Tester and Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown, Bennet had expressed his \"worrisome\" belief that Biden can't win the 2024 election.\n\n\"It's true that I said that,\" the lawmaker expressed before reasoning, \"Joe Biden was 9 points up at this time the last time he was running. Hillary Clinton was 5 points up. This is the first time in more than 20 years that a Republican president has been up in this part of the campaign.\"\n\n\"Donald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election, and maybe win it by a landslide,\" he continued before adding, \"and take with him the Senate and the House.\"\n\nWhile he contended that his own state wasn't in play for the GOP leader come November, Bennet's concern came as Cook Political Report shifted six states closer to Trump's favor including Arizona, Georgia, and Nevada moving from \"Toss Up to Lean Republican\" and Minnesota, Nebraska's 2nd District, and New Hampshire shifting from \"Likely Democrat to Lean Democrat.\"\n\n\"The White House in the time since that disastrous debate, I think has done nothing to really demonstrate that they have a plan to win this election, that they have a convincing plan to win in the battleground states where we have to win in order to win this election and they need to do that,\" lamented the congressman.\n\nBennet refused to go so far as to be the first Democrat from the Senate to call for Biden to step aside even as the president's communications team has struggled to recoup from the debate performance and deflect reports that a movement specialist repeatedly visited the White House.\n\n\"I could have diagnosed him from across the mall,\" said board-certified neurologist Dr. Tom Pitts who contended that the president was suffering from a neurodegeneration disease and was exhibiting \"hallmarks of Parkinson's.\"\n\n\"His motor symptoms are degenerating. He has Parkinsonisms. That is a fact. He has degeneration of the brain. Show me the MRI. Show me he doesn't. Put your money where your mouth is. He definitely has it,\" the specialist argued.\n\nOn Bennet's unwillingness to call for Biden to step aside, Collins wondered if he was \"resigned to the fact\" that the continued campaign could spell Republican control of the upper chamber until \"the end of the decade.\"\n\n\"That would be an American tragedy,\" tried the senator without advancing a path forward outside of fearmongering over what a potential second term for Trump would look like.\n\nWe have no tolerance for comments containing violence, racism, profanity, vulgarity, doxing, or discourteous behavior.

Michael Bennet was among three Democrats who privately voiced fears that Biden couldn't win in November, sources told CNN's Dana Bash, and then became the first of his colleagues to go public.\n\n\"It's true that I said that,\" Bennet told CNN's Kaitlan Collins. \"Donald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election and maybe win it by a landslide and take with him the Senate and the House.\" He added: \"So for me, this isn't a question about polling. It's not a question about politics. It's a moral question about the future of our country.\"\n\n\"The White House, in the time since that disastrous debate, I think, has done nothing to really demonstrate that they have a plan to win this election.\"\n\nBennet's remarks do not represent the public position of all Democratic senators but there is no doubt the debate and its aftermath have created deep concern in the party.\n\nThe last two weeks have badly weakened Biden's standing in a party already unenthusiastic about his campaign. His terrible stretch threatens to further narrow an already tenuous path to reelection against an invigorated Trump, who burst back onto the campaign trail Tuesday night with a blistering rally in Florida, nine days before he accepts the Republican nomination.\n\nDeep disquiet over the president's prospects hung over shaken Democratic senators and representatives in Washington Tuesday, as venting sessions took place behind closed doors at both ends of the US Capitol.\n\nBut no critical mass of lawmakers emerged to seriously threaten Biden's hold on the nomination and the party's Senate and House leaders offered clear, if hardly effusive, support for the president. Ultimately, Biden's warning in a letter to lawmakers on Monday -- \"I am firmly committed to staying in this race\" -- and the knowledge that primary voters have spoken left his critics little leeway to act. Despite this, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, speaking on MSNBC Wednesday, urged fellow Democrats to \"just hold off, whatever you're thinking, either tell somebody privately but you don't have to put that out on the table until we see how we go this week.\"\n\nBiden will face a fresh test on Thursday when he holds a solo press conference at the end of the NATO summit. Any slip-ups or confusion would rip off the fragile patch Biden has fixed on the dam of Democratic Party support.\n\nThe spectacle of a party debating the viability, strength and mental capacity of its nominee less than four months from Election Day encapsulates the crisis that has consumed the president's campaign. There is little evidence so far that Biden is ready to throw himself into saturation-level town halls, campaign swings and media blitzes that many Democrats -- including those who think he should stay in the race -- have called on him to do. Some Democrats now see him as unlikely to win in November. And for all of them, the vibe is existential because Trump, the Republican presumptive nominee, has rarely been in a stronger political position since jumping into presidential politics.\n\nBiden survives a critical day\n\nTuesday had been seen as a critical day for Biden because it was the first time lawmakers gathered en masse since the debate late last month and the July Fourth recess that followed. But even as the number of lawmakers calling for him to step aside ticked up, the president so far this week has managed to stabilize the post-debate crisis.\n\n\"We do want to turn the page. We want to get to the other side of this,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters, although Biden's parlous political fortunes as the oldest-ever president mean this may be an impossible aspiration.\n\nStill, Biden delivered one of his strongest recent public appearances in welcoming world leaders to the NATO summit in Washington Tuesday, even if the effect of aging was obvious in his diction and movements. \"Remember, the biggest cost and the greatest risk will be if Russia wins in Ukraine. We cannot let that happen,\" he said, while lauding the \"single greatest, most effective defense alliance in the history of the world.\"\n\nThe boldness of Biden's rhetoric was a reminder that the summit should have been all about showcasing his leadership as one of the most significant leaders of the West since World War II and setting up a contrast with Trump, who spent his first term berating America's European allies. Instead, the event has turned into a test of the president's acuity.\n\nWhite House officials told CNN's Kayla Tausche that Tuesday's speech went off as planned and that staff hoped that Biden could now go back to \"business as usual.\" That's unlikely to happen because every public event by the president has turned into an excruciating vigil with everyone braced for gaffes, awkward moments or freezes. And his every on-camera appearance is refracted through the prism of a debate performance that seared an unflattering picture of a struggling Biden on the minds of 50 million viewers. It's a low bar for a president to get through a short, scripted speech on a teleprompter at a summit without having a catastrophe. And Biden's often glacial pace in big public moments creates poignant contrasts with the wise-cracking force of nature that he used to be.\n\nThe equation is unlikely to change over the next four months because it's endemic to this matchup and the president's decision to run for a new term that would end when he is 86.\n\nBiden needs one of his classic comebacks more than ever\n\nStill, it's too early to count Biden out. Voters decide elections, not critical lawmakers or scathing media commentary. The president has repeatedly defied predictions of his political demise and has found inner steel in a life scarred by personal tragedy and political disappointments. And Trump, the first former president to be a convicted criminal, has an uncanny capacity to alienate moderate, suburban, and swing voters with his extreme rhetoric and threats against his opponents. The ex-president will be back center stage next week at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, which is likely to turn into a MAGA festival that the Biden camp sees as a chance to reinforce the contrast with Trump that the president's debate nightmare obliterated for the last two weeks.\n\nMost post-debate national polls suggest Biden lost at least a couple of points to Trump in what had been a race inside the margin of error. There is little high-quality polling in swing states so far that spans the debate aftermath. But Biden was generally seen as trailing Trump in many of the battlegrounds that will decide the election before the debate, which he needed to use to reset his clash with Trump. Instead, he created reverse momentum that he's still not arrested. And it's not just a question of the horse race. Biden was unable to use his debate answers to frame a sharp contrast with Trump on the most important issues to Democrats, including abortion, taxes, character, and the ex-president's perceived threat to democracy and founding US values. This - along with Biden's somewhat delusional disbelief in his own mid-30s approval rating and the apparent state of the race - fueled Democratic despair.\n\nThat sense of disappointment with Biden was on display as lawmakers filed into their meetings on Tuesday, with many declining to speak to reporters on the way out. A source familiar with the Democratic Senate lunch told CNN's Bash that as well as Bennet, Sens. Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Jon Tester of Montana told colleagues they don't think Biden can beat Trump.\n\n\"It's true that I said that,\" Bennet told CNN's Kaitlan Collins later Tuesday. \"Donald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election and maybe win it by a landslide and take with him the Senate and the House.\"\n\nSen. Angus King, an independent from Maine who caucuses with Democrats, said senators believe Biden must take on unscripted situations to answer questions from voters. King, asked what would happen if Biden stumbled in such settings, replied: \"It seems to me that's a risk they have to take. If he's OK, it shouldn't be a problem.\"\n\nOne of Biden's most fervent supporters, Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman, defended the president. \"We concluded that Joe Biden is old; we found out, and the polling came back that he's old,\" Fetterman told CNN. \"But we also agreed that he's our guy.\"\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who is rarely reluctant to speak at length, was asked several times about Biden but only replied, \"I'm with Joe,\" in an apparent attempt to shut down the line of questioning.\n\nBiden got a boost when New York Rep. Jerrold Nadler, who had privately expressed doubts about the president's spot on the ticket, said he'd now support him. But the New York Democrat hinted that his decision had as much to do with the difficultly of pushing the presumptive party nominee aside as a feeling that he was a strong bet. \"I'm not resigned to it. He made very clear he's going to run. He's got an excellent record, one of the most excellent presidents of the last century. Trump would be an absolute disaster for democracy; so, I'm enthusiastically supporting Biden,\" Nadler said.\n\nThe president has also been bolstered by the support of the Congressional Black Caucus, a vital power player in the House Democratic Caucus. Many of the CBC's members are in solid blue districts and may be under less pressure than frontline Democrats who have criticized the president's debate performance. Texas Rep. Marc Veasey expressed concern for those vulnerable colleagues when criticizing Biden's attempt to bounce back from the debate. \"Whatever I have seen so far hasn't shown me that that's going to be enough to get there. I just don't think that dog is gonna hunt,\" Veasey told CNN's Manu Raju. \"I think that he has a long way to go and I think there are stronger candidates that would be more likely to beat Trump at this point, but if he says that he is going to stay in, (then) he's the nominee,\" Veasey said.\n\nRep. Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey lavished praise on Biden's presidency and his victory over Trump in 2020 but became the seventh House Democrat to call on him to stand aside on Tuesday. \"Because I know President Biden cares deeply about the future of our country, I am asking that he declare that he won't run for reelection and will help lead us through a process toward a new nominee.\"\n\nSome Democratic leaders sought to jump their members out of their angst by launching an attack against Trump. \"Every single member of the House Democratic Caucus is clear eyed about what the stakes of this election are,\" said Rep. Pete Aguilar, the chairman of the caucus. \"Donald Trump cannot be allowed near the Oval Office and his extremist allies must never be allowed to pass a national abortion ban or their dangerous Project 2025, which would erode our democracy and enable Trump's worst impulses,\" the California Democrat said. But the strength of his presentation in a press conference only served to highlight the lines of attack that Biden largely missed in the debate.\n\nThere was a brighter mood around the Democratic ticket in Las Vegas, where Vice President Kamala Harris displayed the forensic rhetoric of a former prosecutor to attack Trump. \"I will say that someone who vilifies immigrants, who promotes xenophobia, someone who stokes hate should never again have the chance to stand behind a microphone and the seal of the President of the United States,\" Harris said.\n\nFor those Democrats who think Harris would make a better nominee than the president, her fiery delivery was a reminder of an alternative 2024 path that Biden has acted to close off.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 CNN.

Michael Bennet rings alarm about Biden as other lawmakers offer support, silence", "body": "U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet said Tuesday night that he believes Donald Trump is on a trajectory to win the presidential election -- \"maybe in a landslide\" -- amid fallout from President Joe Biden's halting debate performance.\n\n\"For me, this isn't a question about polling, it's not a question about politics -- it's a moral question for the future of our country,\" the Colorado senator told CNN's Kaitlan Collins during her prime time show, warning that a Trump victory would be \"an American tragedy.\" He suggested Republicans may win control of Congress, too.\n\n\"I think we could lose the whole thing,\" he added about the November election, calling the situation \"staggering.\"\n\nBut Bennet repeatedly declined to say whether Biden should step down as the Democratic Party's presumptive nominee, which would open the door for others to seek the nomination before the August convention.\n\nBennet's comments came after reports that he and two other senior Democratic senators told colleagues earlier Tuesday that Biden was on a path to lose. His comments were the most forceful condemnation of his party's trajectory of any voiced publicly to date by Colorado's seven congressional Democrats. The others have offered either support or silence as concerns have mounted about Biden's ability to win.\n\nU.S. Rep. Diane DeGette told The Denver Post on Tuesday that Biden had her full support. She said his public appearances since the June 27 debate had convinced her that he could win in November.\n\nColorado's other senator, John Hickenlooper, has also backed Biden.\n\nBennet, who told CNN that voters he's spoken to have likened the president's condition to an aging parent, has sent increasingly concerned messages since the late June debate. He had said in a statement Sunday that Biden must \"reassure\" voters of his abilities, adding that he would discuss \"the most viable path forward\" with fellow senators. (A Bennet spokesman did not return messages seeking comment late Tuesday afternoon.)\n\nOn Tuesday night, Bennet suggested Biden had not done enough to reassure voters.\n\n\"The White House, in the time since that disastrous debate, I think, has done nothing to demonstrate that they have a plan to win this election, that they have a convincing plan to win in the battleground states,\" he said.\n\nHis apparently rising alarm stood in contrast with DeGette, who said her concerns had been assuaged.\n\nAfter the debate, during which Biden spoke quietly and haltingly and appeared to fully lose his train of thought at least once, DeGette, of Denver, said in a statement that Biden needed to \"intensify his efforts to reassure voters\" that he could continue on as president.\n\nOn Tuesday, DeGette told The Post that she had received that reassurance through Biden's subsequent media and public appearances as she's \"basically been trying to watch everything.\" She said she'd also spoken with him Tuesday morning during a bill signing ceremony.\n\n\"He was articulate, cogent and knew everything that he was talking about,\" she said, referring to a conversation they had about the NATO summit in Washington, D.C. \"As I said in my statement, like everybody else, I was shocked at the performance in that debate, and I've known the president for almost 30 years now.\"\n\n\"I've been trying to see, 'Do I think he's competent for both reelection and to serve another term?' And I can't help but say, 'Yes, he is.' \" said DeGette, the longest-serving member of Colorado's congressional delegation.\n\nU.S. Rep. Brittany Pettersen, a freshman member of the delegation, said in a statement that it was up to Biden to decide whether to stay in the race or not.\n\nNearly half of the state's seven Democrats in Congress did not return messages seeking interviews or comments in recent days. Repeated messages sent to U.S. Rep. Joe Neguse's office were not returned; Neguse is the fourth-ranking Democrat in the House. The office of U.S. Rep. Yadira Caraveo, a freshman who sits in what is likely to be one of the most hotly contested seats in America come November, also did not return requests for comment.\n\nNo one from U.S. Rep. Jason Crow's office would comment on the record.\n\nBennet's criticism and DeGette's support comes as Biden seeks to shore up support on Capitol Hill and prevent further internal calls for him to step aside. National polling shows Biden trailing Trump, and subsequent polls about Biden's fitness show broad voter concern about the 81-year-old's age.\n\nThough Trump is 78 and has faced sharp criticism over his own fitness for office, his age has been less of a focal point than Biden's.\n\nDeGette -- the only member of Colorado's Democratic delegation to agree to an interview -- blamed the media for focusing on Biden's debate performance and age, though it's an issue that polls consistently show is a concern for a majority of American voters.\n\nShe said the focus instead should be on Trump's ability to lead the country, his party's anti-abortion stances and the repeated falsehoods he told at the debate.\n\n\"I understand the issue du jour is Joe Biden's abilities,\" DeGette said. \"I do believe he has the capabilities, and he's our nominee.\"", "source": {"uri": "denverpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Denver Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "seth_klamann@denverpost.com",

Understanding that Joe Biden is headed toward defeat, they've also come to the conclusion that there's nothing they can do about it -- that unless Biden willingly steps aside, their side is doomed to failure. Three senators -- including Jon Tester and Sherrod Brown, fighting to hold on in competitive elections this fall -- said this out loud to their colleagues behind closed doors. The third, Michael Bennet of Colorado, was willing to say it publicly on CNN, even invoking the prospect of a \"landslide\" that results in Republicans winning the Senate and the House. Even Nancy Pelosi seemed skeptical of Biden's prospects on Morning Joe, where she said, \"It's up to the president to decide if he is going to run. We're all encouraging him to make that decision. Because time is running short.\"\n\nThe Biden White House's frame of this situation is that it is \"Washington elites\" who are pushing him out. In fact, the opposite is true -- as numerous commentators have pointed out, the DC elites are late to come to this conclusion. It's just that, prior to the debate, virtually none of the state activists or leaders were willing to raise the voice of concern lest they be labeled a traitor to the cause of \"defending democracy\" or somesuch. As one Democratic state party chair admitted to NBC: \"I wish I was more brave.\"\n\nNow, after nearly two weeks of this story dominating all news, even with Democrat officials publicly voicing opposition, even with the heights of media like the New York Times calling for Biden to step aside, Washington Democrats think they're trapped with Joe: destined to lose, with no way out of their predicament.\n\nThat's the vibes talking, because this just isn't the case. It's also totally at odds with the lesson they and the media spent teaching their voting base for the past several years -- that this is a win-at-all-costs election about whether democracy survives or not. If you really believe that fanciful argument, you should be ready to pull out all the stops, including forcing Joe Biden out, in order to win.\n\nNate Silver writes at length about this in his latest newsletter, and he makes three key points that shouldn't escape notice. First, Joe Biden was already tracking toward losing this election before the debate debacle. Gaslighting from the likes of Stephen Colbert aside, it's one of the reasons Biden's team demanded such an early debate, to achieve a reset. Second, that nothing the Biden White House has done since the debate to make attempts to clean things up has worked, not with the media, not with donors and not with voters. And third, there is no legal requirement for delegates to the Democratic convention to cast their votes for Biden -- in fact, they can invoke the \"conscience clause\" of their party bylaws to oppose Biden. This doesn't mean that they will do it, or even need to -- the point is, they can conceivably make that threat. If Biden wants to go nuclear, they can, too.\n\nThere's another point I'd add to this, which should be obvious to any observer. We're only beginning to see the fallout from this debate and the following rolling disaster show up in the polling data in swing states across the country. (And not even swing states -- the lead headline in Politico today is that Biden could be in trouble in New York.) Those numbers are going to keep rolling in, and they're likely to get worse -- not just because the Biden campaign has no functional strategy for getting back on their feet, but because we'll almost assuredly see a convention bounce from the RNC next week on top of it.\n\nSo what's the alternative for Democrats? The fantastical suggestions of a convention blitz of competition between candidates isn't realistic. There is only one alternative: pushing Biden aside for Kamala Harris. Beyond avoiding a host of legal and fundraising complications, she now polls better than Biden against Donald Trump. And for all the concerns about her foibles, delegates and party leaders can make the case that whether Biden really wanted to be a transitional president or not, he was going to be if he achieved re-election. No one thought that he would make it another four years, so cut out the farce and vote for the person who was going to be president by the end of the term anyway.\n\nDemocrats were already running behind in 2024 before Joe fell apart. The aim at this point should be to erase the concerns of a landslide election and to protect their hold on the Senate. Achieving this with Harris is at this point much more realistic than achieving it with Biden.\n\nThere's one more step to consider. It wasn't lost on many of Biden's allies that perhaps his worst answer to any question on debate night was to a softball question about the issue that has dominated and motivated Democratic wins over the past two years -- abortion. As someone who was no rabid pro-abortion advocate until it became necessary for his political career, Joe's just not comfortable talking about the issue.\n\nDonald Trump wants to make the 2024 election about the economy and immigration, and all his finalists for his vice presidential pick look to be men. If Democrats want to change the issue set for this election to abortion and guns and diversity, if they want to hold on to suburban women and compete in the blue wall states again, then a Kamala Harris-Gretchen Whitmer ticket could achieve just that. It might not be enough to beat Trump, but it could avoid the landslide that Democrats fear today.", "source": {"uri": "thespectator.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Spectator World"},

Joe Biden appeared to have finally tamped down a Democrat mutiny yesterday after making it clear he wouldn't withdraw from the presidential race. Nor could Democrats come up with any rational process by which to replace him ... or even a candidate who could save them from the trainwreck that would result.\n\nDemocrats are essentially stuck with Biden if he won't do the honorable thing -- not that Joe has done much that could be called honorable in his career. Having caught a big whiff of the FO that followed the party's FA in preventing any meaningful primary challenge, the Colorado Democrat told CNN that Biden would likely lead them into the biggest political box canyon in 40 years:\n\nCOLLINS: You heard from Senator Schumer there. There was this long, lengthy lunch that Senate Democrats had today. And after, my colleague, Dana Bash, reported that you, Senator Jon Tester, and Senator Sherrod Brown, all said during that lunch that you don't think President Biden can win in 2024. Is that true?\n\nBENNET: Well, it's true that I said that. And I did say that behind closed doors. And you guys and others asked whether I had said it. And that is what I said. So, I figured I should come here and say it publicly.\n\nCOLLINS: Why do you think he can't win in November?\n\nBENNET: I just think the -- this race is on a trajectory that is very worrisome, if you care about the future of this country. Joe Biden was nine points up at this time -- the last time he was running. Hillary Clinton was five points up. This is the first time in more than 20 years that a Republican president has been up in this part of the campaign. Donald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election, and maybe win it by a landslide, and take with him the Senate and the House.\n\nAnd so, for me, this isn't a question about polling. It's not a question about politics. It's a moral question about the future of our country. And I think it's critically important, for us, to come to grips with what we face, if together, we put this country on the path of electing Donald Trump again.\n\nMost of the rest of this is typical Democrat hysteria over the prospect of a second Trump term, completely disconnected from the realities of the first Trump term. Get ready for a lot more of this, by the way; with an aphasiac nominee at the top of the Democrat ticket, they have little choice but to invert FDR's famous slogan and hope it works down-ballot. All they have to sell is fear itself at this point if Biden won't leave.\n\nNote well that this fear isn't even selling with Biden himself, by the way. If he really believed his own demagoguery, he'd have already stepped aside.\n\nOther than the hysteria, Bennet's correct about the situation, perhaps more than he knows. CNN's Harry Enten laid out the bad polling news this week, noting that Trump is the first Republican presidential nominee to lead aggregate polling in July since 2000. Democrats have decided to throw in the towel and stick with Biden, as the Washington Post reported last night, but that won't solve the Biden problem. In fact, it probably makes it worse.\n\nFirst: The American public realized that Democrats and the media (but I repeat myself) have been lying to them for at least two years and maybe five years about Biden's cognitive incapacity. And not just lying, but actively gaslighting us by claiming that the clear evidence of senility Biden displays are nothing but \"cheap fakes\" and \"ableism,\" or nasty attacks on Biden's supposed stutter. Democrats have already torched their credibility, thanks to Biden's unerringly stupid strategic instincts in demanding a prime-time debate with Donald Trump.\n\nThat brings us to the second and more serious problem. If Biden won't leave, Democrats have no choice but to rally around him literally days after publicly suggesting or outright declaring that Biden is too non compos mentis for a second term. Their opponents all the way down the ballot will run ads with those clips and ask voters why Democrats running for the House and Senate are endorsing someone they know to be too ill to do the job.\n\nYou'd better believe that Bennet's right about the unprecedented political trap that Biden set for them, and into which they keep walking. There's a reason Republicans from Trump on down have been vewwwy, vewwwy quiet (to use an Elmer Fudd voice) for the last two weeks, and that's because Democrats are too busy destroying themselves without GOP help.

The Colorado Democrat often uses his husky voice to discuss wonky topics like why Democrats should not lift the cap on state and local tax deductions that Republicans put in place with the Trump tax cuts, and sounds like the former superintendent of Denver Public Schools he once was.\n\n\"Well, look, I don't think the American people sent us to Washington to cut taxes for rich people,\" he told The Independent in an interview. \"And the reality is we've had since 2001 about $8 trillion in tax cuts, almost all of that has gone to the wealthiest people in this country during a time when we've got the greatest income inequality that we've had since the late 1920s.\"\n\nWhen he ran for president in 2019 and 2020, he dropped out without winning any delegates and regularly criticized Medicare for All proposals by Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren as being unrealistic.\n\n\"I think I describe it as my not very well noticed presidential campaign,\" he joked.\n\nMr Bennet launched his campaign largely after he gave a speech on the floor of the US Senate floor excoriating Republican Senator Ted Cruz during the government shutdown of 2018 and 2019. During that time, he criticised Mr Cruz for shutting down the government in 2013. But the viral moment failed to make him launch as progressives largely supported Mr Sanders and Ms Warren while moderate voters preferred his colleague Senator Amy Klobuchar or Pete Buttigieg. Od course, voters ultimately picked President Joe Biden.\n\nThen the coronavirus pandemic hit and when Congress passed the CARES Act under the Trump administration, Mr Bennet teamed up with Senator Ron Wyden to tack on an additional $600 a week on unemployment insurance. That was reduced to $300 a week in Mr Biden's American Rescue Plan Act.\n\nSimilarly, when Mr Biden passed his signature Covid relief legislation, he included another one of Mr Bennet's policies that he championed during the 2020 presidential campaign: an expanded child tax credit that was fully refundable and gave families making $150,000 a year-and single parents making up to $112,500 for single-parent households-$300 a month for children for every child under six years old and $250 for children between six and 17 years old.\n\nIn turn, Mr Bennet has turned into one of the most prolific voices in politics not just on child poverty, but in general. He has worked with Mr Sanders - whom he criticized in the primary - to make sure the lift on the SALT Cap, a priority for Democrats in California, New York and New Jersey, isn't a giveaway to the rich. Similarly, he was part of a group of eight senators who passed the 2013 immigration reform bill that ultimately died.\n\nMr Bennet said he was interested in passing policies he knew would be possible if he lost his presidential run and returned to Colorado, which is an evenly-divided state politically.\n\n\"And that's what I set out to do and I think that's what I did. And I'm glad there's been some take up of those policies. I think there was a lot of overlap in a number of the things that I proposed and what Joe Biden ran on.\"\n\nIt also helps that one of the early adopters of the tax credit was now in the White House. Initially, Mr Bennet introduced the credit through the American Family Act with Senator Sherrod Brown, a populist progressive from Ohio. But the second person to sign on as a cosponsor was then-California Senator Kamala Harris. A Bennet aide said on the condition of anonymity that the senator reached out to the Vice President before the Biden administration's plan was passed through Congress.\n\nMr Bennet said he began thinking about child poverty when he was superintendent of Denver Public Schools, the role he held before he was appointed to fill the Senate seat of Ken Salazar, who joined the Obama administration as Secretary of Interior. Mr Bennet said he frequently saw parents who worked two or three jobs and still couldn't get themselves out of poverty regardless of what they did.\n\n\"And what I know from that experience is that it's not that people aren't working, they're working incredibly hard, but they cannot afford housing or healthcare, higher education or early childhood education,\" he said. \"But it's the cost of those building blocks of liberating your kids from poverty or feeling like you've got a middle class life, the cost of those has outstripped the wage increases that people have had. And I came to see the Child Tax Credit as the most elegant way of trying to deal with that problem.\"\n\nMr Bennet's oldest friend in the Senate, fellow Coloradoan John Hickenlooper, hired him as his chief of staff when Mr Hickenlooper was Mayor of Denver.\n\n\"He has always been engaged on kids, in every facet, always,\" Mr Hickenlooper said. \"I've only been here a year, but I see him as one of the two or three or four real moving forces behind the child tax credit.\"\n\nMr Hickenlooper, who went on to serve as governor of Colorado and also ran for president before dropping out to stage a successful challenge to Republican Senator Cory Gardner, said Mr Bennet has helped him learn the Senate.\n\n\"He's been the best mentor I've ever had,\" he said. \"He's been overly generous, exceedingly generous in his help.\"\n\nMr Wyden, who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee who worked with him on unemployment insurance, complimented his work as well.\n\n\"I went to school on a basketball scholarship and I don't know of any higher compliment than to say that Michael Bennet comes to play every day,\" he said, saying he and Mr Bennet had looked at unemployment for some time and said he had been negotiating with the Trump administration during the Covid-19 pandemic's onset. \"That bill was also historic in that it also covered gig workers.\"\n\nAt the same time, Mr Bennet's work on both issues is facing major political peril. Plenty of Republican governors ended the expanded unemployment insurance on the premise that it prevented people from seeking work and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell criticised the programme. Second, January marks the first month parents will not see the monthly payments, after Senator Joe Manchin killed fellow Democrats' proposed Build Back Better Act and largely criticised the Child Tax Credit because he worried it went to people making too much money and wanted to make sure that it could go to grandparents raising children.\n\nBut a Bennet aide said that the senator told Mr Manchin, a conservative Democrat from West Virginia, that grandparents are already eligible because they can claim them on their taxes. Similarly, the aide noted how the credit is already means-tested.\n\nFor his part, Mr Bennet said he will continue speaking to Mr Manchin.\n\n\"I've given him a little bit of a break over the holidays, but I've talked to him extensively before then, and I'll talk to him extensively again,\" he said. \"And the last thing we should be doing is doubling the rate of childhood poverty in this country.\"\n\nRepublican Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, who has crafted his own child tax credit plan, said he and Mr Bennet have discussed their different child tax credits.\n\n\"We both concluded it was a priority. I like my plan better than the president's but I'd be happy to work with Democrats and do something together for good,\" Mr Romney told The Independent and praised Mr Bennet, with whom he went rafting last year.\n\n\"He's a very reasonable, thoughtful person who would, I believe, work in a collaborative, bipartisan manner, if that were an option,\" he said, adding he hopes they can work together. \"We can and have. I don't think that's in the currents but we'll see if that happens down the road.\"\n\nMr Bennet said he was actually impressed with Mr Romney's tax credit, noting how the former GOP presidential nominee's credit was more generous for children younger than six years old.\n\n\"So he's got pay-fors in there that I don't love, but do I think that it forms the basis of a potential bipartisan agreement to extend Child Tax Credit at some point, and to make it permanent? I really do. And I think what is going to happen with this is that over time it's going to become popular with the American people.\"\n\nIn addition, despite being a more moderate Democrat who is up for re-election, Mr Bennet also said he has become convinced that the filibuster as it currently stands is unworkable and needs to change.\n\n\"And frankly, what made me change my mind about it was, I don't think we can compete with China with a minority of senators having a permanent detail on what the majority want to do,\" he said. \"I just don't think democracy's going to be able to compete with two hands tied behind our back, which is the effect of the modern day abuse of the filibuster.\"\n\nMr Bennet's words came the same week that his fellow moderate, Senator Kyrsten Sinema defended it. But Mr Bennet said that it would be one thing if it only existed once per year but now it has become an impediment to progress.\n\n\"And that means that senators representing 22% of the country can stop everybody else from doing what needs to be done,\" he said. \"That's a far cry from what the founders wanted. So I believe that we can restore the Senate so that it's not like the House, which is just purely a majoritarian body, but instead in the Senate where you have extended debate by forcing people, if they're going to filibuster to be actually out on the floor, having a Mr Smith Goes to Washington debate.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [],

{"uri": "2024-07-417663162", "lang": "eng", "isDuplicate": false, "date": "2024-07-10", "time": "15:57:54", "dateTime": "2024-07-10T15:57:54Z", "dateTimePub": "2024-07-10T15:48:02Z", "dataType": "news", "sim": 0.4862745106220245, "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/michael-bennet-interview-profile-colorado-b1993552.html", "title": "Meet Michael Bennet, the first Democrat to say Biden will lose against Trump", "body": "{{ #verifyErrors }}{{ message }}{{ /verifyErrors }}{{ ^verifyErrors }}Something went wrong. Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nSenator Michael Bennet hardly looks like anyone's idea of a progressive hero. The Colorado Democrat often uses his husky voice to discuss wonky topics like why Democrats should not lift the cap on state and local tax deductions that Republicans put in place with the Trump tax cuts, and sounds like the former superintendent of Denver Public Schools he once was.\n\n\"Well, look, I don't think the American people sent us to Washington to cut taxes for rich people,\" he told The Independent in an interview. \"And the reality is we've had since 2001 about $8 trillion in tax cuts, almost all of that has gone to the wealthiest people in this country during a time when we've got the greatest income inequality that we've had since the late 1920s.\"\n\nWhen he ran for president in 2019 and 2020, he dropped out without winning any delegates and regularly criticized Medicare for All proposals by Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren as being unrealistic.\n\n\"I think I describe it as my not very well noticed presidential campaign,\" he joked.\n\nMr Bennet launched his campaign largely after he gave a speech on the floor of the US Senate floor excoriating Republican Senator Ted Cruz during the government shutdown of 2018 and 2019. During that time, he criticised Mr Cruz for shutting down the government in 2013. But the viral moment failed to make him launch as progressives largely supported Mr Sanders and Ms Warren while moderate voters preferred his colleague Senator Amy Klobuchar or Pete Buttigieg. Od course, voters ultimately picked President Joe Biden.\n\nThen the coronavirus pandemic hit and when Congress passed the CARES Act under the Trump administration, Mr Bennet teamed up with Senator Ron Wyden to tack on an additional $600 a week on unemployment insurance. That was reduced to $300 a week in Mr Biden's American Rescue Plan Act.\n\nSimilarly, when Mr Biden passed his signature Covid relief legislation, he included another one of Mr Bennet's policies that he championed during the 2020 presidential campaign: an expanded child tax credit that was fully refundable and gave families making $150,000 a year-and single parents making up to $112,500 for single-parent households-$300 a month for children for every child under six years old and $250 for children between six and 17 years old.\n\nIn turn, Mr Bennet has turned into one of the most prolific voices in politics not just on child poverty, but in general. He has worked with Mr Sanders - whom he criticized in the primary - to make sure the lift on the SALT Cap, a priority for Democrats in California, New York and New Jersey, isn't a giveaway to the rich. Similarly, he was part of a group of eight senators who passed the 2013 immigration reform bill that ultimately died.\n\nMr Bennet said he was interested in passing policies he knew would be possible if he lost his presidential run and returned to Colorado, which is an evenly-divided state politically.\n\n\"And that's what I set out to do and I think that's what I did. And I'm glad there's been some take up of those policies. I think there was a lot of overlap in a number of the things that I proposed and what Joe Biden ran on.\"\n\nIt also helps that one of the early adopters of the tax credit was now in the White House. Initially, Mr Bennet introduced the credit through the American Family Act with Senator Sherrod Brown, a populist progressive from Ohio. But the second person to sign on as a cosponsor was then-California Senator Kamala Harris. A Bennet aide said on the condition of anonymity that the senator reached out to the Vice President before the Biden administration's plan was passed through Congress.\n\nMr Bennet said he began thinking about child poverty when he was superintendent of Denver Public Schools, the role he held before he was appointed to fill the Senate seat of Ken Salazar, who joined the Obama administration as Secretary of Interior. Mr Bennet said he frequently saw parents who worked two or three jobs and still couldn't get themselves out of poverty regardless of what they did.\n\n\"And what I know from that experience is that it's not that people aren't working, they're working incredibly hard, but they cannot afford housing or healthcare, higher education or early childhood education,\" he said. \"But it's the cost of those building blocks of liberating your kids from poverty or feeling like you've got a middle class life, the cost of those has outstripped the wage increases that people have had. And I came to see the Child Tax Credit as the most elegant way of trying to deal with that problem.\"\n\nMr Bennet's oldest friend in the Senate, fellow Coloradoan John Hickenlooper, hired him as his chief of staff when Mr Hickenlooper was Mayor of Denver.\n\n\"He has always been engaged on kids, in every facet, always,\" Mr Hickenlooper said. \"I've only been here a year, but I see him as one of the two or three or four real moving forces behind the child tax credit.\"\n\nMr Hickenlooper, who went on to serve as governor of Colorado and also ran for president before dropping out to stage a successful challenge to Republican Senator Cory Gardner, said Mr Bennet has helped him learn the Senate.\n\n\"He's been the best mentor I've ever had,\" he said. \"He's been overly generous, exceedingly generous in his help.\"\n\nMr Wyden, who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee who worked with him on unemployment insurance, complimented his work as well.\n\n\"I went to school on a basketball scholarship and I don't know of any higher compliment than to say that Michael Bennet comes to play every day,\" he said, saying he and Mr Bennet had looked at unemployment for some time and said he had been negotiating with the Trump administration during the Covid-19 pandemic's onset. \"That bill was also historic in that it also covered gig workers.\"\n\nAt the same time, Mr Bennet's work on both issues is facing major political peril. Plenty of Republican governors ended the expanded unemployment insurance on the premise that it prevented people from seeking work and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell criticised the programme. Second, January marks the first month parents will not see the monthly payments, after Senator Joe Manchin killed fellow Democrats' proposed Build Back Better Act and largely criticised the Child Tax Credit because he worried it went to people making too much money and wanted to make sure that it could go to grandparents raising children.\n\nBut a Bennet aide said that the senator told Mr Manchin, a conservative Democrat from West Virginia, that grandparents are already eligible because they can claim them on their taxes. Similarly, the aide noted how the credit is already means-tested.\n\nFor his part, Mr Bennet said he will continue speaking to Mr Manchin.\n\n\"I've given him a little bit of a break over the holidays, but I've talked to him extensively before then, and I'll talk to him extensively again,\" he said. \"And the last thing we should be doing is doubling the rate of childhood poverty in this country.\"\n\nRepublican Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, who has crafted his own child tax credit plan, said he and Mr Bennet have discussed their different child tax credits.\n\n\"We both concluded it was a priority. I like my plan better than the president's but I'd be happy to work with Democrats and do something together for good,\" Mr Romney told The Independent and praised Mr Bennet, with whom he went rafting last year.\n\n\"He's a very reasonable, thoughtful person who would, I believe, work in a collaborative, bipartisan manner, if that were an option,\" he said, adding he hopes they can work together. \"We can and have. I don't think that's in the currents but we'll see if that happens down the road.\"\n\nMr Bennet said he was actually impressed with Mr Romney's tax credit, noting how the former GOP presidential nominee's credit was more generous for children younger than six years old.\n\n\"So he's got pay-fors in there that I don't love, but do I think that it forms the basis of a potential bipartisan agreement to extend Child Tax Credit at some point, and to make it permanent? I really do. And I think what is going to happen with this is that over time it's going to become popular with the American people.\"\n\nIn addition, despite being a more moderate Democrat who is up for re-election, Mr Bennet also said he has become convinced that the filibuster as it currently stands is unworkable and needs to change.\n\n\"And frankly, what made me change my mind about it was, I don't think we can compete with China with a minority of senators having a permanent detail on what the majority want to do,\" he said. \"I just don't think democracy's going to be able to compete with two hands tied behind our back, which is the effect of the modern day abuse of the filibuster.\"\n\nMr Bennet's words came the same week that his fellow moderate, Senator Kyrsten Sinema defended it. But Mr Bennet said that it would be one thing if it only existed once per year but now it has become an impediment to progress.\n\n\"And that means that senators representing 22% of the country can stop everybody else from doing what needs to be done,\" he said. \"That's a far cry from what the founders wanted. So I believe that we can restore the Senate so that it's not like the House, which is just purely a majoritarian body, but instead in the Senate where you have extended debate by forcing people, if they're going to filibuster to be actually out on the floor, having a Mr Smith Goes to Washington debate.\"", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"},

It represented another small, significant success for the White House as the Biden campaign continues to claw back some of the ground lost after the president's debate debacle against Donald Trump at the end of June.\n\nBut the performance did nothing to ease the perception that the election projections have changed in a way many find alarming. Michael Bennet, a Colorado Democratic senator, went public on Tuesday evening with concerns he had previously voiced in private that his party was on course to suffer a historic defeat in November. \"It's true that I said that,\" he told CNN's Kaitlan Collins in an interview which broke from the party line.\n\n\"Donald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election and maybe win it by a landslide and take with him the Senate and the House. So for me this isn't a question about polling. It's not a question about politics. It's a moral question about the future of our country. The White House, in the time since that disastrous debate, I think, has done nothing to really demonstrate that they have a plan to win this election.\"\n\nBennet's viewpoint undoubtedly reflects the concerns of many congressional and Senate Democrats, but the number of those who have explicitly spoken out remains fewer than a dozen. On Wednesday, former House speaker Nancy Pelosi, considered a Democratic figurehead and moral conscience, captured the wait-and-see mood which has taken hold of the party.\n\n\"It is up to the president to decide if he is going to run. We are all encouraging him to make that decision. I want him to do whatever he decides to do. And that's the way it is. Whatever he decides we go with. I think it is really important that we let him deal with this Nato conference. This is a very big deal. Let's hold off. Whatever you are thinking, either tell someone privately but you don't have to put that out on the table until we see how we go this week.\"\n\nWhite House staff could reasonably argue that the one message which Joe Biden has delivered with force and venom is that he is going nowhere. He has been unequivocal in his determination to stay on as the Democratic nominee and it is going to take a lot more than subtle overtures or occasional opinions of dissent to persuade him otherwise.", "source": {"uri": "irishtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Irish Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jens_Stoltenberg", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jens Stoltenberg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide_victory", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Landslide victory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bennet", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Bennet"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Office_of_the_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Executive Office of the President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "label": "dmoz/Home/Entertaining/Holidays", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/o1voUFO4OwaAeaFAvI52QOHUnE0=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/PNQS6DOZZU5SPDUW7N444D4KCI.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719974", "eventUri": "eng-9719974", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2549019607843137, "wgt": 122, "relevance": 1}

Since Biden stumbled on stage, Democrats have been torn apart, with numerous calls for the president to drop out of the race over concerns about his age.\n\nBut Trump supporters still have reason to fret.\n\nIn response to Trump posting a link to a Breitbart story about the French election results insinuating the country's far-right were swindled, titled \"Le Pen party Won Most Votes But Awarded Third Most Seats,\" many posters replied with #TooBigToRig posts, calling on MAGA voters to overwhelm the global leftist election-fixing cabal.\n\n\"Everyone needs to encourage their friends, family, and neighbors to #ClaimYourBallot - even if they are disillusioned and don't want to cast a vote for President,\" posted @WishIWasFishing on Truth Social. \"They need to vote for state and local officials. They need to make certain their name isn't stolen to allow a fraudulent vote to be cast. #TooBigToRig #StopTheSteal.\"\n\nThe hashtag is calling for fans to put their foot on the gas and get out the vote for Trump, believing, almost comically, that the omnipresent deep state they fear would be cowed by an overwhelming turnout for Trump.\n\n\"That's their plan but we will make it #TooBigToRig,\" posted @lauramarks over a meme of a smirking Biden.\n\n\"Oh, you think the *French* elections were rigged?\" Biden says in it. \"Just wait for November.\"\n\nMarine Le Pen's Rassemblement National Party did get the most votes of any single party in the second round of France's legislative election on Sunday but failed to claim a majority given a strategic effort to vote against them by the country's left.\n\nMeanwhile, a new Democrat speaking out publicly about the president's reelection prospects also helped push the hashtag forward.\n\nSen. Michael Bennett (D-Colo.) appeared on CNN on Tuesday and became the first Democratic senator to say that he wasn't confident in Biden's ability to win.\n\n\"I just think this race is on a trajectory that is very worrisome if you care about the future of this country,\" Bennet said. \"Joe Biden was 9 points up at this time the last time he was running. Hillary Clinton was 5 points up. This is the first time in more than 20 years that a Republican president has been up in this part of the campaign. Donald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election -- and maybe win it by a landslide -- and take with him the Senate and the House.\"\n\nThe more Democrats fret, counterintuitively, the more Trump fans worry.\n\nSome Trump supporters were suspicious, wondering if Democratic party members talking about their concerns so publicly was an attempt to make Republican voters let their guards down.\n\nOthers thought Bennet was signaling the need for deep-state action, furthering the push for more votes.\n\n\"When they admit that, be very worried. Something nefarious is afoot,\" posted @NedsNag.\n\nBut they remain confident that their simple solution would work\n\n\"Go out and vote - and take 10 friends - don't buy into \"red wave\" bullshit!\" posted @tiffer. \"We've got to swamp them AGAIN.\"", "source": {"uri": "dailydot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Dot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "marlon_ettinger@dailydot.com", "name": "Marlon Ettinger", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_Social", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Truth Social"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_state_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Deep state in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landslide_victory", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Landslide victory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breitbart_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Breitbart News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "French language"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashtag", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hashtag"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-right_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Far-right politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Le_Pen", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marine Le Pen"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Rally", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Rally"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-party_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "One-party state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_America_Great_Again", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Make America Great Again"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_out_the_vote", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Get out the vote"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_turnout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Voter turnout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing_politics", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Left-wing politics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_elections_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wave elections in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hillary Clinton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online_Issues_Polls", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Online Issues Polls", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://uploads.dailydot.com/2024/07/donald-trump-flying-into-polls.jpg?auto=compress&fm=pjpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9719974", "eventUri": "eng-9719974", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 119, "relevance": 1}

(ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nIt's what you would expect a co-chair of the candidate's re-election campaign to say, thrust into the impossible position of defending the vitality of an elderly man whose clear and rapid decline was witnessed by 50 million Americans on live television. But that didn't make it any less excruciating, and certainly not any more believable.\n\n\"I have got complete confidence in our president,\" Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer told NPR on Tuesday. \"I am an enthusiastic supporter of President Biden's, and I'm going to work my tail off to make sure he gets a second term.\"\n\nWhitmer, often floated as a Hail Mary replacement for the 81-year-old Democrat, was none too inspiring when pressed on that display of loyalty, which was undercut by NPR airing a clip of Biden speaking alongside her at a campaign stop in 2020. The decline from then to now was readily apparent. How could anyone deny it?\n\n\"Our choices on the ballot right now are President Biden and former President Trump,\" Whitmer demurred. \"That is the binary choice in front of us.\"\n\nIf the cold hard reality is that there is no other choice for the 70% of voters who say the incumbent president lacks the physical and mental fitness to complete another four-year term in office -- and that the message for the next four months is going to be that the president is totally fine, but also what else can you do? -- then the cold hard reality appears to be that Democrats are going to lose not just the White House but likely both chambers of Congress.\n\n\"Donald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election, and maybe win it by a landslide, and take with him the Senate and the House,\" Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., who is not a Biden surrogate and thus more capable of speaking freely and honestly, told CNN Tuesday night. \"This isn't a question about polling,\" he continued, referring to concerns about Biden's competency and the continued viability of his campaign (the polling, like the vibes, is quite bad). \"It's not a question about politics. It's a moral question about the future of our country.\"\n\nIt is indeed a question for Democratic leaders: Do you want to be seen as the party that still has integrity -- that is willing to concede that 90 minutes of borderline incoherence is not a \"one off\" for an octogenarian, who clearly does not appear to have the vigor to serve until January 2029 -- or do you want to be seen as a party of liars?\n\nClaiming that one has \"complete confidence\" in Biden's brain is, unfortunately, an obvious lie at this point. In the days since his atrocious debate, Biden only further displayed that he does not have what it takes anymore.\n\nIn an interview with a radio host who was fed questions by his campaign, Biden still managed to bungle his scripted answers, referring to himself as the \"first Black woman to serve with a Black president\" (the interviewer was subsequently fired). On ABC, eight days after the debate, he was at times incoherent and, when he was not, still garbled and infuriating, portraying a loss to Trump as acceptable to him so long as he \"did the good as job as I know I can do\" (the interviewer chosen by the Biden campaign, George Stephanopoulos, subsequently commented: \"I don't think he can serve four more years\").\n\nWhether Biden can capably read from a teleprompter is not so much the question -- and him continuing to do so will not resolve any of the public's legitimate concerns. There is indeed nothing that the president can do at this point to address them, and that's actually fair: because there is no destroying the evidence that has already been made public. The debate, and Biden's later unscripted performances, reveal in absolute clarity why his campaign was hiding him; why, two years in a row, the president declined to appear for an interview before the 120 million people watching the Super Bowl.\n\nElected Democrats absolutely know this too.\n\n\"I haven't talked to one who privately says they think Biden is capable of running and beating Trump at this point,\" Heather Caygle, managing editor at Punchbowl News, wrote Tuesday.\n\nWant a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course.\n\nWhile only seven congressional Democrats have explicitly called for Biden to step aside, almost all of them know the score, even if they've been cowed by a president who half-assed the \"proving himself\" part -- in two weeks: about a half-hour of unscripted remarks, in friendly venues, that went poorly -- before shifting to petulant defiance.\n\nAs Politico reported Wednesday morning, most Democrats \"remain 100 percent convinced Biden will lose to Trump, and many privately want him to gracefully bow out -- even some who are publicly supporting him as the nominee.\"\n\nLoyalty can be a virtue but it can also be a vice. Here, it looks more like cowardice and dishonesty. \"I wish I was more brave,\" a Democratic state party chair told NBC News.\n\n\"I could say something, but I'm a pragmatist,\" one Democratic lawmaker told the outlet. \"I fall in the category of a lot of front-liners who were staying quiet in the hopes that he was going to do the right thing,\" they continued. \"But he's choosing to stay.\"\n\nThe question now is whether Democrats want to be truthful with the public and an American super-majority that thinks Biden should step down. They do not need to be vicious toward a man who has empowered organized labor, boosted real wages for the working class and helped stave off a recession while investing record sums in clean energy. But they will be serving him and his legacy poorly if they don't honestly confront their ailing leader and remind him that there will be no moral victories if an authoritarian demagogue is returned to power in November.\n\nThe alternative is looking voters directly in the face and lying to them in ways more befitting of a MAGA surrogate, convincing no one of anything but the Democrats' own dishonesty. The world does not deserve a second Trump presidency, but if the president's political allies shred their integrity for the next four months that is just what we will get.

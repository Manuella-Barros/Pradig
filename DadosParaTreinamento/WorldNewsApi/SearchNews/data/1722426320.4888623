The filmmaker, who has turned actor for the series, shared in an interview that he had to spend a night in the police lock up for 'slapping the wrong person.' In a conversation with Samay Raina on his YouTube channel, the filmmaker-turned-actor said, \"Yes, I have gone to jail. I slapped the wrong person. Somebody you are not supposed to hit. I was in jail for a night. The man who put me in the lock up is the same guy who changed my life completely. He was the who brought me out.\" Anurag said that the man who got him to spend a night in jail was impressed that Anurag stood for the right thing. Though the filmmaker didn't share the details of the incident, this came as a shocker for both his co-star Gulshan Devaiah and the interviewer.

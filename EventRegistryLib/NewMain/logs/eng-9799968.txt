Parties Hopeful Of Polls As EC Delegation Visits Srinagar", "body": "ECI delegation led by Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar and Election Commissioners Gyanesh Kumar (L) and SS Sandhu (R) arrives at Srinagar to review poll preparedness in Jammu and Kashmir.Source : PTI\n\nA delegation of the Election Commission of India, which is on a three-day visit to Jammu and Kashmir on Thursday met the political parties in Jammu and Kashmir to review preparedeness ahead of the Assembly polls in the Union Territory. Following the meeting at the Sher-e-Kashmir Convention Centre in Srinagar, the political party leaders said the poll body assured them that the elections would be conducted within the deadline set by the Supreme Court.\n\nLast December, the Supreme Court had directed the poll panel to hold Assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir by September 30.\n\nThe five-member team of the Election Commission, led by Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar, will be in Jammu and Kashmir till August 10, raising expectations that the dates for the polls might be announced soon.\n\nAfter meeting with the Election Commission, Congress leader Ravinder Sharma stated that the poll body had indicated that elections would be held soon. He stated that in today's meeting, the party presented all the facts to the Election Commission and demanded that the elections be held as soon as possible.\n\nNasir Aslam Wani, the head of the National Conference (NC) for the Kashmir division, also expressed hope that the elections would be held on time. He also said that the ongoing situation in the UT should not affect the elections, noting that they could have been held in worse conditions, such as in 1996 when there was very low voter turnout.\n\nCiting the safe conduct of the Lok Sabha elections in Jammu and Kashmir, People's Democratic Party (PDP) leader Khurshid Alam emphasised that his party urged the EC to announce the election dates soon. He also mentioned the arrival of one crore tourists and the peaceful completion of the Amarnath Yatra.\n\n\"The response we received from Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar indicates that the election announcement will be made soon,\" Khurshid said.\n\nJammu and Kashmir National Panthers Party leader Harshdev Singh stated that all parties, except the BJP, want early elections in Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nAccusing the BJP of running the UT like its personal territory, Singh said that the saffron party was expoliting the region's culture and language by appointing unfamiliar bureaucrats. He also urged the poll body to not only conduct elections promptly but also restore the statehood.\n\nMeanwhile, the BJP has also supported the idea of holding elections in the valley as soon as possible. BJP's Kashmir in-charge, Surender Ambardar, mentioned that they had told the Election Commission that the elections were long overdue.\n\n\"The Election Commission was informed that there has already been a significant delay in holding the elections,\" Ambardar said.\n\nAfter meeting the national and regional political parties in Jammu and Kashmir, the EC team will now hold discussions with the district commissioners and superintendents of police of all districts next. Thereafter, they will be meeting the Chief Election Officer and senior police officers.\n\nOn August 9, the team will meet the Chief Secretary and Director General of Police, before leaving for Jammu to meet enforcement agencies.\n\nOn August 10, the commission will visit Jammu for a review meeting with enforcement agencies. It will also hold a press conference in Jammu to brief the media on the review process.\n\n(With inputs from Asif)", "source": {"uri": "news.abplive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "english"},

As reported by media organisations, the ECI team will meet political parties in Jammu and Kashmir on Thursday to get feedback on conducting Assembly polls in the Union Territory and in this regard, the office of the Chief Electoral Officer, Jammu and Kashmir, on Tuesday issued letters to various political parties, inviting them for a meeting with the ECI. The ECI, led by Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar, is scheduled to visit Jammu and Kashmir from August 8-10 to review preparedness for Assembly polls, weeks before the Supreme Court's September 30 deadline for holding elections in the Union Territory. It may be recalled here that after a record turnout in the Lok Sabha elections in Jammu and Kashmir, the ECI had remarked that it was a huge positive for assembly elections to be held soon so that the democratic process continues to thrive in the Union Territory.\n\nNow that the ball has been set rolling, the people of the UT are enthusiastic as they are going to elect their own assembly after almost nine years. Last assembly elections were held in 2014 when Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh were a single unit as a state. In 2018, PDP-BJP coalition fell and in 2019, union government did away with special status of erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir and divided it into two Union Territories. From 2018, Jammu and Kashmir has been directly ruled by New Delhi.\n\nHowever, of late there are indications that assembly elections may be held in Jammu and Kashmir in September-October, people here are enthusiastic as they have been out of power from all these years and solely on the mercy of bureaucracy which they prefer to call \"Baboodum\".

The Supreme Court of India has set a deadline for holding the elections in Jammu and Kashmir before 30 September.\n\nJammu and Kashmir will witness elections after a gap of ten years as the last assembly election was held in 2014. The PDP-BJP coalition government fell in June 2018 when the latter withdrew support to the then chief minister, Mehbooba Mufti.\n\nSpeaking to reporters after separate party-wise meetings with the poll panel's delegation, political leaders expressed unanimous support for immediate holding of Assembly elections in the Union Territory (UT). They also called for ensuring a level playing field in the polls to restore democracy in Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nThe BJP's Jammu and Kashmir unit has called for the elections to be held within the Supreme Court's deadline, party spokesman RS Pathania said.\n\n\"We are hopeful that Jammu Kashmir will soon have a democratic government. I am optimistic that the notification will be released shortly,\" Pathania said.\n\nNC's Kashmir provincial president Nasir Aslam Wani, who led a five-member party delegation, said the NC has demanded that the people of J&K now want their own government. We told the EC that you came here many times and we have met with you and it is now time for a definite decision on this matter,\" he told reporters.\n\n\"We pointed out that there has been no government in J&K since 2018 and that Assembly elections have not taken place for the last 10 years,\" Wani said and added that the NC told the EC that a Lieutenant Governor, his sole adviser, and a few bureaucrats cannot run the UT.\n\n\"We told the EC that this is a matter of their credibility. Either you strengthen the voices opposing elections or uphold their credibility by conducting the elections,\" Wani said, adding that the response from the ECI was positive.\n\nCongress leader GN Monga said that democracy should flourish in Jammu and Kashmir. \"We call ourselves the mother of democracy, yet the people of J&K have been without elections for many years. Democracy should flourish here, and elections should be held soon,\" he told reporters.\n\nMonga said, \"We told them that there is discrimination in the security provided to between parties. We appealed that all parties should be weighed in the same scale.\"\n\nPDP leader Khurshid Alam, a member of the party's delegation that met with the EC, said the people of J&K should have the right to elect their own government. \"What justification is there for not holding polls when the government claims the situation has improved, when one crore tourists visited, and when the parliamentary elections and Amarnath yatra were conducted without any untoward incidents,\" he asked.\n\n\"We do not have personal differences with the LG, but as a political appointee, we have concerns that his decisions may be biased. Therefore, we requested the EC to ensure that the government is sanitised to provide a level playing field without any bias,\" he added.\n\nThe EC will also meet with the Chief Secretary, DGP, and other officials handling law and order.\n\nThe team will visit Jammu on Friday to meet with security agencies and hold a press conference.", "source": {"uri": "thestatesman.com", "dataType": "news",

EC team reviews poll preparedness in Srinagar", "body": "An EC delegation led by Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar arrived in Srinagar on Thursday to review the poll preparedness in the state. (Image: ECI)\n\nJammu and Kashmir Elections 2024 News: A three-member delegation of the Election Commission of India arrived in Srinagar on Thursday morning to review the poll preparedness in the erstwhile state. Preparations are currently underway for the first Assembly elections to be held following the abrogation of Article 370 that stripped Jammu and Kashmir of its special status and its bifurcation into two union territories.\n\nThe team, led by Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar, is scheduled to hold separate meetings with representatives of all political parties, civil administration, local election authorities and senior police and security officers during its visit. Election Commissioners Gyanesh Kumar and Dr. SS Sandhu are other members part of the EC delegation.\n\nThe visit is expected to bring clarity to the poll body's plans to hold elections in Jammu and Kashmir. Political parties such as the National Conference and the People's Democratic Party had earlier raised apprehensions about the Centre's intentions to hold Assembly elections in the union territory. Assembly elections have not been held in J&K since 2018.\n\nThey said that the Centre was deliberately delaying the Assembly elections as it feared a certain defeat. However, the Supreme Court addressed the issue and directed the ECI to hold elections in Jammu and Kashmir by September 30, 2024.\n\nThe EC has already set the ball rolling on the updation of electoral rolls following the delimitation exercise which has now been concluded. The number of Assembly seats have increased from 83 to 90.\n\nLast Friday, the poll panel announced that revised electoral rolls in all Assembly polls-bound states and Union Territory would be published by August 20. Last week, the Election Commission of India asked the Jammu and Kashmir administration to transfer out officers posted in their home districts, a routine exercise it holds before conducting elections.\n\nSimilar directions have been issued for poll-bound states including Maharashtra, Jharkhand and Haryana. However, there is no clarity yet on whether the poll panel will hold elections in Jammu and Kashmir along with the other poll-bound states.\n\nThe terms of the Haryana, Maharashtra and Jharkhand assemblies end on November 11, November 26, and January 5, 2025, respectively.\n\nJammu and Kashmir has been under central rule since June 19, 2018, after the collapse of the coalition government headed by the People's Democratic Party's Mehbooba Mufti following the BJP's decision to end its alliance with the party.\n\nSeveral top BJP leaders including Prime Minister Narendra Modi have lately suggested that the Centre is committed to holding elections in Jammu and Kashmir and also restore its statehood.", "source": {"uri": "moneycontrol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MoneyControl"},

BJP as a party was ready for assembly elections even when Lok Sabha polls were held in the country and the party will do well in elections and represent the concern of common people and youth in the new assembly,\" he said.\n\nAfter the meeting with the delegations of political parties, the ECI team held a meeting with deputy commissioners and senior superintendents of police on the security situation. The team was briefed by the officials about the situation, especially on the security front.\n\nThe ECI team also held meetings with other officials of the UT administration during which preparations regarding elections were discussed. On Friday morning, the Commission will hold meetings with chief secretary Atul Duloo and director general of police RR Swain.\n\nLater, the team will travel to winter capital Jammu, where ECI members will be holding a press briefing and another security related meeting with officers deployed in the Jammu division.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Hindustan Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu_and_Kashmir_(union_territory)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jammu and Kashmir (union territory)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Election_Commission_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Election Commission of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_party", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Political party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Election_Commissioner_of_India", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chief Election Commissioner of India"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukhbir_Singh_Badal", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sukhbir Singh Badal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashmir", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kashmir"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinagar", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Srinagar"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Srinagar"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peoples_Democratic_Party_(Nigeria)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Peoples Democratic Party (Nigeria)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasir_Aslam_Wani", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nasir Aslam Wani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_capital", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Summer capital"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lok_Sabha", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lok Sabha"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tea"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bharatiya Janata Party"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crore", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crore"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilgrimage", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pilgrimage"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amarnath_Temple", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Amarnath Temple"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Amarnath Temple"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu_division", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jammu division"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_general_of_police", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Director general of police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintendent_of_police_(India)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Superintendent of police (India)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_territory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Union territory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomad", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Nomad"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jammu"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Jammu"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "India"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Congress", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Indian National Congress"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Parties/Planning", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Democracy", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images.hindustantimes.com/img/2024/08/09/1600x900/ECI-delegation-led-by-chief-election-commissioner-_1723187897060.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9799968", "eventUri": "eng-9799968", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 173, "relevance": 1}

The poll schedule is yet to be announced by the EC, with just a little over seven weeks left for the deadline.\n\nThe BJP also batted for immediate Assembly polls. Its Jammu and Kashmir unit spokesperson R S Pathania said, \"We told the EC that we want the election to be conducted as soon as possible.\" The party wants the polls to be held within the apex court's deadline, he added.\n\nNC's Kashmir provincial president Nasir Aslam Wani, who led a five-member party delegation to meet the EC officials, said, \"Our only demand is that the people of Jammu and Kashmir now want to have their own government. We told the EC that you came here many times and we met you but now, there should be some definite decision on it.\" \"We said there has been no government in Jammu and Kashmir since 2018 and the Assembly election has not taken place for the last 10 years,\" Wani told reporters and added that the NC told the poll panel that a lieutenant governor, his lone advisor and a few bureaucrats cannot run the Union Territory.\n\nWani said the party also demanded a level-playing field in terms of providing a secure environment for the polls.\n\nPolitical, developmental and security issues can be addressed when people have their own representatives, he said and added that the EC has assured the leaders that the election will take place this time.\n\nCongress leader G N Monga said democracy should flourish in Jammu and Kashmir. \"We call ourselves the mother of democracy but the people of Jammu and Kashmir are going without elections for many years. Democracy should flourish here and the election should be held sooner,\" he said.\n\nMonga said the Congress delegation also discussed Jammu and Kashmir's security scenario with the EC.\n\n\"We told them that there is a discrimination between parties on providing them security. We appealed that every party should be weighed on the same scale,\" he added.\n\nPDP leader Khurshid Alam, who was part of the party's delegation that met the EC, said the people of Jammu and Kashmir should have the right to elect their own government.\n\n\"What justification is there not to hold the polls when the government says the situation has improved and is better, when one crore tourists came here and when the parliamentary polls and the (Amarnath) yatra took place without any incident?\" he asked.\n\nAlam said the need of the hour is to restore democracy in Jammu and Kashmir. \"The county believes in democracy, so we should have the election immediately,\" he said, adding that there was a very positive response from the EC.\n\nAfter meeting the political leaders, the EC team received feedback from deputy commissioners and district police chiefs at a marathon meeting on poll preparedness in the Union Territory.\n\nThe poll panel is scheduled to meet Jammu and Kashmir's Chief Electoral Officer P K Pole in the evening for his feedback on holding the Assembly polls.\n\nA meeting with Chief Secretary Atal Dulloo and Director General of Police R R Swain is scheduled for Friday morning, before the EC team moves to winter capital Jammu for the second leg of its visit.\n\nThe three-day visit will culminate on August 10 at Jammu, where the EC will hold a review meeting with enforcement agencies. It will also hold a press conference to brief the media on the review process.\n\nIn March, Kumar, who was then the sole member of the three-member commission to visit the Union Territory, had assured political parties and people that the EC would soon hold the Assembly polls in Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nAt that time, the two posts of election commissioners were vacant. They were filled days before the Lok Sabha polls were announced on March 16.\n\nAfter a record turnout in the Lok Sabha election in Jammu and Kashmir, Kumar had said, \"This active participation is a

Now, if this support is placed in the hands of elected representatives, it will further benefit the people and reach the grassroots level,\" he said.\n\nPathania said that the BJP was hopeful that elections would be held since the Supreme Court had set a deadline for the government.\n\n\"We told the ECI team that all parties are ready and elections should be held at any cost. There should be no further delay,\" he said.\n\nHarsh's Panthers Party (HPP) chief Harsh Dev Singh said that five years ago when the parliamentary elections were held, all the opposition parties were in support of holding Assembly elections.\n\n\"But only the BJP did not support holding Assembly elections at that time. When the Election Commission returned to Delhi, they announced that Assembly elections will not be held,\" he said.\n\nSingh said that the ECI team which had again arrived in J&K to assess the ground situation should consider their demand to hold Assembly elections without any delay.\n\n\"As representatives of the people, we would say that the public wants elections to be held immediately without any delay and before the deadline set by the Supreme Court of India,\" he said.\n\nSingh said that the people of J&K were treated like insects and there was no one to listen to them.\n\n\"People of J&K are being denied their democratic rights, which is completely wrong and unconstitutional,\" he said.\n\nSenior PDP leader Asiya Naqash after meeting the ECI team said that they had pressed for early Assembly polls as per the deadline set by the Supreme Court of India.\n\n\"Today, we told the ECI team that the Supreme Court has set a deadline and that deadline should be met,\" she said.\n\nNaqash said that when the ECI team was in J&K last time to assess the situation for Parliamentary polls, they were asked to hold Assembly elections.\n\n\"We reminded the team that today,\" she said.\n\nNaqash said that considering the SC deadline to hold Assembly elections by September of 2024, the visit of the ECI team on August 8 is already late.\n\n\"Now that the team has come, we hope that they will announce the elections soon,\" she said.\n\nAll the political leaders expressed their satisfaction over their interaction with the ECI delegation on holding Assembly polls.\n\n\"The ECI team listened to the demands of the political leaders,\" a senior political leader said.\n\nOn Friday, the ECI team would leave for Jammu to hold meetings with the civil and Police administration.\n\nThe team would also address the media before leaving for New Delhi in the evening.", "source": {"uri": "greaterkashmir.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Greater Kashmir"},

However, no timeline was given to us about conduct of polls\", she said, adding that the party is expecting early assembly polls.\n\nCPI (M) leader Muhammad Abbas Rather said that the party told them the delay in conducting polls has created a vacuum in J&K, adding that the bureaucratic rule cannot be an alternative to represent the people.

The administration should be able to deal with any such situations and it is capable of that... These things will not have an impact on the elections at all. Our forces and entire administration are capable enough to deal with any situation that comes in the way. The flag of Jamhooriyat will continue,\" he assured.\n\nAs per an order from the Supreme Court, the ECI has to complete elections in Jammu and Kashmir by September 30. However, the elections cannot be held due to security concerns in the Union Territory before August 19 due to the annual Amarnath Yatra which is scheduled between June 29 and August 19.\n\n\"The time is right (for polls). We will keep the deadline in mind. Those who are yet to enroll, they can still do that...We are confident, after our review and also in our resolve, that such activities, whatever may be the design of that activity, cannot be allowed to happen,\" he said, assuring that \"nothing can be allowed to disrupt the elections (in J&K)\".\n\nThe CEC, on being asked if the other states that will have polls this year will see elections along with J&K, said that different states have different dates for completion of terms and hence the decisions will be taken accordingly.\n\n\"As far as J&K polls are concerned, our review has been completed and the Yatra will also end on the 19th (of August)... We will go back to Delhi and calculate the security assessment and force deployment and will announce the polls accordingly,\" Kumar said.\n\nHe went on to say that all political parties want elections to be held in the UT as soon as possible. He also assured that state government officials are ready to hold the elections. \"They have assured that there is nothing to delay the polls,\" he said.\n\nKumar said that they have a positive challenge before them too -- huge participation from candidates and the voters. \"This is a positive challenge that we accept with all happiness. Everyone has been directed to encourage and prepare for mass participation,\" he said.\n\nIt is important to note that the last elections in the erstwhile state took place in November-December 2014. In November 2018, the assembly was dissolved, and in 2019 the process of splitting the state into two UTs, J&K and Ladakh, started. In the recently concluded Lok Sabha polls in the UT, the voter turnout was huge.\n\nThe CEC also shared that as per the draft roll published in July 2024, the total electors in Jammu & Kashmir stand at 87.09 lakh, including 44.46 lakh male and 42.62 lakh females. The UT has 169 transgenders and 73,943 very senior citizens. At least 2,660 voters are above the age of 100 years while 3.71 lakh are first-time voters.\n\nFurther, the UT will have 11,838 polling stations with an average of 735 voters per centre.\n\nThe Union Territory has 90 assembly seats -- 74 are for general category, 7 for SC category and nine for the ST category.\n\nFor Kashmiri migrants, the ECI has scrapped the requirement of Form M and will set up 26 special polling stations in Delhi, Jammu and Udhampur.", "source": {"uri": "news18.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "News18"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Now, the amendment bill seeks to set that right,\" a person familiar with the government's decision said.\n\nThe Bill has a provision to make it mandatory for Waqf boards to register their properties with district collectors to ensure their actual valuation. There are 30 Waqf boards in the country.\n\nIn context: Originally, Waqf boards had around 52,000 properties throughout India. By 2009, there were 3,00,000 registered Waqf properties covering four lakh acres of land, and as on date, there are 8,72,292 such properties in more than eight lakh acres of land.\n\nThe amendment Bill with as many as 40 changes in the current law could be brought in the ongoing Parliament session. The government, as of now, does not plan to leave the Bill pending in Parliament after introduction, the sources said.\n\nThe key changes proposed in the law include ensuring verification of land before a board announces it as a Waqf property. Fresh verification of disputed lands claimed by various state boards will also be sought, according to the proposed bill. The changes with regard to the composition of the Waqf boards will ensure inclusion of women in these bodies.\n\nRecommended Reading: Amid talk of Bill to amend Wakf Act, Muslim Personal Law Board urges BJP allies, Opp leaders to oppose move\n\nFor its plans to amend the Waqf Act, Modi govt finds a familiar supporter: Sufi council\n\nEC team in J&K to review poll preparedness\n\nThe Election Commission, led by Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar, will visit Jammu and Kashmir from August 8-10 to review preparedness for Assembly polls, weeks before the Supreme Court's September 30 deadline for holding elections in the Union Territory.\n\nKumar will be accompanied by Election Commissioners Gyanesh Kumar and S S Sandhu.\n\nIn March, Kumar -- who was then the sole member of the three-member commission to visit the Union Territory -- had assured political parties and the people of Jammu and Kashmir that the poll panel would soon hold assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nThe commission will also review the preparations with election officers and police superintendents of all districts, as well as the chief secretary and director general of police.\n\nOn August 10, the commission will visit Jammu for a review meeting with enforcement agencies. It will also hold a press conference in Jammu to brief the media on the review process.\n\nIn context: Whenever assembly elections are held in Jammu and Kashmir, they will be the first since provisions of Article 370 of the Constitution were abrogated and the erstwhile state divided into two Union Territories in 2019.\n\nFollowing a delimitation exercise, the number of assembly seats has gone up from 83 to 90, excluding those allocated to Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Last December, the Supreme Court directed the poll panel to hold assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir by September 30.\n\nIn a fresh indication that assembly polls in Jammu and Kashmir are imminent, the Election Commission on Wednesday asked the Union Territory administration to transfer out officers posted in their home districts, an exercise it holds ahead of conducting elections.\n\nAjit to begin Jan Samman Yatra from Nashik\n\nMaharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar will begin the Jan Samman Yatra, an outreach programme of the ruling NCP ahead of the Assembly elections, from Dindori in Nashik district on August 8, his party announced on Monday.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference, NCP working president Praful Patel said the party and its allies in the ruling Mahayuti - BJP and Shiv Sena led by Eknath Shinde - have to fight the upcoming election together and win.\n\nThe NCP put up a united front, with the entire top leadership, including Patel, senior leader Chhagan Bhujbal, and Cabinet ministers and MLAs, present at the press conference, where the yatra schedule was announced.\n\nThe NCP leadership has insisted that the Jan Samman Yatra was not limited to constituencies of NCP MLAs and party leaders will also visit seats held by allies as it wishes to present a united face of Mahayuti, they said.\n\nPresident Murmu in New Zealand\n\nPresident Droupadi Murmu on Thursday will begin her two-day state visit to New Zealand at the invitation of the island nation's Governor-General Cindy Kiro, officials said. This will be the first presidential visit to New Zealand from India in eight years.\n\nBesides a bilateral meeting with the governor-general, Murmu will have a meeting with Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and Winston Peters, the deputy prime minister and foreign minister of New Zealand who visited India in March.

Former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah said on Thursday that the National Conference has presented its viewpoint to the Election Commission, hoping for an early issuance of notifications to initiate the election process in the Union Territory.\n\nJammu, Aug 8 (PTI) Former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah said on Thursday that the National Conference has presented its viewpoint to the Election Commission, hoping for an early issuance of notifications to initiate the election process in the Union Territory.\n\nThe National Conference (NC) vice president said the Election Commission (EC) is obligated to conduct the assembly elections according to the deadline set by the Supreme Court, provided they believe the situation is better than it was in 1996.\n\nAlso Read | CBI Arrests ED Assistant Director for Taking Bribe of INR 20 Lakh From Mumbai-Based Jeweller.\n\nAbdullah criticised the BJP-led government for neglecting the Jammu region and focusing entirely on maintaining peace in Kashmir, leading to a resurgence of militancy in Jammu.\n\n\"The Election Commission team is in Srinagar. My colleagues had the opportunity to meet them at 10.30 am. We have conveyed our views to the Election Commission, expecting early notification to kick-start the election process,\" Abdullah told reporters in Bani during a public rally.\n\nAlso Read | Ajit Pawar Launches Jansanman Yatra in Maharashtra, Says 'Do Not Fall Prey to Opposition's False Narratives (See Pics and Video).\n\nAsked about the timing of elections, he said it is up to the authorities whether to comply with the Supreme Court's directive or acknowledge that the situation in Jammu and Kashmir is worse than it was in 1996.\n\nThe 1996 elections for the assembly and Parliament were conducted following improvements in the security situation in Jammu and Kashmir after seven years of intense militancy.\n\n\"If they choose not to hold elections if they feel the current situation is worse than 1996, we won't complain. However, if they believe there is difference between the current situation and that in 1996, then elections have to held. Then the Election Commission has to complete the elections as per the deadline of 30 September set by the Supreme Court,\" he said.\n\nImmediate assembly polls in Jammu and Kashmir was the dominant demand of all political leaders from the Union Territory (UT) who met the visiting EC team in Srinagar on Thursday.\n\nThe team led by Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar arrived here in the morning and met representatives of the registered political parties, including the NC, People's Democratic Party (PDP), Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Congress and Jammu and Kashmir Panthers Party (JKPP) at the Sher-i-Kashmir International Convention Centre (SKICC).\n\nTaking a swipe at the BJP government's alleged efforts to dismantle his party, Abdullah remarked that they have been out of power for the past decade.\n\n\"In the last five years, the BJP and its government have tried to undermine the National Conference. However, none of our party's programmes have failed. Our manifesto preparations have drawn large public participation,\" he said.\n\nAbdullah said the NC requested public feedback, expecting responses from a handful of people, but received 1,000 to 1,500 emails and messages, most containing valuable suggestions.\n\n\"People place high expectations on the National Conference,\" he added.\n\nResponding to questions about increasing terrorist attacks in the Jammu region, Abdullah attributed these incidents to the neglect by past rulers who failed to focus on the region on security front.\n\n\"The entire focus was on Kashmir province, which should remain peaceful. We also wanted that the Kashmir province should be okay, but that does not mean we should lose focus and neglect Jammu. They neglected their focus on the Jammu region, resulting in the emergence of such a security situation, which we see here,\" he said.\n\nAbdullah expressed concern over the rise in militancy, stating it should not have been allowed to resurface.\n\n\"We had eradicated militancy from these areas, including Chenab, Rajouri, Reasi and Poonch. However, negligence by our leaders has allowed militancy to regain a foothold,\" he lamented.\n\nAbdullah expressed the hope that cooperation from the public will help bring the situation under control soon.", "source": {"uri": "latestly.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "LatestLY"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu_and_Kashmir_(union_territory)",

My colleagues had the opportunity to meet them at 10.30 am. We have conveyed our views to the Election Commission, expecting early notification to kick-start the election process,\" Abdullah told reporters in Bani during a public rally.\n\nAsked about the timing of elections, he said it is up to the authorities whether to comply with the Supreme Court's directive or acknowledge that the situation in Jammu and Kashmir is worse than it was in 1996.\n\nThe 1996 elections for the assembly and Parliament were conducted following improvements in the security situation in Jammu and Kashmir after seven years of intense militancy.\n\n\"If they choose not to hold elections if they feel the current situation is worse than 1996, we won't complain. However, if they believe there is difference between the current situation and that in 1996, then elections have to held. Then the Election Commission has to complete the elections as per the deadline of 30 September set by the Supreme Court,\" he said.\n\nImmediate assembly polls in Jammu and Kashmir was the dominant demand of all political leaders from the Union Territory (UT) who met the visiting EC team in Srinagar on Thursday.\n\nThe team led by Chief Election Commissioner Rajiv Kumar arrived here in the morning and met representatives of the registered political parties, including the NC, People's Democratic Party (PDP), Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Congress and Jammu and Kashmir Panthers Party (JKPP) at the Sher-i-Kashmir International Convention Centre (SKICC).\n\nTaking a swipe at the BJP government's alleged efforts to dismantle his party, Abdullah remarked that they have been out of power for the past decade.\n\n\"In the last five years, the BJP and its government have tried to undermine the National Conference. However, none of our party's programmes have failed. Our manifesto preparations have drawn large public participation,\" he said.\n\nAbdullah said the NC requested public feedback, expecting responses from a handful of people, but received 1,000 to 1,500 emails and messages, most containing valuable suggestions.\n\n\"People place high expectations on the National Conference,\" he added.\n\nResponding to questions about increasing terrorist attacks in the Jammu region, Abdullah attributed these incidents to the neglect by past rulers who failed to focus on the region on security front.\n\n\"The entire focus was on Kashmir province, which should remain peaceful. We also wanted that the Kashmir province should be okay, but that does not mean we should lose focus and neglect Jammu. They neglected their focus on the Jammu region, resulting in the emergence of such a security situation, which we see here,\" he said.\n\nAbdullah expressed concern over the rise in militancy, stating it should not have been allowed to resurface.\n\n\"We had eradicated militancy from these areas, including Chenab, Rajouri, Reasi and Poonch. However, negligence by our leaders has allowed militancy to regain a foothold,\" he lamented.\n\nAbdullah expressed the hope that cooperation from the public will help bring the situation under control soon.

We expect the elections to be concluded much earlier than the deadline of September 30 set by the Supreme Court (SC),\" senior BJP leader R.S.

The last Assembly election in J&K was held back in 2014 and remains under Central rule since 2018.\n\nThe Congress urged the EC to abide by the top court's timeline on elections. \"We discussed the need for peaceful and secure elections.

The Election Commission assured us elections will happen,\" National Conference (NC) provincial president Nasir Aslam Wani said.\n\nThe Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) lamented the earlier decision of the EC not to hold Assembly and Lok Sabha elections together during the meeting. It also pointed out that \"the EC and not the SC should have decided on holding elections in J&K\". \"J&K has seen a peaceful conduct of the Amarnath Yatra, Lok Sabha elections, growing tourism, etc. We urged the EC to hold Assembly elections as soon as possible, given the peaceful situation,\" PDP leader Khursheed Alam said.\n\nEDITORIAL | Welcome direction: On the Supreme Court's deadline to conduct elections in J&K\n\nJ&K Apni Party (JKAP), headed by Altaf Bukhari, also pleaded for early elections. \"We expect the EC to announce Assembly elections during their visit to Kashmir. Our party is ready to participate,\" the party chairman said.\n\nMeanwhile, the CEC, accompanied by Election Commissioners Gyanesh Kumar and S.S.

During the meetings, representatives of different parties urged the poll body to hold the elections at the earliest and ensure a level playing field.\n\n\"We told the EC members that some concrete decision should come out of the meeting. The people of J&K want to have their own government. We requested them (the EC) to ensure a level playing field without any bias,\" National Conference leader Nasir Aslam Wani, who led a five-member party delegation, said after the meeting.\n\nThe restive Union Territory has been without an elected government since June 2018, when the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) withdrew support to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)-led coalition government, leading to the imposition of President's Rule and dissolution of state assembly. In August 2019, the Centre revoked Article 370 of the Constitution which gave special status to the region, and bifurcated the erstwhile state into two UTs -- J&K with an assembly and Ladakh without one.\n\nOn December 11 last year, the Supreme Court upheld the revocation of Article 370, but directed EC to conduct polls for the 90-member J&K legislative assembly by September 30, 2024, and asked the Centre to restore statehood to the region \"as soon as possible\". In May 2022, a three-member delimitation commission redraw the new electoral map of J&K, earmarking 43 seats to the Hindu-majority Jammu region and 47 to Muslim-majority Kashmir, making up a total of 90 seats for the UT's assembly, up from the previous 83. Out of the seven new seats added, six were allotted to Jammu and one to Kashmir. The Opposition parties in the region rejected the panel's decision, calling it a bid to consolidate BJP's vote bank. The BJP rejected the charge, accusing the Opposition of misleading the people.\n\nPDP leader Khursheed Alam, who was part of the party's delegation that met EC, said the people of J&K should have the right to elect their own government.\n\n\"The county believes in democracy, so we should have elections immediately. We told the EC members about how the Amarnath pilgrimage was held peacefully, and a large number of people participated in the Lok Sabha polls as well. We also apprised the commission about the problems people are facing due to the absence of an elected government,\" he said.\n\nIn the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, J&K recorded a voter turnout of 58.46%, the highest in 35 years. The BJP won two seat, the NC two and an independent won one.\n\nThe heightened political activity in the region comes against the backdrop of a surge in terror attacks in the Jammu region, prompting the country's political and defence brass to review the security situation in J&K. Political leaders said that they urged EC to ensure adequate security arrangements are made to ensure free and fair polls.\n\n\"We urged them to hold elections at the earliest and ensure that the security issues of political leaders are addressed,\" Congress's J&K vice-president Ghulam Nabi Monga said.\n\nFormer BJP legislator and senior party leader Surinder Ambardar said they focused on the \"security and administrative concerns\" of parties during their meeting with the EC team.\n\n\"We told the EC that assembly elections haven't been held for a long time in J&K and they should be held immediately, \" he said.\n\nAfter meeting representatives of political parties, the EC delegation held a meeting with deputy police commissioners and senior superintendents of police (SSPs) of all 20 districts on the security situation in J&K.\n\nOn Friday, the commission is scheduled to hold meetings with J&K chief secretary Atul Duloo and director general of police (DGP) RR Swain as part of the process to decide the poll schedule for UT. The three-day visit will culminate on August 10 at Jammu where EC will hold a review meeting with enforcement agencies and hold a press briefing.", "source": {"uri": "hindustantimes.com", "dataType":

The polls' schedule is yet to be announced by the EC.\n\nThe BJP's Jammu and Kashmir unit batted for immediate assembly elections. Its spokesperson R S Pathania said, \"We told the EC that we want elections to be conducted as soon as possible.\" The party wants the elections to be held within the Supreme Court's deadline, he said.\n\nNC Kashmir provincial president Nasir Aslam Wani, who led a five-member party delegation, said the NC demanded immediate assembly elections. \"Our only demand is that the people of J-K now want to have their own government. We told the EC that you came here many times and we met you but now there should be some definite decision on it,\" he told reporters.\n\n\"We said there has been no government in J-K since 2018 and the assembly elections have not taken place for the last 10 years,\" Wani said and added that the NC told the EC that a Lieutenant Governor, his lone advisor and a few bureaucrats cannot run the UT.\n\nPolitical, developmental and security issues can be addressed when the people have their own representatives, he said and added that \"they (the EC) have assured us that elections will take place this time\".\n\nCongress leader G N Monga said democracy should flourish in Jammu and Kashmir. \"We call ourselves the mother of democracy but the people of J-K are without elections since last many years. Democracy should flourish here and elections should be held sooner,\" he told reporters.\n\nMonga said the party delegation also discussed the security scenario in J-K with the EC.\n\n\"We told them that there is a discrimination between parties on providing them security, so, we appealed that every party should be weighed in the same scale,\" he added.\n\nPDP leader Khurshid Alam, who was part of the party's delegation that met the EC, said people of J-K should have the right to elect their own government.\n\n\"What justification is there not to hold polls when the government says the situation has improved and is better, when one crore tourists came here, and when the parliamentary polls and (Amarnath) yatra took place without any incident,\" he asked.\n\nHe said the need of the hour is to restore democracy in J-K. \"The county believes in democracy, so we should have elections immediately,\" the PDP leader said and added that the there was a very positive response from the EC. NC leader Wani said the party also demanded a level-playing field in terms of providing a secure environment for the polls.\n\n\"We do not have personal differences with the L-G, but he is basically a political appointee and we have apprehensions that his decisions may be biased. So, we requested them (the EC) that the government be sanitised to provide a level-playing field without any bias. Such an environment should be created in terms of security which will provide a level-playing field,\" he added.\n\nAsked if the party was hopeful of the conduct of the polls, he said, \"We have always been hopeful, and this time also we are hopeful. The EC has assured us that this will now be completed because they told that there were certain things which they had to complete and which are now in place. Now, I do not see any reason for not conducting the election,\" he said.\n\nWani said the party is hopeful that the Supreme Court's September 30 deadline would be met.\n\n\"When the Parliamentary polls were conducted in a good manner, they why cannot assembly polls be held. Polls have taken place in difficult times also, even in 1996 when the situation was bad.\n\n\"We told the EC that it is a question of their credibility. Either you make stronger those voices which do not want elections, or you have to maintain your credibility and conduct the election,\" Wani said and added the response of the ECI was positive.\n\nAfter this meeting, the EC will review the preparations with election officers and superintendents of police all districts as well as the chief secretary and the director general of police.\n\nThe EC team's visit will culminate on August 10 at Jammu where it will hold a review meeting with law enforcement agencies. It will also hold a press conference.

The response has been overwhelmingly positive, with many aspirants already submitting their resumes.\n\nThe received resumes will be shortlisted by the BJP, and the list will then be sent to the party's high command. The high command will finalise the candidates from the shortlisted list submitted by the Jammu and Kashmir unit of the party.\n\nThe Jammu and Kashmir BJP is considering factors such as an individual's contribution to the party and society, in addition to other factors, when shortlisting candidates. This is the first time assembly elections are being held in Jammu and Kashmir since 2015, when the BJP won a record 25 seats in the Jammu region.\n\nThe 2015 coalition government formed by the BJP and PDP was based on the Agenda for Alliance. However, the government lasted for only three years before the BJP withdrew its support from the PDP.

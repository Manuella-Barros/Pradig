{"id": 225027572, "title": "If AI can do your job, maybe it can also replace your CEO", "text": "As artificial intelligence (AI) programs shake up the office, potentially making millions of jobs obsolete, one group of perpetually stressed workers seems especially vulnerable. These employees analyze new markets and discern trends, both tasks a computer could do more efficiently. They spend much of their time communicating with colleagues, a laborious activity that is being automated with voice and image generators. Sometimes they must make difficult decisions \u2014 and who is better at being dispassionate than a machine? Finally, these jobs are very well paid, which means the cost savings of eliminating them is considerable. The CEO is increasingly imperiled by AI, just like the writer of news releases and the customer service representative. Dark factories, which are entirely automated, may soon have a counterpart at the top of the corporation: dark suites. This is not just a prediction. A few successful companies have begun to publicly experiment with the notion of an AI leader, even if at the moment it might largely be a branding exercise. AI has been hyped as the solution to all corporate problems for about 18 months now, ever since OpenAI rolled out ChatGPT in November 2022. Silicon Valley put $29 billion last year into generative AI and is selling it hard. Even in its current rudimentary form, AI that mimics human reasoning is finding a foothold among distressed companies with little to lose and lacking strong leadership. \u201cIn struggling companies, you\u2019ll be replacing operational management first but probably keep a few humans to think beyond the machines,\u201d said Saul J. Berman, a former senior consulting partner with IBM. Overall, he said, \u201cthe change delivered by AI in corporations will be as great or greater at the higher strategic levels of management as the lower ranks.\u201d CEOs themselves seem enthusiastic about the prospect \u2014 or maybe just fatalistic. EdX, the online learning platform created by administrators at Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that is now a part of publicly traded 2U Inc., surveyed hundreds of CEOs and other executives last summer about the issue. Respondents were invited to take part and given what edX called \u201ca small monetary incentive\u201d to do so. The response was striking. Nearly half \u2014 47% \u2014 of the executives surveyed said they believed \u201cmost\u201d or \u201call\u201d of the CEO role should be completely automated or replaced by AI. Even executives believe executives are superfluous in the late digital age. When Anant Agarwal, the founder of edX and a former director of MIT\u2019s Computer Science and AI Lab, first saw the 47%, his initial response was that the executives should be saying something else entirely. \u201cMy first instinct is they would say, \u2018Replace all the employees but not me,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut I thought more deeply and would say 80% of the work that a CEO does can be replaced by AI.\u201d That includes writing, synthesizing, exhorting the employees. More subtly, AI \u2014 if it reaches any of the levels its salespeople are promising \u2014 will democratize the job of top management even while scaling it back. \u201cThere used to be a curve of people who were good with numerical skills and those who were not,\u201d Agarwal said. \u201cThen the calculator came along and was the great equalizer. I believe AI will do the same thing for literacy. Everybody could be CEO.\u201d Working for the robots has been a long time coming, at least in the realm of popular culture. Perhaps the first use of the phrase \u201crobot-boss\u201d was in 1939 in a story by David C. Cooke in a pulp magazine called simply Science Fiction. It was not an empowering tale of mentorship and mutual support. \u201cRemember,\u201d the robot-boss says, \u201cmy photon gun will shoot faster than you can run, so don\u2019t try to get away.\u201d Many science fiction stories and movies followed that portrayed the human-machine relationship in an equally dark light. Nevertheless, real people seemed to perversely warm to the idea. In a 2017 survey of 1,000 British workers commissioned by an online accounting firm, 42% said they would be \u201ccomfortable\u201d taking orders from a computer. Long before the current AI boom, Jack Ma, then the CEO of Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba, predicted that in 30 years \u201ca robot will likely be on the cover of Time magazine as the best CEO.\u201d He pointed out that robots were quicker and more rational than humans, and were not driven by emotions like anger. Chinese online game company NetDragon Websoft, which has 5,000 employees, appointed what it calls an \u201cAI-driven rotating CEO\u201d named Tang Yu in 2022. \u201cWe believe AI is the future of corporate management,\u201d said the company\u2019s founder, Dejian Liu, adding that it was part of NetDragon\u2019s move into the \u201cmetaverse-based working community.\u201d Tang Yu, who is personified as a woman, does not appear on an online chart of NetDragon\u2019s management team, but the company announced last month that she had won \u201cthe coveted title of \u2018China\u2019s Best Virtual Employee of the Year\u2019\u201d at the China Digital Human Industry Forum. Another executive picked up the award for her. NetDragon\u2019s AI employee team is in charge of performance evaluations and mentoring, among other duties, the company says. On the other side of the world, upscale Polish rum company Dictador announced in November that it had an AI humanoid CEO, Mika. She proclaimed on LinkedIn that she was \u201cdevoid of personal bias, ensuring unbiased and strategic choices that prioritize the organization\u2019s best interests.\u201d Executives with the National Association of Chief Executive Officers might have something to say about this trend \u2014 if only to deny it \u2014 but its website does not list any actual human beings affiliated with the group. A message sent through a \u201ccontact us\u201d prompt received no reply. AI experts, the human kind, cautioned that we are still at the beginning of any transition but said this is a natural progression. \u201cWe\u2019ve always outsourced effort. Now we\u2019re outsourcing intelligence,\u201d said Vinay Menon, who leads the global AI practice at the consultant Korn Ferry. He warned that \u201cwhile you may not need the same number of leaders, you will still need leadership.\u201d For one thing, humans provide accountability in a way that machines do not. \u201cAI may be exploited by some as a way to shield folks from having to take fiduciary responsibility,\u201d said Sean Earley, a managing director of the executive consulting firm Teneo. \u201cAt what point does it become culpable for a mistake?\u201d \u201cNever\u201d was the position one company took in court recently. A customer brought a case against Air Canada for declining to give the bereavement fare reduction that a chatbot on the airline\u2019s site had promised. The customer took his complaint to a small claims tribunal. Air Canada argued in its defense that it cannot be held liable for information provided by one of its agents, servants or representatives \u2014 including a chatbot. The judge ruled against the airline and in favor of the passenger in February, but the specter of a company\u2019s arguing that its own AI could not be trusted did not bode well for AI management teams. Air Canada declined to comment. Much of the discussion over the past year about AI in the workplace has revolved around how rank-and-file employees are at risk unless they incorporate new technology into their jobs \u2014 without, of course, letting their jobs become AI. Automation historically puts workers at risk even as it benefits investors and managers. Now the tables are turned. Researchers speculate that automation on the executive level could even help lower-level workers. \u201cSomeone who is already quite advanced in their career and is already fairly self-motivated may not need a human boss anymore,\u201d said Phoebe V. Moore, professor of management and the futures of work at the University of Essex Business School. \u201cIn that case, software for self-management can even enhance worker agency.\u201d The pandemic prepared people for this. Many office workers worked from home in 2020, and quite a few still do, at least several days a week. Communication with colleagues and executives is done through machines. It\u2019s just a small step to communicating with a machine that doesn\u2019t have a person at the other end of it. \u201cSome people like the social aspects of having a human boss,\u201d Moore said. \u201cBut after COVID, many are also fine with not having one.\u201d", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/ai-can-do-your-job-can-replace-your-ceo-9359487/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/05/Untitled-design-2024-05-29T181045.823.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:47:56", "author": "New York Times", "authors": ["New York Times"], "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": -0.402}

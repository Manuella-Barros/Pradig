Pesky weeds often wait beneath the soil - dormant - prepping themselves for the perfect time to bloom, according to Green Art. However, a garden ravished with weeds isn't ideal if you want to have friends over to enjoy the warm weather. Luckily seasoned garden pro Alan Titchmarsh has revealed the several ways you can make your garden weed-free. Here, FEMAIL takes a look at the five steps the 74-year-old recommends to keep your space lush and without weeds... Speaking to Gardeners World, Alan Titchmarsh (pictured) revealed his five methods for taking on both annual and perennial weeds 1. Dig it up There are typically two types of weeds which pop up in your garden - perennials and annual seeds, according to Alan (pictured: Dandelions) Alan suggests that a great way to rid your garden of weeds is by digging them out of the ground (stock image) There are typically two types of weeds which pop up in your garden - perennials and annual seeds, according to Alan. If left to grow and run rampant throughout your garden even the shallow-rooted weeds such as hairy bitter-crest can be an issue. Although easy to get rid of by digging up the plant it can spread via seed if left in the garden. However perennial plants - such as dandelions, nettles and buttercups, can prove to be a bigger issue due to their thick roots. According to Alan, a great way to rid your garden of weeds is by digging them out of the ground. 'It's important with all these thick-rooted weeds that they come out completely,' he said referring to the perennial weeds in a Gardeners' World clip. To shovel away annual seeds such as couch grows a garden hand trowel will be sufficient, however for perennials such as bindweed you will need a garden hand trowel. Explaining how to get rid of tap-rooted weeds, Alan instructed green-thumbed enthusiasts to get each one out by digging the entirety of the roots. 2. Hoe them away Another method the gardening veteran suggests is hoeing bare and dry areas of garden on a weekly basis (stock image) The gardening veteran also advises those who want to ensure their garden is weed-free to hoe dry bare areas weekly. Doing so ensures that the weeds cannot germinate and spread across your green space. Alan advises hoeing the area on a dry day so any weeds impacted by the scraped surface will simply wither away and die as a result of dehydration. 3. Pull by hand To prevent annual weeds spreading their seeds you can pull them out by hand as their roots tend to be shallow (stock image of bindweed) Although you cannot simply pull perennial weeds out of the ground, you can simply tug at annual weeds such as groundsel and chickweed. In doing so you target the weed before it has a chance to spread its seeds across your garden according to Alan. Read More What is chaos gardening?

According to Gardeners World, weeds like Herb Robert do not grow roots deep into the ground and they are fairly easy to remove with your hands. 4. Scrape them out Sometimes weeds can grow in awkward places, such as in between paving slabs. To solve this issue, Alan advises gardeners to use an old knife or a weeding tool to scrape out the roots. He instructs to 'tease' the root out and to use residual path weed killer if you want to opt for chemicals and to stop further weeds from emerging. 5. Spray them away If your garden weeds have gotten particularly out of hand then you can use chemicals such as systemic weed killer in an attempt to get your garden weed-free If your weed infestation has become severe, Alan suggests using chemicals such as systemic weed killer to rid your garden of any weeds. The 74-year-old says to dab or directly spray the chemicals onto weeds when rain is not predicted to fall.

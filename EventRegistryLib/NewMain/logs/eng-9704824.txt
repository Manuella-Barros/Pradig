That's not okay,\" Gonzales said. \"We as an agency are stepping up patrol and enforcement.\"\n\nFor the past couple years, Colorado Parks and Wildlife has kept an unofficial count of water-related deaths that occur in state parks or were reported to the agency. So far this year, water related deaths are outpacing last year, when 32 people died throughout the summer seaso. This year is trending closely with 2022, when a record-breaking 42 people died while recreating in the water.\n\nAlready this summer, water related deaths threaten to surpass 2021, when Colorado Parks and Wildlife recorded 22 deaths across the entire summer.\n\nGonzales said to help reverse the tide on this summer's deadly trend, state officials are urging anyone heading out on the water to wear a piece of equipment that is well-known but all-too-often neglected: a life jacket.\n\n\"We're to the point where we're now begging people to please wear them,\" Gonzales said. \"They're so important. I think life vest tan lines are the coolest tan lines out there.\"\n\nWhitewater activities like rafting accounted for a number of the deaths so far this season as rivers have surged due to a strong snowpack and a warm spring.\n\nWhen a 56-year-old man died in a rafting accident in the Yarmony Rapids of the Colorado River last month, neither he nor his partner, who has been reported missing, were wearing life jackets.\n\nA New Castle man, identified as an experienced river-user, also died last month while rafting on the Colorado River. He also was not wearing a life jacket, often referred to as a personal flotation device, or PFD.\n\nWhile flows on the Colorado River and other many whitewater destinations in the state are not as high as they were a couple weeks ago, Mesa County Search and Rescue volunteer Nicholas Ingalls said that doesn't mean rafters should drop their guard.\n\n\"Our accident type is typically 'inexperienced person falls out of boat without a PFD.' That is the classic most likely kind of accident that is going to result in a fatality,\" Ingalls said. \"The vast majority of (fatal) accidents are caused by a lack of PFDs.\"\n\nExtreme sports like whitewater rafting may account for some water-related deaths, but Colorado Parks and Wildlife public information officer Bridget O'Rourke said that activities like paddleboarding or kayaking on ponds and reservoirs can also be dangerous. In fact, there have been more water-related deaths on flatwater this year than on swiftwater, O'Rourke said.\n\n\"What we're noticing is that this season people are not wearing their life jackets,\" O'Rourke said. \"So when their boat is capsizing they don't have time to get their life jacket on even if it's on their kayak or paddleboard.\"\n\nThat has been true across the Western Slope, where ponds and reservoirs can be ice cold and where high winds and storms can strike out of nowhere and be hard to anticipate, O'Rourke said. The difference between wearing a life jacket and not wearing one can literally be the difference between life and death, she said.\n\nIn May, a 28-year-old man died after being knocked from his paddleboard in high winds at Harvey Gap State Park. The same month, a 26-year-old man died after a gust of strong wind knocked him from his paddleboard at Rifle Gap State Park. A 25-year-old also drowned after his canoe capsized at Trout Lake south of Telluride. Life jackets were not worn during any of these incidents.\n\nBut across the mountains, life jackets have saved countless lives. In late July, for example, three people -- all wearing paddling life jackets -- were OK after crashing into a tree while rafting on the Roaring Fork River near Basalt.\n\nLife jackets also lived up to their name when a windstorm capsized several boats at the Dillon Reservoir in Summit County over Memorial Day weekend. All three people rescued that day were hypothermic by the time teams pulled them from the 43-degree water. Luckily, all three were also wearing life jackets that kept their heads above water until rescuers could reach them.\n\n\"It's sad to think that out of the over 20 water-related fatalities this year, the majority of those could have been prevented if the person was wearing a life jacket,\" O'Rourke said. \"It really is a life saver.\"\n\nAs the summer warms up and more people seek refuge on the water, Gonzales said Colorado Parks and Wildlife officers have been instructed to be on the look-out for life-jacket related violations.\n\nUnder Colorado state law children under the age of 13 must wear a life jacket whenever they are on a vessel, including kayaks and paddleboards. Meanwhile, adults must carry a properly fitting life jacket with them on their vessel. There is a $100 fine for violations.\n\n\"It may not seem like much, but that's $100 that can go to something else,\" Gonzales said. \"And your life is worth more than $100.\"\n\nWhile the letter of the law may only require adults to carry a life jacket on their vessel, Gonzales noted that having a life jacket onboard does no good if someone ends up in the water without it. Wearing a life jacket also sets a good example for children who are around, she added.\n\nO'Rourke noted that several state parks and other popular locations like the Dillon Reservoir have life jacket loaner stations where people can borrow life jackets for free. With the Fourth of July holiday ahead, O'Rourke said that officials will not only be strictly enforcing life jacket rules this weekend but will also be cracking down on boating while impaired.\n\nOperation Dry Water, an enforcement operation timed to educate visitors over the holiday about the dangers of boating under the influence, will be in full force headed into the Fourth of July weekend, O'Rourke said. The operation will include increased patrols and checkpoints.\n\nSun, wind, noise, vibration and motion while boating can intensify the effects of alcohol, such as impaired judgment, balance, vision and slowed reaction times, according to Colorado Parks and Wildlife. Boaters with a blood alcohol content above the .08 state limit could be arrested for boating under the influence.\n\nOne drink on the land is about equivalent to three drinks on the water, O'Rourke said. That increase in impairment could make it extra important to wear a life jacket, she said.\n\n\"(Boating) intensifies the effects of alcohol, and it impairs balance and vision and reaction time,\" O'Rourke said, \"which again is why it is so important to be wearing a life jacket if you're going to be doing that.\"", "source": {"uri": "aspentimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aspen Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_spencer@aspentimes.com", "name": "Ryan Spencer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Parks_and_Wildlife", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Parks and Wildlife"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_River", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Colorado River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafting", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rafting"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paddleboarding", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Paddleboarding"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_flotation_device", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Personal flotation device"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitewater", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Whitewater"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowpack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Snowpack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drowning", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Drowning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_park", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "State park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_spring", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hot spring"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Independence Day (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reservoir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pond", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pond"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "River"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trout", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trout"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Western_Slope", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Colorado Western Slope"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_and_rescue", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Search and rescue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_sport", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Extreme sport"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayaking", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kayaking"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayak", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kayak"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telluride,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Telluride, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Telluride, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesa_County,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mesa County, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mesa County, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summit_County,_Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Summit County, Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Summit County, Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Camping", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Outdoors/Camping", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Society/Disabled/Recreation", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme_Parks/Water_Parks", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Theme Parks/Water Parks", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://swiftmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/mountain.swiftcom.com/images/sites/5/2024/07/02081018/2B89B777-F8D8-4E2B-86E6-6585B82E8B13.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9704824", "eventUri": "eng-9704824", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 178, "relevance": 1}

Use the free sunscreen stations at select state parks\n\nBoating and River Safety\n\nThis year, the majority of water-related deaths occurred because people did not wear a life jacket.\n\nAccording to CPW, there have been over 20 water-related fatalities in Colorado so far this year. In 2023 CPW tracked 32 water-related deaths, which was 12 less than in 2022. In 2021 there were 22 deaths and 34 deaths in 2020.\n\nCPW officers are currently writing $100+ tickets for boaters and paddlers who are on the water without life jackets.\n\nIn order to stay safe while having fun on the water, CPW recommends the following safety tips:\n\nWear a life jacketDress accordingly to the cold temperature of the water to protect yourself from the dangers of cold water shockLife jackets are required while on paddleboards and kayaksHeavy rain or melting snow in nearby mountains can raise water levels quickly and without notice. You can check water flows at the Colorado's Decision Support Systems websiteOnly boat or paddle in conditions that you feel comfortable and confident paddling inBoat and raft with a buddy, especially during high flowsIf you're unsure how to navigate challenging water conditions, consider hiring a Colorado-licensed river outfitter CPW Provides A Warning About Waterways as Arkansas River Approached Flood Stage\n\nBe Careful with Fire\n\nDespite parts of Colorado receiving high levels of moisture this year, drought conditions still impact whether campfires are allowed or restricted this summer.\n\nCheck the Colorado Trail Explorer (COTREX) website or app for active fire alerts, including wildfires and prescribed burnsCheck fire restrictions or bans at the Colorado Division of Homeland Security & Emergency Management Department of Public Safety websiteUse designated campfire areas when allowed and available When putting out fires, drown campfires with water until you can touch the embersNever leave a campfire unattended Fire that burned near Twin Lakes Caused By Humans Says United States Forest Service\n\nKeep Wildlife Wild\n\nSummertime is a sensitive time for wildlife since many species can get more aggressive to protect their young. Cow elk and moose in particular become incredibly protective of their immobile newborns.\n\nCPW has come out with the following safety tips to stay safe around wildlife this season:\n\nDo not feed or approach young wildlifeStay \"bear aware\" while on trails or campingKeep dogs leashed to prevent them from chasing wildlifeIf you see injured or sick wildlife, leave it alone and call your local Colorado Parks and Wildlife office Elk Attacks Keep Happening in Colorado.

The department did not name the politician whom the suspect allegedly wanted to assassinate, but said in a news release that law enforcement foiled the plot before any attack could be carried out.\n\nA criminal complaint unsealed in Brooklyn, New York, on August 6 said Merchant sought to recruit people in the United States to carry out the plot in retaliation for the killing of Qassem Soleimani, a former commander of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps' (IRGC's) elite Quds Force, who was assassinated in January 2020.\n\nThen-President Donald Trump approved the drone strike on Soleimani. Iran has repeatedly vowed revenge for the high-profile killing.\n\nMerchant, who prosecutors allege spent time in Iran before traveling to the United States from Pakistan, was charged with murder for hire in federal court in Brooklyn.\n\nAn individual Merchant contacted in April to help assist with the plot reported his activities to law enforcement and became a confidential informant, according to the complaint, the Justice Department news release said. Merchant instructed the informant to arrange meetings with individuals whom Merchant could hire to carry out the assassination and other acts.\n\nMerchant met in June with the would-be hitmen, who were in fact undercover U.S. law enforcement officers.\n\nMerchant said he had received instructions to \"finalize\" the plan and leave the United States from the unidentified \"party\" he had been working with. He told the undercover agents that they would receive instructions in either the last week of August or the first week of September after he had departed the United States.\n\nMerchant subsequently made flight arrangements and planned to leave the United States on July 12. Law enforcement agents placed him under arrest before he could leave the country. The complaint said a federal judge ordered Merchant detained on July 17.\n\nTrump, the Republican Party's nominee in the November 5 presidential election, was wounded on July 13 in an assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland said that investigators have found no evidence that Merchant had any connection to the attempt on Trump's life. Investigators have said the shooting, which wounded Trump in his right ear, was carried out by a lone 20-year-old gunman.\n\nU.S. Attorney Breon Peace for the Eastern District of New York said Merchant \"planned the murder of U.S. government officials on American soil\" working on behalf of others overseas.\n\n\"This prosecution demonstrates that this office and the entire Department of Justice will take swift and decisive action to protect our nation's security, our government officials, and our citizens from foreign threats.\"\n\nThe FBI is investigating the case. Merchant has said that he has a wife and children in Iran and a wife and children in Pakistan. Avraham Moskowitz, a lawyer for Merchant, did not respond to a request for comment, Reuters reported.", "source": {"uri": "rferl.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty"},

Our ongoing investigation has not found evidence that this defendant (Merchant) had any connection to the shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania,\" a law information official said in a statement to CBS News.\n\nU.S. intelligence and law enforcement officials including FBI Director Christopher Wray have been investigating numerous threat streams from Iran against politicians and government officials that date back to the killing of top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani during the Trump administration. Former national security adviser John Bolton and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have also received threats from the Iranian government, but they are not mentioned in court documents.\n\nMerchant's alleged planning began in April, according to court documents, when he flew to the U.S. to \"recruit individuals to carry out his plot to assassinate U.S. government officials.\" Investigators said he later met with an unnamed co-conspirator-turned-FBI-informant in New York and began a months-long relationship during which time Merchant revealed his plans to the unnamed individual.\n\nDuring meetings in June, Merchant allegedly \"made a 'finger gun' motion with his hand, indicating that the opportunity was related to a killing\" and asked the FBI informant to set up meetings with potential hitmen.\n\nCourt papers revealed the plot included stealing documents or USB drives from an unnamed target's home, planning a protest as a distraction and \"killing a politician or government official.\"\n\n\"People who will be targeted are the ones who are hurting Pakistan and the world, [the] Muslim world,\" Merchant allegedly said. \"These are not normal people.\"\n\nHe drew out the plan on a napkin inside his New York hotel room, prosecutors said, and told the individual \"that there would be 'security all around' the person\" they were planning to kill. At one point in June, Merchant and the FBI informant drove around New York City \"looking for clubs where he could recruit other individuals to assist in his plot,\" according to court documents.\n\nThe unnamed individual arranged to have Merchant meet up with two undercover agents who Merchant thought were hitmen. \"During the meeting, Merchant presented himself as the 'representative' in the U.S., indicating that there were other people he worked for outside the U.S.,\" prosecutors wrote.

This case has led the US government to increase security for former President Donald Trump and other officials.\n\nWhile the criminal complaint does not name Trump explicitly, multiple sources have told reporters that one of the intended targets of the alleged plot was Trump.\n\nAccording to the court document, a federal complaint unsealed in Brooklyn has charged Asif Merchant, also known as \"Asif Raza Merchant,\" a 46-year-old Pakistani national, with murder-for-hire in connection with a foiled assassination plot targeting a politician or US government officials on American soil.\n\nThe plot was thwarted by law enforcement before any attack could be executed. Merchant is currently in federal custody in New York, according to the press release released by the FBI.\n\n\"Fortunately, the assassins Merchant allegedly tried to hire were undercover FBI Agents,\" said Acting Assistant Director Christie Curtis of the FBI New York Field Office. \"This case underscores the dedication and formidable efforts of our agents, analysts and prosecutors in New York, Houston, and Dallas. Their success in neutralizing this threat not only prevented a tragic outcome but also reaffirms the FBI's commitment to protecting our nation and its citizens from both domestic and international threats.\"\n\n\"Working on behalf of others overseas, Merchant planned the murder of US government officials on American soil,\" said US Attorney Breon Peace for the Eastern District of New York. \"This prosecution demonstrates that this Office and the entire US Department of Justice will take swift and decisive action to protect our nation's security, our government officials and our citizens from foreign threats.\"\n\nMerchant travelled to New York City and worked with a hit man to carry out the assassinations in late August or early September, federal prosecutors said in a court complaint. The complaint says the plot was intended to target high-ranking US officials, potentially including Trump.\n\nFBI investigators believe that the intended targets included Trump and other current and former US government officials.\n\nAccording to court documents, Merchant orchestrated a plot to assassinate a politician or US government officials on US soil. In approximately April 2024, after spending time in Iran, Merchant arrived in the United States from Pakistan and contacted a person he believed could assist him with the scheme. This individual reported Merchant's intentions to law enforcement and became a confidential source.\n\nIn early June, during a meeting with the confidential source, Merchant outlined his assassination plot and suggested that this opportunity would not be a one-time event. He made a gesture resembling a gun while discussing the killing and specified that the targets would be \"here,\" referring to the United States.\n\nMerchant's plan included various criminal activities: stealing documents from a target's residence, organizing protests, and ultimately assassinating a political figure or government official. He expressed concerns about security measures surrounding potential targets and discussed multiple scenarios for carrying out the assassination.\n\nIn mid-June, Merchant met with individuals he believed were hitmen but were actually undercover FBI agents (UCs). During these meetings, he sought their services for theft and assassination and indicated that he would provide instructions on whom to kill after leaving the US.\n\nMerchant arranged to pay USD 5,000 in cash as an advance for the assassination services and successfully delivered this payment on June 21. Following this transaction, he made plans to leave the country on July 12, 2024, one day before Trump's assassination attempt.

He was arrested last month as he prepared to leave the U.S. and after having told the men that he would provide further instructions, including the names of the intended targets, in August or September after he returned to Pakistan.\n\nCourt documents do not identify any of the potential targets. But U.S. officials acknowledged last month that a threat on Donald Trump's life from Iran prompted additional security in the days before a Pennsylvania rally in which Trump was injured by a gunman's bullet. That July 13 shooting, carried out by a 20-year-old Pennsylvania man, was unrelated to the Iran threat and Merchant's arrest has no connection to the Trump assassination attempt, a law enforcement official said.\n\nBut an FBI agent's affidavit suggests Merchant had current or former high-level officials like Trump in mind. He told an associate who was secretly cooperating with law enforcement that he wanted a \"political person\" to be killed, the complaint said, mapping out on a napkin the different scenarios in which the target could be assassinated and warning that there would be security \"all around.\"\n\nU.S. officials have warned for years about Iran's desire to avenge the 2020 killing of Qassem Soleimani, who led the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' Quds Force. That strike was ordered by Trump when he was president. The U.S. government since then has paid for security for multiple Trump administration officials, and in 2022, the Justice Department charged an Iranian operative in a foiled plot to kill Bolton.\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray said at a House hearing last month that the Iranian government had been \"extremely aggressive and brazen\" in recent years, and Attorney General Merrick Garland said Tuesday that \"we expect that these threats will continue and that these cases will not be the last.\n\n\"The Justice Department will spare no resource to disrupt and hold accountable those who would carry out Iran's lethal plotting against Americans,\" he said.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Tuesday during an afternoon press briefing that the U.S. had been \"tracking Iranian threats against former politicians.\"\n\n\"We consider this a national and homeland security matter of the highest priority. We have repeatedly met at the highest levels of our government to develop and implement a comprehensive response,\" she said.\n\nFederal officials identified Merchant, 46, as a Pakistani citizen who has said he has a wife and children in Iran and who traveled frequently to Iran, Syria and Iraq. A lawyer for Merchant declined to comment Tuesday when reached by The Associated Press.\n\nAfter Merchant's arrest, Justice Department prosecutors urged a judge to keep him locked up, writing in a detention memo that before flying from Pakistan to the U.S., \"the defendant had spent two approximately two weeks in Iran. Given the seriousness of the murder for hire charges, the defendant has every incentive to flee to either Pakistan or Iran, significantly reducing the likelihood of his appearance in this case should he flee.\"\n\nHe was ordered detained following a court appearance.\n\nCourt documents trace the foiled plot to this past April, when Merchant flew to the U.S. to recruit participants in the murder-for-hire scheme. He contacted a person he thought would help him but who instead alerted law enforcement. That person became a confidential source for investigators, including by introducing Merchant to the purported hitmen, officials said.\n\nAfter meeting the two undercover officers posing as hitmen, the affidavit says, Merchant told them the work would be long-term. He instructed them that in addition to the killings, he would expect them to arrange protests at political rallies, steal documents and launder money for him. He told them he would return to Pakistan before giving them additional instructions.\n\nOfficials say Merchant paid a $5,000 advance for the planned killings.\n\n\"Now we know we're going forward. We're doing this,\" one of the purported hitmen said, according to the affidavit.\n\n\"Yes, absolutely,\" Merchant replied.\n\nMerchant was arrested July 12, the same day he planned to leave the U.S. Prosecutors say a search of his wallet found a handwritten note that included code words he had used to communicate with the individuals he thought were hitmen.", "source": {"uri": "fox61.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "fox61.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@fox61.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bolton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Bolton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Advisor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Security Advisor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_killing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Contract killing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrest_warrant", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arrest warrant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Merrick Garland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Revolutionary_Guard_Corps", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quds_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quds Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qasem_Soleimani", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qasem Soleimani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Wray", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christopher A.

The person he contacted was a confidential informant working with the FBI, according to the criminal complaint.\n\nMerchant, 46, is charged with murder for hire.\n\nAsif was arrested July 12, one day prior Trump's July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, where he was shot in the ear.\n\n\"For years, the Justice Department has been working aggressively to counter Iran's brazen and unrelenting efforts to retaliate against American public officials for the killing of Iranian General Soleimani,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. \"The Justice Department will spare no resource to disrupt and hold accountable those who would seek to carry out Iran's lethal plotting against American citizens, and will not tolerate attempts by an authoritarian regime to target American public officials and endanger America's national security.\"\n\nBreon Peace, U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, added, \"Working on behalf of others overseas, Merchant planned the murder of U.S. government officials on American soil.\"\n\nIn April, Merchant arrived from Iran and contacted someone to help with his plot, according to officials. The person ended up being a confidential source who reported the information to law enforcement, according to the Justice Department. Merchant allegedly again met up with the source in early June and explained the assassination plot and said it was \"not a one-time opportunity,\" officials said.\n\n\"Specifically, Merchant requested men who could do the killing, approximately 25 people who could perform a protest as a distraction after the murder occurred, and a woman to do 'reconnaissance,'\" the complaint said.\n\nBy mid-June, he met up with the people he thought would carry out the hits -- but who were actually undercover law enforcement officials, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office.\n\nMerchant even paid the apparent hitmen $5,000 as an advance on the assassinations before making plans to leave the country when the killings took place, officials said. Instead, he was arrested on July 12, the date he planned to leave the U.S.\n\n\"Fortunately, the assassins Merchant allegedly tried to hire were undercover FBI Agents,\" acting Assistant Director Christie Curtis of the FBI New York Field Office said in a statement. \"This case underscores the dedication and formidable efforts of our agents, analysts and prosecutors in New York, Houston, and Dallas. Their success in neutralizing this threat not only prevented a tragic outcome but also reaffirms the FBI's commitment to protecting our nation and its citizens from both domestic and international threats.\"\n\nA final target had not been selected by the time Merchant made arrangements to fly out of the U.S., according to officials.\n\nInvestigators have said they've found no link between foreign operatives and Thomas Crooks, the 20-year-old shot and killed after he tried to assassinate Trump from a rooftop near the stage, but the arrest may help explain some last-minute adjustments to rally security.\n\n\"We were initially told that there was no Secret Service snipers coming but that was shifted either Thursday or Friday to indicate that there were,\" Pat Young, head of the Beaver County Emergency Services Unit, told ABC News. \"We had been told that this is the first time that a non-sitting president had been allocated Secret Service snipers. So that threw up some alarm bells for some of our guys that -- why the sudden shift -- from one stance to the other?\"", "source": {"uri": "weisradio.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WEIS"},

He expressed concerns about security measures surrounding potential targets and discussed multiple scenarios for carrying out the assassination.\n\nIn mid-June, Merchant met with individuals he believed were hitmen but were actually undercover FBI agents (UCs). During these meetings, he sought their services for theft and assassination and indicated that he would provide instructions on whom to kill after leaving the US.\n\nMerchant arranged to pay USD 5,000 in cash as an advance for the assassination services and successfully delivered this payment on June 21. Following this transaction, he made plans to leave the country on July 12, 2024, one day before Trump's assassination attempt.

The FBI and DOJ believe that they were able to prevent any plan made by Merchant from being executed. They also say that Merchant is cooperating with FBI investigators. However, they also are taking into consideration known Iranian threats against Trump and have notified the Secret Service, which has increased their security for the GOP presidential nominee.\n\nRELATED: US Intelligence Was Warned About an Iranian Plot to Assassinate Trump\n\nThe assassination plots exposed in the unsealed indictment are part of a growing list of threats made by Iran to kill Trump and others, according to unnamed national security officials. The U.S. government has repeatedly raised concerns that Iran will possibly try to retaliate against the United States for the 2020 drone strike that killed Gen. Qasem Soleimani, a top general in Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, by trying to kill Trump or his former advisers.\n\nUS prosecutors have charged other individuals for similar assassination attempts in the past, including charges brought in 2022 against a 45-year-old Iranian national and IRGC member who allegedly tried to pay $300,000 to an individual in the US to kill former national security adviser John Bolton. In that case, prosecutors allege that the plot was \"likely in retaliation\" for Soleimani's death.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland said Tuesday that the US \"will not tolerate attempts by an authoritarian regime to target American public officials and endanger America's national security.\"\n\nAccording to DOJ prosecutors, while Merchant is a Pakistani national, he did travel to Iran and also has family living there as well. When Merchant arrived in New York in April of 2024, his goal was to hire an killer who would carry out assassinations against Trump and other officials in the U.S.. Merchant made contact with what he thought was a hitman who would assist him in his plot. However, that individual then contacted the FBI and became a confidential informant and assisted the Bureau in their investigation.\n\nMerchant met with the confidential human source in early June, prosecutors say, and said that he wanted he wanted to find people in New York to do three things: steal documents or USB drives from one victim's home, plan protests at political rallies and carry out assassinations. Merchant allegedly then told the confidential human source that the work was not a one-time opportunity and made a \"finger gun\" motion with his hand. As the meeting went on, Merchant spoke of a \"party\" back home with whom he was working, and started planning potential scenarios - even asking the confidential human source to explain how a person with \"security\" that was \"all around\" would die, prosecutors say.\n\nThe indictment mentioned that Merchant was trying to organize a large group of at least 25 people with different responsibilities or missions.\n\nMERCHANT then explained that his plot involved three different criminal schemes: (1) stealing documents or USB drives from a target's home; (2) planning a 6 protest; and (3) killing a politician or government official. MERCHANT stated that the victims would be \"targeted here,\" meaning in the United States. He also stated that the \"people who will be targeted are the ones who are hurting Pakistan and the world, [the] Muslim world. These are not normal people.\" Specifically, MERCHANT requested men who could do the killing, approximately twenty-five people who could perform a protest as a distraction after the murder occurred, and a woman to do \"reconnaissance.\" MERCHANT told the CS that these individuals needed to be trusted. MERCHANT also stated that he wanted the hitmen to procure him an untraceable phone so they could communicate securely.\n\nMerchant was planning on leaving the country before the attacks were to have been executed but was arrested before he was able to do so.", "source": {"uri": "redstate.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Redstate"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_funicello@redstate.com", "name":

This case has led the US government to increase security for former President Donald Trump and other officials.\n\nWhile the criminal complaint does not name Trump explicitly, multiple sources have told reporters that one of the intended targets of the alleged plot was Trump.\n\nAlso Read | Bangladesh Unrest: BSF Asks Troopers To Be Ready To Address Any Adverse Situation Promptly.\n\nAccording to the court document, a federal complaint unsealed in Brooklyn has charged Asif Merchant, also known as \"Asif Raza Merchant,\" a 46-year-old Pakistani national, with murder-for-hire in connection with a foiled assassination plot targeting a politician or US government officials on American soil.\n\nThe plot was thwarted by law enforcement before any attack could be executed. Merchant is currently in federal custody in New York, according to the press release released by the FBI.\n\nAlso Read | Bangladesh Unrest: Maharashtra CM Eknath Shinde Urges MEA for Urgent Assistance, Safe Return of Students.\n\n\"Fortunately, the assassins Merchant allegedly tried to hire were undercover FBI Agents,\" said Acting Assistant Director Christie Curtis of the FBI New York Field Office. \"This case underscores the dedication and formidable efforts of our agents, analysts and prosecutors in New York, Houston, and Dallas. Their success in neutralizing this threat not only prevented a tragic outcome but also reaffirms the FBI's commitment to protecting our nation and its citizens from both domestic and international threats.\"\n\n\"Working on behalf of others overseas, Merchant planned the murder of US government officials on American soil,\" said US Attorney Breon Peace for the Eastern District of New York. \"This prosecution demonstrates that this Office and the entire US Department of Justice will take swift and decisive action to protect our nation's security, our government officials and our citizens from foreign threats.\"\n\nMerchant travelled to New York City and worked with a hit man to carry out the assassinations in late August or early September, federal prosecutors said in a court complaint. The complaint says the plot was intended to target high-ranking US officials, potentially including Trump.\n\nFBI investigators believe that the intended targets included Trump and other current and former US government officials.\n\nAccording to court documents, Merchant orchestrated a plot to assassinate a politician or US government officials on US soil. In approximately April 2024, after spending time in Iran, Merchant arrived in the United States from Pakistan and contacted a person he believed could assist him with the scheme. This individual reported Merchant's intentions to law enforcement and became a confidential source.\n\nIn early June, during a meeting with the confidential source, Merchant outlined his assassination plot and suggested that this opportunity would not be a one-time event. He made a gesture resembling a gun while discussing the killing and specified that the targets would be \"here,\" referring to the United States.\n\nMerchant's plan included various criminal activities: stealing documents from a target's residence, organizing protests, and ultimately assassinating a political figure or government official. He expressed concerns about security measures surrounding potential targets and discussed multiple scenarios for carrying out the assassination.\n\nIn mid-June, Merchant met with individuals he believed were hitmen but were actually undercover FBI agents (UCs). During these meetings, he sought their services for theft and assassination and indicated that he would provide instructions on whom to kill after leaving the US.\n\nMerchant arranged to pay USD 5,000 in cash as an advance for the assassination services and successfully delivered this payment on June 21. Following this transaction, he made plans to leave the country on July 12, 2024, one day before Trump's assassination attempt. However, law enforcement intervened and arrested him before he could depart, the court document added.

Authorities said they foiled the plot before any violence could be attempted -- in part because the people Merchant allegedly tried to hire were undercover FBI agents.\n\nAccording to court documents, Merchant in June met with what he thought were hit men, and told them he would have a number of assignments for them, including an assassination of targets whom he would identify later.\n\nMerchant was arrested, according to court papers, on July 12 -- one day before a 20-year-old man in Pennsylvania fired shots during a campaign rally in Butler, Pa., grazing Trump's ear. Investigators do not believe the Iranian plot and the actions by the Pennsylvania gunmen are related, according to law enforcement officials.\n\nThe alleged Iranian-backed plot, however, had raised concerns about Trump's safety in the weeks before the shooting, according to U.S. officials familiar with the investigation who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal discussions.\n\nThe investigation prompted a number of meetings among top officials at the Justice Department in the weeks leading up to the July 13 assassination attempt against Trump, according to one senior U.S. official. The alleged plot raised security concerns among law enforcement officials in part because it involved an individual traveling to the United States to hire specific people to carry out violence or other crimes, the officials said.\n\n\"For years, the Justice Department has been working aggressively to counter Iran's brazen and unrelenting efforts to retaliate against American public officials for the killing of Iranian General [Qasem] Soleimani,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a written statement Tuesday.\n\n\"The Justice Department will spare no resource to disrupt and hold accountable those who would seek to carry out Iran's lethal plotting against American citizens, and will not tolerate attempts by an authoritarian regime to target American public officials and endanger America's national security,\" Garland said.\n\nFBI Director Christopher A. Wray said the alleged plot \"is straight out of the Iranian playbook,\" and was met with \"the full might and resources of the FBI.\"\n\nAccording to the criminal complaint, Merchant arrived in the United States from Pakistan in April and contacted someone he believed could help him with the plot. That person reported Merchant's request to law enforcement, who set up a sting operation.\n\nMerchant allegedly told the source that his plan involved several criminal schemes, including stealing documents or computer data from a target's home, planning a protest and killing a politician or government official.\n\nHe then described a series of potential assassination scenarios, including situations in which there was extensive security around the person, according to court documents. He also indicated that any such assassination would take place after Merchant had left the United States, probably in late August or early September, officials said.", "source": {"uri": "washingtonpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Post"}, "authors": [{"uri": "josh_dawsey@washingtonpost.com", "name": "Josh Dawsey", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "devlin_barrett@washingtonpost.com", "name": "Devlin Barrett", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "shayna_jacobs@washingtonpost.com", "name": "Shayna Jacobs", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_killing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Contract killing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal judiciary of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Merrick Garland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Wray", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christopher A.

Merchant said the plot would be \"ongoing,\" not a \"one-time opportunity\" and made a \"'finger gun' motion\" with his hand to indicate it would involve killing, according to the complaint.\n\nIn a statement, Attorney General Merrick Garland connected the foiled plot to Iran's \"brazen and unrelenting efforts\" to get back at American public officials for the 2020 killing of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani.\n\nSoleimani was killed at the direction of U.S. officials during former President Trump's administration. Reports surfaced shortly after an attempted assassination on Trump's life at a rally in Pennsylvania last month that his security detail had been increased following intelligence that Tehran was plotting an assassination attempt on Trump in retaliation.\n\nThe Iranian regime denied such reports at the time.\n\nMerchant was arrested on July 12, the day before Trump's shooting at his rally in Butler, Pa.\n\n\"The Justice Department will spare no resource to disrupt and hold accountable those who would seek to carry out Iran's lethal plotting against American citizens, and will not tolerate attempts by an authoritarian regime to target American public officials and endanger America's national security,\" Garland said in his statement.\n\nThe Hill has reached out to Merchant's attorney for comment.\n\nProsecutors say Merchant traveled to the United States this April after spending time in Iran. Looking to recruit, he allegedly contacted an individual who became a confidential source for law enforcement.\n\nCharging documents state the source ultimately led Merchant to meet with two undercover agents posing as hitmen.\n\nIn the meeting, he allegedly sought three services: \"theft of documents, arranging protests at political rallies and for them to kill a 'political person,'\" according to prosecutors.\n\nThe instructions on whom to kill would come in the last week of August or first week of September, after Merchant had left the U.S., according to the complaint.\n\nMerchant arranged to leave the country on July 12 but was arrested before he could. The assassination attempt on Trump, which law enforcement has said does not appear connected to Merchant's plot, occurred on July 13.\n\n\"This dangerous murder-for-hire plot exposed in today's charges allegedly was orchestrated by a Pakistani national with close ties to Iran and is straight out of the Iranian playbook,\" FBI Director Christopher Wray said in a statement. \"A foreign-directed plot to kill a public official, or any U.S. citizen, is a threat to our national security and will be met with the full might and resources of the FBI.\"", "source": {"uri": "ksn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "KSN-TV"}, "authors": [{"uri": "zach_schonfeld@ksn.com", "name": "Zach Schonfeld", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "ella_lee@ksn.com", "name": "Ella Lee", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_killing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Contract killing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qasem_Soleimani", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Qasem Soleimani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Merrick Garland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covert_operation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Covert operation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarianism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Authoritarianism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Citizenship of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Wray", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Christopher A.

He is in federal custody.\n\nMerchant said that he wanted to target individuals in the United States who are \"hurting Pakistan and the world, [the] Muslim world,\" according to court documents, adding that \"these are not just normal people.\"\n\nThe FBI investigated the alleged international murder-for-hire plot in the weeks before a 20-year-old from Pennsylvania nearly assassinated the former president at one of his rallies. A law enforcement official told CNN that investigators have not found evidence that Merchant had any connection to the shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe FBI believes it foiled Merchant's plot before any attack, and in the weeks since his arrest he has cooperated with investigators, according to US officials. But the Iranian government's known threats against Trump, prompted the FBI to pass on the intelligence to the US Secret Service, which increased security protection for the former president, officials have said.\n\nAs part of the plot, prosecutors say, Merchant was seeking men to commit the actual assassinations, a woman to do \"reconnaissance,\" and around 25 people \"who could perform a protest as a distraction after the murder occurred.\"\n\nThe plot revealed by US prosecutors on Tuesday adds to a growing list of detailed Iranian plans to allegedly kill Trump, according to national security officials.\n\nThe US government has repeatedly raised concerns that Iran may try to retaliate for a 2020 US drone strike that killed Gen. Qasem Soleimani, a top general in Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) by trying to kill Trump or his former advisers.\n\n\"We have not received any reports on this matter from the U.S. Government,\" a spokesperson for Iran's Permanent Mission to the United Nations told CNN when asked about the Justice Department charges. \"However, it is evident that the modus operandi in question contradicts the Iranian Government's policy of legally prosecuting the murderer of General Soleimani.\"\n\nUS prosecutors have charged other individuals for similar assassination attempts in the past, including charges brought in 2022 against a 45-year-old Iranian national and IRGC member who allegedly tried to pay $300,000 to an individual in the US to kill former national security adviser John Bolton. In that case, prosecutors allege that the plot was \"likely in retaliation\" for Soleimani's death.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland said Tuesday that the US \"will not tolerate attempts by an authoritarian regime to target American public officials and endanger America's national security.\"\n\nThe alleged plot\n\nMerchant arrived in New York City in April, prosecutors say, and aimed to hire a hit man who would carry out assassinations against officials on US soil. Although Merchant is a Pakistani national, prosecutors say he spent time in Iran and has family there.\n\nOnce in the United States, Merchant allegedly contacted someone who he believed would assist him in the murder-for-hire plot. That person, however, contacted the FBI and began working for investigators as a confidential source.\n\nMerchant met with the confidential human source in early June, prosecutors say, and said that he wanted he wanted to find people in New York to do three things: steal documents or USB drives from one victim's home, plan protests at political rallies and carry out assassinations. Merchant allegedly told the confidential human source that the work was not a one-time opportunity and made a \"finger gun\" motion with his hand.\n\nAs the meeting went on, Merchant spoke of a \"party\" back home with whom he was working, and started planning potential scenarios - even asking the confidential human source to explain how a person with \"security\" that was \"all around\" would die, prosecutors say.\n\nLater that month, Merchant met with law enforcement officers working undercover as hitmen, according to prosecutors, and said he wanted them to kill a \"political person in late August or early September.\" Merchant allegedly arranged to pay them a $5,000 advance on the assassination.\n\nHe also allegedly told the hitmen to communicate with him about their plans in code, saying that \"the word 'tee-shirt' would mean a 'protest' (because it was the 'lightest' job), the phrase 'flannel shirt' would mean 'stealing,' because it was 'heavier work,' and the phrase 'fleece jacket,' would mean 'the third task ... commit the act of the game.'\" The third part of his plan, according to prosecutors, were the assassinations.\n\nMerchant planned to leave the country before the assassination, prosecutors say, but was arrested before he could go.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

He was arrested last month as he prepared to leave the U.S. and after having told the men that he would provide further instructions, including the names of the intended targets, in August or September after he returned to Pakistan.\n\nAsif Merchant Justice Department via AP\n\nCourt documents do not identify any of the potential targets. But U.S. officials acknowledged last month that a threat on Donald Trump's life from Iran prompted additional security in the days before a Pennsylvania rally in which Trump was injured by a gunman's bullet. That July 13 shooting, carried out by a 20-year-old Pennsylvania man, was unrelated to the Iran threat and Merchant's arrest has no connection to the Trump assassination attempt, a law enforcement official said.\n\nBut an FBI agent's affidavit suggests Merchant had current or former high-level officials like Trump in mind. He told an associate who was secretly cooperating with law enforcement that he wanted a \"political person\" to be killed, the complaint said, mapping out on a napkin the different scenarios in which the target could be assassinated and warning that there would be security \"all around.\"\n\nU.S. officials have warned for years about Iran's desire to avenge the 2020 killing of Qassem Soleimani, who led the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' Quds Force. That strike was ordered by Trump when he was president. The U.S. government since then has paid for security for multiple Trump administration officials, and in 2022, the Justice Department charged an Iranian operative in a foiled plot to kill Bolton.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray said at a House hearing last month that the Iranian government had been \"extremely aggressive and brazen\" in recent years, and Attorney General Merrick Garland said Tuesday that \"we expect that these threats will continue and that these cases will not be the last.\n\n\"The Justice Department will spare no resource to disrupt and hold accountable those who would carry out Iran's lethal plotting against Americans,\" he said.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Tuesday during an afternoon press briefing that the U.S. had been \"tracking Iranian threats against former politicians.\"\n\n\"We consider this a national and homeland security matter of the highest priority. We have repeatedly met at the highest levels of our government to develop and implement a comprehensive response,\" she said.\n\nFederal officials identified Merchant, 46, as a Pakistani citizen who has said he has a wife and children in Iran and who traveled frequently to Iran, Syria and Iraq. A lawyer for Merchant declined to comment Tuesday when reached by The Associated Press.\n\nAfter Merchant's arrest, Justice Department prosecutors urged a judge to keep him locked up, writing in a detention memo that before flying from Pakistan to the U.S., \"the defendant had spent two approximately two weeks in Iran. Given the seriousness of the murder for hire charges, the defendant has every incentive to flee to either Pakistan or Iran, significantly reducing the likelihood of his appearance in this case should he flee.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe was ordered detained following a court appearance.\n\nCourt documents trace the foiled plot to this past April, when Merchant flew to the U.S. to recruit participants in the murder-for-hire scheme. He contacted a person he thought would help him but who instead alerted law enforcement. That person became a confidential source for investigators, including by introducing Merchant to the purported hitmen, officials said.\n\nAfter meeting the two undercover officers posing as hitmen, the affidavit says, Merchant told them the work would be long-term. He instructed them that in addition to the killings, he would expect them to arrange protests at political rallies, steal documents and launder money for him. He told them he would return to Pakistan before giving them additional instructions.\n\nOfficials say Merchant paid a $5,000 advance for the planned killings.\n\n\"Now we know we're going forward. We're doing this,\" one of the purported hitmen said, according to the affidavit.\n\n\"Yes, absolutely,\" Merchant replied.\n\nMerchant was arrested July 12, the same day he planned to leave the U.S. Prosecutors say a search of his wallet found a handwritten note that included code words he had used to communicate with the individuals he thought were hitmen.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nComments are not available on this story.\n\nSend questions/comments to the editors.\n\n\" Previous\n\nHamas names Yahya Sinwar, mastermind of Oct. 7 attacks, as its new leader Related Stories Latest Articles", "source": {"uri": "pressherald.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Portland Press Herald"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_killing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Contract killing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bolton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Bolton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Advisor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Security Advisor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karine_Jean-Pierre", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Karine Jean-Pierre"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Merrick Garland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Revolutionary_Guard_Corps", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quds_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quds Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qasem_Soleimani", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qasem Soleimani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Wray", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christopher A.

Merchant, with purported ties to Iran, flew to the U.S. from Pakistan to recruit hitmen for the alleged plot. He contacted an individual who was a confidential FBI informant, detailing his plan to carry out the assassination. Merchant, 46, is charged with murder for hire.\n\nMerchant was apprehended on July 12, a day before Trump's rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, where Trump was shot in the ear. The arrest is part of the Justice Department's ongoing efforts to counter Iran's retaliation attempts for the killing of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland emphasized the department's commitment to preventing such threats against American citizens, while Breon Peace, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, highlighted Merchant's plan to murder U.S. government officials on American soil.\n\nAfter arriving in the U.S. from Iran in April, Merchant contacted someone he believed could assist with his plot, only to find out it was a confidential source working with law enforcement. In June, Merchant met with undercover FBI agents posing as hitmen, paying them $5,000 as an advance for the assassinations. He planned to leave the country after the killings, but was arrested on July 12.\n\nThis case underscores the FBI's dedication to protecting the nation from both domestic and international threats.

Former national security adviser John Bolton and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have also received threats from the Iranian government, but they are not mentioned in court documents.\n\nMerchant's alleged planning began in April, according to court documents, when he flew to the U.S. to \"recruit individuals to carry out his plot to assassinate U.S. government officials.\" Investigators said he later met with an unnamed co-conspirator-turned-FBI-informant in New York and began a months-long relationship during which time Merchant revealed his plans to the unnamed individual.\n\nDuring meetings in June, Merchant allegedly \"made a 'finger gun' motion with his hand, indicating that the opportunity was related to a killing\" and asked the FBI informant to set up meetings with potential hitmen.\n\nCourt papers revealed the plot included stealing documents or USB drives from an unnamed target's home, planning a protest as a distraction and \"killing a politician or government official.\"\n\n\"People who will be targeted are the ones who are hurting Pakistan and the world, [the] Muslim world,\" Merchant allegedly said. \"These are not normal people.\"\n\nHe drew out the plan on a napkin inside his New York hotel room, prosecutors said, and told the individual \"that there would be 'security all around' the person\" they were planning to kill. At one point in June, Merchant and the FBI informant drove around New York City \"looking for clubs where he could recruit other individuals to assist in his plot,\" according to court documents.\n\nThe unnamed individual arranged to have Merchant meet up with two undercover agents who Merchant thought were hitmen. \"During the meeting, Merchant presented himself as the 'representative' in the U.S., indicating that there were other people he worked for outside the U.S.,\" prosecutors wrote. He later agreed to pay the men $5,000 ahead of the plot as an advance and created a coded language to speak about the alleged assassination plan in secret.\n\nThe phrase \"fleece jacket\" allegedly referred to the assassination plot, court documents revealed.\n\nAccording to the criminal complaint, Merchant told the men he would provide more instructions about the alleged plot in \"either the last week of August 2024 or the first week of September 2024,\" including the target name.\n\nOn June 21, investigators alleged Merchant traveled from Boston to New York to pay the hitmen and ultimately handed over $5,000 in cash. He then \"reiterated that the plan was for the [undercover agents] to go forward with his three plots -- the assassination, the protest, and the stealing of documents. Merchant added that he wanted the [undercover agents] to launder money for him as well,\" according to charging documents.\n\nLaw enforcement officials arrested Merchant on July 12 at his residence ahead of a planned trip outside of the U.S. During a search, they recovered a handwritten note inside his wallet that contained the codewords for the various aspects of the plot.\n\n\"For years, the Justice Department has been working to aggressively counter Iran's brazen and unrelenting efforts to retaliate against American government officials for the killing of General Soleimani,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said Tuesday. \"The Justice Department will spare no resource to disrupt and hold accountable those who would carry out Iran's lethal plotting against Americans.\"\n\nGarland noted the greater awareness among Americans of the seriousness of threats against public officials after the assassination attempt against Trump but said investigators have found no evidence \"of any link between the defendant charged in the complaint unsealed today and the attempted assassination of the former President in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13.\"\n\nThomas Crooks fired eight rounds at the rally, injuring Trump and two others and killing one man, Corey Comperatore. A Secret Service sniper then killed Crooks.\n\nThe Secret Service called the attack a failure and said the FBI is still investigating Crooks' motive.\n\nRobert Legare\n\nRobert Legare is a CBS News multiplatform reporter and producer covering the Justice Department, federal courts and investigations.

He was arrested last month as he prepared to leave the U.S. and after having told the men that he would provide further instructions, including the name of the intended targets, in August or September after his return to Pakistan.\n\nCourt documents do not identify any of the potential targets. But U.S. officials acknowledged last month that a threat on Donald Trump's life from Iran prompted additional security in the days before a Pennsylvania rally in which Trump was injured by a gunman's bullet. That July 13 shooting, carried out by a 20-year-old Pennsylvania man, was unrelated to the Iran threat and Merchant's arrest has no connection to the Trump assassination attempt, a law enforcement official said.\n\nBut the newly unsealed criminal complaint suggests Merchant may have had high-level officials like Trump in mind. He told an associate who was secretly cooperating with law enforcement that he wanted a \"political person\" to be killed, the complaint said, mapping out on a napkin the different scenarios in which the target could be assassinated and warning that there would be security \"all around\" the person.\n\nU.S. officials have warned for years about Iran's desire to avenge the 2020 killing of Qassem Soleimani, who led the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' Quds Force. That strike was ordered by Trump when he was president. The U.S. government since then has paid for security for multiple Trump administration officials, and in 2022, the Justice Department charged an Iranian operative in a foiled plot to kill former national security adviser John Bolton.\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray said at a House hearing last month that the Iranian government had been \"extremely aggressive and brazen\" in recent years, and Attorney General Merrick Garland said Tuesday that \"we expect that these threats will continue and that these cases will not be the last.\n\n\"The Justice Department will spare no resource to disrupt and hold accountable those who would carry out Iran's lethal plotting against Americans,\" he said.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Tuesday during an afternoon press briefing, \"We've been tracking Iranian threats against former politicians.\"\n\n\"We consider this a national and homeland security matter of the highest priority. We have repeatedly met at the highest levels of our government to develop and implement a comprehensive response,\" she said.\n\nFederal officials identified Merchant as a Pakistani citizen who has said he has a wife and children in Iran and who traveled frequently to Iran, Syria and Iraq, the Justice Department said. A lawyer for Merchant declined to comment Tuesday when reached by The Associated Press. He appeared in court last month in Brooklyn and was ordered held.\n\nCourt documents traced the foiled plot to last April, when Merchant flew to the U.S. to recruit participants in the murder-for-hire scheme. He contacted a person who alerted law enforcement, and that person became a confidential source for investigators, including by introducing Merchant to the purported hitmen, prosecutors said.\n\nLast month, according to the complaint, he was introduced to the two undercover officers posing as hitmen. Prosecutors say he said that the work would be long-term and that he would most likely travel to Pakistan before giving them further instructions.\n\nOfficials say Merchant paid a $5,000 advance for the planned killings.\n\n\"Now we know we're going forward. We're doing this,\" one of the purported hitmen said, according to the complaint.\n\n\"Yes, absolutely,\" Merchant replied.\n\nMerchant was arrested July 12, the same day he planned to leave the U.S. Prosecutors say a search of his wallet found a handwritten note that included code words he had used to communicate with the individuals he thought were hitmen.", "source": {"uri": "wislawjournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Wisconsin Law Journal - WI Legal News & Resources"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@wislawjournal.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_killing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Contract killing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Merrick Garland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bolton", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "John Bolton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Revolutionary_Guard_Corps", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quds_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quds Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qasem_Soleimani", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qasem Soleimani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Wray", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christopher A.

Feds lock up man intending to kill * WorldNetDaily * by Bob Unruh", "body": "Federal authorities say they have jailed a Pakistani man who is accused of working on a plot to assassinate a politician \"or U.S. government officials,\" in an announcement that is more foreboding because of the recent attempt to shoot President Donald Trump at a Butler, Pennsylvania, rally.\n\nThat attempt, by a 20-year-old sniper who was shot and killed by police, failed. But the repercussions from the events that day already have cost the Secret Service chief her job and triggered multiple investigations into how America's elite program to protect leaders failed so badly.\n\nThe new scheme may or may not have targeted a particular individual, but a statement from the U.S. attorney's office in eastern New York explains a complaint was unsealed on Tuesday accusing Asif Merchant, aka \"Asif Raza Merchant,\" 46, of a murder-for-hire plot.\n\n\"Law enforcement foiled the charged plot before any attack could be carried out. Merchant is in federal custody in New York,\" authorities reported.\n\nGet the hottest, most important news stories on the Internet - delivered FREE to your inbox as soon as they break! Take just 30 seconds and sign up for WND's Email News Alerts!\n\nThe plotter allegedly was trying to repay America for the killing of Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani, a terror leader who was destroyed on the orders of Trump while he was in the White House.\n\nU.S. Attorney Breon Peace explained, \"Working on behalf of others overseas, Merchant planned the murder of U.S. government officials on American soil. This prosecution demonstrates that this office and the entire Department of Justice will take swift and decisive action to protect our nation's security, our government officials and our citizens from foreign threats.\"\n\nFBI chief Christopher Wray added, \"This dangerous murder-for-hire plot exposed in today's charges allegedly was orchestrated by a Pakistani national with close ties to Iran and is straight out of the Iranian playbook. A foreign-directed plot to kill a public official, or any U.S. citizen, is a threat to our national security and will be met with the full might and resources of the FBI.\"\n\nAccording to case documents, federal authorities explained, \"Merchant orchestrated a plot to assassinate a politician or U.S. government officials on U.S. soil. In approximately April 2024, after spending time in Iran, Merchant arrived in the United States from Pakistan and contacted a person he believed could assist him with the scheme. That person reported Merchant's conduct to law enforcement and became a confidential source (the CS).\"\n\nIn June Merchant met with the confidential source and said his plan was for an \"ongoing\" series of attacks.\n\n\"Merchant then made a 'finger gun' motion with his hand, indicating that the opportunity was related to a killing. Merchant further stated that the intended victims would be 'targeted here,' meaning in the United States. Merchant instructed the CS to arrange meetings with individuals whom Merchant could hire to carry out these actions,\" the federal officials reported.\n\nThey also reported Merchant discussed how a person would die, and promised he would communicate from overseas in code.\n\nMerchant also said he had discussed his agenda with a \"party\" overseas and he was told to \"finalize\" the plan and then leave the U.S.\n\nMerchant later met with undercover officers to pay them $5,000 cash for the job.\n\nA report at the Gateway Pundit said, \"FBI investigators believe that the intended targets of the plot included Trump and other current and former U.S. government officials, according to a U.S. official briefed on the matter, per CNN.\"\n\nThe shooter who tried to assassinate President Trump in late July, Thomas Matthew Crooks, apparently had no connection to the latest threat.\n\n\"Secret Service learned of the increased threat from this threat stream,\" one official told CNN. \"NSC directly contacted USSS at a senior level to be absolutely sure they continued to track the latest reporting. USSS shared this information with the detail lead, and the Trump campaign was made aware of an evolving threat. In response to the increased threat, Secret Service surged resources and assets for the protection of former President Trump.\"\n\nContent created by the WND News Center is available for re-publication without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

We're doing this,\" to which Merchant responded: \"Yes, absolutely.\"\n\nPolitical violence is a constant worry in the US.\n\nLast week, a man was arrested in Virginia for allegedly threatening to kill the Democratic Party presidential nominee Kamala Harris.\n\n\"Kamala Harris needs to be put on fire alive. I will do it personally if no one else does... I want her to suffer a slow agonising death,\" Frank Lucio Carillo posted on a right-wing social media site, according to the FBI complaint in a Federal court.\n\nHe also allegedly threatened President Joe Biden and FBI Chief Wray.\n\n(Arul Louis can be contacted at arul.l@ians.in and followed at @arulouis)", "source": {"uri": "weeklyvoice.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Weekly Voice"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qasem_Soleimani", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Qasem Soleimani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spy_fiction", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Spy fiction"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Merrick Garland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Wray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christopher A.

On June 10, Merchant allegedly met in New York with undercover law enforcement officers posing as assassins for hire.\n\nHe also, according to court documents, created a code for the group to talk and paid the undercover law enforcement officers $5,000 so they knew they were going forward.\n\nMerchant allegedly made plans to leave the U.S. on July 12, and the FBI arrested him that day at his home in Texas and conducted a search.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with NBC News last week, Attorney General Merrick Garland said the Iranians have been brazen and persistent about plotting to kill former Trump administration officials.\n\n\"I don't think that we have seen the end of this,\" he said. \"I expect we will hear more.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_winter@yahoo.com", "name": "Tom Winter", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "ken_dilanian@yahoo.com", "name": "Ken Dilanian", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_killing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Contract killing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Nightly_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC Nightly News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_News", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Revolutionary_Guard_Corps", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quds_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quds Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qasem_Soleimani", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qasem Soleimani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Wray", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christopher A.

The case disclosed by the Justice Department on Tuesday, August 6, is the latest murder-for-hire plot originating from abroad to target American public figures, coming two years after officials disrupted a separate scheme that they said was aimed at former Trump administration national security adviser John Bolton.\n\nAsif Merchant traveled to New York in June to meet with men he thought he was recruiting to carry out the killings, even paying a $5,000 advance to two would-be assassins who were actually undercover law enforcement officers, federal officials said. He was arrested last month as he prepared to leave the US and after having told the men that he would provide further instructions, including the names of the intended targets, in August or September after he returned to Pakistan.\n\nCourt documents do not identify any of the potential targets. But US officials acknowledged last month that a threat on Donald Trump's life from Iran prompted additional security in the days before a Pennsylvania rally in which Trump was injured by a gunman's bullet. That July 13 shooting, carried out by a 20-year-old Pennsylvania man, was unrelated to the Iran threat and Merchant's arrest has no connection to the Trump assassination attempt, a law enforcement official said.\n\nBut an FBI agent's affidavit suggests Merchant had current or former high-level officials like Trump in mind. He told an associate who was secretly cooperating with law enforcement that he wanted a \"political person\" to be killed, the complaint said, mapping out on a napkin the different scenarios in which the target could be assassinated and warning that there would be security \"all around.\"\n\nUS officials have warned for years about Iran's desire to avenge the 2020 killing of Qassem Soleimani, who led the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' Quds Force. That strike was ordered by Trump when he was president. The US government since then has paid for security for multiple Trump administration officials, and in 2022, the Justice Department charged an Iranian operative in a foiled plot to kill Bolton.\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray said at a House hearing last month that the Iranian government had been \"extremely aggressive and brazen\" in recent years, and Attorney General Merrick Garland said Tuesday that \"we expect that these threats will continue and that these cases will not be the last. \"The Justice Department will spare no resource to disrupt and hold accountable those who would carry out Iran's lethal plotting against Americans,\" he said.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Tuesday during an afternoon press briefing that the US had been \"tracking Iranian threats against former politicians.\" \"We consider this a national and homeland security matter of the highest priority. We have repeatedly met at the highest levels of our government to develop and implement a comprehensive response,\" she said.\n\nFederal officials identified Merchant, 46, as a Pakistani citizen who has said he has a wife and children in Iran and who traveled frequently to Iran, Syria and Iraq.\n\nAfter Merchant's arrest, Justice Department prosecutors urged a judge to keep him locked up, writing in a detention memo that before flying from Pakistan to the US, \"the defendant had spent two approximately two weeks in Iran. Given the seriousness of the murder-for-hire charges, the defendant has every incentive to flee to either Pakistan or Iran, significantly reducing the likelihood of his appearance in this case should he flee.\" He was ordered detained following a court appearance.\n\nCourt documents trace the foiled plot to this past April, when Merchant flew to the US to recruit participants in the murder-for-hire scheme. He contacted a person he thought would help him but who instead alerted law enforcement. That person became a confidential source for investigators, including by introducing Merchant to the purported hitmen, officials said.\n\nAfter meeting the two undercover officers posing as hitmen, the affidavit says, Merchant told them the work would be long-term. He instructed them that in addition to the killings, he would expect them to arrange protests at political rallies, steal documents and launder money for him. He told them he would return to Pakistan before giving them additional instructions.\n\nOfficials say Merchant paid a $5,000 advance for the planned killings. \"Now we know we're going forward. We're doing this,\" one of the purported hitmen said, according to the affidavit. \"Yes, absolutely,\" Merchant replied.\n\nMerchant was arrested July 12, the same day he planned to leave the US Prosecutors say a search of his wallet found a handwritten note that included code words he had used to communicate with the individuals he thought were hitmen.", "source": {"uri": "lemonde.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "Le Monde.fr"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bolton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "John Bolton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Advisor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Security Advisor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_killing", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Contract killing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Merrick Garland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Revolutionary_Guard_Corps", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quds_Force", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quds Force"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qasem_Soleimani", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Qasem Soleimani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Wray", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christopher A.

The DOJ did not reveal who was Merchant's target, though they did say they suspect the plots are retaliation for the U.S. drone killing of Qasem Soleimani, an attack ordered by then-President Trump.\n\nAccording to the DOJ and federal court filings, Merchant spent time in Pakistan and Iran before flying to the U.S., where he began as early as April of this year trying to recruit and pay someone to carry out the attempt.\n\nFederal filings say Merchant explained his assassination plan to someone, but that person reported it to federal law enforcement. Law enforcement then began communicating with Merchant, and he even paid thousands of dollars in advance before the feds eventually arrested him on July 12, the day before the Pennsylvania assassination attempt against Trump.\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray called Merchant a \"Pakistani national with close ties to Iran and is straight out of the Iranian playbook.\"\n\nAccording to the DOJ, Merchant was attempting to hire someone to carry out an assassination and was working with someone \"back home.\" Federal law enforcement said Merchant claimed to have wives and children in both Iran and Pakistan, and his travel records show repeated trips to Iran, Syria and Iraq.\n\nFrom the DOJ:\n\nIn early June, Merchant met the [informant] in New York and explained his assassination plot.

Merchant further stated that the intended victims would be \"targeted here,\" meaning in the United States. Merchant instructed the [informant] to arrange meetings with individuals whom Merchant could hire to carry out these actions.

He was arrested last month as he prepared to leave the United States and after having told the men that he would provide further instructions, including the names of the intended targets, in August or September after he returned to Pakistan.\n\nCourt documents do not identify any of the potential targets. But US officials acknowledged last month that a threat on Donald Trump's life from Iran prompted additional security in the days before a Pennsylvania rally in which Trump was injured by a gunman's bullet. That July 13 shooting, carried out by a 20-year-old Pennsylvania man, was unrelated to the Iran threat and Merchant's arrest has no connection to the Trump assassination attempt, a law enforcement official said.\n\nBut an FBI agent's affidavit suggests Merchant had current or former high-level officials like Trump in mind. He told an associate who was secretly cooperating with law enforcement that he wanted a \"political person\" to be killed, the complaint said, mapping out on a napkin the different scenarios in which the target could be assassinated and warning that there would be security \"all around.\"\n\nUS officials have warned for years about Iran's desire to avenge the 2020 killing of Qassem Soleimani, who led the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' Quds Force. That strike was ordered by Trump when he was president. The US government since then has paid for security for multiple Trump administration officials, and in 2022, the Justice Department charged an Iranian operative in a foiled plot to kill Bolton.\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray said at a House hearing last month that the Iranian government had been \"extremely aggressive and brazen\" in recent years, and Attorney General Merrick Garland said Tuesday that \"we expect that these threats will continue and that these cases will not be the last.\n\n\"The Justice Department will spare no resource to disrupt and hold accountable those who would carry out Iran's lethal plotting against Americans,\" he said.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Tuesday during an afternoon press briefing that the United States had been \"tracking Iranian threats against former politicians.\"\n\n\"We consider this a national and homeland security matter of the highest priority. We have repeatedly met at the highest levels of our government to develop and implement a comprehensive response,\" she said.\n\nFederal officials identified Merchant, 46, as a Pakistani citizen who has said he has a wife and children in Iran and who traveled frequently to Iran, Syria, and Iraq. A lawyer for Merchant declined to comment Tuesday when reached by the Associated Press.\n\nAfter Merchant's arrest, Justice Department prosecutors urged a judge to keep him locked up, writing in a detention memo that before flying from Pakistan to the United States, \"the defendant had spent approximately two weeks in Iran. Given the seriousness of the murder for hire charges, the defendant has every incentive to flee to either Pakistan or Iran, significantly reducing the likelihood of his appearance in this case should he flee.\"\n\nHe was ordered detained following a court appearance.\n\nCourt documents trace the foiled plot to this past April, when Merchant flew to the United States to recruit participants in the murder-for-hire scheme. He contacted a person he thought would help him but who instead alerted law enforcement. That person became a confidential source for investigators, including by introducing Merchant to the purported hitmen, officials said.\n\nAfter meeting the two undercover officers posing as hitmen, the affidavit says, Merchant told them the work would be long-term. He instructed them that in addition to the killings, he would expect them to arrange protests at political rallies, steal documents, and launder money for him. He told them he would return to Pakistan before giving them additional instructions.\n\nOfficials say Merchant paid a $5,000 advance for the planned killings.\n\n\"Now we know we're going forward. We're doing this,\" one of the purported hitmen said, according to the affidavit.\n\n\"Yes, absolutely,\" Merchant replied.\n\nMerchant was arrested July 12, the same day he planned to leave the United States.

Officials", "body": "The Department of Justice announced charges against Asif Merchant, 46, a Pakistani man with ties to Iran, for trying to assassinate former President Donald Trump and other government officials..\n\nOfficials said the investigation took place before Thomas Matthews Crooks shot Trump at a Pennsylvania rally.\n\nFBI Special Agent Anthony Cipriano and other assets tracked Merchant and others undercover, finding him working with national and international sources to assassinate Trump in retaliation for the killing of IRGC Officer Qasem Soleimani in 2022.\n\nIran promised revenge after a drone strike took out Soleimani.\n\n\"Working on behalf of others overseas, Merchant planned the murder of U.S. government officials on American soil,\" said U.S. Attorney Breon Peace for the Eastern District of New York. \"This prosecution demonstrates that this Office and the entire Department of Justice will take swift and decisive action to protect our nation's security, our government officials and our citizens from foreign threats.\"\n\nMerchant lives in Pakistan with a wife and children. He also said he has a wife and children in Iran.\n\nMerchant's travel records show frequent stops in Iran, Iraq, and Syria.\n\nThe plot took place between April 2024 and July 2024. Merchant tried to hire hitmen in Brooklyn to carry out the assassination between August and September.\n\nMerchant contacted a person who told the FBI about the plans and became a confidential source (CS) with the FBI.\n\nMerchant told the CS he spent two weeks in Iran before he flew to the U.S.\n\nThe CS then put Merchant in touch with two supposed hitmen.\n\nThe plot involved three schemes:\n\nMerchant illustrated the assassination plot, \"including a target (the person to be killed), a crowd, surrounding buildings, and streets.\" Merchant wanted the CS to tell him how the target could die, explaining that security would surround the target.\n\nMerchant said the killing would take place after he left the States, but they would still communicate in code.\n\nThe CS asked the Merchant to speak to his \"party\" overseas. Merchant said, \"that the party back home told him to 'finalize' the plan and leave the U.S.\"\n\nThe CS put Merchant in charge of the \"hitmen\" in Manhattan. Merchant laid out the plan to the men.\n\nMerchant acted as a representative for an outside party the whole time, \"indicating that there were other people he worked for outside the U.S.\"\n\n\"Using the plural tense to indicate he was working with people overseas, Merchant stated that 'we' would give the instructions, including the target name, to the hitmen either the first week of August 2024 or the first week of September 2024, when Merchant was out of the U.S.,\" according to the filing.\n\nMerchant paid the men a downpayment of $5,000.\n\nMerchant went back to Pakistan, but came back around June 21.\n\nLaw enforcement arrested Merchant around July 12 as he tried to leave the country.\n\n\"The complaint unsealed today underscores, yet again, that those who engage in lethal plotting on U.S. soil will face the full force of the American justice system,\" said Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen of the National Security Division. \"The targeting of former and current officials by foreign actors is an affront to our sovereignty and our democratic institutions and the Department of Justice will use every possible tool to expose and disrupt this egregious activity.\"", "source": {"uri": "legalinsurrection.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Le\u00b7gal In\u00b7sur\u00b7rec\u00b7tion"}, "authors": [{"uri": "mechastain@legalinsurrection.com", "name": "mechastain", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qasem_Soleimani", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Qasem Soleimani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_killing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Contract killing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breon_Peace", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Breon Peace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Revolutionary_Guard_Corps", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_Eastern_District_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_aerial_vehicle", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Unmanned aerial vehicle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_action", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Strike action"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syria", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Syria"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Syria"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iraq"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_G._Olsen", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matthew G.

A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment further.\n\nA Pakistani man with alleged ties to Iran has been charged in the United States in connection with a foiled plot to assassinate a U.S. politician or government officials, the Justice Department said on Tuesday. Asif Merchant, 46, sought to recruit people in the United States to carry out the plot in retaliation for the U.S. killing of Iran's Revolutionary Guards' top commander Qassem Soleimani in 2020, according to a criminal complaint.\n\nMerchant, who prosecutors allege spent time in Iran before traveling to the United States from Pakistan, was charged with murder for hire in federal court in New York's Brooklyn borough. A federal judge ordered him detained on July 17, according to court records. \"For years, the Justice Department has been working aggressively to counter Iran's brazen and unrelenting efforts to retaliate against American public officials for the killing of Iranian General Soleimani,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement.\n\nFBI investigators believe that former President Donald Trump, who approved the drone strike on Soleimani, and other current and former U.S. government officials were the intended targets of the plot, CNN reported, citing a U.S. official. Court documents do not name the alleged targets of the plot. Merchant told a law enforcement informant that there would be \"security all around\" one target, according to the criminal complaint.\n\nA Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment further. Avraham Moskowitz, a lawyer for Merchant, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trump's presidential campaign could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nTrump, the Republican candidate in the Nov. 5 presidential election, was wounded in an assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania last month. Garland said on Tuesday that investigators have found no evidence that Merchant had any connection to the shooting, which officials have said was carried out by a lone 20-year-old gunman. Law enforcement thwarted Merchant's plan before any attack was carried out. An individual Merchant contacted in April to help assist with the plot reported his activities to law enforcement and became a confidential informant, according to the complaint.\n\nMerchant told the informant his plans also included stealing documents from one target and organizing protests in the United States, prosecutors allege.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is

The unnamed individual then connected him in June to undercover FBI agents posing as hitmen.\n\nMr Merchant told the undercover agents that he required them to carry out three orders: steal documents from the home of an intended assassination target, arrange protests at political rallies, and kill a \"political person\".\n\nAccording to the indictment, Mr Merchant told the hitmen that he would receive instructions on who to kill either in the last week of August or the first week of September.\n\nMr Merchant then planned to leave the US on 12 July, but was arrested by law enforcement before he could do so.\n\nWhile the indictment does not mention Trump by name, sources cited by CBS News said that the former president was one of the intended targets.\n\nSecurity was tightened around Trump in June after the US Secret Service and the Trump campaign were notified of an Iranian-backed plot to kill him.\n\nThe plot is unrelated to the assassination attempt on the former president at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on 13 July, which was allegedly carried out by 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, who was shot and killed by a Secret Service sniper on site.\n\nTrump and officials including his former secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, have faced threats from Tehran since ordering the drone strike assassination of Qassim Soleimani, the commander of Iran's Quds force, in Iraq in 2020.", "source": {"uri": "myjoyonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MyJoyOnline.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_killing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Contract killing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Wray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christopher A.

The person he contacted was a confidential informant working with the FBI, according to the criminal complaint.\n\nMerchant, 46, is charged with murder for hire.\n\nKilling the former president was one part of Merchant's plot but it was clear he wasn't planning to get his own hands dirty. Instead, he planned to hire the people needed, set everything in motion and then leave the country before it actually happened. Merchant also told the FBI informant that he was in contact with unnamed people overseas who wanted this done.\n\nIn early June, Merchant met the CS in New York and explained his assassination plot. Merchant told the CS that the opportunity he had for the CS was not a one-time opportunity and would be ongoing. Merchant then made a \"finger gun\" motion with his hand, indicating that the opportunity was related to a killing. Merchant further stated that the intended victims would be \"targeted here,\" meaning in the United States. Merchant instructed the CS to arrange meetings with individuals whom Merchant could hire to carry out these actions. Merchant explained that his plot involved multiple criminal schemes: (1) stealing documents or USB drives from a target's home; (2) planning a protest; and (3) killing a politician or government official.\n\nAt that meeting, Merchant began planning potential assassination scenarios and quizzed the CS on how he would kill a target in the various scenarios. Specifically, Merchant asked the CS to explain how the target would die in different scenarios. Merchant told the CS that there would be \"security [] all around\" the person.\n\nMerchant stated that the assassination would occur after he left the United States and he would communicate with the CS from overseas using code words. The CS asked whether Merchant had spoken to the unidentified \"party\" back home with whom Merchant was working. Merchant responded that he had and that the party back home told him to \"finalize\" the plan and leave the United States.\n\nHe eventually put up a $5,000 down-payment on the assassination, money which he had help getting from that same unnamed party overseas. After delivering the money, he made plans to leave the country.\n\nMerchant then began arranging means to obtain $5,000 in cash to pay the UCs as an advance payment for the assassination, which he eventually received with assistance from an individual overseas. On June 21, Merchant met with the UCs in New York and paid them the $5,000 advance. After Merchant paid the $5,000 to the UCs, one of the UCs stated, \"now we're bonded,\" to which Merchant responded \"yes.\" The UC then stated \"Now we know we're going forward. We're doing this,\" to which Merchant responded \"Yes, absolutely.\"\n\nMerchant subsequently made flight arrangements and planned to leave the United States on Friday, July 12, 2024. On July 12th, law enforcement agents placed Merchant under arrest before he could leave the country.\n\nSo if you're keeping track, the FBI arrested this guy one day before the July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania where Trump was shot. So far, authorities say there is no known connection between the Matthew Crooks, the Butler shooter, and the plot originating overseas.\n\nSpeaking of which, the DOJ press release leaves little doubt about who the overseas party was that was behind all of this. FBI Director Wray said, \"\"This dangerous murder-for-hire plot exposed in today's charges allegedly was orchestrated by a Pakistani national with close ties to Iran and is straight out of the Iranian playbook.\" AG Garland added a likely reason why Iran would target Trump. \"For years, the Justice Department has been working aggressively to counter Iran's brazen and unrelenting efforts to retaliate against American public officials for the killing of Iranian General Soleimani.\" he said.\n\nSoleimani was the head of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corp, basically the general directly responsible for all of the trouble Iran causes in the region. In January 2020, a US drone operating on orders from President Trump killed him near Baghdad's airport. Iran immediately vowed revenge.\n\nSo as of now it looks like the FBI foiled one plot but missed another one, both happening around the same time. Despite them being separate, ABC News suggests the Iranian plot may have played a direct role in what happened in Pennsylvania.\n\n\"We were initially told that there was no Secret Service snipers coming but that was shifted either Thursday or Friday to indicate that there were,\" Pat Young, head of the Beaver County Emergency Services Unit, told ABC News. \"We had been told that this is the first time that a non-sitting president had been allocated Secret Service snipers. So that threw up some alarm bells for some of our guys that -- why the sudden shift -- from one stance to the other?\"\n\nThis may be one of those times where truth is stranger than fiction.

That person reported Merchant's conduct to law enforcement and became a confidential source.\n\nIn early June, Merchant met the confidential source in New York and explained his assassination plot. Merchant told the individual the opportunity he had for the person was not a one-time opportunity and would be ongoing.\n\nMerchant then made a \"finger gun\" motion with his hand, indicating that the opportunity was related to a killing.\n\nMerchant further stated that the intended victims would be \"targeted here\", meaning in the United States.\n\nMerchant instructed the individual to arrange meetings with others whom he could hire to carry out these actions. Merchant explained that his plot involved multiple criminal schemes including stealing documents or USB drives from a target's home; planning a protest; and killing a politician or government official.\n\nMerchant at the meeting began planning potential assassination scenarios and quizzed the individual on how he would kill a target in the various scenarios.\n\nSpecifically, Merchant asked to explain how the target would die in different scenarios. Merchant told the individual that there would be \"security [] all around\" the person.\n\nMerchant stated that the assassination would occur after he left the United States and he would communicate with the individual from overseas using code words. The source asked whether Merchant had spoken to the unidentified \"party\" back home with whom Merchant was working.\n\nMerchant responded that he had and the party back home told him to \"finalise\" the plan and leave the United States.\n\nIn mid-June, Merchant met with the purported hitmen, who were undercover US law enforcement officers in New York. Merchant advised the undercover officers that he was looking for three services from them: theft of documents, arranging protests at political rallies, and for them to kill a \"political person\".\n\nMerchant said the hitmen would receive instructions on who to kill either the last week of August or the first week of September after he had departed the United States.\n\nMerchant then began arranging means to obtain USD 5,000 in cash to pay the undercover officers as an advance payment for the assassination, which he eventually received with assistance from an individual overseas.\n\nOn June 21, Merchant met with the undercover officers in New York and paid them the USD 5,000 advance. One of the undercover officers stated: \"Now we're bonded\", to which Merchant responded: \"Yes.\" The undercover officer added: \"Now we know we're going forward. We're doing this\", to which Merchant responded, \"Yes, absolutely.\" Merchant subsequently made flight arrangements and planned to leave the United States on July 12 when law enforcement agents placed him under arrest before he could leave the country.

He is in federal custody.\n\nThe FBI investigated the alleged international murder-for-hire plot in the weeks before a 20-year-old from Pennsylvania nearly assassinated the former president at one of his rallies. A law enforcement official told CNN that investigators have not found evidence that Merchant had any connection to the shooting in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe FBI believes it foiled Merchant's plot before any attack, and in the weeks since his arrest he has cooperated with investigators, according to US officials. But the Iranian government's known threats against Trump, prompted the FBI to pass on the intelligence to the US Secret Service, which increased security protection for the former president, officials have said.\n\nThe plot revealed by US prosecutors on Tuesday adds to a growing list of detailed Iranian plans to allegedly kill Trump, according to national security officials.\n\nThe US government has repeatedly raised concerns that Iran may try to retaliate for a 2020 US drone strike that killed Gen. Qasem Soleimani, a top general in Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) by trying to kill Trump or his former advisers.\n\nUS prosecutors have charged other individuals for similar assassination attempts in the past, including charges brought in 2022 against a 45-year-old Iranian national and IRGC member who allegedly tried to pay $300,000 to an individual in the US to kill former national security adviser John Bolton. In that case, prosecutors allege that the plot was \"likely in retaliation\" for Soleimani's death.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "evan_perez@aol.com", "name": "Evan Perez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "hannah_rabinowitz@aol.com", "name": "Hannah Rabinowitz", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_killing", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Contract killing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covert_operation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Covert operation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drone_strikes_in_Pakistan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Drone strikes in Pakistan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bolton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Bolton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Revolutionary_Guard_Corps", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qasem_Soleimani", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Qasem Soleimani"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Advisor_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Security Advisor (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National security"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Fire_and_Security", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Fire and Security", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Business", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Murder", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 82}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/aol_cnn_articles_945/d9f54a5731fabb5dd92c7cb853928787", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795843", "eventUri": "eng-9795843", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-12", "textStart": 921, "textEnd": 928}], "sentiment": -0.4117647058823529, "wgt": 188, "relevance": 1}

Charges Pakistani Man in Alleged Plot to Kill U.S. Leaders", "body": "The Justice Department said on Tuesday that it had charged a Pakistani man who had recently spent two weeks in Iran with trying to hire a hit man to assassinate political figures in the U.S. Investigators believe that his target list likely included former President Donald J. Trump, according to a senior law enforcement official.\n\nThe man, Asif Raza Merchant, 46, was arrested in New York on July 12, the day before a 20-year-old man, Matthew Crooks, shot at and slightly wounded Mr. Trump during a rally in Pennsylvania, according to a criminal complaint unsealed in federal court in Brooklyn on Tuesday.\n\nOfficials said they had no evidence indicating the plot was connected to the shooting in Pennsylvania. But they said the arrest of Mr. Merchant allowed them to disrupt what they characterized as a far-ranging plot that also included stealing computer files from U.S. officials and staging protests against American treatment of Muslim countries.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies were tracking a potential Iranian assassination plot against Mr. Trump in the weeks before the assassination attempt that prompted the Secret Service to enhance security for the former president before his outdoor campaign rally in Butler, Pa. It is not clear if the scheme made public on Tuesday precipitated those moves.\n\nMr. Merchant, who is believed to be cooperating with investigators since his detention, \"orchestrated a plot to assassinate U.S. government officials and steal information on U.S. soil,\" prosecutors wrote in documents unsealed on Tuesday.\n\n\"After spending time in Iran, Merchant flew from Pakistan to the U.S. to recruit hit men to carry out his scheme,\" they said.\n\nIn an affidavit accompanying the charges, an F.B.I. agent said that \"the tradecraft and operational security measures\" employed by Mr. Merchant were \"consistent\" with the actions of someone \"plotting on behalf of a foreign adversary.\"\n\nThe agent likened Mr. Merchant's actions to the foiled plot by Iranian operatives to murder John R. Bolton, the former national security adviser under Mr. Trump, in revenge for the 2020 killing of Qassim Suleimani, a high-ranking member of Iran's Revolutionary Guards, in a U.S. drone attack in Iraq.\n\nThe bureau had been investigating Mr. Merchant for weeks before they arrested him as he attempted to leave the country.\n\nAfter arriving in the U.S. in April, Mr. Merchant contacted a person who he thought could help him. Instead that person told law enforcement officials, and became a confidential informant.\n\nIn early June, Mr. Merchant traveled from Texas to New York to visit the person and laid out a scheme that included targeted assassinations of people \"who are hurting Pakistan\" and the \"Muslim world,\" according to the informant.\n\nHe also told the person, whom he offered to pay $5,000 as a down payment on a potential $100,000 fee, that he was a \"representative\" for other conspirators outside the U.S.\n\nHe offered to channel the money through an informal network in Dubai or Istanbul, prosecutors said. The filings do not indicate if Mr. Merchant revealed whom he was working with, but he said he had wives in Pakistan and Iran, and had traveled to Iraq in recent years.\n\nIn his discussions with the person, Mr. Merchant did not say whom he wanted to assassinate, but said he hoped to pull off the killing, or killings, in late August or early September.\n\nHe specified that he was not targeting \"normal\" people, and that the political figures he had in mind were prominent enough to warrant security details, the law enforcement official said.\n\nHis targets included current and former U.S. officials, according to a senior federal law enforcement official. The bureau's leadership said in recent testimony before Congress that Mr. Trump was a longstanding target of threats from Iran.\n\nMr. Merchant encouraged the informant to travel to Iran personally, and said he had gotten permission from higher-ups to \"finalize\" the assassination plot.\n\nDuring a trip to New York, Mr. Merchant asked the informant to drive him around to \"clubs\" in Brooklyn to recruit potential hit men, and people to engage in an unspecified criminal scheme that could earn participants up to a million dollars.\n\nIt was on that trip that the informant introduced Mr. Merchant to two people who were represented as killers for hire, but who were in fact undercover federal operatives.\n\nBut he did not tell those informants whom he wanted to have killed, and said he would send them names after he left the country, according to the complaint. He was arrested soon afterward.", "source": {"uri": "dnyuz.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "DNyuz"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type":

FBI officials believe that Merchant intended to assassinate Trump but foiled his plans before he could act, the official told CNN. (RELATED: Rocket Attack Against Military Base In Iraq Injured 'Several' US Personnel, Officials Say)\n\nThe plot is \"straight out of the Iranian playbook,\" FBI Director Christopher Wray said in a statement on Tuesday. \"A foreign-directed plot to kill a public official, or any U.S. citizen, is a threat to our national security and will be met with the full might and resources of the FBI.\"\n\nThere is no known connection between Merchant's plot and the assassination attempt against Trump on July 13 in Butler, Pennsylvania, a law enforcement official told CNN. Trump was nearly killed by a gunman at the rally in what was decried as a catastrophic security \"failure\" by the U.S. Secret Service.\n\nMerchant spent time in Iran and told law enforcement he had a family in the country, according to the DOJ. He traveled from the U.S. to Pakistan in April 2024 and \"contacted a person he believed could assist him\" with the assassination plot.\n\nThat person reported Merchant's behavior and agreed to act as a \"confidential source\" for law enforcement, according to the DOJ. Merchant met with the source in June 2024 and outlined his plan, which included stealing files from a \"target's home,\" orchestrating a protest and killing a U.S. government official or politician.\n\nMerchant told the source that the assassination would occur after he left the U.S., noting that he had spoken to an unidentified party \"back home\" to \"finalize the plans, according to the DOJ. After meeting with undercover officers who he believed to be hit men, arranging payments for the hit and securing flight plans, Merchant was arrested in July \"before he could leave the country.\"\n\nThe DOJ statement does not identify which politicians and U.S. officials Merchant was targeting. But the FBI believes that Trump was a target, among other current and former officials, the official speaking on condition of anonymity told CNN.\n\nThe Islamic Republic has long sought revenge against Trump and some in his orbit over the 2020 U.S. assassination of Gen. Qasem Soleimani, the former leader of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and a famous figure among the Iranian public.

Law enforcement foiled the charged plot before any attack could be carried out. Merchant is in federal custody.\n\n\"For years, the Justice Department has been working aggressively to counter Iran's brazen and unrelenting efforts to retaliate against American public officials for the killing of Iranian General Soleimani,\" said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. \"The Justice Department will spare no resource to disrupt and hold accountable those who would seek to carry out Iran's lethal plotting against American citizens and will not tolerate attempts by an authoritarian regime to target American public officials and endanger America's national security.\"\n\n\"This dangerous murder-for-hire plot exposed in today's complaint allegedly was orchestrated by a Pakistani national with close ties to Iran and is straight out of the Iranian playbook,\" said FBI Director Christopher Wray. \"A foreign-directed plot to kill a public official, or any U.S. citizen, is a threat to our national security and will be met with the full might and resources of the FBI.\"\n\n\"The complaint unsealed today underscores, yet again, that those who engage in lethal plotting on U.S. soil will face the full force of the American justice system,\" said Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen of the Justice Department's National Security Division. \"The targeting of former and current officials by foreign actors is an affront to our sovereignty and our democratic institutions and the Department of Justice will use every possible tool to expose and disrupt this egregious activity.\"\n\n\"Working on behalf of others overseas, Merchant planned the murder of U.S. government officials on American soil,\" said U.S. Attorney Breon Peace for the Eastern District of New York. \"This prosecution demonstrates that this office and the entire Department of Justice will take swift and decisive action to protect our nation's security, our government officials and our citizens from foreign threats\n\n\"Fortunately, the assassins Merchant allegedly tried to hire were undercover FBI Agents,\" said Acting Assistant Director Christie Curtis of the FBI New York Field Office. \"This case underscores the dedication and formidable efforts of our agents, analysts and prosecutors in New York, Houston, and Dallas. Their success in neutralizing this threat not only prevented a tragic outcome but also reaffirms the FBI's commitment to protecting our nation and its citizens from both domestic and international threats.\"\n\nAccording to allegations contained in the complaint and related publicly filed court documents, Merchant orchestrated a plot to assassinate a politician or U.S. government official on U.S. soil. In approximately April 2024, after spending time in Iran, Merchant arrived in the United States from Pakistan and contacted a person he believed could assist him with the scheme. That person reported Merchant's conduct to law enforcement and became a confidential source (the CS).\n\nIn early June, Merchant met the CS in New York and explained his assassination plot. Merchant told the CS that the opportunity he had for the CS was not a one-time opportunity and would be ongoing. Merchant then made a \"finger gun\" motion with his hand, indicating that the opportunity was related to a killing. Merchant further stated that the intended victims would be \"targeted here,\" meaning in the United States. Merchant instructed the CS to arrange meetings with individuals whom Merchant could hire to carry out these actions. Merchant explained that his plot involved multiple criminal schemes: (1) stealing documents or USB drives from a target's home; (2) planning a protest; and (3) killing a politician or government official.\n\nAt that meeting, Merchant began planning potential assassination scenarios and quizzed the CS on how he would kill a target in the various scenarios. Specifically, Merchant asked the CS to explain how a target would die in different scenarios. Merchant told the CS that there would be \"security [] all around\" the person.\n\nMerchant stated that the assassination would occur after he left the United States and he would communicate with the CS from overseas using code words. The CS asked whether Merchant had spoken to the unidentified \"party\" back home with whom Merchant was working. Merchant responded that he had and that the party back home told him to \"finalize\" the plan and leave the United States.\n\nIn mid-June, Merchant met with the purported hitmen, who were in fact undercover U.S. law enforcement officers (the UCs) in New York. Merchant advised the UCs that he was looking for three services from them: theft of documents, arranging protests at political rallies, and for them to kill a \"political person.\" Merchant stated that the hitmen would receive instructions on who to kill either the last week of August or the first week of September, after Merchant had departed the United States.\n\nMerchant then began arranging means to obtain $5,000 in cash to pay the UCs as an advance payment for the assassination, which he eventually received with assistance from an individual overseas. On June 21, Merchant met with the UCs in New York and paid them the $5,000 advance. After Merchant paid the $5,000 to the UCs, one of the UCs stated, \"now we're bonded,\" to which Merchant responded \"yes.\" The UC then stated \"Now we know we're going forward. We're doing this,\" to which Merchant responded \"Yes, absolutely.\"\n\nMerchant subsequently made flight arrangements and planned to leave the United States on Friday, July 12, 2024. On July 12, law enforcement agents placed Merchant under arrest before he could leave the country. Merchant has stated that he has a wife and children in Iran and a wife and children in Pakistan.\n\nThe FBI is investigating the case.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorneys Sara K.

The complaint says the plot was intended to target high-ranking U.S. officials, potentially including Trump.\n\n\"Working on behalf of others overseas, Merchant planned the murder of U.S. government officials on American soil,\" said U.S. Attorney Breon Peace for the Eastern District of New York. \"This prosecution demonstrates that this Office and the entire U.S. Department of Justice will take swift and decisive action to protect our nation's security, our government officials and our citizens from foreign threats.\"\n\nSON OF HAMAS FOUNDER RIPS BIDEN-HARRIS ADMINISTRATION'S 'TOTAL DENIAL' IN MIDDLE EAST\n\nMerchant was arrested on July 12 while preparing to leave the U.S., authorities said. He told investigators that he has a wife and children in Iran and a wife and children in Pakistan.\n\n\"Fortunately, the assassins Merchant allegedly tried to hire were undercover FBI Agents,\" said Acting Assistant Director Christie Curtis of the FBI New York Field Office. \"This case underscores the dedication and formidable efforts of our agents, analysts and prosecutors in New York, Houston, and Dallas. Their success in neutralizing this threat not only prevented a tragic outcome but also reaffirms the FBI's commitment to protecting our nation and its citizens from both domestic and international threats.\"\n\nMerchant's alleged foiled plot has no ties to the shooting of Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, a federal government source told Fox News Digital. Investigators said targets included people on \"both sides,\" not just Trump.\n\nSecurity concerns related to Trump and his former advisors have been raised before about possible retaliation from Tehran for the 2020 airstrike that killed Gen. Qasem Soleimani, a commander in Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).\n\nTRUMP-ERA SECURITY OFFICIAL: IRAN IS 'ON THE MARCH' FOR THE US AND ISRAEL\n\n\"We have not received any reports on this matter from the U.S. Government,\" the Iranian Permanent Mission to the United Nations told Fox News Digital. \"However, it is evident that the modus operandi in question contradicts the Iranian Government's policy of legally prosecuting the murderer of General Soleimani.\"\n\nU.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said the Justice Department has been working to counter Iran's \"brazen and unrelenting efforts\" to retaliate against American government officials for the killing of Soleimani.\n\n\"The Justice Department has brought multiple cases against individuals working on behalf of the Iranian government to lethally target Americans in the United States,\" he said. \"But as I said last week, we expect that these threats will continue and that these cases will not be the last.\"\n\n\"The Justice Department will spare no resource to disrupt and hold accountable those who would carry out Iran's lethal plotting against Americans,\" added Garland.\n\nGarland continued: \"I do want to recognize that in the wake of the attempted assassination of former President Trump last month, the American people are more aware than ever about the seriousness of the threats facing our public officials.\n\n\"While our investigation into the attempted assassination remains ongoing, as the FBI has stated multiple times, we have not found any evidence that the shooter had accomplices or co-conspirators, either foreign or domestic.\n\n\"And, in light of the heightened public interest, I want to be clear that, although our extensive investigation continues, we have found no evidence of any link between the defendant charged in the complaint unsealed today and the attempted assassination of the former President in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13.\"\n\nMerchant arrived in New York City from Texas in April with the intention of hiring a hit man to kill political figures in the U.S., prosecutors said. He contacted someone he believed would help him, but the person contacted the FBI and began working for the agency as a confidential source, court documents said.\n\nMerchant allegedly told the source that the \"people who will be targeted are the ones who are hurting Pakistan and the world, [the] Muslim world. These are not normal people.\" He requested 25 men who could perform a protest as a distraction after a murder occurred, and a woman to do \"reconnaissance,\" court documents state.\n\nHe allegedly met with the source several times and stated he wanted him to do three things: steal documents or USB drives from one victim's home, plan protests at political rallies and carry out assassinations. At one meeting, he allegedly told the source that the work was not a one-time opportunity and allegedly made a \"finger gun\" motion with his hand.\n\nDuring a meeting, Merchant spoke of the \"party\" back home with whom he was working with while planning for several scenarios. He also used coded language to communicate his plans, saying \"tee-shirt\" meant \"protest,\" which he described as the \"lightest work,\" court documents said.\n\n\"Flannel shirt\" would mean \"stealing,\" which was \"heavier work\", and \"fleece jacket,\" the heaviest work, would mean \"the third task...commit the act of the game,\" indicating the assassinations.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe phrase \"denim jacket\" referred to \"sending money.\" Merchant allegedly met with undercover law enforcement officers and said he wanted to commit the killing in the last week of August or first week of September. He paid $5,000 in advance, authorities said.\n\nIn 2022, the U.S. charged a 45-year-old member of Iran's IRGC who offered to pay someone $300,000 to kill former White House National Security Advisor John Bolton. The suspect allegedly also had plans to target former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.", "source": {"uri": "wfin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WFIN"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Rather, officials said, the plot appears to be related to efforts by Iran to retaliate for the killing of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in a U.S. drone strike Trump ordered in Iraq in 2020.\n\nCourt filings released as the case became public Tuesday refer to the potential target in elliptical terms as a U.S. politician or public official, with no specific mention of Trump. But in discussions Merchant had with others, Trump's name came up as a possible target, according to a law enforcement official granted anonymity to discuss sensitive details about the investigation.\n\nA former senior Trump administration official said Tuesday he received a \"duty to warn\" briefing from the FBI about Merchant before the indictment was unsealed.\n\nAmong the indications that Merchant was targeting a high-level official is a comment he allegedly made about the target being well protected.\n\nOn June 4, during a sting operation mounted by the FBI, Merchant told a confidential source that there would be security \"all around\" the target, FBI Special Agent Anthony Cipriano said in an affidavit filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New York.\n\nMerchant appeared in federal court there on July 17 and a magistrate judge ordered him held without bail, according to court records. In an unusual move, the criminal complaint and a letter from prosecutors urging Merchant's detention were kept secret until Tuesday at the government's request.\n\nDuring a visit to prosecutors and law enforcement agents in Iowa Tuesday, Attorney General Merrick Garland decried the alleged plot, but stressed that investigators do not see a connection to the assassination attempt on Trump in Pennsylvania. Officials believe that shooting was carried out by Thomas Matthew Crooks, a 20-year-old American from Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, who was shot dead at the scene by a Secret Service sniper.\n\n\"I do want to recognize that in the wake of the attempted assassination of former President Trump last month, the American people are more aware than ever about the seriousness of the threats facing our public officials,\" Garland said. \"While our investigation into the attempted assassination remains ongoing, as the FBI has stated multiple times, we have not found any evidence that the shooter had accomplices or co-conspirators, either foreign or domestic.\"\n\nAccording to court papers, the FBI became aware of Merchant's plot in April after he traveled in Iran and Pakistan before flying to the U.S. and reaching out to someone who reported to law enforcement that Merchant had asked him to help steal information, organize protests and carry out an assassination. That unnamed contact agreed to become a confidential source for the FBI, court filings say.\n\nThe FBI arranged a pair of undercover officers to pose as hit men who could help with the operation, according to prosecutors. He met them in June and told them he was looking to kill a \"political person,\" Cipriano wrote.\n\nIn a later meeting with the confidential source, Merchant provided a rudimentary written code that would obscure the purpose of their interactions, court filings say.\n\n\"Merchant wrote that the word 'tee-shirt' would mean a 'protest,' which he described as the 'lightest work,'\" Cipriano wrote. \"The phrase 'flannel shirt' would mean 'stealing,' which was 'heavier work.'\"\n\n\"Fleece jacket,\" Cipriano continued, was Merchant's code for murder.\n\nWhen Merchant was arrested, agents found a list of the codewords in his wallet, Cipriano said.\n\nThe court filings don't say Merchant explicitly declared that he was acting on behalf of Iran, but say he \"indicated an affinity for Iran,\" often traveled there, and had a wife and children both in Iran and Pakistan.\n\nThreats from Iran have led the Secret Service to increase security for Trump and other current and former U.S. officials in recent months. That increase was prompted in part by the plot Merchant is charged with, a law enforcement official said Tuesday.\n\n\"Certainly, that was part of the calculus,\" said the official, who was granted anonymity to discuss the security arrangements.\n\nSecret Service spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said officials are aware of the Iranian threat and are taking it into account when planning security arrangements.\n\nSome in Congress have pressed for even more security coverage in response to the threats U.S. officials have attributed to Iran.\n\nDuring a Senate hearing last week about the Pennsylvania assassination attempt on Trump and federal agencies' handling of it, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) pressed acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe about the cancellation of a security detail for former national security adviser Robert O'Brien.\n\n\"Who made that decision despite Iran's ongoing, credible threats?\" Cotton asked, urging that the protection be restored.\n\n\"It wasn't the Secret Service,\" Rowe said, adding that such protection was usually granted by presidential memorandum.\n\n\"I'm pretty confident that the agency can get this done, and I think it needs to get done, if you look at the kind of ongoing threats that he and all these others face,\" Cotton said.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki",

The investigation led by the FBI uncovered that he allegedly attempted to hire a hitman to carry out attacks on U.S. officials on American soil.\n\nAccording to investigative reports, former President Donald Trump is believed to be among the intended targets of the alleged assassination plot. Increased security measures for Trump were enacted in June after reports indicated a potential Iranian plan to assassinate him, officials noted.\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray characterized the plan as a \"dangerous murder-for-hire plot\" and emphasized the seriousness of foreign-directed threats against U.S. citizens. \"A foreign-directed plot to kill a public official, or any U.S. citizen, is a threat to our national security and will be met with the full might and resources of the FBI,\" he stated.\n\nMerchant reportedly arrived in the U.S. from Pakistan in April, having recently spent time in Iran. It is alleged that upon his arrival, he sought out an accomplice to assist him with the assassination plans. This individual later informed law enforcement about Merchant's intentions.\n\nThe indictment highlights that Merchant discussed the assassination method with his accomplice, indicating he intended to use coded communications from abroad after departing the U.S. He also suggested that support would be needed repeatedly, which included a directive for the assassins to operate within U.S. territory.\n\nIn June, the individual connected Merchant with undercover FBI agents posing as potential hitmen. During these interactions, he allegedly outlined his requests, which included stealing documents from the residence of a target and coordinating protests at political events.\n\nThe FBI arrested Merchant right before his scheduled departure from the U.S. on July 12. While the indictment did not specify the names of the intended victims, sources have indicated that Trump was indeed one of those targeted.\n\nThis incident is part of a broader pattern where Trump and other officials have faced threats from Iranian operatives since the U.S. executed a drone strike that killed Qassim Soleimani, head of Iran's Quds force, in Iraq back in 2020.

But they said the arrest of Mr. Merchant allowed them to disrupt what they characterized as a far-ranging plot that also included stealing computer files from U.S. officials and staging protests against American treatment of Muslim countries.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies were tracking a potential Iranian assassination plot against Mr. Trump in the weeks before the assassination attempt that prompted the Secret Service to enhance security for the former president before his outdoor campaign rally in Butler, Pa. It is not clear if the scheme made public on Tuesday precipitated those moves.\n\nMr. Merchant, who is believed to be cooperating with investigators since his detention, \"orchestrated a plot to assassinate U.S. government officials and steal information on U.S. soil,\" prosecutors wrote in documents unsealed on Tuesday.\n\n\"After spending time in Iran, Merchant flew from Pakistan to the U.S. to recruit hit men to carry out his scheme,\" they said.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_killing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Contract killing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Ronald_Reagan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Intelligence_Community", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Intelligence Community"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_world", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muslim world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Kidnapping", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/08/06/multimedia/06dc-justice-trump-hvgf/06dc-justice-trump-hvgf-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795843", "eventUri": "eng-9795843", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-12", "textStart": 394, "textEnd": 401}], "sentiment": -0.3647058823529412, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

We've been very clear about that,' White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Tuesday.\n\n'We consider this a national and homeland security matter of the highest priority,' she said. 'We have invested extraordinary resources in developing additional information about these threats, disrupting individuals involved in these threats, enhancing protective arrangements and potential targets of these threats, engaging with foreign partners and directly warning Iran.'\n\nThe court-appointed lawyer for the defendant in this latest plot targeting Trump, and others, declined comment when contacted by VOA.\n\nBut the charging documents allege Merchant traveled from Pakistan to Turkey and then to Houston, Texas, in April, after spending about two weeks in Iran.\n\nOnce he landed in the U.S., the criminal complaint states, Merchant immediately began recruiting individuals to assist him with the plan, telling the informant that he could earn up to $100,000 and that the scheme would target multiple individuals.\n\n'[The] people who will be targeted are the ones who are hurting Pakistan and the world, [the] Muslim world. These are not normal people,' Merchant said, according to the charging documents.\n\nPlans included theft, death\n\nDuring meetings in New York in June, Merchant allegedly sketched out a three-part plan that involved stealing documents or computer files from a target's home, planning protests and then killing the targets on U.S. soil.\n\nMerchant is charged with giving two undercover agents posing as hitmen a $5,000 advanced payment in late June to carry out the plot, adding more money would be coming after he returned to Pakistan.\n\nU.S. law enforcement officials arrested Merchant on July 12, before he was able to leave the U.S.\n\n'For years, the Justice Department has been working aggressively to counter Iran's brazen and unrelenting efforts to retaliate against American public officials for the killing of Iranian General Soleimani,' said Attorney General Merrick Garland in a statement Tuesday.\n\n'The Justice Department will spare no resource to disrupt and hold accountable those who would seek to carry out Iran's lethal plotting.'\n\nU.S. officials expect there will be no let-up in Tehran's attempts to get revenge.\n\n'We need to recognize the brazenness of the Iranian regime,' the FBI's Wray told U.S. lawmakers during a hearing late last month. 'I expect we're going to see more of it. I expect there will be more coming on that.'\n\nAnd some experts warn that even if some of the Iranian attempts appear amateurish, they need to be taken seriously.\n\n'Much like Iranian projectiles, sometimes quantity has a quality of its own,' said Behnam Ben Taleblu, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\n\n'On the one hand, some of these things may sound cartoonish or too far-fetched, but on the other hand, there's a persistence behind it, which is worrisome,' he told VOA. 'My fear is that it's going to be throwing everything or what it can at the wall and seeing what sticks.'\n\nPatsy Widakuswara and Lynn Davis contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "myanmarnews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Myanmar News.Net"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_killing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Contract killing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Tehran"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Citizenship of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_Permanent_Select_Committee_on_Intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_of_the_Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_A._Wray", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christopher A.

The arrest has prompted officials to increase security around Trump, especially after an attempt was made on his life during a rally at Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13.\n\nMr. Merchant was arrested July 12, one day before Trump was nearly killed. He is being accused of working with a hitman to carry out the assassination attempts in late August or early September of last year.\n\nThe FBI director, Christopher Way, said that the plot was \"straight out of the Iranian playbook.\" Mr. Merchant is believed to have been arrested before any kind of premeditated attack took place, and he is in federal custody.\n\n\"The Justice Department will spare no resource to disrupt and hold accountable those who would seek to carry out Iran's lethal plotting against American citizens,\" Attorney General Garland said.\n\nThe DOJ \"will not tolerate attempts by an authoritarian regime to target American public officials and endanger America's national security,\" he added.\n\nAccording to the prosecution, Mr. Merchant arrived on American soil from Pakistan in April, after spending time in Iran. He allegedly contacted someone whom he believed could help him with his plots.\n\nInstead, his contact reported him to law enforcement and became a confidential source. Mr. Merchant allegedly wanted his contact to work with him on future assassinations as well. Mr. Merchant's plot involved stealing a target's documents and inciting protests in addition to assassination.\n\nIn June, Mr. Merchant met with purported hitmen, who were American law enforcement agents in disguise. He enlisted their help and said they would receive instructions from him on who to kill after he had left America.\n\nOn June 21, Mr. Merchant met with the undercover agents to pay the $5,000 in advance for their services, and made arrangements to leave America shortly afterward. He was arrested nearly four weeks later.\n\n\"The targeting of former and current officials by foreign actors is an affront to our sovereignty and our democratic institutions and the Department of Justice will use every possible tool to expose and disrupt this egregious activity,\" an assistant attorney general, Matthew Olson, said.\n\nThe FBI will take this as a welcomed public victory after the debacle at the Butler rally, for which the bureau was severely scrutinized during a Senate hearing last week.\n\nThe acting FBI assistant director, Christie Curtis, was quick to praise her agents, saying that this case \"underscores the dedication and formidable efforts of our agents, analysts and prosecutors.\" She also said it \"reaffirms the FBI's commitment to protecting our nation and its citizens from both domestic and international threats.\"\n\nThe DOJ has not responded to the Sun's requests seeking comment on this matter.", "source": {"uri": "nysun.com", "dataType": "news",

Merchant told a law enforcement informant that there would be \"security all around\" one target, according to the criminal complaint.\n\nA Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment further.

That person reported Merchant's conduct to law enforcement and became a confidential source.\n\nIn early June, Merchant met the confidential source in New York and explained his assassination plot. Merchant told the individual the opportunity he had for the person was not a one-time opportunity and would be ongoing.\n\nMerchant then made a \"finger gun\" motion with his hand, indicating that the opportunity was related to a killing.\n\nMerchant further stated that the intended victims would be \"targeted here\", meaning in the United States.\n\nMerchant instructed the individual to arrange meetings with others whom he could hire to carry out these actions. Merchant explained that his plot involved multiple criminal schemes including stealing documents or USB drives from a target's home; planning a protest; and killing a politician or government official.\n\nMerchant at the meeting began planning potential assassination scenarios and quizzed the individual on how he would kill a target in the various scenarios.\n\nSpecifically, Merchant asked to explain how the target would die in different scenarios. Merchant told the individual that there would be \"security [] all around\" the person.\n\nMerchant stated that the assassination would occur after he left the United States and he would communicate with the individual from overseas using code words. The source asked whether Merchant had spoken to the unidentified \"party\" back home with whom Merchant was working.\n\nMerchant responded that he had and the party back home told him to \"finalise\" the plan and leave the United States.\n\nIn mid-June, Merchant met with the purported hitmen, who were undercover US law enforcement officers in New York. Merchant advised the undercover officers that he was looking for three services from them: theft of documents, arranging protests at political rallies, and for them to kill a \"political person\".\n\nMerchant said the hitmen would receive instructions on who to kill either the last week of August or the first week of September after he had departed the United States.\n\nMerchant then began arranging means to obtain USD 5,000 in cash to pay the undercover officers as an advance payment for the assassination, which he eventually received with assistance from an individual overseas.\n\nOn June 21, Merchant met with the undercover officers in New York and paid them the USD 5,000 advance. One of the undercover officers stated: \"Now we're bonded\", to which Merchant responded: \"Yes.\" The undercover officer added: \"Now we know we're going forward. We're doing this\", to which Merchant responded, \"Yes, absolutely.\" Merchant subsequently made flight arrangements and planned to leave the United States on July 12 when law enforcement agents placed him under arrest before he could leave the country.

Why the Date Is Alarming.", "body": "Federal law enforcement got poked in the eye again as we learned that a Pakistani national was arrested for plotting to assassinate former President Donald Trump. Asif Raza Merchant, 46, who had ties to Iran, was cobbling together a conspiracy to eliminate Trump. The men he tried to hire for this scheme were undercover FBI agents. Merchant was arrested on July 12 (via DOJ):\n\nFor years, the Justice Department has been working aggressively to counter Iran's brazen and unrelenting efforts to retaliate against American public officials for the killing of Iranian General Soleimani,\" said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. \"The Justice Department will spare no resource to disrupt and hold accountable those who would seek to carry out Iran's lethal plotting against American citizens and will not tolerate attempts by an authoritarian regime to target American public officials and endanger America's national security.\"\n\n\"This dangerous murder-for-hire plot exposed in today's complaint allegedly was orchestrated by a Pakistani national with close ties to Iran and is straight out of the Iranian playbook,\" said FBI Director Christopher Wray. \"A foreign-directed plot to kill a public official, or any U.S. citizen, is a threat to our national security and will be met with the full might and resources of the FBI.\"\n\n\"The complaint unsealed today underscores, yet again, that those who engage in lethal plotting on U.S. soil will face the full force of the American justice system,\" said Assistant Attorney General Matthew G. Olsen of the Justice Department's National Security Division. \"The targeting of former and current officials by foreign actors is an affront to our sovereignty and our democratic institutions and the Department of Justice will use every possible tool to expose and disrupt this egregious activity.\"\n\n\"Working on behalf of others overseas, Merchant planned the murder of U.S. government officials on American soil,\" said U.S. Attorney Breon Peace for the Eastern District of New York. \"This prosecution demonstrates that this office and the entire Department of Justice will take swift and decisive action to protect our nation's security, our government officials and our citizens from foreign threats\n\n\"Fortunately, the assassins Merchant allegedly tried to hire were undercover FBI Agents,\" said Acting Assistant Director Christie Curtis of the FBI New York Field Office. \"This case underscores the dedication and formidable efforts of our agents, analysts and prosecutors in New York, Houston, and Dallas. Their success in neutralizing this threat not only prevented a tragic outcome but also reaffirms the FBI's commitment to protecting our nation and its citizens from both domestic and international threats.\"\n\nAccording to allegations contained in the complaint and related publicly filed court documents, Merchant orchestrated a plot to assassinate a politician or U.S. government official on U.S. soil. In approximately April 2024, after spending time in Iran, Merchant arrived in the United States from Pakistan and contacted a person he believed could assist him with the scheme. That person reported Merchant's conduct to law enforcement and became a confidential source (the CS).\n\nThat's why Trump was reportedly given extra security, though the Secret Service later admitted denying other requests for additional resources. And yet, Trump still got shot and was nearly killed in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13. The Secret Service had to have known about this arrest, which some, like Kerri Urbahn, commented made the butler rally failures more \"mind-boggling.\" Urbahn is Fox News' legal editor and former director of public affairs at the Justice Department.\n\nIt's just another addition to this layer cake of incompetence and negligence that almost killed a former president. The rooftop of the American Glass Research building is left unprotected, the Secret Service does not have access to the radio system, IDs are allegedly not checked for access to the restricted area, and lead agents are unqualified to run point for this event.

But in discussions Merchant had with others, Trump's name came up as a possible target, according to a law enforcement official granted anonymity to discuss sensitive details about the investigation.\n\nA former senior Trump administration official said Tuesday he received a \"duty to warn\" briefing from the FBI about Merchant before the indictment was unsealed.\n\nAmong the indications that Merchant was targeting a high-level official is a comment he allegedly made about the target being well protected.\n\nOn June 4, during a sting operation mounted by the FBI, Merchant told a confidential source that there would be security \"all around\" the target, FBI Special Agent Anthony Cipriano said in an affidavit filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New York.\n\nMerchant appeared in federal court there on July 17 and a magistrate judge ordered him held without bail, according to court records. In an unusual move, the criminal complaint and a letter from prosecutors urging Merchant's detention were kept secret until Tuesday at the government's request.\n\nDuring a visit to prosecutors and law enforcement agents in Iowa Tuesday, Attorney General Merrick Garland decried the alleged plot, but stressed that investigators do not see a connection to the assassination attempt on Trump in Pennsylvania. Officials believe that shooting was carried out by Thomas Matthew Crooks, a 20-year-old American from Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, who was shot dead at the scene by a Secret Service sniper.\n\n\"I do want to recognize that in the wake of the attempted assassination of former President Trump last month, the American people are more aware than ever about the seriousness of the threats facing our public officials,\" Garland said. \"While our investigation into the attempted assassination remains ongoing, as the FBI has stated multiple times, we have not found any evidence that the shooter had accomplices or co-conspirators, either foreign or domestic.\"\n\nAccording to court papers, the FBI became aware of Merchant's plot in April after he traveled in Iran and Pakistan before flying to the U.S. and reaching out to someone who reported to law enforcement that Merchant had asked him to help steal information, organize protests and carry out an assassination. That unnamed contact agreed to become a confidential source for the FBI, court filings say.\n\nThe FBI arranged a pair of undercover officers to pose as hit men who could help with the operation, according to prosecutors. He met them in June and told them he was looking to kill a \"political person,\" Cipriano wrote.\n\nIn a later meeting with the confidential source, Merchant provided a rudimentary written code that would obscure the purpose of their interactions, court filings say.\n\n\"Merchant wrote that the word 'tee-shirt' would mean a 'protest,' which he described as the 'lightest work,'\" Cipriano wrote. \"The phrase 'flannel shirt' would mean 'stealing,' which was 'heavier work.'\"\n\n\"Fleece jacket,\" Cipriano continued, was Merchant's code for murder.\n\nWhen Merchant was arrested, agents found a list of the codewords in his wallet, Cipriano said.\n\nThe court filings don't say Merchant explicitly declared that he was acting on behalf of Iran, but say he \"indicated an affinity for Iran,\" often traveled there, and had a wife and children both in Iran and Pakistan.\n\nThreats from Iran have led the Secret Service to increase security for Trump and other current and former U.S. officials in recent months. That increase was prompted in part by the plot Merchant is charged with, a law enforcement official said Tuesday.\n\n\"Certainly, that was part of the calculus,\" said the official, who was granted anonymity to discuss the security arrangements.\n\nSecret Service spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said officials are aware of the Iranian threat and are taking it into account when planning security arrangements.\n\nSome in Congress have pressed for even more security coverage in response to the threats U.S. officials have attributed to Iran.\n\nDuring a Senate hearing last week about the Pennsylvania assassination attempt on Trump and federal agencies' handling of it, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) pressed acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe about the cancellation of a security detail for former national security adviser Robert O'Brien.\n\n\"Who made that decision despite Iran's ongoing, credible threats?\" Cotton asked, urging that the protection be restored.\n\n\"It wasn't the Secret Service,\" Rowe said, adding that such protection was usually granted by presidential memorandum.\n\n\"I'm pretty confident that the agency can get this done, and I think it needs to get done, if you look at the kind of ongoing threats that he and all these others face,\" Cotton said.", "source": {"uri": "politico.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "POLITICO"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score":

He revealed his motivation to a confidential source: The \"people who will be targeted are the ones who are hurting Pakistan and the world, (the) Muslim world. These are not normal people,\" per unsealed court documents.\n\nThe FBI believes the intended targets of the plot were current and former officials, as well as former President Donald Trump, CNN reported.\n\nMerchant is now in federal custody.\n\nThe unsealed court documents reveal that Merchant has been working since at least April on assassination plots of U.S. government officials and spent time recruiting help in the U.S. One such potential recruit informed law enforcement and became a confidential source to authorities, ultimately setting him up in a hit man hiring trap.\n\nHe disguised the assassination plot as a \"yarn-dying\" business out of fear of being recorded or overheard. He frequently spoke in code with the source and would hide the source's phone during meetings. He used words like \"T-shirt\" to mean protest and \"flannel shirt\" to mean stealing, according to CNN.\n\nTraveling between Houston, Texas and New York, Merchant met the source in person in addition to digital contact.\n\nIn May, Merchant offered to pay the source up to $100,000 for his services.\n\nThe next month, he revealed his plan to the source, which consisted of three parts: \"(1) stealing documents or USB drives from a target's home; (2) planning a protest; and (3) killing a politician or government official,\" per the documents.\n\nHe tasked the source with recruiting people for each of the plan's stages. He needed 25 people for the protest, which would act as a distraction after the assassination, a reconnaissance woman and \"men who could do the killing.\"\n\nFrom April to July, Merchant communicated in detail with the source regarding his plan, and took action to set it up. Working with the FBI, this culminated in the source connecting Merchant to undercover officers posing as hit men in late June.\n\nOn July 12, weeks after paying the \"hit men\" an advanced payment and confirming their bond, Merchant attempted to leave the country for Pakistan, where he'd wait while the plan was to be carried out in August or September, CNN reported.\n\nMerchant was arrested at his place of residence in New York and officers carried out a search, during which they found a note, written in code he invented to discuss the plot, in his wallet.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_world", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Muslim world"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_killing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Contract killing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconnaissance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reconnaissance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covert_operation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Covert operation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government_Operations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Government Operations", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 60}], "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/deseret_news_992/a498afcaf9350453dc7894de2bcb45ec", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795843", "eventUri": "eng-9795843", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-12", "textStart": 2280, "textEnd": 2287}], "sentiment": -0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

He is currently in federal custody.\n\n\"Fortunately, the assassins Merchant allegedly tried to hire were undercover FBI Agents,\" said Acting Assistant Director Christie Curtis of the FBI New York Field Office. \"This case underscores the dedication and formidable efforts of our agents, analysts and prosecutors in New York, Houston, and Dallas. Their success in neutralizing this threat not only prevented a tragic outcome but also reaffirms the FBI's commitment to protecting our nation and its citizens from both domestic and international threats.\"\n\n\"Working on behalf of others overseas, Merchant planned the murder of U.S. government officials on American soil,\" said U.S. Attorney Breon Peace for the Eastern District of New York. \"This prosecution demonstrates that this Office and the entire U.S. Department of Justice will take swift and decisive action to protect our nation's security, our government officials and our citizens from foreign threats.\"\n\nMerchant arrived in New York City from Texas in April with the intention of hiring a hitman to kill political figures in the U.S., prosecutors said.

These are not normal people.\" He then asked 25 men who could perform a protest as a distraction after a murder occurred, and a woman to do \"reconnaissance,\" court documents state.\n\nAdditionally, Merchant met with the confidential source multiple times and stated he wanted him to do three things: steal documents or USB drives from one victim's home, plan protests at political rallies and carry out assassinations. At one specific meeting, he allegedly told the source that the work was not a one-time opportunity and allegedly made a \"finger gun\" motion with his hand.\n\nHe also used coded language for communicating his plans, saying \"tee-shirt\" meant \"protest,\" which he described as the \"lightest work.\"\n\n\"Flannel shirt\" would mean \"stealing,\" which was \"heavier work\" and the \"fleece jacket,\" the heaviest work, would mean \"the third task . . . commit the act of the game,\" indicating the assassinations.\n\nThe latest assassination plot foiled adds to another list of detailed Iranian plans to allegedly kill Trump, according to national security officials.\n\nConcerns have been repeatedly raised by the U.S. government that Iran could retaliate for a 2020 U.S. drone strike that killed General Qasem Soleimani, a top general in Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) by trying to kill the 45 president.\n\nMeanwhile, prosecutors have charged other individuals for other assassination attempts in the past, which includes charges brought in 2022 against a 45-year-old Iranian national and IRGC member who allegedly tried to pay $300,000 to an individual in the U.S. to kill former national security adviser John Bolton.\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland said Tuesday that the U.S. \"will not tolerate attempts by an authoritarian regime to target American public officials and endanger America's national security.\"\n\nStay informed!

This case was being investigated before a gunman attempted to kill former President Trump at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania.\n\nMerchant, aged 46, traveled to New York City and collaborated with a hitman to plan the assassinations in late August or early September, according to federal prosecutors. The target of the plot was high-ranking U.S. officials, including Trump. He was arrested on July 12 while getting ready to leave the U.S. Investigators found out that he has a wife and children in Iran as well as a wife and children in Pakistan.\n\nThe FBI was able to thwart the alleged plot by Merchant as the hitmen he tried to hire turned out to be undercover FBI agents. The case was a joint effort involving agents, analysts, and prosecutors from New York, Houston, and Dallas. This successful operation prevented a potentially tragic outcome and highlights the FBI's commitment to safeguarding the nation and its citizens from both domestic and international threats.\n\nIt is important to note that Merchant's failed plot is not related to the incident involving the shooting of Trump in Pennsylvania. Investigators clarified that the targets included individuals from both political factions, not just Trump. Merchant had arrived in New York City from Texas in April with the purpose of hiring a hitman to assassinate political figures in the U.S. He contacted someone he believed would assist him, but that individual reached out to the FBI and became a confidential source.\n\nDuring their meetings, Merchant mentioned that the targets were individuals who were causing harm to Pakistan and the Muslim world, emphasizing that they were not ordinary people. He requested 25 men to create a distraction through protests after the assassinations and a woman to conduct reconnaissance. Merchant used coded language to communicate his plans, referring to protests as \"tee-shirt,\" theft as \"flannel shirt,\" and assassinations as \"fleece jacket.\"\n\nIn one of the meetings, Merchant indicated that the operation was ongoing and not a one-time task, making a gesture with his hand mimicking a gun. He also mentioned a \"party\" back home with whom he was working while planning various scenarios. Additionally, he used the phrase \"denim jacket\" to denote \"sending money.\"\n\nThis case serves as a reminder of the importance of vigilance and the tireless efforts of law enforcement agencies to protect the country from foreign threats. The collaboration between different agencies played a crucial role in preventing a potentially dangerous situation and ensuring the safety of government officials and citizens.", "source": {"uri": "usanews.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "USANews Press Release Network"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_killing", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Contract killing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Pakistan"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Iran", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Government of Iran"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Iran"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Iran"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covert_operation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Covert operation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconnaissance", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Reconnaissance"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_agency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement agency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_world", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Muslim world"}, "location": null}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://usanews.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/news-06082024-230009.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795843", "eventUri": "eng-9795843", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-07-12", "textStart": 565, "textEnd": 572}], "sentiment": -0.1529411764705882, "wgt": 170, "relevance": 1}

Their success in neutralizing this threat not only prevented a tragic outcome but also reaffirms the FBI's commitment to protecting our nation and its citizens from both domestic and international threats.\"\n\nRELATED: Secret Service director says he's 'ashamed' following Trump assassination attempt\n\n\"Working on behalf of others overseas, Merchant planned the murder of U.S. government officials on American soil,\" said U.S. Attorney Breon Peace for the Eastern District of New York. \"This prosecution demonstrates that this Office and the entire U.S. Department of Justice will take swift and decisive action to protect our nation's security, our government officials and our citizens from foreign threats.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxla.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 11 Los Angeles"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Assassination"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New York City"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pennsylvania"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract_killing", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Contract killing"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breon_Peace", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Breon Peace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_District_Court_for_the_Eastern_District_of_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Secret Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal government of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Murder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Houston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Organized_Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Organized Crime", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 73}], "image": "https://images.foxtv.com/static.livenowfox.com/www.livenowfox.com/content/uploads/2024/08/1280/720/pakistan.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9795843", "eventUri": "eng-9795843", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.3333333333333334, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

According to court records, a federal judge ordered him detained on July 16.\n\n\"For years, the Justice Department has been working aggressively to counter Iran's brazen and unrelenting efforts to retaliate against American public officials for the killing of Iranian General Soleimani,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement.\n\nFBI investigators believe that former president Donald Trump, who approved the drone strike on Soleimani, and other current and former US government officials were the intended targets of the plot, CNN reported, citing a US official.\n\nCourt documents do not name the alleged targets of the plot. Merchant told a law enforcement informant that there would be \"security all around\" one target, according to the criminal complaint.\n\nA Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment further. Trump's presidential campaign could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nA 20-year-old gunman wounded the former Republican president and current White House candidate at a July 13 campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nThe gunman opened fire on Trump with an AR-style assault rifle just minutes after he began speaking at the campaign event.\n\nPerched on the roof of a nearby building, he was shot dead by a Secret Service sniper less than 30 seconds after firing the first of eight shots.\n\nInvestigators concluded the young man, who lived in a town about 80 kilometres from Butler, acted alone and were not able to identify any strong ideological or political leanings.\n\nTwo rally attendees were seriously wounded and a 50-year-old Pennsylvania firefighter, Corey Comperatore, was shot dead.\n\nFormer US Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle admitted to Congress that she and her agency failed and subsequently resigned.\n\nLast week, the US Secret Service's acting director said that police in Pennsylvania had warned that there was a man with a gun on a roof before the July 13 attempted assassination but the message did not reach its agents on time.\n\nLocal authorities and Secret Service agents were using different communication channels, which prevented the warning from getting through before the assailant opened fire on the Republican presidential candidate.", "source": {"uri": "pakistantoday.com.pk", "dataType": "news", "title": "pakistantoday.com.pk"}, "authors": [{"uri": "reuters@pakistantoday.com.pk", "name": "Reuters", "type":

Merchant was arrested one day before the July 13 rally.\n\nMerchant is accused of flying from Pakistan to the U.S. to try and recruit accomplices for his deadly scheme.\n\nMerchant also paid $5,000 in cash to an undercover agent after a meeting in Manhattan, according to prosecutors.\n\nProsecutors say Merchant plotted his deadly scheme with scribbles on a napkin\n\nImages show the notes he made on one of the napkins, that was retrieved during the investigation\n\nWord of the stunning alleged plot follows an unrelated attempt on Trump's life\n\nHe also paid $5,000 in cash to an undercover agent after a meeting in Manhattan and laid out his plans on a napkin, according to prosecutors.\n\nThe damning indictment reveals he frequently travelled to Iraq, Syria and Iran.\n\nWhen in the U.S., he contacted a person he believed could help him in his sinister plans.\n\nThe individual then contacted law enforcement and became a confidential informant.\n\nFederal officials said his wife and children lived in Iran, and that he had traveled to Iran, Syria and Iraq.\n\nSaid AG Merrick Garland in a statement, 'For years, the Justice Department has been working aggressively to counter Iran's brazen and unrelenting efforts to retaliate against American public officials for the killing of Iranian General Soleimani.'\n\n'The Justice Department will spare no resource to disrupt and hold accountable those who would seek to carry out Iran's lethal plotting against American citizens and will not tolerate attempts by an authoritarian regime to target American public officials and endanger America's national security,' he added.\n\nThe charges come amid new scrutiny on the Secret Service amid what has been deemed a massive security failure after a shooter was able to fire on Trump during his rally last month.\n\nFormer Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle stepped down in the wake of the shooting.\n\nIt also comes amid fears of a widening conflict in the Middle East, with the Pentagon dispatching additional forces to the region to head off escalation amid expectations Iran will further strike out at Israel and as its proxies continue to fire on U.S. military positions in the region.\n\nThe charging documents did not mention Trump by name, and sources told ABC potential targets came from both parties.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, asked about the news at her Tuesday briefing, said that based on the ongoing DOJ probe, 'there has been no evidence to suggest that the individual named in today's indictment has any connection to the assassination attempt against former President Trump that happened in Butler Pennsylvania.'\n\n'These threats arise from arise desire to seek revenge for the killing of Qasem Soleimani. We consider this a national and homeland security matter of highest priority, the highest priority,' she said. \"We have repeatedly met at the highest levels of our government to develop and implement a comprehensive response to this to these threats.'\n\nTehran has denied any role in the plot, saying in a statement by Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani last month that Iran 'strongly rejects any involvement in the recent armed attack on Trump or claims about Iran's intention for such an action, considering such allegations to have malicious political motives and objectives.'", "source":

Recent court documents unsealed in Brooklyn federal court revealed that Merchant, 46, was in the U.S. to hire a hitman for an Iranian scheme targeting multiple U.S. officials, with Trump being one of the potential targets, although the documents do not explicitly name him. Merchant was apprehended on June 12, just one day before the attempted assassination on the 78-year-old former president.\n\nMust Read: Six IDF Soldiers Sustained Injuries In A Hezbollah Attack\n\nThe court documents disclose that Merchant, born in Karachi around 1978, claims to currently reside in Pakistan. He has mentioned having a family in both Pakistan and Iran and has traveled frequently to Iran, Syria, and Iraq. The documents show that Merchant traveled to the U.S. in April 2022 to enlist help for his plot.

After spending time in Iran, Merchant traveled to the U.S. from Pakistan in April and contacted a person he believed could assist him with the plot, according a criminal complaint filed in federal court in Brooklyn, New York.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump was one of those individuals who Merchant viewed as a possible target, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the matter isn't public. There's no evidence that Merchant's plan had any connection to last month's assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, another person said.\n\nPakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement that it is in touch with U.S. officials about the case and awaiting further details. CNN reported the indictment and Trump as a potential target earlier Tuesday.\n\nMerchant made an initial court appearance before U.S. Magistrate Judge Lois Bloom in Brooklyn who ordered him held without bail saying he posed a \"severe\" threat to the U.S. and a flight risk.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\n(With assistance from Chris Strohm.)\n\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.

He was apprehended and is currently in federal custody in New York.\n\nThe arrest underscores what the DOJ said is its commitment to thwarting Iran's ongoing efforts to retaliate against American officials, particularly in response to the killing of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani.\n\nSoleimani was killed in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad on Jan. 3, 2020, under the Trump administration.\n\n\"For years, the Justice Department has been working aggressively to counter Iran's brazen and unrelenting efforts to retaliate against American public officials for the killing of Iranian General Soleimani,\" said Attorney General Merrick Garland.\n\n\"The Justice Department will spare no resource to disrupt and hold accountable those who would seek to carry out Iran's lethal plotting against American citizens and will not tolerate attempts by an authoritarian regime to target American public officials and endanger America's national security.\"\n\nThe plot was uncovered through a coordinated effort involving multiple FBI field offices and the New York City Police Department, among other agencies, DOJ said.\n\nAccording to court documents, Merchant arrived in the United States from Pakistan in April, following a period in Iran.\n\nHe is described as a citizen of Pakistan, born in Karachi, with a wife and children in both Pakistan and Iran, and he traveled frequently to Iran, Syria, and Iraq.\n\nMerchant allegedly sought to hire hitmen to carry out assassinations on American soil, believing he was working with a trusted contact who reported his activities to law enforcement and became a confidential source.\n\nHe used operational security measures, such as multiple cellular phones and removing them during sensitive discussions, to avoid surveillance, the court documents claim.\n\nDuring meetings in New York, Merchant outlined a plan involving multiple criminal schemes, including the theft of documents, organizing protests as distractions, and the assassination plot. These activities were discussed using coded language; for instance, \"tee-shirt\" referred to protests, \"flannel shirt\" to stealing, and \"fleece jacket\" to murder.\n\nIn June, Merchant met with individuals he believed to be hitmen, who were actually undercover FBI agents, to arrange the logistics of the plot.\n\nHe provided an advance payment of $5,000 and indicated that instructions for the assassination would be issued after his planned departure from the United States in mid-July, the DOJ said.\n\nHowever, law enforcement intervened and arrested Merchant on July 12, before he could leave the country, DOJ said.\n\n\"Fortunately, the assassins Merchant tried to hire were undercover FBI Agents,\" said Acting Assistant Director Christie Curtis of the FBI New York Field Office. \"This case underscores the dedication and formidable efforts of our agents, analysts and prosecutors in New York, Houston and Dallas. Their success in neutralizing this threat not only prevented a tragic outcome but also reaffirms the FBI's commitment to protecting our nation and its citizens from both domestic and international threats.\"\n\nThe complaint also highlighted Merchant's intent to recruit trusted individuals for various roles in his scheme, including reconnaissance and organizing a protest, with further instructions to be conveyed in coded language.\n\nThe DOJ emphasized at the time of filing in mid-July that premature disclosure of the complaint's contents could have jeopardized the investigation, with risks including fleeing suspects and tampering with evidence before it was ultimately unsealed this week.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

An individual Merchant contacted in April to help assist with the plot reported his activities to law enforcement and became a confidential informant, according to the complaint.\n\nMerchant told the informant his plans also included stealing documents from one target and organizing protests in the US, prosecutors allege.\n\nAfter the failed assassination attempt in Pennsylvania, US officials said that a threat from Iran had prompted the US Secret Service to boost protection around Trump.\n\nAt the time, Iran's mission to the United Nations dismissed the allegations as \"unsubstantiated and

He was arrested last month as he prepared to leave the U.S. and after having told the men that he would provide further instructions, including the names of the intended targets, in August or September after he returned to Pakistan.\n\nPeople are also reading...

But U.S. officials acknowledged last month that a threat on Donald Trump's life from Iran prompted additional security in the days before a Pennsylvania rally in which Trump was injured by a gunman's bullet. That July 13 shooting, carried out by a 20-year-old Pennsylvania man, was unrelated to the Iran threat and Merchant's arrest has no connection to the Trump assassination attempt, a law enforcement official said.\n\nBut an FBI agent's affidavit suggests Merchant had current or former high-level officials like Trump in mind. He told an associate who was secretly cooperating with law enforcement that he wanted a \"political person\" to be killed, the complaint said, mapping out on a napkin the different scenarios in which the target could be assassinated and warning that there would be security \"all around.\"\n\nU.S. officials have warned for years about Iran's desire to avenge the 2020 killing of Qassem Soleimani, who led the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' Quds Force. That strike was ordered by Trump when he was president. The U.S. government since then has paid for security for multiple Trump administration officials, and in 2022, the Justice Department charged an Iranian operative in a foiled plot to kill Bolton.\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray said at a House hearing last month that the Iranian government had been \"extremely aggressive and brazen\" in recent years, and Attorney General Merrick Garland said Tuesday that \"we expect that these threats will continue and that these cases will not be the last.\n\n\"The Justice Department will spare no resource to disrupt and hold accountable those who would carry out Iran's lethal plotting against Americans,\" he said.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Tuesday during an afternoon press briefing that the U.S. had been \"tracking Iranian threats against former politicians.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"We consider this a national and homeland security matter of the highest priority. We have repeatedly met at the highest levels of our government to develop and implement a comprehensive response,\" she said.\n\nFederal officials identified Merchant, 46, as a Pakistani citizen who has said he has a wife and children in Iran and who traveled frequently to Iran, Syria and Iraq. A lawyer for Merchant declined to comment Tuesday when reached by The Associated Press.\n\nAfter Merchant's arrest, Justice Department prosecutors urged a judge to keep him locked up, writing in a detention memo that before flying from Pakistan to the U.S., \"the defendant had spent two approximately two weeks in Iran. Given the seriousness of the murder for hire charges, the defendant has every incentive to flee to either Pakistan or Iran, significantly reducing the likelihood of his appearance in this case should he flee.\"\n\nHe was ordered detained following a court appearance.\n\nCourt documents trace the foiled plot to this past April, when Merchant flew to the U.S. to recruit participants in the murder-for-hire scheme. He contacted a person he thought would help him but who instead alerted law enforcement. That person became a confidential source for investigators, including by introducing Merchant to the purported hitmen, officials said.\n\nAfter meeting the two undercover officers posing as hitmen, the affidavit says, Merchant told them the work would be long-term. He instructed them that in addition to the killings, he would expect them to arrange protests at political rallies, steal documents and launder money for him. He told them he would return to Pakistan before giving them additional instructions.\n\nOfficials say Merchant paid a $5,000 advance for the planned killings.\n\n\"Now we know we're going forward. We're doing this,\" one of the purported hitmen said, according to the affidavit.\n\n\"Yes, absolutely,\" Merchant replied.\n\nMerchant was arrested July 12, the same day he planned to leave the U.S. Prosecutors say a search of his wallet found a handwritten note that included code words he had used to communicate with the individuals he thought were hitmen.\n\n___\n\nPhotos: Trump injured, 2 killed in shooting at rally 0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up!

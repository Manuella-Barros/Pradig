The home side had led 2-1 from the first leg of the play-off at Starks Park on Thursday night and a Simon Murray double and goals from Jordan White and substitute Brandon Khela saw the home side ran out comfortable 4-0 winners. Cowie was assistant to Malky Mackay and then became interim manager in February 2024, following the departure of Derek Adams and after the play-off win over Rovers, MacGregor said: \u201cDon was told before he got the job that it was his no matter what happened.\u201d Former Ross County, Hearts and Scotland player Cowie,\u201d delighted\u201d to retain cinch Premiership football, said: \u201cWhat was said was that the chairman saw me as the person to take this club forward. \u201cWe were aligned in not thinking that needed to be the focus, because we didn\u2019t need any distractions. \u201cOur main focus was on keeping this club in the Premiership. \u201cYou have to have a chat and see how things look. The chairman has shown a lot of belief in me, and he has stated that he sees me being the person to take the club forward. \u201cAt any club you need to have a bigger conversation about how that looks going forward, and we\u2019ll have that. \u201cI\u2019ve said all along that I want to be a manager, and I felt I was ready three months ago. \u201cSince then that belief I have in myself has only strengthened, and this is a club I have a lot of affection for, so I don\u2019t see any issues there.\u201d Macgregor said: \u201cHe knew when he took over it didn\u2019t matter where we finished, it would be him. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t want the interruption of speaking to his agent and all that during an important time. \u201cI have known him for a long time, since he was nine years old, so to watch his journey, being a local boy, going away to play for Scotland then coming back to be the manager, it has been fabulous. \u201cIt has been traumatic off the park and if it has been like that off the park it will be difficult on it. \u201cThe manager did so well to galvanise things and get the place going again. \u201cIt was difficult for him, I made a mistake because he wanted the job when Malky left but I didn\u2019t think it was fair to put him into that at the time. \u201cIt was a mistake. So I am delighted for him. \u201cHe has a bond with the players, him being a local boy has been important for Ross County.\u201d Rovers boss Ian Murray had no complaints about the defeat and admitted his Championship side had come up against a team that was \u201cquicker, stronger, faster\u201d as he vowed to go again next season. He said: \u201cYou have to give credit to Ross County because they punished us. \u201cThey were clinical, their goals were good strikes and they put you to the sword if you give them opportunities. And that\u2019s the bottom end of the Premiership. \u201cThere is always a physicality aspect of it, especially one-v-one situations. \u201cOur guys are in good shape but we\u2019re playing against quicker, stronger, faster athletes and it\u2019s not what you\u2019re used to. \u201cIn one-off games you can get away with it sometimes but over two games home and away it shows. \u201cWe want to be at that level one day so it shows how far we have to go.\u201d", "summary": "Roy McGregor confirmed Cowie has been offered the manager's job on a permanent basis.", "url": "https://news.stv.tv/sport/don-cowie-will-discuss-becoming-ross-county-boss-after-top-flight-status-secured", "image": "https://news.stv.tv/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/1486e9c19bd62b2b57b4c88c90d7d8a4-1716734082.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 14:49:11", "author": "Andy Coyle", "authors": ["Andy Coyle"], "language": "en", "source_country": "tv", "sentiment": -0.261}

Gretchen Whitmer, is now running for sheriff in northern Michigan's Wexford County.\n\nIn an interview Thursday, Molitor, 40, of Cadillac confirmed he filed paperwork to challenge the county's incumbent sheriff, Trent Taylor, in the Republican primary. Molitor said his personal legal troubles had opened his eyes to problems in the criminal justice system and if elected, he would refuse to enforce laws that he deemed unconstitutional.\n\nAs for voters concerned about the allegations he faced, Molitor said he was willing to personally walk them through his defense. In September, an Antrim County jury found Molitor, William Null, and his twin brother, Michael Null, not guilty of providing support for a terrorist act and a weapon charge.\n\n\"Come on over,\" Molitor said. \"I will open some stuff and let people see. This was a setup by the government.\"\n\nMolitor was one of 14 men charged in federal or state courts in 2020 because of their involvement in alleged plans to kidnap and harm Whitmer, Michigan's top government official. Overall, nine suspects were convicted or accepted plea deals, while a total of five men, including Molitor, were acquitted.\n\nMolitor testified during his trial, describing his participation in a ride to see the governor's vacation home in northern Michigan, according to the Associated Press.\n\n\"It didn't seem serious. ... The danger level in my mind was decreasing just based on the fact that they were not organized. It was two guys, one of them just talking crazy,\" testified Molitor, according to the Associated Press. \"My danger level went way down.\"\n\nMolitor said he's struggled to find a job since his acquittal in September, but he's working to open a survival school in Cadillac.\n\nWexford County has a population of about 34,000 people. In 2020, the county voted overwhelmingly for Republican Donald Trump for president. Trump won the county with 66% of the vote. Democrat Joe Biden got 32%.\n\nTaylor, a Republican and the county's current sheriff, is running for a third term. He's been part of the local sheriff's office in various positions for longer than three decades, he said.\n\n\"Anybody can run for sheriff,\" Taylor said on Thursday when asked about Molitor. \"There are no set qualifications.\"\n\nTaylor said he's proven he can guide the sheriff's office going forward, can manage the budget and understands the changing world of law enforcement.\n\nMolitor said one of the key differences he has with Taylor is Molitor plans to refuse to enforce Michigan's new \"red flag law,\" which allows judges to order law enforcement to temporarily confiscate firearms from people they deem a risk to themselves or others.\n\n\"It's going behind someone's back to take their possessions,\" said Molitor of the policy, which was signed into law by Whitmer in April 2023.\n\nThe Democratic governor said the \"red flag\" law was part of a package of bills that would take Michigan one step closer to having \"common sense\" gun policies.\n\n\"Gun violence is a scourge that is unique to this country and that's why we are taking action,\" Whitmer said last year.\n\nTaylor said the \"red flag\" policy is the law of the land and he will enforce it. Taylor said a law enforcement official who refuses a judge's order could be found in contempt of court.\n\n\"I don't think the citizens want a sheriff that's going to be potentially lodged in their own jail,\" Taylor said.\n\ncmauger@detroitnews.com", "source": {"uri": "detroitnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Detroit News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gretchen_Whitmer", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Gretchen Whitmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquittal", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Acquittal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wexford_County,_Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wexford County, Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wexford County, Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incumbent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Incumbent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutionality", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Constitutionality"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Criminal justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terrorism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antrim_County,_Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Antrim County, Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Antrim County, Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plea_bargain", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Plea bargain"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_court_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "State court (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_flag_law", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Red flag law"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Contempt of court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Governor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Products", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Laws", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2024/05/09/PDTN/73628593007-eric-molitor.jpg?auto=webp&crop=1600,900,x0,y1024&format=pjpg&width=1200", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9554716", "eventUri": "eng-9554716", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 233, "relevance": 1}

Whitmer kidnap plot now running for sheriff", "body": "DETROIT -- Eric Molitor, whom a jury found not guilty of supporting a plot to kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, is now running for sheriff in northern Michigan's Wexford County.\n\nIn an interview Thursday, Molitor, 40, of Cadillac confirmed he filed paperwork to challenge the county's incumbent sheriff, Trent Taylor, in the Republican primary. Molitor said his personal legal troubles had opened his eyes to problems in the criminal justice system and if elected, he would refuse to enforce laws that he deemed unconstitutional.\n\nAs for voters concerned about the allegations he faced, Molitor said he was willing to personally walk them through his defense. In September, an Antrim County jury found Molitor, William Null, and his twin brother, Michael Null, not guilty of providing support for a terrorist act and a weapon charge.\n\n\"Come on over,\" Molitor said. \"I will open some stuff and let people see. This was a setup by the government.\"\n\nMolitor was one of 14 men charged in federal or state courts in 2020 because of their involvement in alleged plans to kidnap and harm Whitmer, Michigan's top government official. Overall, nine suspects were convicted or accepted plea deals, while a total of five men, including Molitor, were acquitted.\n\nMolitor testified during his trial, describing his participation in a ride to see the governor's vacation home in northern Michigan, according to the Associated Press.\n\n\"It didn't seem serious. ... The danger level in my mind was decreasing just based on the fact that they were not organized. It was two guys, one of them just talking crazy,\" testified Molitor, according to the Associated Press. \"My danger level went way down.\"\n\nMolitor said he's struggled to find a job since his acquittal in September, but he's working to open a survival school in Cadillac.\n\nWexford County has a population of about 34,000 people. In 2020, the county voted overwhelmingly for Republican Donald Trump for president. Trump won the county with 66% of the vote.

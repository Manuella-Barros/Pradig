He later was taken to an airport and boarded a plane to an undisclosed location, his lawyer said.\n\nQin pleaded guilty in March to illegally making campaign contributions in the names of others, immigration fraud and production of a false identification document. He admitted using his fortune to recruit and reimburse people who made political donations on his behalf, starting with a New York City race in 2021 -- when Mayor Eric Adams was elected.\n\nFederal prosecutors never named the politicians whose campaigns received the straw donations. U.S. Attorney Breon Peace's office said they were a candidate for New York City political office, a U.S. representative on Long Island and a candidate for a Rhode Island congressional district seat.\n\nProsecutors said the straw donors contributed about $11,600 to the campaigns on Qin's behalf without the campaigns' knowledge.\n\n''Qin's brazen flouting of our political and immigration systems, and his defrauding government agencies resulted in a felony conviction, prison sentence and today, his removal from the United States,'' Peace said in a statement.\n\nQin's lawyer, Henry Mazurek, said Qin got on a plane to leave the country later in the day. He declined to say where Qin was going. He said his client looked forward to rebuilding his life.\n\n''I have no doubts that he will soon regain prominence in international business, and he has a good future ahead of him,'' Mazurek said in a phone interview. ''And it is unfortunate that the U.S. government decides that he will have to build that career someplace else, because he has always been a philanthropist, a legitimate businessman who has done a lot of good here in Long Island and New York.''\n\nMazurek said Qin ''just wanted to participate as a citizen could'' in elections, but was not able to contribute to candidates he supported because he was not a citizen. He said the campaigns did not know about the straw donors scheme.\n\nQin was previously included on the Forbes list of billionaires, with an estimated net worth of $1.8 billion from his stake in film and entertainment companies, including the Honk Kong-based SMI Culture.\n\nAccording to campaign finance records, Qin donated $2,000 to Adams in March 2021. Under the city's campaign finance rules, green card-holders can contribute to races and participate in the city's generous matching funds program, which caps donations at $2,100. A lawyer for Adams has said the mayor had no knowledge of the scheme.\n\nNine months after the donation to Adams, federal prosecutors said Qin began working ''to find individuals to make more than $10,000 in straw donor contributions'' to an unnamed New York City candidate.\n\nAt least one person donated $1,000 on Qin's behalf on Dec. 9, according to prosecutors. The following day, Qin spoke with an unnamed co-conspirator, who told him they expected to be able to obtain up to $20,000 in straw donor contributions for the candidate.\n\nAdams, a Democrat, is currently facing a federal investigation for his fundraising practices. He has said his campaign followed the law on fundraising.\n\nProsecutors say Qin engaged in two other straw donor schemes.\n\nFederal Elections Commission records show Qin donated $2,900 in 2022 to the campaign of Allan Fung, a Republican former mayor who ran unsuccessfully for Congress in Rhode Island. Fung did not immediately return a phone message seeking comment Thursday.\n\nRecords also show that a man named Jonathan Chau, who provided Adams' transition committee with $1,000 on December 9, 2021, gave $5,800 to a committee supporting Fung, and $2,900 to a committee backing Rep. Andrew Garbarino, a Long Island Republican. An email message seeking comment was sent to a Garbarino staffer.\n\nAlso as part of the case, Qin admitted to filing a false application for lawful permanent residency status in the U.S. in 2019 by falsely claiming he never used an alias, and fraudulently obtaining a Florida driver's license when he lived in New York.", "source": {"uri": "startribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Star

Azrack to seven months' imprisonment for making political contributions in the names of others, immigration fraud and producing a false identification document. Qin pleaded guilty to the charges in March 2024. As part of his plea, the defendant consented to abandonment of his fraudulently obtained LPR status and removal from the United States immediately after the sentencing. Qin has been incarcerated since his arrest seven months ago on October 2, 2023.\n\nBreon Peace, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, James Smith, Assistant Director-in-Charge, Federal Bureau of Investigation, New York Field Office (FBI), Thomas Fattorusso, Special Agent-in-Charge, Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation, New York (IRS-CI), and Ivan J. Arvelo, Special Agent-in-Charge, Homeland Security Investigations, New York (HSI), announced the sentence.\n\n\"Qin's brazen flouting of our political and immigration systems, and his defrauding government agencies resulted in a felony conviction, prison sentence and today, his removal from the United States,\" stated United States Attorney Peace. \"Qin has learned a lesson in American civics the hard way, that no one is above the law.\"\n\n\"Hui Qin violated our democratic norms by illegally attempting to influence election campaigns through fraudulent political donations,\" stated FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge Smith. \"His unlawful actions and repeated efforts to exploit various government agencies were disrupted by the FBI and such attempts by other threat actors will not be tolerated. Today's sentence and his removal from the United States should dissuade any future schemers from engaging in similar activity. The FBI is committed to exposing all forms of corruption, especially those that threaten election integrity and our duly elected officials.\n\n\"Qin interfered with our election system and tried to gain advantage through his straw donations. He furthered his criminal activity by misrepresenting himself on documents to obtain a false Visa, then lived with an illegitimate status in his $5 million Manhattan apartment. It is through our law enforcement partnerships and good police work that Qin was held accountable for behaving like he was above the law,\" stated IRS-CI Special Agent-in-Charge Fattorusso.\n\n\"By flouting laws vital to the sanctity of the federal election and immigration systems, the defendant threatened not only the community's safety, but the democratic foundation on which the United States of America was established,\" stated HSI New York Special Agent-in- Charge Arvelo. \"Hui Qin's sentencing today underscores the importance of law enforcement's collaboration, coordination, and unwavering dedication to one common goal: protecting the public. HSI New York stands united with our partners against any individuals attempting to jeopardize our national security.\"\n\nAs set forth in court filings and facts presented at the plea proceeding, between December 2021 and December 2022, Qin agreed to reimburse other individuals who made contributions on his behalf to the campaign committees for a candidate for a New York City-wide political office, a member of the United States House of Representatives for a congressional district in the Eastern District of New York and candidate for a House of Representatives seat in a Rhode Island congressional district. During the scheme, straw donors made approximately $11,600 in contributions on Qin's behalf, which caused the campaign committees to file false contribution reports with the Federal Election Commission in 2022.\n\nAdditionally, as part of his plea Qin admitted that, in April 2019, he filed a false application for LPR status with United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. In the application, Qin falsely swore, under penalty of perjury, that he had never used another name. In fact, in 2008, a PRC government official provided Qin with the alias \"Muk Lam Li\" and between 2008 and the filing of Qin's LPR application, Qin obtained identification documents, including a Hong Kong identification card, a PRC identification card and a Hong Kong passport in the name of the Li alias, which contained Qin's photograph, but a date of birth different than Qin's. Around September 2017, Qin used the Li alias to transfer more than $5 million from the PRC to a United States bank account, a portion of which was used to purchase a luxury Manhattan apartment, where Qin resided.\n\nQin also pleaded guilty to engaging in interstate travel to fraudulently obtain a Florida driver's license. In December 2020, Qin travelled from New York to Florida and applied for a driver's license at Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (\"FLHSMV\"). At the time of his travel, Qin was a resident of Old Westbury, Long Island and Manhattan, but he signed an application stating that it was \"true and correct\" that he resided at an address in Miami, where he had never lived. To bolster this false assertion, Qin presented FLHSMV officials with fake bank and credit card statements bearing the name \"Hui Quin\" and the false Miami address. After FLHSMV issued Qin a Florida Driver's License, he presented it to banks and a motor vehicle insurer as identification.\n\nThe government's case is being handled by the Criminal Section of the Office's Long Island Division.

He later was taken to an airport and boarded a plane to an undisclosed location, his lawyer said.\n\nQin pleaded guilty in March to illegally making campaign contributions in the names of others, immigration fraud and production of a false identification document. He admitted using his fortune to recruit and reimburse people who made political donations on his behalf, starting with a New York City race in 2021 -- when Mayor Eric Adams was elected.\n\nFederal prosecutors never named the politicians whose campaigns received the straw donations. U.S. Attorney Breon Peace's office said they were a candidate for New York City political office, a U.S. representative on Long Island and a candidate for a Rhode Island congressional district seat.\n\nProsecutors said the straw donors contributed about $11,600 to the campaigns on Qin's behalf without the campaigns' knowledge.\n\n\"Qin's brazen flouting of our political and immigration systems, and his defrauding government agencies resulted in a felony conviction, prison sentence and today, his removal from the United States,\" Peace said in a statement.\n\nQin's lawyer, Henry Mazurek, said Qin got on a plane to leave the country later in the day. He declined to say where Qin was going. He said his client looked forward to rebuilding his life.\n\n\"I have no doubts that he will soon regain prominence in international business, and he has a good future ahead of him,\" Mazurek said in a phone interview. \"And it is unfortunate that the U.S. government decides that he will have to build that career someplace else, because he has always been a philanthropist, a legitimate businessman who has done a lot of good here in Long Island and New York.\"\n\nMazurek said Qin \"just wanted to participate as a citizen could\" in elections, but was not able to contribute to candidates he supported because he was not a citizen. He said the campaigns did not know about the straw donors scheme.\n\nQin was previously included on the Forbes list of billionaires, with an estimated net worth of $1.8 billion from his stake in film and entertainment companies, including the Honk Kong-based SMI Culture.\n\nAccording to campaign finance records, Qin donated $2,000 to Adams in March 2021. Under the city's campaign finance rules, green card-holders can contribute to races and participate in the city's generous matching funds program, which caps donations at $2,100. A lawyer for Adams has said the mayor had no knowledge of the scheme.\n\nNine months after the donation to Adams, federal prosecutors said Qin began working \"to find individuals to make more than $10,000 in straw donor contributions\" to an unnamed New York City candidate.\n\nAt least one person donated $1,000 on Qin's behalf on Dec. 9, according to prosecutors. The following day, Qin spoke with an unnamed co-conspirator, who told him they expected to be able to obtain up to $20,000 in straw donor contributions for the candidate.\n\nAdams, a Democrat, is currently facing a federal investigation for his fundraising practices. He has said his campaign followed the law on fundraising.\n\nProsecutors say Qin engaged in two other straw donor schemes.\n\nFederal Elections Commission records show Qin donated $2,900 in 2022 to the campaign of Allan Fung, a Republican former mayor who ran unsuccessfully for Congress in Rhode Island. Fung did not immediately return a phone message seeking comment Thursday.\n\nRecords also show that a man named Jonathan Chau, who provided Adams' transition committee with $1,000 on December 9, 2021, gave $5,800 to a committee supporting Fung, and $2,900 to a committee backing Rep. Andrew Garbarino, a Long Island Republican. An email message seeking comment was sent to a Garbarino staffer.\n\nAlso as part of the case, Qin admitted to filing a false application for lawful permanent residency status in the U.S. in 2019 by falsely claiming he never used an alias, and fraudulently obtaining a Florida driver's license when he lived in New York.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 The Associated Press.

A source familiar with the investigation told Newsday the donations were made to the campaigns of New York City Mayor Eric Adams, Long Island Congressman Andrew Garbarino, and former Rhode Island Congressional candidate Allan Fung.\n\nQin, who faced between eight and 14 months in prison under federal sentencing guidelines, was given an agreed-upon sentence of time served after spending the past seven months at the Metropolitan Detention Center in New York City.\n\n\"Any time there is very hard time,\" Azrack said, noting that Qin has already nearly reached the low-end of the guideline sentence.\n\nAn emotional Qin, who used tissues to wipe away tears throughout the proceeding, apologized for his actions, which included lying on forms establishing permanent residency and while obtaining a driver's license using an alias in Miami. Qin's former wife and their two children will remain in Old Westbury as he is removed from the United States to an undisclosed country -- not China -- under what his attorney described as an elaborate plan.\n\n\"The most painful choice for me is that I've lost my most beloved kids,\" Qin said through a Mandarin interpreter.\n\nHenry Mazurek, an attorney for Qin, told Azrack he hopes his client \"finds the peace that has eluded him over the years.\"\n\nMazurek described Qin as a \"self-made business owner,\" a billionaire who cracked the Forbes Top 20 before his empire came crashing down among a series of poor decisions made around the time of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nMazurek said Qin, who also had a residence in Manhattan, had raised more than $200 million from investors to take his 3,000 movie-theater chain, which he described as a Chinese equivalent of AMC, public in 2020. The financial fallout from pandemic-era lockdown restrictions cost Qin his fortune and his marriage, leading to a series of lawsuits from investors across the globe when the chain never did go public, Mazurek said.\n\nBetween December 2021 and December 2022, according to prosecutors, Qin agreed to reimburse other individuals who made campaign contributions on his behalf to Adams, Garbarino and Fung. Adams and Garbarino did not immediately respond to requests for comment Thursday.\n\nQin's straw donors made approximately $11,600 in contributions on his behalf, without the knowledge of the campaign committees, prosecutors have said. The campaigns filed false contribution reports with the Federal Election Commission in 2022 as a result of Qin's actions, Assistant U.S. Attorney Bradley King said.\n\nMazurek said Qin's straw-donation scheme was created in an effort to impress his politically active former wife.\n\nQin also admitted in March to filing a false application for lawful permanent resident status in April 2019 with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. He swore in his application, under penalty of perjury, that he had never used another name. Prosecutors said a People's Republic of China official provided Qin with the alias \"Muk Lam Li\" between 2008 and the filing of his residency application.\n\nQin obtained identification documents, including a Hong Kong identification card, a Chinese identification card and a Hong Kong passport in the name of the Li alias, which contained Qin's photograph, prosecutors said. In or around September 2017, Qin used the Li alias to transfer more than $5 million from China to a United States bank account. He used some of those funds to buy a luxury Manhattan apartment, prosecutors said\n\nMazurek said he established the false identity to avoid public scrutiny, as a famous business owner in China.\n\nHis notoriety drew attention from other Chinese nationals, who attended Thursday's sentencing.\n\nLinhui Wang, 51, of Smithtown, described Qin's fall from grace as an emotional moment for the Chinese people, who once celebrated his improbable business success. An IT analyst for Stony Brook University Hospital who has never met Qin, she wanted to see the sentencing for herself.\n\n\"He had traumas in his life and I think he made mistakes. He will pay for his mistakes,\" Wang said.", "source": {"uri": "newsday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsday"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qin_dynasty",

He later was taken to an airport and boarded a plane to an undisclosed location, his lawyer said.\n\nQin pleaded guilty in March to illegally making campaign contributions in the names of others, immigration fraud and production of a false identification document. He admitted using his fortune to recruit and reimburse people who made political donations on his behalf, starting with a New York City race in 2021 -- when Mayor Eric Adams was elected.\n\nFederal prosecutors never named the politicians whose campaigns received the straw donations. U.S. Attorney Breon Peace's office said they were a candidate for New York City political office, a U.S. representative on Long Island and a candidate for a Rhode Island congressional district seat.\n\nProsecutors said the straw donors contributed about $11,600 to the campaigns on Qin's behalf without the campaigns' knowledge.\n\n\"Qin's brazen flouting of our political and immigration systems, and his defrauding government agencies resulted in a felony conviction, prison sentence and today, his removal from the United States,\" Peace said in a statement.\n\nQin's lawyer, Henry Mazurek, said Qin got on a plane to leave the country later in the day. He declined to say where Qin was going. He said his client looked forward to rebuilding his life.\n\n\"I have no doubts that he will soon regain prominence in international business, and he has a good future ahead of him,\" Mazurek said in a phone interview. \"And it is unfortunate that the U.S. government decides that he will have to build that career someplace else, because he has always been a philanthropist, a legitimate businessman who has done a lot of good here in Long Island and New York.\"\n\nMazurek said Qin \"just wanted to participate as a citizen could\" in elections, but was not able to contribute to candidates he supported because he was not a citizen. He said the campaigns did not know about the straw donors scheme.\n\nQin was previously included on the Forbes list of billionaires, with an estimated net worth of $1.8 billion from his stake in film and entertainment companies, including the Honk Kong-based SMI Culture.\n\nAccording to campaign finance records, Qin donated $2,000 to Adams in March 2021. Under the city's campaign finance rules, green card-holders can contribute to races and participate in the city's generous matching funds program, which caps donations at $2,100. A lawyer for Adams has said the mayor had no knowledge of the scheme.\n\nNine months after the donation to Adams, federal prosecutors said Qin began working \"to find individuals to make more than $10,000 in straw donor contributions\" to an unnamed New York City candidate.\n\nAt least one person donated $1,000 on Qin's behalf on Dec. 9, according to prosecutors. The following day, Qin spoke with an unnamed co-conspirator, who told him they expected to be able to obtain up to $20,000 in straw donor contributions for the candidate.\n\nAdams, a Democrat, is currently facing a federal investigation for his fundraising practices. He has said his campaign followed the law on fundraising.\n\nProsecutors say Qin engaged in two other straw donor schemes.\n\nFederal Elections Commission records show Qin donated $2,900 in 2022 to the campaign of Allan Fung, a Republican former mayor who ran unsuccessfully for Congress in Rhode Island. Fung did not immediately return a phone message seeking comment Thursday.\n\nRecords also show that a man named Jonathan Chau, who provided Adams' transition committee with $1,000 on December 9, 2021, gave $5,800 to a committee supporting Fung, and $2,900 to a committee backing Rep. Andrew Garbarino, a Long Island Republican. An email message seeking comment was sent to a Garbarino staffer.\n\nAlso as part of the case, Qin admitted to filing a false application for lawful permanent residency status in the U.S. in 2019 by falsely claiming he never used an alias, and fraudulently obtaining a Florida driver's license when he lived in New York.", "source": {"uri": "sandiegouniontribune.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Andrew Garbarino, (R-N.Y.), and Allan Fung, a Republican who ran for Congress in Rhode Island. None of the three politicians have been implicated in any wrongdoing in the case.\n\nWhen first questioned about Qin's guilty plea, Adams told reporters he'd \"met him before,\" but that he was one of \"the thousands upon thousands of people that I interacted with\" while on the campaign trail.\n\nA month later, the Daily News reported there was more to their connection than that -- Adams celebrated his 60th birthday party at Qin and his former model wife Emma Duo Liu's luxe Plaza penthouse.\n\nAlso in attendance at that party was Adams adviser Winnie Greco, whose Bronx homes were raided in March by the FBI. She hasn't been accused of wrongdoing.\n\nAt Thursday's sentencing of Qin, United States District Judge Joan Azrack ruled in favor of giving him time served, as he'd already been incarcerated since his arrest last October. As part of his plea, Qin also agreed to relinquishing his permanent resident status in the U.S. -- which he obtained illegally -- as well as his immediate deportation.\n\nIn addition to admitting to illegally reimbursing donors for their political contributions, Qin also fessed to filing a false application for legal resident status and fraudulently obtaining a Florida driver's license, despite not being a legal resident there.\n\nFederal prosecutors said in March that the campaigns targeted by Qin were unaware of his actions because he \"concealed\" his use of straw donors.\n\nThe Qin matter isn't he only straw donor case connected to Adams' political operation.\n\nThe federal prosecutor's office in Manhattan is probing ties between the Adams campaign and the Turkish government and whether the campaign benefited from illicit Turkish money. As part of that investigation, the FBI seized the mayor's electronic devices and raided the homes of top campaign fundraiser Brianna Suggs and City Hall adviser Rana Abbasova last November.\n\nIn another case, which involved Dwayne Montgomery, a former NYPD inspector and longtime friend of Adams, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg alleged that several defendants orchestrated a straw donor scheme to help Adams' campaign in the hopes that they'd benefit down the road.\n\nMontgomery pleaded guilty in that case to misdemeanor conspiracy and was sentenced in April to 200 hours of community service.\n\nAdams hasn't been accused of wrongdoing in any of the cases.", "source": {"uri": "nydailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Andrew Garbarino, (R-N.Y.), and Allan Fung, a Republican who ran for Congress in Rhode Island. None of the three politicians have been implicated in any wrongdoing in the case.\n\nWhen first questioned about Qin's guilty plea, Adams told reporters he'd \"met him before,\" but that he was one of \"the thousands upon thousands of people that I interacted with\" while on the campaign trail.\n\nA month later, the Daily News reported there was more to their connection than that -- Adams celebrated his 60th birthday party at Qin and his former model wife Emma Duo Liu's luxe Plaza penthouse.\n\nAlso in attendance at that party was Adams adviser Winnie Greco, whose Bronx homes were raided in March by the FBI. She hasn't been accused of wrongdoing.\n\nAt Thursday's sentencing of Qin, United States District Judge Joan Azrack ruled in favor of giving him time served, as he'd already been incarcerated since his arrest last October. As part of his plea, Qin also agreed to relinquishing his permanent resident status in the U.S. -- which he obtained illegally -- as well as his immediate deportation.\n\nIn addition to admitting to illegally reimbursing donors for their political contributions, Qin also fessed to filing a false application for legal resident status and fraudulently obtaining a Florida driver's license, despite not being a legal resident there.\n\nFederal prosecutors said in March that the campaigns targeted by Qin were unaware of his actions because he \"concealed\" his use of straw donors.\n\nThe Qin matter isn't he only straw donor case connected to Adams' political operation.\n\nThe federal prosecutor's office in Manhattan is probing ties between the Adams campaign and the Turkish government and whether the campaign benefited from illicit Turkish money. As part of that investigation, the FBI seized the mayor's electronic devices and raided the homes of top campaign fundraiser Brianna Suggs and City Hall adviser Rana Abbasova last November.\n\nIn another case, which involved Dwayne Montgomery, a former NYPD inspector and longtime friend of Adams, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg alleged that several defendants orchestrated a straw donor scheme to help Adams' campaign in the hopes that they'd benefit down the road.\n\nMontgomery pleaded guilty in that case to misdemeanor conspiracy and was sentenced in April to 200 hours of community service.\n\nAdams hasn't been accused of wrongdoing in any of the cases.", "source": {"uri": "nydailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

He faces immediate deportation.\n\n\u201cQin\u2019s brazen flouting of our political and immigration systems and his defrauding government agencies resulted in a felony conviction, prison sentence and today, his removal from the United States,\u201d said Breon Peace, US attorney for the Eastern District of New York, the federal court that heard the case.\n\n\u201cQin has learned a lesson in American civics the hard way, that no one is above the law.\u201d\n\nAs outlined in court documents and the plea proceeding, Qin, 56, agreed to reimburse other individuals who made US campaign contributions on his behalf in 2020 and 2021.\n\nThese were made to the campaign committees of a New York City-wide political office, a member of the United States House of Representatives for a congressional district in New York and a House of Representatives seat in a Rhode Island congressional district.\n\nFederal law prohibits foreign nationals from contributing to any federal, state or local election.\n\nThe court did not identify the recipients of Qin\u2019s donations.\n\nBut in March, citing a source, The New York Times reported they were New York City Mayor Eric Adams, Congressman Andrew Garbarino of Long Island, and Allan Fung, a former mayor of Cranston, Rhode Island, who ran for US Congress.\n\nIt is unclear whether the recipients knew the ultimate source of the funds they received.\n\nAdams previously denied knowledge of the straw-donor operation, although at a press conference in March the mayor said he had encountered Qin, calling him \u201cone of those people who I met while on the campaign trail\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, the intermediaries Qin used to channel the donations reportedly funnelled about US$11,600 to the campaigns on his behalf, which resulted in their filing false contribution reports with the Federal Election Commission in 2022.\n\nQin also admitted falsely swearing in US immigration documents that he had never used another name. The names he has employed, prosecutors said, included Hui Quin, Muk Lam Li and Karl.\n\nAccording to court documents, Qin received the Muk Lam Li alias from a Chinese government official in 2008.\n\nAnd over the next year, before applying for a US visa, he obtained a Hong Kong identification card, a Chinese identification card and a Hong Kong passport with the Li alias.\n\nThe documents contained Qin\u2019s photograph but a different birthday. Using the alias, Li reportedly then transferred more than US$5 million from China to a US bank account.\n\nPart of the sum was used to buy the luxury Plaza Hotel apartment in Manhattan where Qin lived.\n\nThe Chinese embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nHenry Mazurek, Qin\u2019s lawyer, said Thursday\u2019s outcome was bittersweet for his client.\n\n\u201cHe is pleased that the judge agreed to sentence him to time served, but is saddened to leave a country he admires,\u201d Mazurek said.\n\n\u201cI believe that today\u2019s result, including Mr Qin\u2019s self-deportation, is America\u2019s loss because he is a compassionate businessman and philanthropist.\u201d\n\nQin also pleaded guilty to fraudulently obtaining a Florida driving license under the name Hui Quin using a false Florida address and fake bank and credit card statements.\n\nA month before his arrest last year in the straw-donor case, police in New York\u2019s Nassau County arrested Qin on charges of attempting to attack his ex-wife.\n\nThe two were still living together at the time, and the arrest happened soon before she was due to testify in a civil case against him in Manhattan federal court.\n\nProsecutors in that case said Qin tried to break down a locked door with an axe. The incident reportedly transpired after an earlier attack on his ex-wife in which he had tried to strangle her.\n\nThe apparent effort to intimidate his ex-wife involved a lawsuit in Manhattan brought by a Chinese investment management group trying to enforce a US$450 million foreign arbitration award in China against Qin.\n\nIn that case, the tycoon allegedly transferred the ownership of his Long Island home to his ex-wife and ex-mother-in-law for only US$10 during the arbitration process in China, apparently in a bid to avoid the arbitration judgment.\n\nOfficials on Thursday voiced hope that Qin\u2019s sentence would serve as a warning.\n\n\u201cHui Qin violated our democratic norms by illegally attempting to influence election campaigns through fraudulent political donations,\u201d said James Smith, the assistant director-in-charge at the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s New York field office.\n\nThursday\u2019s developments \u201cshould dissuade any future schemers from engaging in similar activity\u201d, Smith added.\n\n\u201cThe FBI is committed to exposing all forms of corruption, especially those that threaten election integrity and our duly-elected officials.\u201d", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South China Morning Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qin_Hui",

He faces immediate deportation.\n\n\u201cQin\u2019s brazen flouting of our political and immigration systems and his defrauding government agencies resulted in a felony conviction, prison sentence and today, his removal from the United States,\u201d said Breon Peace, US attorney for the Eastern District of New York, the federal court that heard the case.\n\n\u201cQin has learned a lesson in American civics the hard way, that no one is above the law.\u201d\n\nAs outlined in court documents and the plea proceeding, Qin, 56, agreed to reimburse other individuals who made US campaign contributions on his behalf in 2020 and 2021.\n\nThese were made to the campaign committees of a New York City-wide political office, a member of the United States House of Representatives for a congressional district in New York and a House of Representatives seat in a Rhode Island congressional district.\n\nFederal law prohibits foreign nationals from contributing to any federal, state or local election.\n\nThe court did not identify the recipients of Qin\u2019s donations.\n\nBut in March, citing a source, The New York Times reported they were New York City Mayor Eric Adams, Congressman Andrew Garbarino of Long Island, and Allan Fung, a former mayor of Cranston, Rhode Island, who ran for US Congress.\n\nIt is unclear whether the recipients knew the ultimate source of the funds they received.\n\nAdams previously denied knowledge of the straw-donor operation, although at a press conference in March the mayor said he had encountered Qin, calling him \u201cone of those people who I met while on the campaign trail\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, the intermediaries Qin used to channel the donations reportedly funnelled about US$11,600 to the campaigns on his behalf, which resulted in their filing false contribution reports with the Federal Election Commission in 2022.\n\nQin also admitted falsely swearing in US immigration documents that he had never used another name. The names he has employed, prosecutors said, included Hui Quin, Muk Lam Li and Karl.\n\nAccording to court documents, Qin received the Muk Lam Li alias from a Chinese government official in 2008.\n\nAnd over the next year, before applying for a US visa, he obtained a Hong Kong identification card, a Chinese identification card and a Hong Kong passport with the Li alias.\n\nThe documents contained Qin\u2019s photograph but a different birthday. Using the alias, Li reportedly then transferred more than US$5 million from China to a US bank account.\n\nPart of the sum was used to buy the luxury Plaza Hotel apartment in Manhattan where Qin lived.\n\nThe Chinese embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nHenry Mazurek, Qin\u2019s lawyer, said Thursday\u2019s outcome was bittersweet for his client.\n\n\u201cHe is pleased that the judge agreed to sentence him to time served, but is saddened to leave a country he admires,\u201d Mazurek said.\n\n\u201cI believe that today\u2019s result, including Mr Qin\u2019s self-deportation, is America\u2019s loss because he is a compassionate businessman and philanthropist.\u201d\n\nQin also pleaded guilty to fraudulently obtaining a Florida driving license under the name Hui Quin using a false Florida address and fake bank and credit card statements.\n\nA month before his arrest last year in the straw-donor case, police in New York\u2019s Nassau County arrested Qin on charges of attempting to attack his ex-wife.\n\nThe two were still living together at the time, and the arrest happened soon before she was due to testify in a civil case against him in Manhattan federal court.\n\nProsecutors in that case said Qin tried to break down a locked door with an axe. The incident reportedly transpired after an earlier attack on his ex-wife in which he had tried to strangle her.\n\nThe apparent effort to intimidate his ex-wife involved a lawsuit in Manhattan brought by a Chinese investment management group trying to enforce a US$450 million foreign arbitration award in China against Qin.\n\nIn that case, the tycoon allegedly transferred the ownership of his Long Island home to his ex-wife and ex-mother-in-law for only US$10 during the arbitration process in China, apparently in a bid to avoid the arbitration judgment.\n\nOfficials on Thursday voiced hope that Qin\u2019s sentence would serve as a warning.\n\n\u201cHui Qin violated our democratic norms by illegally attempting to influence election campaigns through fraudulent political donations,\u201d said James Smith, the assistant director-in-charge at the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s New York field office.\n\nThursday\u2019s developments \u201cshould dissuade any future schemers from engaging in similar activity\u201d, Smith added.\n\n\u201cThe FBI is committed to exposing all forms of corruption, especially those that threaten election integrity and our duly-elected officials.\u201d", "source": {"uri": "scmp.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "South China Morning Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qin_Hui",

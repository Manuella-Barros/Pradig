I try to donate items to the nearest thrift store to give them another life. However, I\u2019ve learned this practice isn\u2019t as sustainable as I thought. According to CalRecycle, only 10-15% of donated clothes are resold. Most of the remaining clothes are either sent to landfills in California or overseas, wasting reusable material. The Responsible Textile Recovery Act addresses the need for a sustainable method of clothing disposal by establishing a textile recycling program, paid for by producers. This bill will help divert waste from landfills and reduce the fashion industry\u2019s environmental impact. The Responsible Textile Recovery Act is set to be voted on in the state Legislature. Join me in advocating for this bill by telling your state representative you support it. Radha Feist Berkeley", "summary": "\"According to CalRecycle, only 10-15%\u00a0of donated clothes are resold.

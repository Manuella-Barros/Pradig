The only players with more: Wayne Gretzky with 47 in 1985, Mario Lemieux with 44 in 1991 and Gretzky again with 43 in 1988.\n\nNobody has more in NHL history. McDavid has set up 34 goals so far in these playoffs, breaking the record of 31 assists that Gretzky set in 1988. Gretzky also had 30 assists in 1985.\n\nMcDavid had four points (1-3-4) in Game 4 against Florida, then did it again (2-2-4) in Game 5. He became the first player in Stanley Cup Final history with consecutive four-point games.\n\nEdmonton Oilers' Connor McDavid celebrates the team's win over the Florida Panthers in Game 4 of the NHL hockey Stanley Cup Final, Saturday, June 15, 2024, in Edmonton, Alberta. (Jason Franson/The Canadian Press via AP)\n\nEver.\n\nThe only player with three points in three consecutive games in the same title series is Oilers great (and now assistant coach) Paul Coffey, who did it in 1985. Montreal\u00b4s Newsy Lalonde is the only other player with such a streak, sort of: He had three points in three consecutive final games spanning the 1918 and 1919 seasons.\n\nNot only is McDavid the first with back-to-back four-point games in the Stanley Cup Final, he\u00b4s also the first with eight points in a two-game span of the same series.\n\nThere are seven players - Lemieux in 1991, Gretzky in 1988, Coffey in 1985, Gordie Howe and Ted Lindsay in 1955, Syl Apps in 1942 and Lalonde in 1919 - who had seven points in a two-game stretch of the final.\n\nThey\u00b4re all looking up at McDavid on that list now.\n\nMcDavid is the first player to have four different four-point games in a single Stanley Cup playoff season since the Oilers\u00b4 glory days of the 1980s.\n\nGretzky had six four-point games in the 1985 playoffs, while Coffey and Jari Kurri had four apiece that same year. Mark Messier had four such games in the 1988 playoffs.\n\nNobody had done it before, or since, until McDavid this year. And all five of those players did it in an Oilers sweater.\n\nMcDavid has a career-best 174 points in 99 games so far this season, the most by anyone in a single NHL season since Lemieux had 188 points in 1995-96.\n\nMcDavid had 173 points last season in 94 games. This will be the fourth consecutive season that he leads the NHL in points, factoring in both regular season and postseason contests.\n\nNobody has had that long a streak since - you guessed it - Gretzky, who was atop the total-season scoring list in nine consecutive seasons spanning 1979-80 (when he was tied with Marcel Dionne) through 1987-88.\n\nThe 174 points is tied for 14th most in a season; Mike Bossy had that many in 1981-82. The only players with more than 174 points are - again, you guessed it - Gretzky (who did it 10 times, with a career-best 255 points in 1984-85) and Lemieux (who did it three times, with a career-best 218 points in 1988-89).\n\nIt\u00b4s pretty simple: If McDavid gets a point, the Oilers are probably going to win.\n\nHe\u00b4s gotten at least one goal or assist in 82 games this season; the Oilers have won 59 of those games - a 72% rate.\n\nHe\u00b4s been held without a point in 17 games this season; the Oilers have won three of those games - an 18% rate.\n\nAP NHL playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://www.apnews.com/hub/NHL\n\nEdmonton Oilers' Connor McDavid (97) and Mattias Ekholm (14) skate a drill during practice in Edmonton on Thursday June 20, 2024.

The only players with more than 174 points are -- again, you guessed it -- Gretzky (who did it 10 times, with a career-best 255 points in 1984-85) and Lemieux (who did it three times, with a career-best 218 points in 1988-89).\n\nIt's pretty simple: If McDavid gets a point, the Oilers are probably going to win.\n\nHe's gotten at least one goal or assist in 82 games this season; the Oilers have won 59 of those games -- a 72% rate.\n\nHe's been held without a point in 17 games this season; the Oilers have won three of those games -- an 18% rate.", "source": {"uri": "apnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "AP NEWS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connor_McDavid", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Connor McDavid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Gretzky", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wayne Gretzky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Coffey", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paul Coffey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Lemieux", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mario Lemieux"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Assist (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsy_Lalonde", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newsy Lalonde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton_Oilers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton Oilers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syl_Apps", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Syl Apps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Lindsay", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ted Lindsay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordie_Howe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gordie Howe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Montreal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montreal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988\u201389_OHL_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "1988\u201389 OHL season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1981\u201382_OHL_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "1981\u201382 OHL season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Bossy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Bossy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Dionne", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marcel Dionne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jari_Kurri", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jari Kurri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Messier", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark Messier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockey_jersey", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hockey jersey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Murder-Mystery_and_Deduction", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Murder-Mystery and Deduction", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Spectrangle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Spectrangle", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/968fec6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3486x1961+0+204/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Ffa%2F98%2F13ca6f59193eb49adcb80d8392a2%2F2b776abb5d704b1d817042a39e43bff1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667640", "eventUri": "eng-9667640", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 214, "relevance": 1}

The result feels immaterial at this point -- especially since McDavid has willed the Oilers back into the series after dropping the first three games.\n\n\"He just puts us on his back,\" defenseman Mattias Ekholm said. \"The guy is the best in the world. There's just nothing else you can say about him.\"\n\nYup. All you need to do is look at the numbers.\n\nMcDavid has rewritten parts of the record book thanks to his play over the last two months. And he might not be done yet.\n\nHere are McDavid's 2024 playoff exploits, by the numbers.\n\nMove over Wayne Gretzky.\n\nMcDavid tied and passed The Great One as part of a three-assist, four-point effort in Game 4 -- an 8-1 Oilers win to keep their season alive. Gretzky had 31 helpers in 1988, the last of his four Stanley Cup titles in Edmonton.\n\n\"Obviously not the focus with where we're at (in the series),\" McDavid said after Game 4, \"but (it's) not lost on me what he means to the game.\"\n\nMcDavid added two more helpers, to go along with two goals, in a 5-3 victory in Game 5. He's just padding his stats now.\n\nYou probably had no problem doing the math in the previous section.\n\nMcDavid had matching four-point efforts in Games 4 and 5, the first time anyone has accomplished that feat in the championship series.\n\n\"He's been driving the bus since he got here -- before I got here,\" said winger Zach Hyman, a third-year Oiler. \"Since I've been here, he's the guy leading this team. You expect it from him.\n\n\"You don't want to put any extra pressure, but that's what he does. He elevates his game at the most opportune times for us. He's been great.\"\n\nIt's been a while since anyone else came close. You'd have to go back more than eight decades since anyone even notched seven points.\n\nThat seven-point club consists of Don Metz and Syl Apps (1942 Toronto Maple Leafs) -- part of the only NHL team to rebound from a 3-0 deficit in the Cup Final -- and Babe Dye (1922 Toronto St. Patricks).\n\nMetz and Apps had four games to rack up their point totals, whereas Dye had two like McDavid.\n\n\"What I'm most impressed about with him is the bigger the moment, the bigger performance he puts on,\" Ekholm said. \"We're on the brink of elimination, and he puts up four points two nights in a row. That's just him in a nutshell. He just wants to be the guy. He is the guy. To me, he's the best in the world.\"\n\nMcDavid has also tied Ken Linseman's Cup Final mark of five assists when facing elimination. Linseman accomplished that feat over two games with the 1980 Philadelphia Flyers.\n\nIt hasn't just been in the final when McDavid has stepped up with the Oilers on the ropes. They could have been knocked out of the playoffs by Vancouver in Games 6 and 7 and McDavid had three assists over those two games.\n\nAdd it all up and he has 11 points in four elimination games, tying him with Justin Williams and An\u017ee Kopitar from the Los Angeles Kings' 2014 Cup run and the New York Rangers' Mika Zibanejad from 2022. Williams and Kopitar played seven games and Zibanejad appeared in six.\n\nMcDavid became the first player among his peers to hit double digits for points in a Cup Final during Game 5. He then added an empty net goal with 19 seconds remaining to bump him up to 11 points.\n\nThat's the best output in the Stanley Cup Final since the Flyers' Daniel Briere recorded 12 points in 2010.\n\nMcDavid, 3-8-11, is just two assists and two points back of tying Gretzky for both categories in a single championship series. Gretzky had 10 assists and 13 points in 1988.\n\nThere are just two players ahead of McDavid here: Gretzky (twice) and Mario Lemieux. That's elite company.\n\n\"I seem to be getting this question a lot, which is a good thing,\" McDavid said after Game 5. \"Any time I'm compared or in the same realm as those two is a good thing.\n\n\"But I love playing in the playoffs. I love playing with this group and it's not possible without everybody.\"\n\nMcDavid needs one point to tie Gretzky from 1988 for third and two points to equal Lemieux from 1991.\n\nNo. 97 has an outside chance of matching or even surpassing Gretzky's top mark of 47 points from 1985.\n\nIn April, McDavid became the fourth player in NHL history to reach the century mark for assists in a single season -- joining Gretzky, Lemieux and Bobby Orr. Tampa Bay Lightning winger Nikita Kucherov matched him before the playoffs began.\n\nWith 34 assists, McDavid is seventh for assists in a season (regular season and playoffs). He passed Gretzky's 133 total from 1991, but The Great One still holds the top six places on the list.\n\nMcDavid's 174 points are one more than he had last season. He's tied with New York Islanders great Mike Bossy for 14th in one season, including playoffs.\n\nIt seems like forever ago now, but McDavid opened the playoffs with a five-assist performance against the Kings. No one had done that since Geoff Courtnall did it for the Oilers in 1998.\n\nMcDavid was one assist shy of tying the playoff record for helpers in a single game. Gretzky (1987 Oilers) and Mikko Leinonen (1982 New York Rangers) share the top spot.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Win or lose, this playoff run has been otherworldly from any angle.\n\nHey, congratulations to Edmonton. Sure, the Oilers may not win the Stanley Cup, though being down 3-2 in the final is better than being down 3-0, and Sergei Bobrovsky is suddenly a screen door rather than a wall. The Florida Panthers were by far the better team in Game 5 for extended stretches; they just made the critical mistake of not winning the NHL draft lottery in 2015, which frankly could have happened to anyone. The Panthers are still very capable of winning this series.\n\nBut win or lose, Edmonton deserves congratulations, because no matter what happens this year, Connor McDavid is an Oiler. He's under contract for another year and is extension eligible on July 1, and his former agent is running the organization, sooo ... anyway, raise a glass to Edmonton, you lucky buggers. I can admit that five years later, circumstances have proved me at least a little wrong.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nIt's an obvious statement, after all, but McDavid is a holy terror right now. You can prove it with the numbers, which aren't eye-popping because it's McDavid: He has 42 points in 23 playoff games this spring, behind only Wayne Gretzky's 47 in 1985, Mario Lemieux's 44 in 1991, and Gretzky's 43 in 1988. The Conn Smythe is inevitable, win or lose.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAdjusted for era, though, McDavid already has the highest-scoring post-season of all time, and only trails Gretzky in 1985 in adjusted points per game. McDavid has been on the ice for 53 of Edmonton's 80 goals for, and just 21 of 62 against. He has played 15 periods in the Stanley Cup final, and has 11 points.\n\nFor the record, Auston Matthews and Mitch Marner have produced 0.87 and 0.88 points per game in their playoff careers, or a little more combined than McDavid's 1.625, which only ranks behind Gretzky. Bit of a gap.\n\nEveryone looks up and sees a gap, though. Watching McDavid is incredible because even in the playoffs -- where hockey adds some prison rules, from checking to hitting to game planning -- he looks just like McDavid does all the time, but better. There was a moment on the fourth Oilers goal -- the winning goal, as it turned out -- where McDavid had been on the ice for an entire power play and was carrying the puck with speed, surrounded. He'd already slalomed past Eetu Luostarinen, and Kevin Stenlund was starting to edge over; defencemen Niko Mikkola and Dmitry Kulikov were in front of him. They were all looking at McDavid like he was a ticking bomb. For almost every hockey player ever, this wasn't a great place to be.\n\nBut McDavid wasn't locked in there with the Panthers; they were locked in there with him. Stenlund watched McDavid slice through both defencemen, and he kept watching until McDavid passed to Corey Perry, who had skated behind Stenlund and scored.\n\nMcDavid wasn't even doing his rocket skates routine. He was just playing in a slightly different, sped-up dimension, like he does all season long. It's like how Ken Hitchcock used to describe Sidney Crosby. Sid would look at a 10/90 play and see a 50/50 play.\n\n\"That was our tightest-checking game (with) what we got to what we gave up, that ratio,\" Panthers coach Paul Maurice told media Wednesday morning in Florida. \"We were as tight as we've been for a long time.\"\n\nFlorida was the better team, except. Leon Draisaitl is fifth all-time in points per game in the playoffs and only has two assists all series, both in the 8-1 laugher in Game 4. McDavid hasn't just dragged the Panthers back to Edmonton, he's dragged the Oilers back, too. It's unlikely McDavid can string together three four-point games in a row, but if you're the Panthers, you have to be wondering, right?\n\nMcDavid could have been a Leaf, of course. No complaints, time marches forward, but the Leafs were one lottery ball away from getting the local boy in the 2015 draft, and everything would have changed. McDavid would have been a Leaf instead of Marner, and the Leafs would have drafted someone other than Matthews in 2016: maybe Matthew Tkachuk, Clayton Keller, Mikhail Sergachev, someone. Matthews has a Hart and is the greatest goal scorer of his generation, but plug McDavid into a Toronto Core Four and they would have won some playoff series, boy. And maybe more.\n\nAh, but hockey history rhymes: Mario and Jaromir Jagr begat Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin, and Gretzky and Mark Messier begat McDavid and Leon Draisaitl, and McDavid is so brilliant he will win a Cup eventually, provided the Oilers don't totally screw it up. NHL transactions restarted Wednesday, because the league is playing so deep into June. It was almost like the NHL was trying to overshadow its best player's biggest game.\n\nBut even the league can't overshadow McDavid. He is simply one of the three or four greatest hockey players ever -- a thrilling, kinetic marvel, an avatar of impossibility who is still only 27 years old -- and Friday night he gets to play one more game with the season on the line. Congratulations, Edmonton. The rest of us get to watch him play, but he belongs to you.", "source": {"uri": "thestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Star"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bruce_arthur@thestar.com", "name": "Bruce

A look at his numbers and their historical significance:\n\nMcDavid is right there with the absolute greatest who have ever played, and a record that has stood for nearly 40 years is within his reach.\n\nMcDavid has 42 points so far in these playoffs. The only players with more: Wayne Gretzky with 47 in 1985, Mario Lemieux with 44 in 1991 and Gretzky again with 43 in 1988.\n\nAssists, one postseason\n\nNobody has more in NHL history. McDavid has set up 34 goals so far in these playoffs, breaking the record of 31 assists that Gretzky set in 1988. Gretzky also had 30 assists in 1985.\n\nBack-to-back\n\nMcDavid had four points (1-3-4) in Game 4 against Florida, then did it again (2-2-4) in Game 5. He became the first player in Stanley Cup Final history with consecutive four-point games.\n\nEver.\n\nThe only player with three points in three consecutive games in the same title series is Oilers great (and now assistant coach) Paul Coffey, who did it in 1985. Montreal's Newsy Lalonde is the only other player with such a streak, sort of: He had three points in three consecutive final games spanning the 1918 and 1919 seasons.\n\nMost points, 2-game span\n\nNot only is McDavid the first with back-to-back four-point games in the Stanley Cup Final, he's also the first with eight points in a two-game span of the same series.\n\nThere are seven players -- Lemieux in 1991, Gretzky in 1988, Coffey in 1985, Gordie Howe and Ted Lindsay in 1955, Syl Apps in 1942 and Lalonde in 1919 -- who had seven points in a two-game stretch of the final.\n\nMcDavid is the first player to have four different four-point games in a single Stanley Cup playoff season since the Oilers' glory days of the 1980s.\n\nGretzky had six four-point games in the 1985 playoffs, while Coffey and Jari Kurri had four apiece that same year. Mark Messier had four such games in the 1988 playoffs.\n\nNobody had done it before, or since, until McDavid this year. And all five of those players did it in an Oilers sweater.\n\nMost since Lemieux\n\nMcDavid has a career-best 174 points in 99 games so far this season, the most by anyone in a single NHL season since Lemieux had 188 points in 1995-96.\n\nMcDavid had 173 points last season in 94 games. This will be the fourth consecutive season that he leads the NHL in points, factoring in both regular season and postseason contests.\n\nNobody has had that long a streak since -- you guessed it -- Gretzky, who was atop the total-season scoring list in nine consecutive seasons spanning 1979-80 (when he was tied with Marcel Dionne) through 1987-88.\n\nThe 174 points is tied for 14th most in a season; Mike Bossy had that many in 1981-82. The only players with more than 174 points are -- again, you guessed it -- Gretzky (who did it 10 times, with a career-best 255 points in 1984-85) and Lemieux (who did it three times, with a career-best 218 points in 1988-89).\n\nHis impact\n\nIt's pretty simple: If McDavid gets a point, the Oilers are probably going to win.\n\nHe's gotten at least one goal or assist in 82 games this season; the Oilers have won 59 of those games -- a 72% rate.\n\nHe's been held without a point in 17 games this season; the Oilers have won three of those games -- an 18% rate.\n\n___\n\nAP NHL playoffs: https://apnews.com/hub/stanley-cup and https://www.apnews.com/hub/NHL", "source": {"uri": "winnipegfreepress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Winnipeg Free Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connor_McDavid", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Connor McDavid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Lemieux", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Mario Lemieux"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Gretzky", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wayne Gretzky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Assist (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Coffey", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paul Coffey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsy_Lalonde", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Newsy Lalonde"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton_Oilers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton Oilers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syl_Apps", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Syl Apps"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Lindsay", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ted Lindsay"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jari_Kurri", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jari Kurri"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordie_Howe", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gordie Howe"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Montreal"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Montreal"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988\u201389_OHL_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "1988\u201389 OHL season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1981\u201382_OHL_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "1981\u201382 OHL season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Bossy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Bossy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Dionne", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marcel Dionne"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Messier", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark Messier"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockey_jersey", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hockey jersey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Murder-Mystery_and_Deduction", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Murder-Mystery and Deduction", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Spectrangle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Spectrangle", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/11/fb-og-image.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667640", "eventUri": "eng-9667640", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 198, "relevance": 1}

Game 6 is Friday in Edmonton.\n\n\"I like playing in the playoffs,\" McDavid said. I love playing with this group. It was a fun ride and we were glad it would last another day. But that's all we've earned here: another day, another flight. Make sure you're ready to go to Edmonton on Friday.\n\nWith consecutive four-point performances, McDavid joined Wayne Gretzky in 1985 as the only players to have four or more in two games of a finals. His eight over this period is the most by a player in consecutive games for a team on the brink.\n\nConnor does Connor things, said linemate Zach Hyman, who scored his 15th goal of the playoffs with an assist from McDavid. That's what makes him special. He can take his game to the next level in the most important moment, the biggest reason why we have come this far. Weren't here without him. He continues to drive the bus.\n\nDrag 'em back to Alberta became the Oilers' rallying cry, started by McDavid after leading the way in avoiding a sweep and echoed by Connor Brown hours before the puck dropped in Sunrise. Brown, the other Connor, scored short-handed five minutes later after Stuart Skinner made a number of big saves over the first few shifts as the Panthers opened with a strong push in their second chance to win the cup.\n\nThat will have to wait thanks to Edmonton's power play that was 0 for the series at 5 on 4 and built the lead with goals from Hyman and Corey Perry, each assisted by McDavid.\n\nHe puts this team on his back, Perry said. When we stand against the wall, he puts us on his back and plays. You can see why he is the best player.\n\nRetired referee Kerry Fraser, who played in the finals 12 times during his long career, posted on social media: Connor McDavid reminds me of how Mark Messier could take over a play-off game and ultimately a series. Fraser was referring to Messier carrying the Oilers to the Cup in 1990, the franchise's last championship, which capped that dynasty's run of five in seven years.\n\nMcDavid now has 42 points on this run. Only Gretzky (twice) and Mario Lemieux have more in a single postseason. His 42nd into the empty net with 19 seconds left set off the Oilers' victory song, La Bamba, playing all over Edmonton.\n\nWe believe, said fan Trevor Savage after watching Game 5. We all knew it was possible. We knew Connor could lead us. We knew the team would be ready and were just excited about Game 6 at home.\n\nMcDavid didn't do the towing himself.\n\nBrown's goal marked the first time since the 1991 Pittsburgh Penguins (Mario Lemieux and Bob Errey) that Edmonton has scored short-handed in back-to-back games in the finals. And Skinner, whose play will be in the series seemed the greatest uncertaintystopped 29 of the 32 shots he faced.\n\nMeanwhile, the Oilers reached Sergei Bobrovsky again, three nights later chase him out of Game 4 an 8-1 defeat at halftime. Especially McDavid's goal Tuesday night from a tight angle, a soft one to give up by the goaltender everyone just calls Bob.\n\nA more shaky Bobrovsky when the series returns to Edmonton could set the stage for a comeback not seen in more than 80 years. The Oilers became only the third team in Cup Final history and the first since New Jersey in 2012 to fall behind 3-0 and win the next two games, and the only team to come all the way back to win it all was the Toronto Maple from 1942. Leaves.\n\nIt's been a crazy story all year, Hyman said. We must continue writing it. It doesn't make for a good story unless you finish it.", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

The Edmonton Oilers take on the Florida Panthers in game 6 of the NHL Stanley Cup final on Friday. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Jason FransonEDMONTON - Connor McDavid has spent his entire life pushing toward the biggest moment on hockey's biggest stage. The crisp winter nights on outdoor rinks. The countless hours inside arenas. The long bus rides. The training sessions in searing summer heat. The hours of skating, stickhandling, shooting. The grind has taken the Edmonton Oilers captain, blessed with good genes and an unparalleled work ethic, from youngster to prodigy to superstar. He now sits two wins from hoisting the Stanley Cup - and authoring an improbable, historic comeback. \"You think that when you're here it's going to be some magic feeling,\" McDavid said Thursday. \"You don't know what to expect. To be honest, it's all been pretty normal.\" McDavid, to be honest, has been anything but in what is turning into a best-of-seven masterpiece, grabbing hold of the title series in stunning fashion after his team went down 3-0 to the Florida Panthers. Edmonton's back pressed against the wall, the 27-year-old powered through with a four-point performance in an 8-1 walloping in Game 4 before again leaving his stamp with two goals and two assists as part of a 5-3 victory in Game 5 that dragged the Panthers back to the Alberta capital for Friday's Game 6. \"I don't think you can be exceptional at anything you do unless you absolutely love what you're doing,\" Oilers head coach Kris Knoblauch said. \"He loves playing hockey.\" McDavid's 42 points in these playoffs is a number bettered only by Wayne Gretzky and Mario Lemieux in a single post-season. His eight points in consecutive Cup games is a record. His output of 11 points through five contests in a final is a record. And he's two points back of Gretzky's high-water mark of 13 in a single championship round, which the Great One accomplished all the way back in 1988. \"A very competitive person,\" Knoblauch continued. \"He wants to win, wants to be the best. Between his love and passion, that just allows him to rise up and make those plays at significant times.\" Edmonton forward Corey Perry has seen plenty of leaders in a long career that included a Cup win back in 2007 with Anaheim. McDavid's style is similar - quiet, confident, all business. \"Everybody knows what he does on the ice,\" said the 39-year-old Perry. \"Tremendous, world-class player. He lets the play do his talking. It's not like he's in the room yelling and screaming and getting everybody going. \"(Hall of Fame defenceman) Scott Niedermayer was the exact same way.\" Perry was on the receiving end of a McDavid pass in Game 5 that came at the end of a long shift where the lightning-quick centre knifed through the Florida defence - a sequence that will live on highlight reels for generations if the Oilers finish the job. \"Those are some things that you just never forget,\" Perry said. \"He's put this team on his back and really led by example. \"Guy's on a mission and we're right there following with him.\" Edmonton goaltender Stuart Skinner, whose team is looking to become just the second in NHL history after the 1942 Toronto Maple Leafs to win a final after trailing 3-0, said McDavid's positive energy trickles down. \"Gives me a ton of confidence,\" Skinner said. \"Whether I let in five, whether I get a shutout, he's always in my corner.\" The Oilers pushed back time and again this season. They sat 32nd in the overall standings and went through a coaching change before going on a number of impressive runs, including a 16-game winning streak, to make the playoffs. Edmonton, which is hoping for a Game 7 on Tuesday in South Florida, then trailed the Vancouver Canucks three times in the second round and were down 2-1 to the Dallas Stars in the Western Conference final. A deep 3-0 hole against the Panthers that now stands at 3-2 is par for the Oilers' course. \"This has always been part of the plan for our group,\" McDavid said. \"To be in a position like this, playing big games at home in big moments.\" With rapper Snoop Dogg playing a Thursday show at Rogers Place, the Oilers' media availability was moved to a fifth-floor restaurant in another part of the sprawling arena complex. Plastered on the walls are quotes from Gretzky's career. Edmonton's No. 99 had plenty of big moments in this city. This iteration's No. 97 feels it's his team's time. \"Those things just happen,\" McDavid said. \"They're a byproduct of being prepared, all the work that we've done throughout the regular season, all the work that we've done through this run. Those moments are a product of guys who are ready for the big moment. \"There's no group that is more ready for the moment than this one.\" With a player penning a remarkable story leading the way.

You get here and expect there to be this magic feeling, but to be honest, it's all been pretty normal,\" he said on Thursday ahead of Game 6.\n\nMcDavid's performance in the playoffs has been anything but normal, even by the three-time NHL MVP's standards. Through Game 5 of the Stanley Cup Final, McDavid has:\n\n* Set a record for most assists in a single NHL postseason (34).\n\n* Posted the fourth-highest single postseason point total (42) of any player in NHL history, and trail's Wayne Gretzky's all-time record by five points.\n\n* Become the first player in NHL history to post back-to-back four-point games in the Stanley Cup Final, in Games 4 and 5.\n\n* Scored 11 points in the Final, two back of Gretzky's record of 13 points in 1988.\n\nAnd that's just a small sampling of his statistical achievements.\n\nMcDavid has rallied the Edmonton Oilers back from the brink, as they try to become the second team in NHL history after the 1942 Toronto Maple Leafs to win the Stanley Cup after starting a series down 3-0.\n\nCoach Kris Knoblauch said it's McDavid's dominance that's helped give his team the confidence to come back against the Florida Panthers.\n\n\"Sometimes you're in the dressing room and you're looking across at your leaders and you're not sure if they're ready to play. They're nervous or struggling, and it puts a lot of doubt in your team,\" he said. \"But when you look at Connor McDavid putting together back-to-back four-point games, that gives your team a lot of confidence. Your best players do that. When they're ready to play, you're like, 'alright, we're going to be OK.' I just gives confidence throughout the dressing room.\"\n\nGoalie Stuart Skinner said that self-assurance extends off the ice.\n\n\"He's got so much confidence in us. For me, personally, he gives me a ton of confidence whether I let in 5 [goals] or I get a shutout, he's always in my corner. He always has my back and telling me that he believes in me,\" said Skinner, before grinning. \"Plus, he always lets me win on the plane when we play games.\"\n\nMcDavid is now the favorite to win the Conn Smythe Trophy for playoff MVP, even though his team is not favored to win the Stanley Cup Final. But for the Oilers captain, the mission isn't about breaking records or making iconic moments.\n\n\"I don't think you're thinking about that. Those things just happen. They're a byproduct of being prepared, all the work that we've done throughout the regular season, all the work that we've done through this run,\" he said. \"Those moments are a product of guys who are ready for the big moment. There's no group that is more ready for the moment than this one here.\"\n\nGame 6 of the Stanley Cup Final is Friday night in Edmonton.", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "greg_wyshynski@espn.com", "name": "Greg Wyshynski", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connor_McDavid", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Connor McDavid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Hockey League"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Gretzky", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wayne Gretzky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hart_Memorial_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Hart Memorial Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto_Maple_Leafs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Toronto Maple Leafs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton_Oilers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton Oilers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conn_Smythe_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conn Smythe Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goaltender", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Goaltender"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Captain (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutout", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Shutout"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Recreation", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Recreation", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Play_Groups/Europe", "label": "dmoz/Games/Play Groups/Europe", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Paper_and_Pencil", "label": "dmoz/Games/Paper and Pencil", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://a1.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0619%2Fr1347633_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667640", "eventUri": "eng-9667640", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 177, "relevance": 1}

The countless hours inside arenas. The long bus rides. The training sessions in searing summer heat. The hours of skating, stickhandling, shooting.\n\nThe grind has taken the Edmonton Oilers captain, blessed with good genes and an unparalleled work ethic, from youngster to prodigy to superstar.\n\nHe now sits two wins from hoisting the Stanley Cup -- and authoring an improbable, historic comeback.\n\n\"You think that when you're here it's going to be some magic feeling,\" McDavid said Thursday. \"You don't know what to expect. To be honest, it's all been pretty normal.\"\n\nMcDavid, to be honest, has been anything but in what is turning into a best-of-seven masterpiece, grabbing hold of the title series in stunning fashion after his team went down 3-0 to the Florida Panthers.\n\nEdmonton's back pressed against the wall, the 27-year-old powered through with a four-point performance in an 8-1 walloping in Game 4 before again leaving his stamp with two goals and two assists as part of a 5-3 victory in Game 5 that dragged the Panthers back to the Alberta capital for Friday's Game 6.\n\n\"I don't think you can be exceptional at anything you do unless you absolutely love what you're doing,\" Oilers head coach Kris Knoblauch said.\n\n\"He loves playing hockey.\"\n\nMcDavid's 42 points in these playoffs is a number bettered only by Wayne Gretzky and Mario Lemieux in a single post-season. His eight points in consecutive Cup games is a record. His output of 11 points through five contests in a final is a record.\n\nAnd he's two points back of Gretzky's high-water mark of 13 in a single championship round, which the Great One accomplished all the way back in 1988.\n\n\"A very competitive person,\" Knoblauch continued. \"He wants to win, wants to be the best. Between his love and passion, that just allows him to rise up and make those plays at significant times.\"\n\nEdmonton forward Corey Perry has seen plenty of leaders in a long career that included a Cup win back in 2007 with Anaheim.\n\nMcDavid's style is similar -- quiet, confident, all business.\n\n\"Everybody knows what he does on the ice,\" said the 39-year-old Perry. \"Tremendous, world-class player. He lets the play do his talking. It's not like he's in the room yelling and screaming and getting everybody going.\n\n\"(Hall of Fame defenceman) Scott Niedermayer was the exact same way.\"\n\nPerry was on the receiving end of a McDavid pass in Game 5 that came at the end of a long shift where the lightning-quick centre knifed through the Florida defence -- a sequence that will live on highlight reels for generations if the Oilers finish the job.\n\n\"Those are some things that you just never forget,\" Perry said. \"He's put this team on his back and really led by example.\n\n\"Guy's on a mission and we're right there following with him.\"\n\nEdmonton goaltender Stuart Skinner, whose team is looking to become just the second in NHL history after the 1942 Toronto Maple Leafs to win a final after trailing 3-0, said McDavid's positive energy trickles down.\n\n\"Gives me a ton of confidence,\" Skinner said. \"Whether I let in five, whether I get a shutout, he's always in my corner.\"\n\nThe Oilers pushed back time and again this season.\n\nThey sat 32nd in the overall standings and went through a coaching change before going on a number of impressive runs, including a 16-game winning streak, to make the playoffs.\n\nEdmonton, which is hoping for a Game 7 on Tuesday in South Florida, then trailed the Vancouver Canucks three times in the second round and were down 2-1 to the Dallas Stars in the Western Conference final.\n\nA deep 3-0 hole against the Panthers that now stands at 3-2 is par for the Oilers' course.\n\n\"This has always been part of the plan for our group,\" McDavid said. \"To be in a position like this, playing big games at home in big moments.\"\n\nWith rapper Snoop Dogg playing a Thursday show at Rogers Place, the Oilers' media availability was moved to a fifth-floor restaurant in another part of the sprawling arena complex.\n\nPlastered on the walls are quotes from Gretzky's career.\n\nEdmonton's No. 99 had plenty of big moments in this city. This iteration's No. 97 feels it's his team's time.\n\n\"Those things just happen,\" McDavid said. \"They're a byproduct of being prepared, all the work that we've done throughout the regular season, all the work that we've done through this run.

His output of 11 points through five contests in a final is a record.", "source": {"uri": "nationalpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "National Post"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connor_McDavid", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Connor McDavid"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_Panthers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Florida Panthers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Cup", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stanley Cup"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonton", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Edmonton"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kris_Knoblauch", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kris Knoblauch"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Lemieux", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mario Lemieux"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Gretzky", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wayne Gretzky"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(ice_hockey)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (ice hockey)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberta", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alberta"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Alberta"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Canada"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Downloads", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Downloads", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Computer_Platforms", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Computer Platforms", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Historical", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Historical", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://smartcdn.gprod.postmedia.digital/nationalpost/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/edm115-the-canadian-press.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9667640", "eventUri": "eng-9667640", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 159, "relevance": 1}

Connor McDavid has led Edmonton's resurgence, recording consecutive four-point games as the Oilers defeated Florida 8-1 at Rogers Place on Saturday (June 15) and 5-3 at Amerant Bank Arena on Tuesday (June 18).\n\nRelated: McDavid Sets 5 Records as Oilers Score 5 Goals in Game 5 Win\n\nEdmonton's captain has played sublime in the last two games, setting numerous records including the most points while facing elimination in an NHL championship series. McDavid now leads all players in the 2024 Stanley Cup Playoffs with 42 points, the fourth most ever in a single NHL postseason.\n\nSince being drafted first overall by the Oilers in 2015, McDavid has spent nine years trying to reach the championship round, and now that he's here, the five-time Art Ross Trophy winner has taken his game to a level that hockey fans didn't even know existed.\n\nThat, however, can't be said of the other half of Edmonton's dynamic duo, the Batman to McDavid's Superman, 28-year-old centre Leon Draisaitl.\n\nFrom Day 1, Draisaitl has been right next to McDavid. He's gone through all the trials and tribulations that McDavid has endured. He's won all the honours and awards that McDavid has received. He's been widely acknowledged as one half of the best duos ever in hockey, and heard the whispers that they couldn't carry the Oilers to a championship.\n\nAfter a decade in the NHL, Draisaitl is also playing in his first Stanley Cup Final. But unlike McDavid, he has been a non-factor on the NHL's grandest stage. He has zero goals and two assists in five games against the Panthers, with both points coming in Edmonton's Game 4 blowout victory. In 22:19 of ice time on Tuesday, he was held pointless, had no hits, managed just one shot on goal, and went 8-for-20 in the face-off circle.\n\nThe five-time NHL All-Star, who has tallied at a rate of virtually 50 goals per 82 games over the past six regular seasons, hasn't scored a goal in three weeks. He's got just six points since the start of the Western Conference Final.\n\nWhat makes Draisaitl's disappearance most conspicuous is how brilliantly he performed in the opening two rounds of the postseason, during which he led the league in points. He had at least one point in Edmonton's first 13 games of the 2024 NHL Playoffs, tied for the fifth-longest point streak from the start of a postseason in NHL history.\n\nIn Edmonton's 4-1 victory over the Los Angeles Kings in Round 1, Draisaitl had five goals, five assists, 23 shots, and was a tremendous 62/108 on face-offs. He even blocked nine shots in five games against the Kings, second most among all NHL forwards in the playoffs' opening round.\n\nAgainst the Vancouver Canucks in the second round, Draisaitl racked up 14 points as the Oilers rallied from trailing in the series on three separate occasions (1-0, 2-1, and 3-2) to ultimately prevail in seven games.\n\nMany have speculated that Draisaitl is playing hurt. He hasn't said nor have the Oilers reported anything to that effect, but nobody is going to reveal anything about injuries at this time of year.\n\nThere was the situation in Game 1 of Round 2 when Draisaitl missed most of the second period and appeared to be in pain when he returned to play in the third period, but Oilers coach Kris Knoblauch chalked that up to \"cramping and equipment issues\", and Draisaitl went on have a spectacular series, appearing no worse for wear.\n\nThen there's that splint that Draisaitl has been spotted wearing on his finger, which might explain why the player with one of the best one-timers in the league suddenly seems unable to raise the puck with any regularity.\n\nIt is possible, too, that Draisaitl is just in a slump. That wouldn't be entirely unheard of. He had a stretch of 15 games early in Edmonton's 2023-24 schedule where he scored just twice, and has a streak of seven games without a goal in each of the last two regular seasons.\n\nHe also failed to score a goal in the Oilers' final seven games of the 2022 Playoffs, when they advanced to the Western Conference Final. But that was while playing with a high ankle sprain. So he has persevered through postseason pain before.\n\nIt would have been a shame if Edmonton had finally reached this point, only to be unceremoniously swept aside without getting any contributions from Draisaitl. But now the Oilers have life, and he has a chance to write a different ending to what would have been a very disappointing story, by performing like the superhero he's shown himself to be so often over the last several seasons.\n\nEven with McDavid in full-on Man of Steel mode, it's hard to see the Oilers winning two more games against a great Florida team if they don't get at least one big night from the other half of their dynamic duo.

In the playoffs (that's tough to do), especially.\"\n\nWhile McDavid has long since earned the respect of his peers for his unmatched speed and elite offensive instincts, he's shown them something extra during his first run to the Cup Final.\n\nHe led the charge in Edmonton's Game 4 and 5 victories over the Panthers and became the first player in NHL history with eight points in a two-game stretch during the championship series.\n\n\"I think the coolest thing I admire is how calm he's stayed down 3-0,\" Colorado Avalanche star Nathan MacKinnon said. \"No panic in his game, and he's taken it to another level. Very even keel and (showing) amazing leadership for his team.\"\n\n\"He's a very special and fun player to watch -- especially the past few games, where he's elevated his game and driven his team to two wins with their backs against the wall,\" added Avalanche defenseman Cale Makar, who won a Cup alongside MacKinnon in 2022.\n\nSteven Stamkos says he isn't the least bit surprised by a spring where McDavid has registered 42 points and put himself within striking distance of Wayne's Gretzky's all-time record of 47.\n\nThey were among a group of NHLers that trained together north of Toronto last summer and spent a considerable amount of time in each other's company, on the ice and off it.\n\n\"He even approached me to have conversations about my experiences when we won the Cup and what it took and things of that nature,\" said Stamkos, a two-time champion with the Tampa Bay Lighting. \"He is all about winning and the passion and drive to be the best to help his team win a Cup. It's so impressive how competitive he is in every aspect. He always wants to win -- in the gym, or scrimmages, or games.\n\n\"If there is a player to will his team back from a 0-3 hole, it's him!\"\n\nThe Oilers are vying to become just the second team in NHL history to accomplish that feat in the Stanley Cup Final, following the 1942 Toronto Maple Leafs.\n\nMcDavid naturally draws most of his praise for his incredible offensive output -- he's had multi-point outings in seven of 11 games dating back to the start of the Western Conference final -- but he's also playing more than 23 minutes per night during these playoffs and helped Edmonton tilt the ice considerably during his five-on-five minutes.\n\n\"What he is doing is refusing to lose,\" said former Anaheim Ducks captain Ryan Getzlaf, who won a Stanley Cup and two Olympic gold medals during his playing career. \"He is blocking shots and doing whatever it takes to win. Watching him in years past I'm not sure you would have seen him do everything it takes to win the Cup, and we are seeing that he has learned and grown into someone who is ready to do it.\"\n\nLast year's Conn Smythe winner, Jonathan Marchessault, was leaning toward Aleksander Barkov last week for his playoff MVP pick when the Panthers were up 3-0 in the series. But like so many, Marchessault has been wowed by McDavid's consecutive four-point outings to help the Oilers stay alive.\n\n\"It's pretty hard not to go with Connor now,\" Marchessault told The Athletic over the phone Wednesday night. \"What he's doing right now is just unbelievable. He has so many points. He's a factor so many times when he's on the ice. As much as people say, 'Let's hit him or get him,' you can't. He's too fast. He's too agile. You can't touch him. He's unbelievable.\n\n\"And he's not doing it against San Jose in December,\" Marchessault added. \"He's doing it in June with the best two teams in the Cup Final. He's doing it every night. And now he's giving his team a chance to come back. Obviously, they don't have a lot of leeway left, but they're giving themselves a chance.\"\n\nSo impressed is the Vegas Golden Knights forward with what he's seen from McDavid that he believes No. 97 has set himself apart among the all-time greats.\n\n\"I wasn't around for the other eras of the NHL, but he has to be the most dominant player to have ever played the game,\" Marchessault said. \"The game is so fast now, and the way he reacts is unbelievable. Yeah, I think win or lose, Connor should be the guy to get it.\"", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The New York Times"}, "authors": [{"uri": "pierre_lebrun@nytimes.com",

The Italian government on Sunday welcomed Libya's decision to bar foreign vessels from a stretch of water off its coast, as both countries struggle with a migrant crisis that has engulfed Europe in recent years.\n\nThe comments from Italian Foreign Minister Angelino Alfano came as a second non-governmental organisation announced it was suspending operations in the area in response to the Libyan move.\n\nThe Libyan government \"is ready to put in place a search and rescue zone in its waters, work with Europe and invest in its coastguards,\" Alfano told La Stampa daily on Sunday.\n\n\"This sends a signal that the balance is being restored in the Mediterranean.\"\n\nLibya's navy last week ordered foreign vessels to stay out of a coastal \"search and rescue zone\" for migrants headed for Europe, saying the measure was aimed at non-governmental organisations it accuses of facilitating illegal migration.\n\nSix years since a revolution that toppled longtime dictator Moamer Kadhafi, Libya has become a key departure point for migrants risking their lives to cross the Mediterranean to Europe.\n\nTens of thousands of migrants have resorted to paying people traffickers for the journey, often on overcrowded and unseaworthy boats, and charities have dispatched ships to rescue them from drowning.\n\n'Significant investment'\n\nMeanwhile, Libya and Italy -- where the vast majority of migrants land -- have worked together to stem the flow, with Italy also moving to rein in NGOs helping the multinational rescue operations by making them sign up to a new code of conduct.\n\n\"We need a significant, I repeat a significant European economic investment in Libya and in Africa,\" Alfano said.\n\n\"Europe has to decide if the theme of migration flows is an absolute priority on the same scale as the economy. For us, it is\".\n\nThe Libyan measure prompted the German aid group Sea Eye to announce on Sunday it is suspending its migrant rescue operations in the Mediterranean, citing security concerns.\n\nSea Eye said in a statement that it was with \"a heavy heart\" that it made its decision, after the Libyan government's \"explicit threat against the private NGOs\".\n\n\"Under these circumstances, a continuation of our rescue work is not currently possible.

Hundreds of thousands have made dangerous journeys across Africa and the Mediterranean heading towards Italy, fleeing war, persecution and poverty.\n\nBut earlier this week, Libya announced that it was establishing a \"search and rescue\" zone off its coast, ordering vessels belonging to non-governmental organizations to stay out. Libyan authorities accuse charities of inadvertently aiding human trafficking with their rescue at sea missions, hampering efforts to crack down on the illegal migration route.\n\nItaly takes charge of illegal immigration\n\nThe Italian Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre reacted by warning NGOs that their employees working in the international waters off Libya were at risk. Italy, which has had to bear the brunt of Europe's migrant crisis this year, has also introduced a new code of conduct, to which NGOs engaged in such rescue operations have to adhere.\n\nItaly last month approved its own naval mission in Libyan waters, with designs to deploy a large vessel and several smaller ships to stop migrant boats from reaching the mainland. The refugees it manages to intercept will be taken back to Libya.\n\nHowever, human rights organizations allege that migrants sent back to Libya often face torture, slave labor and sexual violence.\n\n\"European states and Libyan authorities are jointly implementing a blockade on the ability of people to seek safety.

decided to suspend its search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean following threats from the Libyan coastguard.\n\nMSF said on Saturday that it would withdraw the Prudence search and rescue ship which has been instrumental in saving the lives of asylum seekers trying to reach Europe by crossing the Mediterranean.\n\nIt's decision follows the announcement that Libyan authorities plans to restrict the access of humanitarian vessels in international waters off the coast of Libya.\n\nThe Italian Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre in Rome has warned MSF of the security risk to their staff following public threats from the Libyan Coast Guard against humanitarian search and rescue vessels operating in nearby international waters.\n\n\"If these declarations are confirmed and the orders are implemented we see two grave consequences - there will be more deaths at sea and more people trapped in Libya,\" said Annemarie Loof, MSF's operational manager.\n\n\"If humanitarian ships are pushed out of the Mediterranean, there will be fewer ships in the area to rescue people from drowning.\n\n\"Those who will not drown will be intercepted and brought back to Libya, which we know is a place of lawlessness, arbitrary detention and extreme violence.\"\n\nLast week the Italian Navy announced that it would be deployed inside Libyan waters to help increase the capacity of Libyan coastguard to intercept migrant and refugees and send them back to Libya.\n\nHowever, MSF is calling on the Libyan authorities to respect their \"legal obligation\" to rescue vessels in distress, both in international and Libyan waters.\n\nA total of 96,853 asylum seekers have arrived in Italy by crossing the Mediterranean so far this year, according to the most up-to-date statistics from the UN Refugee Agency.\n\nThe vast majority of these people set sail from Libya where there have been reports of severe human rights abuses and torture in detention centres. So far in 2017, a total of 118,523 men, women and children have crossed the sea to reach Spain, Italy, Greece and Cyprus.\n\nLast month, an Irish doctor working with MSF in the Mediterranean called on Irish naval vessels carrying out search and rescue operations not to support efforts to return refugees and migrants to these Libyan detention centres.\n\nSpeaking at an Oireachtas committee hearing in July, Dr Conor Kenny spoke of the torture and hard labour endured by refugees and migrants stuck in Libya.\n\n\"They often speak about the abuse they have suffered at the hands of smugglers, armed groups and private individuals.\n\n\"Many tell us stories of how they were bought and sold as a commodity. It appears to be a place of extreme danger with no rule of law,\" said Dr Kenny.\n\n\"Ireland needs to know that returning people to Libya is simply not an option.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Italy has expressed fears that charity rescue boats are facilitating people smuggling and has proposed a code of conduct governing how they operate. Some groups, including MSF, have refused to sign the code.\n\nThey object to a requirement that Italian police officers be on their boats and that the boats must take migrants to a safe port themselves, rather than transferring them to other vessels to allow smaller boats to stay in the area for further rescues.\n\nMSF operates one rescue ship in the Mediterranean, the Vox Prudence, currently docked in the Sicilian port of Catania.\n\nThe charity will continue its collaboration with another aid group, SOS Mediterranee, which operates a rescue ship in the Mediterranean with MSF doctors on board.", "time": "09:04:00"}

I have informed our crews and skippers of this decision. The reason for this is the changed security situation in the Western Mediterranean, after the Libyan government announced an indefinite and unilateral extension of their territorial waters -- in connection with an explicit threat against the private NGOs,\" Michael Buschheuer, the founder of the organization, was quoted as saying in its statement.\n\n\u00a9 REUTERS/ Ismail ZitounyMSF Proposes Way to End Refugees' Life-Threatening Boat Trips to EuropeEarlier in August, the Italian parliament approved conducting a joint naval operation with the Libyan coastguard to prevent migrants' boats from leaving the country.\n\n\"Under these circumstances, a continuation of our rescue work is not currently possible. It would be irresponsible towards our crews,\" Buschheuer said in the statement, adding that the organization intends to analyze the security situation and discuss future actions.\n\nThe route from Libya to Italy is the most popular among irregular migrants. According to UN data, over 95,000 migrants and refugees arrived in Italy by sea in 2017, while more than 2,350 refugees died in the sea.", "time": "14:25:00"}

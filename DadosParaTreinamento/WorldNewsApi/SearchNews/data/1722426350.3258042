Over the years, the social media ecosystem has expanded exponentially, with the emergence of iconic platforms such as Facebook, LinkedIn, MySpace, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, WhatsApp, Snapchat, TikTok, and more. Today, social media has become an integral part of people's lives in India, with the country having a rapidly growing user base. According to Global Statistics, Indians spend an average of 2.36 hours on social media daily. While social media platforms have faced increased scrutiny over issues like data privacy and misinformation, World Social Media Day serves as a reminder to reflect on the positive aspects of these digital spaces and strive for a balanced, responsible approach to their use.", "summary": "", "url": "https://indianexpress.com/article/trending/world-social-media-day-2024-date-history-significance-theme-9420606/", "image": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/06/World-Social-Media-Day-was-established-in-2010-by-Mashable-a-global-media-and-tec-Source_-Freepik.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-29 05:30:40", "author": "Express Web Desk", "authors": ["Express Web Desk"], "language": "en", "source_country": "in", "sentiment": 0.463}

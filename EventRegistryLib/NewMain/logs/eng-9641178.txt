He was embraced by GOP lawmakers who find themselves newly energized by his bid to retake the White House.\n\nDespite pending federal charges against Trump for conspiring to overturn the 2020 election, and his recent guilty verdict in an unrelated hush money trial, the Republican former president arrived emboldened as the party's presumptive nominee. He has successfully purged the GOP of critics, silenced most skeptics and enticed once-critical lawmakers aboard his MAGA-fueled campaign.\n\nA packed room of House Republicans sang \"Happy Birthday\" to Trump in a private breakfast meeting at GOP campaign headquarters across the street from the Capitol. The lawmakers gave him a baseball and bat from the annual congressional game. Trump bragged that even his telephone rallies for lawmakers could draw bigger crowds than mega-popstar Taylor Swift, who has yet to make any endorsement.\n\n\"There's tremendous unity in the Republican Party,\" Trump said in brief remarks later at Senate GOP headquarters.\n\nTrump spent about an hour each with House and Senate Republicans delivering free-wheeling remarks, fielding questions and discussing issues -- including Russia and immigration, tax cuts and other priorities for a potential second term.\n\nDuring the morning session, Trump said he thinks House Speaker Mike Johnson is doing a \"terrific job,\" according to a Republican in the private breakfast meeting and granted anonymity to discuss it. Trump asked Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the speaker's chief Republican critic, if she was being \"nice\" to Johnson, another Republican said.\n\n\"President Trump brought an extraordinary amount of energy, excitement and enthusiasm this morning,\" Johnson said afterward, noting high fund-raising tallies since the guilty verdict. \"We're feeling good.\"\n\nThe Republican speaker had demurred earlier over whether he's asked Trump to respect the peaceful transfer of presidential power and commit to not doing another Jan. 6. \"Of course he respects that, we all do, and we've all talked about it, ad nauseum.\"\n\nThursday afternoon offered the first encounter in years between Trump and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, who once blamed Trump for the \"disgraceful\" attack that he called an \"insurrection\" but now endorses the party's presumptive nominee.\n\nMcConnell said Trump received standing ovations from the senators and the two \"had a really positive meeting.\" The senator said, \"He and I got a chance to talk a little bit, shook hands a few times.\"\n\nMany potential priorities for a new White House administration are being formulated by a constellation of outside groups, including Project 2025, laying the groundwork for executive and legislative actions, though Trump has made clear he has his own agenda.\n\nOn one major controversial issue, Trump told lawmakers that abortion rules should be left to the states and said he supported exceptions for rape, incest and to save the life of the mother, lawmakers said.\n\n\"Anybody who thought that this president was going to be down after the sham trial. it's only giving him even more energy,\" said Rep. Tom Emmer, the GOP whip. \"Donald Trump is crushing this election.\"\n\nBut Trump's private meetings with House and Senate Republicans so close to the Capitol were infused with the symbolism of his return as the U.S. president who threatened the American tradition of the peaceful transfer of power.\n\n\"It's frustrating,\" said former U.S. Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn, who made his own unsuccessful run for Congress as a Maryland Democrat in the aftermath of Jan. 6, the day when police engaged in hand-to-hand fighting to stop Trump supporters who stormed the building in an effort to overturn President Joe Biden's election.\n\nDunn spoke of the \"irony\" of Trump returning to the area and lawmakers now embracing him. \"It just shows the lack of backbone they have when they're truly putting party and person over country,\" he said. \"And it's sad.\"\n\nBiden was overseas Thursday attending a summit of the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations, but the president's campaign unveiled a new ad blaming Trump for lighting the \"fire\" of Jan. 6 and threatening democracy.\n\nMany of those who once stood up to Trump are long gone from office and the Republicans who remain seem increasingly enthusiastic about the possibility of him retaking the White House, and the down-ballot windfall that could mean for their own GOP majorities in Congress.\n\nSen. John Thune, the GOP whip who is vying to replace McConnell as leader, told The Associated Press that he was interested in hearing from Trump about the fall election. \"I think there's an opportunity there to really make this a big win,\" he said.\n\nAs democracies around the world come under threat from a far-rightward shift, some analysts warn that the U.S. system, once seemingly immune from authoritarian impulses, is at risk of populist and extremist forces like those that Trump inspired to sack the Capitol.\n\n\"This is just another example of House Republicans bending the knee to Donald Trump,\" said Rep. Pete Aguilar of California, the chairman of the House Democratic caucus.\n\nMaking Jan. 6 a cornerstone of his reelection campaign, Trump celebrates those who stormed the Capitol as \"warriors\" and \"patriots,\" and he has vowed to pardon any number of the more than 1,300 convicted of crimes for the assault on the seat of U.S. democracy.\n\nMoreover, Trump has vowed to seek retribution by ousting officials at the U.S. Justice Department, which is prosecuting him in a four-count indictment to overturn the election ahead of the Jan. 6 attack and another case over storing classified documents at his Mar-A-Largo home.\n\nRepublicans, particularly in the House but increasingly in the Senate, are vigorously following his lead, complaining of an unfair justice system. Alongside Trump, the House and Senate GOP campaign arms scored some of their highest fundraising periods yet after a jury found him guilty in the New York hush money case.\n\nWhen former GOP Speaker Paul Ryan on Fox News reiterated this week that he wouldn't be voting for Trump and wished Republicans had another choice for president, he was immediately ostracized by Trump allies.\n\n\"Paul Ryan, you're a piece of garbage,\" said Rep. Troy Nehls, R-Texas. \"We should kick you out of the party.\"\n\nOf the Republicans who voted to impeach Trump over Jan. 6 and convict him on the charge of inciting the insurrection, only a few remain in office.\n\nSen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, had not been expected to attend Thursday's closed-door session with Trump. But Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, had a change of plans and was to join.\n\nAlso Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said he would likely join the Trump meeting, expecting \"he's going to be the next president, so you have to work\" together.\n\nAsked if he was concerned about the direction of the Trump Republican Party, Cassidy said: \"Let the day's own troubles be sufficient for the day. You can fill yourself up with anxiety about tomorrow, but will it change a thing? No.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Jill Colvin, Farnoush Amiri and Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "rocketcitynow.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

He has successfully purged the GOP of critics, silenced most skeptics and enticed once-critical lawmakers aboard his MAGA-fueled campaign.\n\nA packed room of House Republicans sang \"Happy Birthday\" to Trump in a private breakfast meeting at GOP campaign headquarters across the street from the Capitol. The lawmakers gave him a baseball and bat from the annual congressional game, and senators later presented an American flag cake with \"45\" candles -- and then \"47\" -- referring to the next presidency. Trump bragged that even his telephone rallies for lawmakers could draw bigger crowds than mega-popstar Taylor Swift, who has yet to make any endorsement.\n\nIn one remarkable moment, Trump and his most prominent Republican critic, Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell, shook hands, and fist-bumped.\n\n\"There's tremendous unity in the Republican Party,\" Trump said in brief remarks at Senate GOP headquarters.\n\nTrump spent about an hour each with House and Senate Republicans delivering free-wheeling remarks, fielding questions and discussing issues -- including Russia and immigration, tax cuts and other priorities for a potential second term.\n\nDuring the morning session, Trump said he thinks House Speaker Mike Johnson is doing a \"terrific job,\" according to a Republican in the private meeting and granted anonymity to discuss it. Trump asked Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the speaker's chief Republican critic, if she was being \"nice\" to Johnson, another Republican said.\n\n\"President Trump brought an extraordinary amount of energy, excitement and enthusiasm this morning,\" Johnson said afterward, noting high fund-raising tallies since the guilty verdict. \"We're feeling good.\"\n\nThe Republican speaker had demurred earlier over whether he's asked Trump to respect the peaceful transfer of presidential power and commit to not doing another Jan. 6. \"Of course he respects that, we all do, and we've all talked about it, ad nauseum.\"\n\nMany potential priorities for a new White House administration are being formulated by a constellation of outside groups, including Project 2025, laying the groundwork for executive and legislative actions, though Trump has made clear he has his own agenda.\n\n\"Anybody who thought that this president was going to be down after the sham trial. it's only giving him even more energy,\" said Rep. Tom Emmer, the GOP whip. \"Donald Trump is crushing this election.\"\n\nBut Trump's private meetings with House and Senate Republicans so close to the Capitol were infused with the symbolism of his return as the U.S. president who threatened the American tradition of the peaceful transfer of power.\n\n\"It's frustrating,\" said former U.S. Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn, who made his own unsuccessful run for Congress as a Maryland Democrat in the aftermath of Jan. 6, the day when police engaged in hand-to-hand fighting to stop Trump supporters who stormed the building in an effort to overturn President Joe Biden's election.\n\nDunn spoke of the \"irony\" of Trump returning to the area and lawmakers now embracing him. \"It just shows the lack of backbone they have when they're truly putting party and person over country,\" he said. \"And it's sad.\"\n\nBiden was overseas Thursday attending a summit of the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations, but the president's campaign unveiled a new ad blaming Trump for lighting the \"fire\" of Jan. 6 and threatening democracy.\n\nMany of those who once stood up to Trump are long gone from office and the Republicans who remain seem increasingly enthusiastic about the possibility of him retaking the White House, and the down-ballot windfall that could mean for their own GOP majorities in Congress.\n\nThursday afternoon offered the first encounter in years between Trump and McConnell, who once blamed Trump for the \"disgraceful\" attack that he called an \"insurrection\" but now endorses the party's presumptive nominee.\n\nAccording to Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., who organized the conference meeting, after Trump addressed the group McConnell gave a thumbs up and the two approached each other and exchanged the fist-bump.\n\n\"We had a really positive meeting,\" McConnell said. \"He and I got a chance to talk a little bit, shook hands a few times.\"\n\nAs democracies around the world come under threat from a far-rightward shift, some analysts warn that the U.S. system, once seemingly immune from authoritarian impulses, is at risk of populist and extremist forces like those that Trump inspired to sack the Capitol.\n\n\"This is just another example of House Republicans bending the knee to Donald Trump,\" said Rep. Pete Aguilar of California, the chairman of the House Democratic caucus.\n\nMaking Jan. 6 a cornerstone of his reelection campaign, Trump celebrates those who stormed the Capitol as \"warriors\" and \"patriots,\" and he has vowed to pardon any number of the more than 1,300 convicted of crimes for the assault on the seat of U.S. democracy.\n\nMoreover, Trump has vowed to seek retribution by ousting officials at the U.S. Justice Department, which is prosecuting him in a four-count indictment to overturn the election ahead of the Jan. 6 attack and another case over storing classified documents at his Mar-A-Largo home.\n\nRepublicans, particularly in the House but increasingly in the Senate, are vigorously following his lead, complaining of an unfair justice system. It's having noticeable results: the House and Senate GOP campaign arms scored some of their highest fundraising periods yet after a jury found him guilty in the New York hush money case.\n\nWhen former GOP Speaker Paul Ryan on Fox News reiterated this week that he wouldn't be voting for Trump and wished Republicans had another choice for president, he was immediately ostracized by Trump allies.\n\n\"Paul Ryan, you're a piece of garbage,\" said Rep. Troy Nehls, R-Texas. \"We should kick you out of the party.\"\n\nOf the Republicans who voted to impeach Trump over Jan. 6 and convict him on the charge of inciting the insurrection, only a few remain in office.\n\nSen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, had not been expected to attend Thursday's closed-door session with Trump. But Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, had a change of plans and was to join.\n\nAlso Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., joined join the Trump meeting, expecting \"he's going to be the next president, so you have to work\" together.\n\nAsked if he was concerned about the direction of the Trump Republican Party, Cassidy said: \"Let the day's own troubles be sufficient for the day. You can fill yourself up with anxiety about tomorrow, but will it change a thing? No.\"\n\nAssociated Press writers Jill Colvin, Farnoush Amiri, Kevin Freking, Mary Clare Jalonick and Stephen Groves contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "eagletribune.com", "dataType":

GOP lawmakers find themselves newly energized and reinvigorated by his bid to retake the White House.\n\nDespite the federal charges against Trump for conspiring to overturn the 2020 election, and his recent guilty verdict in an unrelated hush money trial, the Republican former president arrived emboldened as the party's presumptive nominee. He has successfully purged the GOP of critics, silenced most skeptics and enticed once-critical lawmakers aboard his MAGA-fueled campaign.\n\nA packed room of House Republicans sang \"Happy Birthday\" to Trump in the private breakfast meeting at GOP campaign headquarters across the street from the Capitol.\n\n\"We're excited to welcome President Trump back,\" said House Speaker Mike Johnson the day earlier.\n\nThe Republican speaker had demurred over whether he's asked Trump to respect the peaceful transfer of presidential power and commit to not doing another Jan. 6. \"Of course he respects that, we all do, and we've all talked about it, ad nauseum.\"\n\nTrump told the speaker behind closed doors Thursday he thinks Johnson is doing a \"terrific job,\" according to a Republican in the private meeting and granted anonymity to discuss it.\n\nTrump is expected to be delivering remarks and discussing issues animating his campaign -- including mass immigration deportations but also tax cuts and other priorities for a potential second term.\n\nMany potential priorities for a new White House administration are being formulated by a constellation of outside groups, including Project 2025, that are laying the groundwork for executive and legislative actions, though Trump has made clear he has his own agenda.\n\nBut the private meetings with House and later in the afternoon the Senate Republicans so close to the Capitol are infused with symbolism of Trump's return as the U.S. president who threatened the American tradition of the peaceful transfer of presidential power.\n\n\"It's frustrating,\" said former U.S. Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn, who made his own unsuccessful run for Congress as a Maryland Democrat in the aftermath of Jan. 6, when police engaged in hand-to-hand fighting to stop Trump supporters who stormed the building trying to overturn President Joe Biden's election.\n\nDunn spoke of the \"irony\" of Trump returning to the area and lawmakers now embracing him. \"It just shows the lack of backbone they have when they're truly putting party and person over country,\" he said. \"And it's sad.\"\n\nMany of those who once stood up to Trump are long gone from office and the Republicans who remain seem increasingly enthusiastic about the possibility of him retaking the White House, and the down-ballot windfall that could mean for their own GOP majorities in Congress.\n\nJohnson met with senators on Wednesday ahead of Trump's arrival as the Republicans mapped out potential priorities.\n\nOutgoing Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who once blamed Trump for the \"disgraceful\" attack that he called an \"insurrection\" now endorses the party's presumptive nominee and said: \"Of course I'll be at the meeting.\"\n\nSen. John Thune, the GOP whip who is vying to replace McConnell as leader, told The Associated Press that he's interested in hearing from Trump about the fall election and \"ways in which we, as a team, and him individually can appeal to the constituencies and people that may not traditionally vote Republican.\"\n\nThune said, \"I think there's an opportunity there to really make this a big win.\"\n\nAs democracies around the world come under threat from a far-rightward shift, experts warn that the U.S. system, once seemingly immune from authoritarian impulses, is at risk of populist and extremist forces like those that Trump inspired to sack the Capitol.\n\n\"This is just another example of House Republicans bending the knee to Donald Trump,\" said Rep. Pete Aguilar of California, the chairman of the House Democratic caucus.\n\nMaking Jan. 6 a cornerstone of his reelection campaign, Trump celebrates those who stormed the Capitol as \"warriors\" and \"patriots,\" and he has vowed to pardon any number of the more than 1,300 America convicted of crimes for the assault on the seat of U.S. democracy.\n\nMoreover, Trump has vowed to seek retribution by ousting officials at the U.S. Justice Department, which is prosecuting him in a four-count indictment to overturn the election ahead of the Jan. 6 attack and another case over storing classified documents at his Mar-A-Largo home.\n\nRepublicans, particularly in the House but increasingly in the Senate, are vigorously following his lead, complaining of an unfair justice system. The House voted to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress and is re-investigating the House committee that investigated Jan. 6.\n\nAlongside Trump, the House and Senate GOP campaign arms scored some of their highest fundraising periods yet after a jury found him guilty in the New York hush money case.\n\nWhen former GOP Speaker Paul Ryan on Fox News reiterated this week that he wouldn't be voting for Trump and wished Republicans had another choice for president, he was immediately ostracized by Trump allies.\n\n\"Paul Ryan, you're a piece of garbage,\" said Rep. Troy Nehls, R-Texas. \"We should kick you out of the party.\"\n\nOf the Republicans who voted to impeach Trump over Jan. 6 and convict him on the charge of inciting the insurrection, only a few remain in office.\n\nSen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, are not expected to attend Thursday's closed-door session with Trump.\n\nBut Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said he would likely join the Trump meeting at GOP senators' campaign headquarters, expecting \"he's going to be the next president, so you have to work\" together.\n\nAsked if he was concerned about the direction of the Trump Republican Party, Cassidy: \"Let the day's own troubles be sufficient for the day. You can fill yourself up with anxiety about tomorrow, but will it change a thing? No.\"\n\nSen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who confronted Trump at times but did not join in the vote to convict him in the Capitol attack, said he did not expect the meeting to be contentious as Republicans hope to seize the Senate majority this fall.\n\n\"Look, we've got to win. And our ability to get a majority in the Senate is intrinsically linked to Trump winning. So we're like, one team, one vision. And I think that will be largely what we talk about,\" Tillis said.\n\nAssociated Press writers Jill Colvin and Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2024 BY CHANNEL 3000.

Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., joined at left by Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., arrives as former President Donald Trump returns to Washington for meetings with Republican lawmakers to unite on his political agenda, just a few steps off the Capitol campus, Thursday, June 13, 2025 in Washington.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Donald Trump made a triumphant return Thursday to Capitol Hill, whipping up House and Senate Republicans in his first meetings since the Jan.6, 2021 attacks, embraced by GOP lawmakers who find themselves newly energized by his bid to retake the White House.\n\nDespite the federal charges against Trump for conspiring to overturn the 2020 election, and his recent guilty verdict in an unrelated hush money trial, the Republican former president arrived emboldened as the party's presumptive nominee. He has successfully purged the GOP of critics, silenced most skeptics and enticed once-critical lawmakers aboard his MAGA-fueled campaign.\n\nA packed room of House Republicans sang \"Happy Birthday\" to Trump in the private breakfast meeting at GOP campaign headquarters across the street from the Capitol. The lawmakers gave him a baseball and bat from the annual congressional game. Trump bragged that even his telephone rallies for lawmakers could draw bigger crowds than mega-popstar Taylor Swift, who has yet to make any endorsement.\n\n\"President Trump brought an extraordinary amount of energy, excitement and enthusiasm this morning,\" said House Speaker Mike Johnson, noting high fund-raising tallies since the guilty verdict. \"We're feeling good.\"\n\nThe Republican speaker had demurred earlier over whether he's asked Trump to respect the peaceful transfer of presidential power and commit to not doing another Jan. 6. \"Of course he respects that, we all do, and we've all talked about it, ad nauseum.\"\n\nTrump told Johnson Thursday he thinks the speaker is doing a \"terrific job,\" according to a Republican in the private meeting and granted anonymity to discuss it. He asked Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the speaker's chief Republican critic, if she was being \"nice\" to Johnson, another Republican said.\n\nTrump spent about an hour with House Republicans delivering free-wheeling remarks, fielding questions and discussing issues -- including Russia and immigration and also tax cuts and other priorities for a potential second term. On one major controversial issue, Trump told lawmakers that abortion rules should be left to the states and said he supported exceptions for rape, incest and to save the life of the mother, lawmakers said.\n\nSenate Republicans welcomed Trump next in the afternoon, as protesters clamored at both locations and police beefed up security.\n\nMany potential priorities for a new White House administration are being formulated by a constellation of outside groups, including Project 2025, laying the groundwork for executive and legislative actions, though Trump has made clear he has his own agenda.\n\n\"Anybody who thought that this president was going to be down after the sham trial. it's only giving him even more energy,\" said Rep. Tom Emmer, the GOP whip. \"Donald Trump is crushing this election.\"\n\nBut Trump's private meetings with House and Senate Republicans so close to the Capitol were infused with the symbolism of his return as the U.S. president who threatened the American tradition of the peaceful transfer of power.\n\n\"It's frustrating,\" said former U.S. Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn, who made his own unsuccessful run for Congress as a Maryland Democrat in the aftermath of Jan. 6, the day when police engaged in hand-to-hand fighting to stop Trump supporters who stormed the building in an effort to overturn President Joe Biden's election.\n\nDunn spoke of the \"irony\" of Trump returning to the area and lawmakers now embracing him. \"It just shows the lack of backbone they have when they're truly putting party and person over country,\" he said. \"And it's sad.\"\n\nBiden was overseas Thursday attending a summit of the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations, but the president's campaign unveiled a new ad blaming Trump for lighting the \"fire\" of Jan. 6 and threatening democracy.\n\nMany of those who once stood up to Trump are long gone from office and the Republicans who remain seem increasingly enthusiastic about the possibility of him retaking the White House, and the down-ballot windfall that could mean for their own GOP majorities in Congress.\n\nThursday was to include an encounter between Trump and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who once blamed Trump for the \"disgraceful\" attack that he called an \"insurrection\" but now endorses the party's presumptive nominee. \"Of course I'll be at the meeting.\"\n\nSen.

AP\n\nDespite the federal charges against Trump for conspiring to overturn the 2020 election, and his recent guilty verdict in an unrelated hush money trial, the Republican former president arrived emboldened as the party's presumptive nominee. He has successfully purged the GOP of critics, silenced most skeptics, and enticed once-critical lawmakers aboard his MAGA-fueled campaign.\n\nA packed room of House Republicans sang \"Happy Birthday\" to Trump in the private breakfast meeting at GOP campaign headquarters across the street from the Capitol. The lawmakers gave him a baseball and bat from the annual congressional game.\n\n\"We're excited to welcome President Trump back,\" said House Speaker Mike Johnson a day earlier.\n\nThe Republican speaker had demurred over whether he's asked Trump to respect the peaceful transfer of presidential power and commit to not doing another Jan. 6. \"Of course he respects that, we all do, and we've all talked about it, ad nauseum.\"\n\nTrump told Johnson Thursday he thinks the speaker is doing a \"terrific job,\" according to a Republican in the private meeting and granted anonymity to discuss it. Trump asked Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the speaker's chief Republican critic if she was being nice to Johnson, another Republican said.\n\nTrump is expected to be delivering remarks and discussing issues animating his campaign -- including mass immigration deportations but also tax cuts and other priorities for a potential second term.\n\nMany potential priorities for a new White House administration are being formulated by a constellation of outside groups, including Project 2025, that are laying the groundwork for executive and legislative actions, though Trump has made clear he has his own agenda.\n\nBut the private meetings with House and later in the afternoon Senate Republicans so close to the Capitol are infused with symbolism of Trump's return as the US president who threatened the American tradition of the peaceful transfer of presidential power.\n\n\"It's frustrating,\" said former US Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn, who made his own unsuccessful run for Congress as a Maryland Democrat in the aftermath of Jan. 6, when police engaged in hand-to-hand fighting to stop Trump supporters who stormed the building trying to overturn President Joe Biden's election.\n\nDunn spoke of the \"irony\" of Trump returning to the area and lawmakers now embracing him. \"It just shows the lack of backbone they have when they're truly putting party and person over country,\" he said. \"And it's sad.\"\n\nBiden was overseas Thursday attending a summit of the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations, but the president's campaign unveiled a new ad blaming Trump for lighting the \"fire\" of Jan. 6 and threatening democracy.\n\nMany of those who once stood up to Trump are long gone from office and the Republicans who remain seem increasingly enthusiastic about the possibility of him retaking the White House, and the down-ballot windfall that could mean for their own GOP majorities in Congress.\n\nJohnson met with senators on Wednesday ahead of Trump's arrival as the Republicans mapped out potential priorities.\n\nOutgoing Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who once blamed Trump for the \"disgraceful\" attack that he called an \"insurrection\" now endorses the party's presumptive nominee and said: \"Of course I'll be at the meeting.\"\n\nSen. John Thune, the GOP whip who is vying to replace McConnell as leader, told The Associated Press that he was interested in hearing from Trump about the fall election. \"I think there's an opportunity there to really make this a big win,\" he said.\n\nAs democracies around the world come under threat from a far-rightward shift, experts warn that the US system, once seemingly immune from authoritarian impulses, is at risk of populist and extremist forces like those that Trump inspired to sack the Capitol.\n\n\"This is just another example of House Republicans bending the knee to Donald Trump,\" said Rep. Pete Aguilar of California, the chairman of the House Democratic caucus.\n\nMaking Jan. 6 a cornerstone of his reelection campaign, Trump celebrates those who stormed the Capitol as \"warriors\" and \"patriots,\" and he has vowed to pardon any number of the more than 1,300 Americans convicted of crimes for the assault on the seat of US democracy.\n\nMoreover, Trump has vowed to seek retribution by ousting officials at the US Justice Department, which is prosecuting him in a four-count indictment to overturn the election ahead of the Jan. 6 attack and another case over storing classified documents at his Mar-A-Largo home.\n\nRepublicans, particularly in the House but increasingly in the Senate, are vigorously following his lead, complaining of an unfair justice system. The House voted to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress and is re-investigating the House committee that investigated Jan. 6.\n\nAlongside Trump, the House and Senate GOP campaign arms scored some of their highest fundraising periods yet after a jury found him guilty in the New York hush-money case.\n\nWhen former GOP Speaker Paul Ryan on Fox News reiterated this week that he wouldn't be voting for Trump and wished Republicans had another choice for president, he was immediately ostracized by Trump allies.\n\n\"Paul Ryan, you're a piece of garbage,\" said Rep. Troy Nehls, R-Texas. \"We should kick you out of the party.\"\n\nOf the Republicans who voted to impeach Trump over Jan. 6 and convict him on the charge of inciting the insurrection, only a few remain in office.\n\nSen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah are not expected to attend Thursday's closed-door session with Trump.\n\nBut Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said he would likely join the Trump meeting at GOP senators' campaign headquarters, expecting \"he's going to be the next president, so you have to work\" together.\n\nAsked if he was concerned about the direction of the Trump Republican Party, Cassidy: \"Let the day's own troubles be sufficient for the day. You can fill yourself up with anxiety about tomorrow, but will it change a thing? No.\"\n\nSen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who confronted Trump at times but did not join in the vote to convict him in the Capitol attack, said he did not expect the meeting to be contentious as Republicans hope to seize the Senate majority this fall.\n\n\"Look, we've got to win. And our ability to get a majority in the Senate is intrinsically linked to Trump winning. So we're like, one team, one vision. And I think that will be largely what we talk about,\" Tillis said.", "source": {"uri": "english.ahram.org.eg", "dataType": "news", "title": "\u062c\u0631\u064a\u062f\u0629

John Thune, the GOP whip who is vying to replace McConnell as leader, told The Associated Press that he was interested in hearing from Trump about the fall election. \"I think there's an opportunity there to really make this a big win,\" he said.\n\nAs democracies around the world come under threat from a far-rightward shift, experts warn that the U.S. system, once seemingly immune from authoritarian impulses, is at risk of populist and extremist forces like those that Trump inspired to sack the Capitol.\n\n\"This is just another example of House Republicans bending the knee to Donald Trump,\" said Rep. Pete Aguilar of California, the chairman of the House Democratic caucus.\n\nMaking Jan. 6 a cornerstone of his reelection campaign, Trump celebrates those who stormed the Capitol as \"warriors\" and \"patriots,\" and he has vowed to pardon any number of the more than 1,300 America convicted of crimes for the assault on the seat of U.S. democracy.\n\nMoreover, Trump has vowed to seek retribution by ousting officials at the U.S. Justice Department, which is prosecuting him in a four-count indictment to overturn the election ahead of the Jan. 6 attack and another case over storing classified documents at his Mar-A-Largo home.\n\nRepublicans, particularly in the House but increasingly in the Senate, are vigorously following his lead, complaining of an unfair justice system. Alongside Trump, the House and Senate GOP campaign arms scored some of their highest fundraising periods yet after a jury found him guilty in the New York hush money case.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally June 9, 2024 in Las Vegas. (John Locher / AP Photo)\n\nWhen former GOP Speaker Paul Ryan on Fox News reiterated this week that he wouldn't be voting for Trump and wished Republicans had another choice for president, he was immediately ostracized by Trump allies.\n\n\"Paul Ryan, you're a piece of garbage,\" said Rep. Troy Nehls, R-Texas. \"We should kick you out of the party.\"\n\nOf the Republicans who voted to impeach Trump over Jan. 6 and convict him on the charge of inciting the insurrection, only a few remain in office.\n\nSen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, were not expected to attend Thursday's closed-door session with Trump. But Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, had a change of plans and will now join.\n\nAlso Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said he would likely join the Trump meeting at GOP senators' campaign headquarters, expecting \"he's going to be the next president, so you have to work\" together.\n\nAsked if he was concerned about the direction of the Trump Republican Party, Cassidy: \"Let the day's own troubles be sufficient for the day. You can fill yourself up with anxiety about tomorrow, but will it change a thing? No.\"\n\nSen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who confronted Trump at times but did not join in the vote to convict him in the Capitol attack, said he did not expect the meeting to be contentious as Republicans hope to seize the Senate majority this fall.\n\n\"Look, we've got to win. And our ability to get a majority in the Senate is intrinsically linked to Trump winning. So we're like, one team, one vision. And I think that will be largely what we talk about,\" Tillis said.", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He has successfully purged the GOP of critics, silenced most skeptics and enticed once-critical lawmakers aboard his MAGA-fueled campaign.\n\nA packed room of House Republicans sang \"Happy Birthday\" to Trump in a private breakfast meeting at GOP campaign headquarters across the street from the Capitol. The lawmakers gave him a baseball and bat from the annual congressional game, and senators later presented an American flag cake with \"45\" candles -- and then \"47'' -- referring to the next presidency. Trump bragged that even his telephone rallies for lawmakers could draw bigger crowds than mega-popstar Taylor Swift, who has yet to make any endorsement.\n\nIn one remarkable moment, Trump and his most prominent Republican critic, Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell, shook hands, and fist-bumped.\n\n\"There's tremendous unity in the Republican Party,\" Trump said in brief remarks at Senate GOP headquarters.\n\nTrump spent about an hour each with House and Senate Republicans delivering free-wheeling remarks, fielding questions and discussing issues -- including Russia and immigration, tax cuts and other priorities for a potential second term.\n\nDuring the morning session, Trump said House Speaker Mike Johnson is doing a \"terrific job,\" according to a Republican in the private meeting and granted anonymity to discuss it. Trump asked Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the speaker's chief Republican critic, if she was being \"nice\" to Johnson, another Republican said.\n\n\"President Trump brought an extraordinary amount of energy, excitement and enthusiasm this morning,\" Johnson said afterward, noting high fund-raising tallies since the guilty verdict. \"We're feeling good.\"\n\nThe Republican speaker had demurred earlier over whether he's asked Trump to respect the peaceful transfer of presidential power and commit to not doing another Jan. 6. \"Of course he respects that, we all do, and we've all talked about it, ad nauseum.\"\n\nMany potential priorities for a new White House administration are being formulated by a constellation of outside groups, including Project 2025, laying the groundwork for executive and legislative actions, though Trump has made clear he has his own agenda.\n\n\"Anybody who thought that this president was going to be down after the sham trial. it's only giving him even more energy,\" said Rep.

Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., an ally of the former president.\n\nAccording to Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., who organized the conference meeting, after Trump addressed the group McConnell gave a thumbs up and the two approached each other and exchanged the fist-bump.\n\n\"We had a really positive meeting,\" McConnell said. \"He and I got a chance to talk a little bit, shook hands a few times.\"\n\nAs democracies around the world come under threat from a far-rightward shift, some analysts warn that the U.S. system, once seemingly immune from authoritarian impulses, is at risk of populist and extremist forces like those that Trump inspired to sack the Capitol.\n\n\"This is just another example of House Republicans bending the knee to Donald Trump,\" said Rep. Pete Aguilar of California, the chairman of the House Democratic caucus.\n\nMaking Jan. 6 a cornerstone of his reelection campaign, Trump celebrates those who stormed the Capitol as \"warriors\" and \"patriots,\" and he has vowed to pardon any number of the more than 1,200 people charged with crimes for the assault on the seat of U.S. democracy.\n\nMoreover, Trump has vowed to seek retribution by ousting officials at the U.S. Justice Department, which is prosecuting him in a four-count indictment to overturn the election ahead of the Jan. 6 attack and another case over storing classified documents at his Mar-A-Largo home.\n\nRepublicans, particularly in the House but increasingly in the Senate, are vigorously following his lead, complaining of an unfair justice system. It's having noticeable results: the House and Senate GOP campaign arms scored some of their highest fundraising periods yet after a jury found him guilty in the New York hush money case.\n\nWhen former GOP Speaker Paul Ryan on Fox News reiterated this week that he wouldn't be voting for Trump and wished Republicans had another choice for president, he was immediately ostracized by Trump allies.\n\n\"Paul Ryan, you're a piece of garbage,\" said Rep.

He has successfully purged the GOP of critics, silenced most skeptics and enticed once-critical lawmakers aboard his MAGA-fuelled campaign.\n\n\"We're excited to welcome President Trump back,\" said House Speaker Mike Johnson, who led one of the lawsuits challenging the 2020 election, and had his biggest fundraising day yet after Trump's felony conviction.\n\nThe Republican speaker demurred over whether he's asked Trump to respect the peaceful transfer of presidential power and commit to not doing another Jan. 6. \"Of course he respects that, we all do, and we've all talked about it, ad nauseum.\"\n\nTrump is scheduled to deliver remarks to both groups at the House and Senate campaign headquarters near the U.S. Capitol and discuss issues animating his campaign -- including mass immigration deportations but also tax cuts and other priorities for a potential second term.\n\nIn between, Trump is expected to speak at the Business Roundtable downtown, which routinely invites the presumptive presidential nominees to address the executives' group. Many potential priorities for a new White House administration are being formulated by a constellation of outside groups, including Project 2025, that are laying the groundwork for executive and legislative actions, though Trump has made clear he has his own agenda.\n\nBut the private meetings with House and Senate Republicans so close to the Capitol are infused with symbolism of Trump's return as the U.S. president who threatened the American tradition of the peaceful transfer of presidential power.\n\n\"It's frustrating,\" said former U.S. Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn, who made his own unsuccessful run for Congress as a Maryland Democrat in the aftermath of Jan. 6, when police engaged in hand-to-hand fighting to stop Trump supporters who stormed the building trying to overturn U.S. President Joe Biden's election.\n\nDunn spoke of the \"irony\" of Trump returning to the area and lawmakers now embracing him. \"It just shows the lack of backbone they have when they're truly putting party and person over country,\" he said. \"And it's sad.\"\n\nMany of those who once stood up to Trump are long gone from office and the Republicans who remain seem increasingly enthusiastic about the possibility of him retaking the White House, and the down-ballot windfall that could mean for their own GOP majorities in Congress.\n\nJohnson met with senators on Wednesday ahead of Trump's arrival as the Republicans mapped out potential priorities.\n\nOutgoing Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who once blamed Trump for the \"disgraceful\" attack that he called an \"insurrection,\" now endorses the party's presumptive nominee and said: \"Of course I'll be at the meeting.\"\n\nSen. John Thune, the GOP whip who is vying to replace McConnell as leader, told The Associated Press that he's interested in hearing from Trump about the fall election and \"ways in which we, as a team, and him individually can appeal to the constituencies and people that may not traditionally vote Republican.\"\n\nThune said, \"I think there's an opportunity there to really make this a big win.\"\n\nAs democracies around the world come under threat from a far-rightward shift, experts warn that the U.S. system, once seemingly immune from authoritarian impulses, is at risk of populist and extremist forces like those that Trump inspired to sack the Capitol.\n\n\"This is just another example of House Republicans bending the knee to Donald Trump,\" said Rep. Pete Aguilar of California, the chairman of the House Democratic caucus.\n\nMaking Jan. 6 a cornerstone of his reelection campaign, Trump celebrates those who stormed the Capitol as \"warriors\" and \"patriots,\" and he has vowed to pardon any number of the more than 1,300 America convicted of crimes for the assault on the seat of U.S. democracy.\n\nMoreover, Trump has vowed to seek retribution by ousting officials at the U.S. Justice Department, which is prosecuting him in a four-count indictment to overturn the election ahead of the Jan. 6 attack and another case over storing classified documents at his Mar-A-Largo home.\n\nRepublicans, particularly in the House but increasingly in the Senate, are vigorously following his lead, complaining of an unfair justice system. The House voted to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress and is re-investigating the House committee that investigated Jan. 6.\n\nAlongside Trump, the House and Senate GOP campaign arms scored some of their highest fundraising periods yet after a jury found him guilty in the New York hush money case.\n\nWhen former GOP Speaker Paul Ryan on Fox News reiterated this week that he wouldn't be voting for Trump and wished Republicans had another choice for president, he was immediately ostracized by Trump allies.\n\n\"Paul Ryan, you're a piece of garbage,\" said Rep. Troy Nehls, a Republican from Texas. \"We should kick you out of the party.\"\n\nOf the Republicans who voted to impeach Trump over Jan. 6 and convict him on the charge of inciting the insurrection, only a few remain in office.\n\nSen. Susan Collins, a Republican from Maine, and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska, are not expected to attend Thursday's closed-door session with Trump.\n\nBut Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Republican from Lousiana, said he would likely join the Trump meeting at GOP senators' campaign headquarters, expecting \"he's going to be the next president, so you have to work\" together.\n\nAsked if he was concerned about the direction of the Trump Republican Party, Cassidy said: \"Let the day's own troubles be sufficient for the day. You can fill yourself up with anxiety about tomorrow, but will it change a thing? No.\"\n\nSen. Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina who confronted Trump at times but did not join in the vote to convict him in the Capitol attack, said he did not expect the meeting to be contentious as Republicans hope to seize the Senate majority this fall.\n\n\"Look, we've got to win. And our ability to get a majority in the Senate is intrinsically linked to Trump winning. So we're like, one team, one vision. And I think that will be largely what we talk about,\" Tillis said.\n\n___", "source": {"uri": "ctvnews.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CTV News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Many potential priorities for a new White House administration are being formulated by a constellation of outside groups, including Project 2025, that are laying the groundwork for executive and legislative actions, though Trump has made clear he has his own agenda.\n\nBut the private meetings with House and Senate Republicans so close to the Capitol are infused with symbolism of Trump's return as the U.S. president who threatened the American tradition of the peaceful transfer of presidential power.\n\n\"It's frustrating,\" said former U.S. Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn, who made his own unsuccessful run for Congress as a Maryland Democrat in the aftermath of Jan. 6, when police engaged in hand-to-hand fighting to stop Trump supporters who stormed the building trying to overturn President Joe Biden's election.\n\nDunn spoke of the \"irony\" of Trump returning to the area and lawmakers now embracing him. \"It just shows the lack of backbone they have when they're truly putting party and person over country,\" he said. \"And it's sad.\"\n\nMany of those who once stood up to Trump are long gone from office and the Republicans who remain seem increasingly enthusiastic about the possibility of him retaking the White House, and the down-ballot windfall that could mean for their own GOP majorities in Congress.\n\nJohnson met with senators on Wednesday ahead of Trump's arrival as the Republicans mapped out potential priorities.\n\nOutgoing Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who once blamed Trump for the \"disgraceful\" attack that he called an \"insurrection\" now endorses the party's presumptive nominee and said: \"Of course I'll be at the meeting.\"\n\nSen. John Thune, the GOP whip who is vying to replace McConnell as leader, told The Associated Press that he's interested in hearing from Trump about the fall election and \"ways in which we, as a team, and him individually can appeal to the constituencies and people that may not traditionally vote Republican.\"\n\nThune said, \"I think there's an opportunity there to really make this a big win.\"\n\nAs democracies around the world come under threat from a far-rightward shift, experts warn that the U.S. system, once seemingly immune from authoritarian impulses, is at risk of populist and extremist forces like those that Trump inspired to sack the Capitol.\n\n\"This is just another example of House Republicans bending the knee to Donald Trump,\" said Rep. Pete Aguilar of California, the chairman of the House Democratic caucus.\n\nMaking Jan. 6 a cornerstone of his reelection campaign, Trump celebrates those who stormed the Capitol as \"warriors\" and \"patriots,\" and he has vowed to pardon any number of the more than 1,300 America convicted of crimes for the assault on the seat of U.S. democracy.\n\nMoreover, Trump has vowed to seek retribution by ousting officials at the U.S. Justice Department, which is prosecuting him in a four-count indictment to overturn the election ahead of the Jan. 6 attack and another case over storing classified documents at his Mar-A-Largo home.\n\nRepublicans, particularly in the House but increasingly in the Senate, are vigorously following his lead, complaining of an unfair justice system. The House voted to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress and is re-investigating the House committee that investigated Jan. 6.\n\nAlongside Trump, the House and Senate GOP campaign arms scored some of their highest fundraising periods yet after a jury found him guilty in the New York hush money case.\n\nWhen former GOP Speaker Paul Ryan on Fox News reiterated this week that he wouldn't be voting for Trump and wished Republicans had another choice for president, he was immediately ostracized by Trump allies.\n\n\"Paul Ryan, you're a piece of garbage,\" said Rep. Troy Nehls, R-Texas. \"We should kick you out of the party.\"\n\nOf the Republicans who voted to impeach Trump over Jan. 6 and convict him on the charge of inciting the insurrection, only a few remain in office.\n\nSen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, are not expected to attend Thursday's closed-door session with Trump.\n\nBut Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said he would likely join the Trump meeting at GOP senators' campaign headquarters, expecting \"he's going to be the next president, so you have to work\" together.\n\nAsked if he was concerned about the direction of the Trump Republican Party, Cassidy: \"Let the day's own troubles be sufficient for the day. You can fill yourself up with anxiety about tomorrow, but will it change a thing? No.\"\n\nSen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who confronted Trump at times but did not join in the vote to convict him in the Capitol attack, said he did not expect the meeting to be contentious as Republicans hope to seize the Senate majority this fall.\n\n\"Look, we've got to win. And our ability to get a majority in the Senate is intrinsically linked to Trump winning. So we're like, one team, one vision. And I think that will be largely what we talk about,\" Tillis said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Jill Colvin and Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri":

House GOP Conference Chairwoman Rep. Elise Stefanik advised lawmakers early Tuesday of the upcoming meeting with Trump.\n\nIt's a pivotal moment for the indicted former president, weeks before he is to be sentenced after being found guilty in the hush money trial and ahead of the Republican National Convention when he is expected to become the formal GOP nominee for president.\n\nThe Trump campaign did not confirm the meeting with House Republicans, but the senior campaign official said the Senate meeting will be focused on policy issues -- including tax cuts.\n\nTrump's return to the GOP campaign offices across from the Capitol, his first since the mob of supporters rioted at the Capitol in 2021, comes as he faces other legal charges, including the four-part federal indictment brought by Justice Department Special Prosecutor Jack Smith in the conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election results.\n\nMost Republicans have endorsed Trump in the expected rematch against Biden, including Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and other leaders who were critical of him in the aftermath of the 2021 attack.\n\nMany of the Republicans in Congress have joined Trump in attacking the U.S. justice system for the cases against him. House Speaker Mike Johnson led lawmakers in rallying to Trump's defense outside the New York courthouse last month in the hush money trial.\n\nThe verdict made Trump the first former American president found guilty of felony crimes when a New York jury convicted him on all charges in a scheme to illegally influence the 2016 election with a hush money payment to a porn actor.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

He has successfully purged the Republican Party of its critics, silenced most skeptics and lured once-critical lawmakers on board his MAGA-fueled campaign.\n\nWe are delighted to welcome back President Trump, said House Speaker Mike Johnson, who led one of the lawsuits challenging the 2020 election and had his biggest fundraising day ever. this day after Trump's felony conviction.\n\nThe Republican president questioned whether he had asked Trump to respect the peaceful transfer of presidential power and pledge not to do another on January 6. Of course he respects that, we all respect that, and we've all talked about it ad nauseum.\n\nTrump is expected to deliver a speech to both groups at the House and Senate campaign headquarters near the U.S. Capitol and discuss the issues driving his campaign, including mass expulsions of immigrants, but also tax cuts and other priorities for a possible second term.\n\nWhat you need to know about the 2024 elections\n\nMeanwhile, Trump is expected to speak at the downtown Business Roundtable, which regularly invites presumptive presidential candidates to address the group of leaders. Many potential priorities for a new White House administration are being formulated by a constellation of outside groups, including Project 2025, that are setting the stage for executive and legislative actions, even as Trump has made clear he has his own program.\n\nBut the private meetings with House and Senate Republicans so close to the Capitol are steeped in the symbolism of Trump's return as U.S. president that has threatened the American tradition of peaceful transfer of presidential power.\n\nIt's frustrating, said Harry Dunn, a former U.S. Capitol Police officer who himself ran unsuccessfully for Congress as a Maryland Democrat in the aftermath of Jan. 6, when police fought in hand-to-hand combat to stop Trump supporters who stormed the building. attempt to overturn the election of President Joe Biden.\n\nDunn spoke about the irony of Trump returning to the region and how lawmakers are now embracing him. It just shows the lack of courage they have when they truly put the party and the individual before the country, he said. And it's sad.\n\nMany of those who once resisted Trump have long left office, and the Republicans who remain seem increasingly enthusiastic about the possibility of him taking back the White House and the boon that could mean for their own majorities Republicans in Congress.\n\nJohnson met with senators Wednesday before Trump arrived as Republicans hammered out potential priorities.\n\nOutgoing Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell, who once blamed Trump for the shameful attack he called an insurrection, now supports the party's presumptive nominee and said: Of course I'll be at the meeting.\n\nSen. John Thune, the GOP whip seeking to replace McConnell as leader, told The Associated Press he wants to hear Trump talk about the fall election and how we, as a team, and he individually, can appeal to the constituencies. and people who don't traditionally vote Republican.\n\nThune said: \"I think there's an opportunity there to make this a big win.\n\nAs democracies around the world are threatened by a shift to the far right, experts warn that the American system, once seemingly immune to authoritarian impulses, risks facing populist and extremist forces like those Trump inspired to sack the Capitol.\n\nIt's just another example of how House Republicans are taking a knee to Donald Trump, said Rep. Pete Aguilar of California, chairman of the House Democratic caucus.\n\nMaking January 6 the cornerstone of his re-election campaign, Trump is celebrating those who stormed the Capitol as warriors and patriots, and he has pledged to pardon a number of the more than 1,300 Americans convicted of crimes for the assault on the seat of American democracy.\n\nAdditionally, Trump has vowed to seek retaliation by ousting officials from the U.S. Justice Department, which is prosecuting him in a four-count indictment aimed at overturning the election before the attack on January 6 and another case for the storage of classified documents in its headquarters. -Largo at home.\n\nRepublicans, particularly in the House but increasingly in the Senate, are vigorously following his lead, complaining about an unfair justice system. The House voted to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress and is reviewing the House committee that investigated the Jan. 6 incident.\n\nAlongside Trump, GOP campaign groups in the House and Senate recorded some of their highest fundraising periods to date after a jury convicted him in the Trump secrecy case. money in New York.\n\nWhen former GOP Chairman Paul Ryan on Fox News reiterated this week that he would not vote for Trump and wanted Republicans to have another choice for president, he was immediately ostracized by Trump's allies. Trump.\n\nPaul Ryan, you are trash, said Rep. Troy Nehls, R-Texas. We should kick you out of the party.\n\nOf the Republicans who voted to impeach Trump on January 6 and convict him of inciting insurrection, only a few remain in office.\n\nSen. Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, are not expected to attend Thursday's closed-door session with Trump.\n\nBut Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said he would likely join Trump's meeting at the GOP senators' campaign headquarters, hoping he will be the next president, so you have to work together.\n\nAsked if he was concerned about the direction of Trump's Republican Party, Cassidy responded: Let the issues of the day suffice for the day. You can fill yourself with anxiety about tomorrow, but will it make a difference? No.\n\nSen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who has at times clashed with Trump but did not join the vote to convict him in the Capitol attack, said he did not expect the meeting to be controversial as Republicans hope to capture the majority in the Senate this fall. .\n\nLook, we have to win. And our ability to win a majority in the Senate is intrinsically linked to Trump's victory. So it was like, one team, one vision. And I think that's going to be a lot of what we talk about, Tillis said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Jill Colvin and Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.\n\nWhat Are The Main

He has successfully purged the GOP of critics, silenced skeptics and enticed once-critical lawmakers aboard his MAGA-fueled campaign.\n\n\"We're excited to have Trump back,\" said House Speaker Mike Johnson, who led one of the lawsuits challenging the 2020 election, and had his biggest fundraising day yet after Trump's felony conviction.\n\nThe Republican speaker demurred over whether he's asked Trump to respect the peaceful transfer of presidential power and commit to not doing another Jan. 6. \"Of course he respects that, we all do, and we've all talked about it, ad nauseum.\"\n\nTrump is scheduled to deliver remarks to both groups at the House and Senate campaign headquarters near the U.S. Capitol and discuss issues animating his campaign -- including mass immigration deportations but also tax cuts and other priorities for a potential second term.\n\nIn between, Trump is expected to speak at the Business Roundtable downtown which routinely invites the presumptive presidential nominees to address the executives' group. Many potential priorities for a new White House administration are being formulated by a constellation of outside groups, including Project 2025, that are laying the groundwork for executive and legislative actions, though Trump has made clear he has his own agenda.\n\nBut the private meetings with House and Senate Republicans so close to the Capitol are infused with symbolism of Trump's return as the U.S. president who threatened the American tradition of the peaceful transfer of presidential power.\n\n\"It's frustrating,\" said former U.S. Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn, who made his own unsuccessful run for Congress as a Maryland Democrat in the aftermath of Jan. 6, when police engaged in hand-to-hand fighting to stop Trump supporters who stormed the building trying to overturn President Joe Biden's election.\n\nDunn spoke of the \"irony\" of Trump returning to the area and lawmakers now embracing him. \"It just shows the lack of backbone they have when they're truly putting party and person over country,\" he said. \"And it's sad.\"\n\nMany of those who once stood up to Trump are long gone from office and the Republicans who remain seem increasingly enthusiastic about the possibility of him retaking the White House, and the down-ballot windfall that could mean for their own GOP majorities in Congress.\n\nJohnson met with senators on Wednesday ahead of Trump's arrival as the Republicans mapped out potential priorities.\n\nOutgoing Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who once blamed Trump for the \"disgraceful\" attack that he called an \"insurrection\" now endorses the party's presumptive nominee and said: \"Of course I'll be at the meeting.\"\n\nSen. John Thune, the GOP whip who is vying to replace McConnell as leader, told The Associated Press that he's interested in hearing from Trump about the fall election and \"ways in which we, as a team, and him individually can appeal to the constituencies and people that may not traditionally vote Republican.\"\n\nThune said, \"I think there's an opportunity there to really make this a big win.\"\n\nAs democracies around the world come under threat from a far-rightward shift, experts warn that the U.S. system, once seemingly immune from authoritarian impulses, is at risk of populist and extremist forces like those that Trump inspired to sack the Capitol.\n\n\"This is just another example of House Republicans bending the knee to Donald Trump,\" said Rep. Pete Aguilar of California, the chairman of the House Democratic caucus.\n\nMaking Jan. 6 a cornerstone of his reelection campaign, Trump celebrates those who stormed the Capitol as \"warriors\" and \"patriots,\" and he has vowed to pardon any number of the more than 1,300 America convicted of crimes for the assault on the seat of U.S. democracy.\n\nMoreover, Trump has vowed to seek retribution by ousting officials at the U.S. Justice Department, which is prosecuting him in a four-count indictment to overturn the election ahead of the Jan. 6 attack and another case over storing classified documents at his Mar-A-Largo home.\n\nRepublicans, particularly in the House but increasingly in the Senate, are vigorously following his lead, complaining of an unfair justice system. The House voted to hold hAttorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress and is re-investigating the House committee that investigated Jan. 6.\n\nAlongside Trump, the House and Senate GOP campaign arms scored some of their highest fundraising periods yet after a jury found him guilty in the New York hush money case.\n\nWhen former GOP Speaker Paul Ryan on Fox News reiterated this week that he wouldn't be voting for Trump and wished Republicans had another choice for president, he was immediately ostracized by Trump allies.\n\n\"Paul Ryan, you're a piece of garbage,\" said Rep. Troy Nehls, R-Texas. \"We should kick you out of the party.\"\n\nOf the Republicans who voted to impeach Trump over Jan. 6 and convict him on the charge of inciting the insurrection, only a few remain in office.\n\nSen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, are not expected to attend Thursday's closed-door session with Trump.\n\nBut Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said he would likely join the Trump meeting at GOP senators' campaign headquarters, expecting \"he's going to be the next president, so you have to work\" together.\n\nAsked if he was concerned about the direction of the Trump Republican Party, Cassidy: \"Let the day's own troubles be sufficient for the day. You can fill yourself up with anxiety about tomorrow, but will it change a thing? No.\"\n\nSen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who confronted Trump at times but did not join in the vote to convict him in the Capitol attack, said he did not expect the meeting to be contentious as Republicans hope to seize the Senate majority this fall.\n\n\"Look, we've got to win. And our ability to get a majority in the Senate is intrinsically linked to Trump winning. So we're like, one team, one vision.

Rep. Elise Stefanik, chairwoman of the House GOP conference, briefed lawmakers Tuesday morning about the upcoming meeting with Trump.\n\nIt's a pivotal moment for the indicted former president, weeks before he is set to be sentenced after being found guilty in the secret trial and ahead of the Republican National Convention where he is expected to become the official GOP nominee for presidency.\n\nThe Trump campaign has not confirmed the meeting with House Republicans, but the senior campaign official said the Senate meeting would focus on policy issues, including tax cuts.\n\nTrump's return to GOP campaign offices across the street from the Capitol, his first since partisan riots at the Capitol in 2021, comes as he faces other legal charges, including the federal indictment in four parts filed by Justice Department Special Prosecutor Jack Smith in 2021. the plot to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nMost Republicans backed Trump in the expected rematch against Biden, including Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and other leaders who criticized him following the 2021 attack.\n\nWhat you need to know about the 2024 elections\n\nMany Republicans in Congress have joined Trump in attacking the U.S. justice system over the charges against him.

He has successfully purged the GOP of critics, silenced skeptics and enticed once-critical lawmakers aboard his MAGA-fueled campaign.\n\n\"We\u00b4re excited to have Trump back,\" said House Speaker Mike Johnson, who led one of the lawsuits challenging the 2020 election, and had his biggest fundraising day yet after Trump's felony conviction.\n\nThe Republican speaker demurred over whether he\u00b4s asked Trump to respect the peaceful transfer of presidential power and commit to not doing another Jan. 6. \"Of course he respects that, we all do, and we've all talked about it, ad nauseum.\"\n\nTrump is scheduled to deliver remarks to both groups at the House and Senate campaign headquarters near the U.S. Capitol and discuss issues animating his campaign - including mass immigration deportations but also tax cuts and other priorities for a potential second term.\n\nIn between, Trump is expected to speak at the Business Roundtable downtown which routinely invites the presumptive presidential nominees to address the executives' group. Many potential priorities for a new White House administration are being formulated by a constellation of outside groups, including Project 2025, that are laying the groundwork for executive and legislative actions, though Trump has made clear he has his own agenda.\n\nFILE - Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally June 9, 2024, in Las Vegas. (AP Photo/John Locher, File)\n\nBut the private meetings with House and Senate Republicans so close to the Capitol are infused with symbolism of Trump\u00b4s return as the U.S. president who threatened the American tradition of the peaceful transfer of presidential power.\n\n\"It\u00b4s frustrating,\" said former U.S. Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn, who made his own unsuccessful run for Congress as a Maryland Democrat in the aftermath of Jan. 6, when police engaged in hand-to-hand fighting to stop Trump supporters who stormed the building trying to overturn President Joe Biden's election.\n\nDunn spoke of the \"irony\" of Trump returning to the area and lawmakers now embracing him. \"It just shows the lack of backbone they have when they\u00b4re truly putting party and person over country,\" he said. \"And it\u00b4s sad.\"\n\nMany of those who once stood up to Trump are long gone from office and the Republicans who remain seem increasingly enthusiastic about the possibility of him retaking the White House, and the down-ballot windfall that could mean for their own GOP majorities in Congress.\n\nJohnson met with senators on Wednesday ahead of Trump's arrival as the Republicans mapped out potential priorities.\n\nOutgoing Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who once blamed Trump for the \"disgraceful\" attack that he called an \"insurrection\" now endorses the party\u00b4s presumptive nominee and said: \"Of course I\u00b4ll be at the meeting.\"\n\nSen. John Thune, the GOP whip who is vying to replace McConnell as leader, told The Associated Press that he\u00b4s interested in hearing from Trump about the fall election and \"ways in which we, as a team, and him individually can appeal to the constituencies and people that may not traditionally vote Republican.\"\n\nThune said, \"I think there\u00b4s an opportunity there to really make this a big win.\"\n\nAs democracies around the world come under threat from a far-rightward shift, experts warn that the U.S. system, once seemingly immune from authoritarian impulses, is at risk of populist and extremist forces like those that Trump inspired to sack the Capitol.\n\n\"This is just another example of House Republicans bending the knee to Donald Trump,\" said Rep. Pete Aguilar of California, the chairman of the House Democratic caucus.\n\nMaking Jan. 6 a cornerstone of his reelection campaign, Trump celebrates those who stormed the Capitol as \"warriors\" and \"patriots,\" and he has vowed to pardon any number of the more than 1,300 America convicted of crimes for the assault on the seat of U.S. democracy.\n\nMoreover, Trump has vowed to seek retribution by ousting officials at the U.S. Justice Department, which is prosecuting him in a four-count indictment to overturn the election ahead of the Jan. 6 attack and another case over storing classified documents at his Mar-A-Largo home.\n\nRepublicans, particularly in the House but increasingly in the Senate, are vigorously following his lead, complaining of an unfair justice system. The House voted to hold hAttorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress and is re-investigating the House committee that investigated Jan. 6.\n\nAlongside Trump, the House and Senate GOP campaign arms scored some of their highest fundraising periods yet after a jury found him guilty in the New York hush money case.\n\nWhen former GOP Speaker Paul Ryan on Fox News reiterated this week that he wouldn\u00b4t be voting for Trump and wished Republicans had another choice for president, he was immediately ostracized by Trump allies.\n\n\"Paul Ryan, you\u00b4re a piece of garbage,\" said Rep. Troy Nehls, R-Texas. \"We should kick you out of the party.\"\n\nOf the Republicans who voted to impeach Trump over Jan. 6 and convict him on the charge of inciting the insurrection, only a few remain in office.\n\nSen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, are not expected to attend Thursday's closed-door session with Trump.\n\nBut Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said he would likely join the Trump meeting at GOP senators' campaign headquarters, expecting \"he\u00b4s going to be the next president, so you have to work\" together.\n\nAsked if he was concerned about the direction of the Trump Republican Party, Cassidy: \"Let the day\u00b4s own troubles be sufficient for the day. You can fill yourself up with anxiety about tomorrow, but will it change a thing? No.\"\n\nSen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who confronted Trump at times but did not join in the vote to convict him in the Capitol attack, said he did not expect the meeting to be contentious as Republicans hope to seize the Senate majority this fall.\n\n\"Look, we\u00b4ve got to win. And our ability to get a majority in the Senate is intrinsically linked to Trump winning. So we\u00b4re like, one team, one vision. And I think that will be largely what we talk about,\" Tillis said.\n\nAssociated Press writers Jill Colvin and Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk",

Since the guilty verdict last month, Republicans have largely fallen in line behind Trump, as he and President Biden continue to be locked in a tight race.\n\nFormer president Donald Trump attends a rally in Las Vegas on June 9. Eric Thayer for The Washington Post\n\nIt will also be Trump's first public visit to Capitol Hill since the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection, in which a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol complex to stop the certification of Biden's 2020 victory. Though Trump was not at the Capitol that day, his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results, including his actions leading up to and during the attack, are at the heart of federal charges against him.\n\nTrump's actions and words influenced several Republican lawmakers to publicly break from the former president and endorse other candidates in this year's GOP presidential primary. Although many Republicans had previously bemoaned Trump's sometimes erratic behavior and norm bashing, the electoral fates of those who broke with him - like former representatives Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., and Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., - has not gone unnoticed by them.\n\nOnly two of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump after the Jan. 6 Capitol riot remain in Congress - Reps. Dan Newhouse, Wash., and David G. Valadao, Calif. Neither has endorsed Trump this cycle, and only Newhouse has said he will attend Thursday's meeting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf the four senators still in office who voted to convict Trump in his second impeachment trial after Jan. 6, only Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said he is likely to attend the meeting with Trump on Thursday. Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said they had scheduling conflicts.\n\nSome Republicans have also broken with Trump on policy. While the GOP embraces the broad ambition of passing tough immigration policy, curbing government spending and cutting taxes, the ideological divisions plaguing House Republicans in particular have made it difficult for them to pass substantive legislation.\n\nTrump displayed his power over Senate Republicans from afar when, earlier this year, he helped kill bipartisan border security legislation that would have cracked down on asylum claims at the U.S.-Mexico border. Senate Republicans rejected the bill a second time last month.\n\nRepublicans also remain increasingly divided over whether to address abortion and other reproductive health issues on the federal level, though many agree with Trump that those matters should be left up to the states.\n\nTrump's visit comes as Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is brainstorming what a House Republican majority's first-100-days agenda would feature if voters keep the GOP at the helm. Trump is scheduled to meet with House Republicans at 9:30 a.m. Thursday at the Capitol Hill Club followed by a meeting with Senate Republicans at 12:30 p.m. at the headquarters of the National Republican Senatorial Committee.\n\n\"We're very excited to welcome President Trump back. ... There's high anticipation here and great excitement, and I feel good,\" Johnson said, later adding that GOP lawmakers were eager to talk about post-election plans and \"bounce around ideas\" with Trump.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsked whether he had spoken to Trump about committing to a peaceful transfer of power, Johnson said \"of course he respects that, and we all do.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who will step down as the Senate's top GOP leader at the end of the year, has suggested Senate Republicans first need to win the majority before establishing a legislative agenda.\n\nMcConnell plans to attend the meeting, which will mark the first time he and Trump have spoken since shortly after the 2020 election. McConnell broke with Trump over his refusal to accept the 2020 election results then and over the Jan. 6 riot, for which McConnell called Trump \"practically and morally responsible.\" Trump also later attacked McConnell's wife - former Trump Cabinet secretary Elaine Chao - in racist terms. But McConnell has already endorsed Trump for reelection, saying that \"it should come as no surprise that as nominee, he will have my support.\"\n\n\"I said three years ago, right after the Capitol was attacked, that I would support our nominee, regardless of who it was, including him,\" McConnell said Wednesday. \"I've said earlier this year I support him. He's ... earned the nomination by the voters all across the country.\"\n\nTrump has had conflicts with Senate Republicans in the past, although the majority of the conference is staunchly behind him. Trump is also considering some members of the conference to be his running mate, including Sens. J.D. Vance, Ohio, and Tim Scott, S.C.\n\nIn a meeting invitation obtained by The Washington Post, Senate Republicans were told to expect \"to hear directly from President Trump about his plans for the summer and to also share our ideas for a strategic governing agenda for 2025.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., said he doubted the meeting would get too in the weeds on policy, focusing more on politics and messaging and rallying together ahead of the election.\n\n\"It's the first time we've all been together with him since he was president, certainly the first time a large group of us have been with him since the convictions, and I would expect he'd receive a lot of unifying messages,\" Cramer said. \"I would expect it will be a very encouraging day for him.\"\n\nSenate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., disparaged Republicans ahead of the meetings, saying the party's only policy idea was to recycle \"the same Trump tax cuts that proved to be a dud seven years ago.\"\n\nHouse Republican leaders briefed conference members during their weekly meeting Wednesday about Trump's visit the next day, urging lawmakers to arrive early at the Capitol Hill Club. There were few specifics given about what might be discussed with Trump, but people familiar with the leadership's thinking said a meeting with Trump has been in the works for months.\n\nSeveral Republican lawmakers said Wednesday that they expected Trump to update them on what he saw as top concerns for the American people and to lay out a role for how lawmakers could support his reelection efforts over the next five months.\n\nSome moderate House Republicans are still contemplating not attending their meeting with Trump, possibly stunting his attempt to unite the conference. One moderate House Republican, who represents a swing district and who spoke on the condition of anonymity to freely discuss the meeting, said they were bracing for chaos. But Rep. Nick LaLota, a moderate from New York state, dismissed the notion that Thursday's meeting could turn tense.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I think it'll be a morale-building, team-building-focused meeting where I expect spirits to be high,\" he said.\n\nTrump is aware of GOP disunity, according to Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., who said he speaks to Trump frequently. But Donalds, who is reported to be under consideration to be Trump's running mate, encouraged his colleagues to appear - even those who may be hesitant because of their reelection prospects or previously endorsed another candidate in the presidential primary.\n\n\"I think that if you're just going to go around just being a distraction for distraction's sake, he has little patience for that - but quite frankly, I got little patience for that,\" Donalds said of colleagues who often break with Trump. \"So I think members should show up. They should go. It'll be a packed house.\"\n\nRep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., who endorsed former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley during the primary, said he will continue pushing her to be Trump's running mate. But he encouraged his colleagues to leave the past behind by not letting \"personalities get in the way\" and instead remain focused on \"turning the country around, saving it.\"\n\nAsked whether he was excited for Trump's visit, Rep. Chip Roy, R-Tex., - who campaigned for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the primary - said he \"certainly plans on attending\" Thursday's meeting. Roy said he thinks Republicans must have a conversation \"about what we want to accomplish in the spring of '25, to talk about the agenda and the policies that we ought to address.\"\n\nRep. Bob Good, R-Va., a former DeSantis supporter whose opponent Trump backed this cycle, said he would attend \"to listen to what our presumptive nominee and the effective leader of our party has to say.\"\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., a top Trump ally in the House, downplayed the possibility of tension resulting Thursday from the presence of those who supported other primary candidates, like Good. \"I don't think President Trump even cares.\"\n\nMarianne LeVine contributed to this report.\n\nCopy the Story Link Related Headlines Trump becomes first former U.S. president convicted of felony crimes\n\nInvalid username/password.\n\nPlease check your email to confirm and complete your registration.\n\nCreate a commenting profile by providing an email address, password and display name.

Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., a Trump loyalist, said as he left the rally.\n\nAt the House GOP meeting, Trump delivered a message about \"unity\" within the party, saying Republicans must come together to defeat Democrats in November, a source in the House said. room. At one point, according to two sources, Trump implored his close ally, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., to get along with Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., whom she tried to oust power.\n\n\"Marjorie, are you nice to Mike?\" Trump asked, the sources said, drawing laughter from House Republicans.\n\nDuring his speech, the former president moved from one topic to another, touching on everything from border security and China's \"They're scamming us\" to insults against trans athletes in women's sports .\n\nMinutes after the Supreme Court rejected a challenge to the abortion pill mifepristone, Trump told House Republicans that in the post-Roe environment the party needs to speak correctly about abortion, multiple sources said .\n\nHe acknowledged that the issue of abortion rights had cost Republicans dearly and was too important to ignore, while adding that it was now in the hands of the people and the states, his stated preference. He also expressed support for an abortion policy that includes exceptions such as in cases of rape, incest and life of the mother.\n\nIs the party showing common sense on this and other key issues, Trump told lawmakers. He did not directly reference mifepristone or the Supreme Court decision.\n\nMembers in the room had mixed reactions to his speech on abortion, according to sources.\n\nTrump also took a photo in Milwaukee, the host city of the Republican National Convention, where Trump will formally accept the GOP presidential nomination. It is scheduled for July 15-18, although Trump will not be able to attend in person.\n\nThe former president called Milwaukee horrible and overrun with crime, a source said, adding that no one in the room disagreed with him.\n\nAs Trump came from behind to speak to House Republicans, a handful of protesters held signs outside the Capitol Hill Club, reading articles like Failed Coup and Democracy Forever, Trump Never. The Democratic National Committee, meanwhile, has installed a mobile billboard that will attempt to track Trump between meetings while broadcasting footage of the Jan. 6 attack.\n\nPotential collaborators and detractors\n\nEven some of Trump's critics within the Republican Party plan to attend the Senate meeting with him Thursday afternoon. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., who voted to convict Trump in the impeachment trial after the Jan. 6 attack, said he thought he would attend but was still firming up his schedule.\n\nThe polls say he will be our next president, so you have to work with him, Cassidy said, joking that he didn't know what to expect. Can you predict what Trump will do in the next minute? No of course not.\n\nIt will also be the first time since the Capitol riot that Trump will be in the same room as Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. ; the two have not spoken since December 2020. At the time, McConnell criticized Trump as being practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of January 6. He has since endorsed Trump for president and announced he would resign as Senate GOP leader after this year.\n\nI said three years ago, right after the attack on the Capitol, that I would support our candidate no matter who it was, including him. I said earlier this year that I supported him. He secured the nomination from voters across the country, McConnell told reporters Tuesday, without using Trump's name. And of course, I will be at the meeting tomorrow.\n\nTrump returns to Washington just after being convicted of 34 counts of falsifying business records related to hush money payments to an adult film star and awaiting sentencing. Between his meetings with House and Senate Republicans, Trump will meet with CEOs in a meeting with the Business Roundtable, a lobbying group that says it represents more than 200 major companies, as Washington and key industries prepare to the reality that Trump could be president again. .\n\nSeveral of Trump's vice-presidential contenders will also have a chance to get his attention on Thursday. They include GOP Sens. JD Vance of Ohio, Marco Rubio of Florida and Tim Scott of South Carolina.\n\nOther Trump critics within the party are expected to skip the Senate meeting, including Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine and Mitt Romney of Utah. All three voted to convict Trump after his January 6 impeachment.\n\nRomney, who is retiring from the Senate this year, said he had a flight to catch at the time of the Trump rally.\n\n\"I'm not giving him advice on what to say, and I'm sure he wouldn't listen to my advice anyway,\" Romney told reporters.\n\nSen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said he wasn't reading much into McConnell's participation in the meeting with Trump.\n\nI don't think it's anything other than Mitch showing respect for our presidential candidate, Tillis said. And show up for all of us at the conference.\n\nTrump is not expected to set foot in the Capitol complex itself, which his supporters invaded in 2021, during his visit. He will meet in the morning with House Republicans at the Capitol Hill Club, a private Republican club located just steps from the Capitol office buildings. In the afternoon, he will meet with Republican senators at the headquarters of the National Republican Senatorial Committee after speaking at the Business Roundtable.\n\nSen. Todd Young, R-Ind., who did not support Trump for president, declined to say whether he would attend.\n\nNo questions about Trump, Young said, adding that this is a personal rule until I decide to make it more of a rule.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [],

He has successfully purged the GOP of critics, silenced most skeptics and enticed once-critical lawmakers aboard his MAGA-fueled campaign.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nA packed room of House Republicans sang \"Happy Birthday\" to Trump in the private breakfast meeting at GOP campaign headquarters across the street from the Capitol. The lawmakers gave him a baseball and bat from the annual congressional game. Trump bragged that even his telephone rallies for lawmakers could draw bigger crowds than mega-popstar Taylor Swift, who has yet to make any endorsement.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"President Trump brought an extraordinary amount of energy, excitement and enthusiasm this morning,\" said House Speaker Mike Johnson, noting high fund-raising tallies since the guilty verdict. \"We're feeling good.\"\n\nThe Republican speaker had demurred earlier over whether he's asked Trump to respect the peaceful transfer of presidential power and commit to not doing another Jan. 6. \"Of course he respects that, we all do, and we've all talked about it, ad nauseum.\"\n\nTrump told Johnson Thursday he thinks the speaker is doing a \"terrific job,\" according to a Republican in the private meeting and granted anonymity to discuss it. He asked Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the speaker's chief Republican critic, if she was being \"nice\" to Johnson, another Republican said.\n\nTrump spent about an hour with House Republicans delivering free-wheeling remarks, fielding questions and discussing issues -- including Russia and immigration and also tax cuts and other priorities for a potential second term. On one major controversial issue, Trump told lawmakers that abortion rules should be left to the states and said he supported exceptions for rape, incest and to save the life of the mother, lawmakers said.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nSenate Republicans meet next with Trump in the afternoon.\n\nYou might be interested in Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 Peterborough And Area News Dec 31, 1969 ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nMany potential priorities for a new White House administration are being formulated by a constellation of outside groups, including Project 2025, laying the groundwork for executive and legislative actions, though Trump has made clear he has his own agenda.\n\n\"Anybody who thought that this president was going to be down after the sham trial. it's only giving him even more energy,\" said Rep. Tom Emmer, the GOP whip. \"Donald Trump is crushing this election.\"\n\nBut Trump's private meetings with House and Senate Republicans so close to the Capitol are infused with symbolism of his return as the U.S. president who threatened the American tradition of the peaceful transfer of power.\n\n\"It's frustrating,\" said former U.S. Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn, who made his own unsuccessful run for Congress as a Maryland Democrat in the aftermath of Jan. 6, when police engaged in hand-to-hand fighting to stop Trump supporters who stormed the building.\n\nDunn spoke of the \"irony\" of Trump returning to the area and lawmakers now embracing him. \"It just shows the lack of backbone they have when they're truly putting party and person over country,\" he said. \"And it's sad.\"\n\nBiden was overseas Thursday attending a summit of the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations, but the president's campaign unveiled a new ad blaming Trump for lighting the \"fire\" of Jan. 6 and threatening democracy.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nMany of those who once stood up to Trump are long gone from office and the Republicans who remain seem increasingly enthusiastic about the possibility of him retaking the White House, and the down-ballot windfall that could mean for their own GOP majorities in Congress.\n\nOutgoing Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who once blamed Trump for the \"disgraceful\" attack that he called an \"insurrection\" now endorses the party's presumptive nominee and said: \"Of course I'll be at the meeting.\"\n\nSen. John Thune, the GOP whip who is vying to replace McConnell as leader, told The Associated Press that he was interested in hearing from Trump about the fall election. \"I think there's an opportunity there to really make this a big win,\" he said.\n\nAs democracies around the world come under threat from a far-rightward shift, experts warn that the U.S. system, once seemingly immune from authoritarian impulses, is at risk of populist and extremist forces like those that Trump inspired to sack the Capitol.\n\n\"This is just another example of House Republicans bending the knee to Donald Trump,\" said Rep. Pete Aguilar of California, the chairman of the House Democratic caucus.\n\nMaking Jan. 6 a cornerstone of his reelection campaign, Trump celebrates those who stormed the Capitol as \"warriors\" and \"patriots,\" and he has vowed to pardon any number of the more than 1,300 America convicted of crimes for the assault on the seat of U.S. democracy.\n\nMoreover, Trump has vowed to seek retribution by ousting officials at the U.S. Justice Department, which is prosecuting him in a four-count indictment to overturn the election ahead of the Jan. 6 attack and another case over storing classified documents at his Mar-A-Largo home.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nRepublicans, particularly in the House but increasingly in the Senate, are vigorously following his lead, complaining of an unfair justice system. Alongside Trump, the House and Senate GOP campaign arms scored some of their highest fundraising periods yet after a jury found him guilty in the New York hush money case.\n\nWhen former GOP Speaker Paul Ryan on Fox News reiterated this week that he wouldn't be voting for Trump and wished Republicans had another choice for president, he was immediately ostracized by Trump allies.\n\n\"Paul Ryan, you're a piece of garbage,\" said Rep. Troy Nehls, R-Texas. \"We should kick you out of the party.\"\n\nOf the Republicans who voted to impeach Trump over Jan. 6 and convict him on the charge of inciting the insurrection, only a few remain in office.\n\nSen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, were not expected to attend Thursday's closed-door session with Trump. But Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, had a change of plans and will now join.\n\nAlso Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said he would likely join the Trump meeting at GOP senators' campaign headquarters, expecting \"he's going to be the next president, so you have to work\" together.\n\nAsked if he was concerned about the direction of the Trump Republican Party, Cassidy: \"Let the day's own troubles be sufficient for the day. You can fill yourself up with anxiety about tomorrow, but will it change a thing? No.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nSen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who confronted Trump at times but did not join in the vote to convict him in the Capitol attack, said he did not expect the meeting to be contentious as Republicans hope to seize the Senate majority this fall.\n\n\"Look, we've got to win. And our ability to get a majority in the Senate is intrinsically linked to Trump winning. So we're like, one team, one vision. And I think that will be largely what we talk about,\" Tillis said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Jill Colvin, Farnoush Amiri, Kevin Freking, Mary Clare Jalonick and Stephen Groves contributed to

Trump asked congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, the speaker\u2019s chief Republican critic, if she was being \u201cnice\u201d to Johnson, another Republican said.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump brought an extraordinary amount of energy, excitement and enthusiasm this morning,\u201d Johnson said after the meeting, noting high fund-raising tallies since the guilty verdict. \u201cWe\u2019re feeling good.\u201d\n\nThe Republican speaker had demurred earlier over whether he has asked Trump to respect the peaceful transfer of presidential power and commit to not doing \u201canother January 6\u201d. \u201cOf course he respects that, we all do, and we\u2019ve all talked about it, ad nauseum.\u201d\n\nMany potential priorities for a new White House administration are being formulated by a constellation of outside groups, including Project 2025, laying the groundwork for executive and legislative actions, though Trump has made clear he has his own agenda.\n\n\u201cAnybody who thought that this president was going to be down after the sham trial, it\u2019s only giving him even more energy,\u201d said congressman Tom Emmer, the Republican whip. \u201cDonald Trump is crushing this election.\u201d\n\nBut Trump\u2019s private meetings with House and Senate Republicans so close to the Capitol were infused with the symbolism of his return as the US president who threatened the American tradition of the peaceful transfer of power.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating,\u201d said former US Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn, who made his own unsuccessful run for Congress as a Maryland Democrat in the aftermath of January 6, the day when police engaged in hand-to-hand fighting to stop Trump supporters who stormed the building in an effort to overturn US President Joe Biden\u2019s election.\n\nDunn spoke of the \u201cirony\u201d of Trump returning to the area and lawmakers now embracing him. \u201cIt just shows the lack of backbone they have when they\u2019re truly putting party and person over country,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s sad.\u201d\n\nBiden was in Italy on Thursday attending a summit of the Group of Seven leading industrialised nations (G7), but the president\u2019s campaign unveiled a new ad blaming Trump for lighting the \u201cfire\u201d of January 6 and threatening democracy.\n\nMany of those who once stood up to Trump are long gone from office and the Republicans who remain seem increasingly enthusiastic about the possibility of him retaking the White House, and the down-ballot windfall that could mean for their own Republican majorities in Congress.\n\nThursday afternoon offered the first encounter in years between Trump and McConnell, who once blamed Trump for the \u201cdisgraceful\u201d attack that he called an \u201cinsurrection\u201d but now endorses the party\u2019s presumptive nominee.\n\nAccording to Senator John Barrasso, who organised the conference meeting, after Trump addressed the group McConnell gave a thumbs up and the two approached each other and exchanged the fist-bump.\n\n\u201cWe had a really positive meeting,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cHe and I got a chance to talk a little bit, shook hands a few times.\u201d\n\nAs democracies around the world come under threat from a far-rightward shift, some analysts warn that the US system, once seemingly immune from authoritarian impulses, is at risk of populist and extremist forces like those that Trump inspired to sack the Capitol.\n\n\u201cThis is just another example of House Republicans bending the knee to Donald Trump,\u201d said congressman Pete Aguilar of California, the chairman of the House Democratic caucus.\n\nMaking January 6 a cornerstone of his reelection campaign, Trump celebrates those who stormed the Capitol as \u201cwarriors\u201d and \u201cpatriots\u201d, and he has vowed to pardon any number of the more than 1,300 convicted of crimes for the assault on the seat of US democracy.\n\nMoreover, Trump has vowed to seek retribution by ousting officials at the US Justice Department, which is prosecuting him in a four-count indictment to overturn the election ahead of the January 6 attack and another case over storing classified documents at his Mar-A-Largo, Florida home.\n\nRepublicans, particularly in the House but increasingly in the Senate, are vigorously following his lead, complaining of an unfair justice system. It is having noticeable results: the House and Senate Republican campaign arms scored some of their highest fundraising periods yet after a jury found him guilty in the New York hush money case.",

Roger Wicker, R-Miss., a past GOP campaign chairman, told NBC News.\n\nEven some critics in the party plan to attend: Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., who voted to convict Trump in the impeachment trial after the Jan. 6 attack, said he thinks he will attend but is still firming up his schedule.\n\n\"The polls say he's going to be our next president, so you got to work with the guy,\" Cassidy said, joking that he does not know what to expect. \"Can you predict what Trump's going to do the next minute? No, of course not.\"\n\nIt will also be the first time since the Capitol riot that Trump will have been in the same room with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.; the two have not spoken since December 2020. At the time, McConnell slammed Trump as being \"practically and morally responsible for provoking the events\" of Jan. 6. He has since endorsed Trump for president -- and announced that he will step down as Senate GOP leader after this year.\n\n\"I said three years ago right after the Capitol was attacked that I would support our nominee, regardless of who it was -- including him. I've said earlier this year I support him. He's earned the nomination by the voters all across the country,\" McConnell told reporters Tuesday, without using Trump's name. \"And of course, I'll be at the meeting tomorrow.\"\n\nTrump returns to Washington just after he was convicted of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records related to hush money payments to an adult film star and as he awaits sentencing. Between meetings with House and Senate Republicans, Trump will sit down with CEOs in a meeting with the Business Roundtable, a lobbying group that says it represents more than 200 major companies, as Washington and key industries prepare for the reality that Trump might be president again.\n\nSeveral top contenders to be Trump's running mate will have a chance to catch his attention Thursday, as well. They include GOP Sens. JD Vance of Ohio, Marco Rubio of Florida and Tim Scott of South Carolina.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., a top Trump ally who played a key role in the GOP's effort to stop certification of Biden's 2020 victory, predicted that Trump would win a second term and would be \"the most consequential president of the modern era\" as he fixes the \"disaster\" created by the Biden administration.\n\n\"When he comes in, we've got to have a very aggressive first-100-day agenda; the first year will be important. I think we cannot waste a moment, because there are so many things to do,\" Johnson told reporters Wednesday. \"You don't put the cart before the horse, but you do have to be prepared to lead.\"\n\nOther Trump critics in the party are expected to skip the Senate meeting, including Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine and Mitt Romney of Utah. All three voted to convict Trump after he was impeached in connection with Jan. 6.\n\nRomney, who is retiring from the Senate this year, said he has a flight to catch at the time of the Trump gathering.\n\n\"I don't give him advice on what to say, and I'm sure he wouldn't listen to my advice anyway,\" Romney told reporters.\n\nSen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said he does not read much into McConnell's attending the meeting with Trump.\n\n\"I don't think it's anything more than Mitch showing respect for our presidential nominee,\" Tillis said. \"And showing up for the rest of us in the conference.\"\n\nTrump is not expected to set foot in the Capitol complex itself, which his supporters overran in 2021, during his visit. He will huddle in the morning with House Republicans at the Capitol Hill Club, a private Republican club just steps from the Capitol office buildings. In the afternoon, he will meet with GOP senators at the National Republican Senatorial Committee headquarters after he addresses the Business Roundtable.\n\nSen. Todd Young, R-Ind., who has not endorsed Trump for president, declined to say whether he will attend.\n\n\"No Trump questions,\" Young said, adding that it is a personal rule \"until I decide to make it no longer a rule.\"", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "frank_thorp_v@aol.com", "name": "Frank Thorp V", "type": "author", "isAgency": false},

House GOP Conference Chairwoman Rep. Elise Stefanik advised lawmakers early Tuesday of the upcoming meeting with Trump.\n\nIt's a pivotal moment for the indicted former president, weeks before he is to be sentenced after being found guilty in the hush money trial and ahead of the Republican National Convention when he is expected to become the formal GOP nominee for president.\n\nThe Trump campaign did not confirm the meeting with House Republicans, but the senior campaign official said the Senate meeting will be focused on policy issues - including tax cuts.\n\nTrump's return to the GOP campaign offices across from the Capitol, his first since the mob of supporters rioted at the Capitol in 2021, comes as he faces other legal charges, including the four-part federal indictment brought by Justice Department Special Prosecutor Jack Smith in the conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election results.\n\nMost Republicans have endorsed Trump in the expected rematch against Biden, including Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and other leaders who were critical of him in the aftermath of the 2021 attack.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump speaks during a news conference at Trump Tower, Friday, May 31, 2024, in New York.

He has successfully purged the GOP of critics, silenced most skeptics and enticed once-critical lawmakers aboard his MAGA-fueled campaign.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nA packed room of House Republicans sang \"Happy Birthday\" to Trump in the private breakfast meeting at GOP campaign headquarters across the street from the Capitol. The lawmakers gave him a baseball and bat from the annual congressional game. Trump bragged that even his telephone rallies for lawmakers could draw bigger crowds than mega-popstar Taylor Swift, who has yet to make any endorsement.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"President Trump brought an extraordinary amount of energy, excitement and enthusiasm this morning,\" said House Speaker Mike Johnson, noting high fund-raising tallies since the guilty verdict. \"We're feeling good.\"\n\nThe Republican speaker had demurred earlier over whether he's asked Trump to respect the peaceful transfer of presidential power and commit to not doing another Jan. 6. \"Of course he respects that, we all do, and we've all talked about it, ad nauseum.\"\n\nTrump told Johnson Thursday he thinks the speaker is doing a \"terrific job,\" according to a Republican in the private meeting and granted anonymity to discuss it. He asked Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the speaker's chief Republican critic, if she was being \"nice\" to Johnson, another Republican said.\n\nTrump spent about an hour with House Republicans delivering free-wheeling remarks, fielding questions and discussing issues -- including Russia and immigration and also tax cuts and other priorities for a potential second term. On one major controversial issue, Trump told lawmakers that abortion rules should be left to the states and said he supported exceptions for rape, incest and to save the life of the mother, lawmakers said.\n\nSenate Republicans meet next with Trump in the afternoon.\n\nMany potential priorities for a new White House administration are being formulated by a constellation of outside groups, including Project 2025, laying the groundwork for executive and legislative actions, though Trump has made clear he has his own agenda.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"Anybody who thought that this president was going to be down after the sham trial. it's only giving him even more energy,\" said Rep. Tom Emmer, the GOP whip. \"Donald Trump is crushing this election.\"\n\nBut Trump's private meetings with House and Senate Republicans so close to the Capitol are infused with symbolism of his return as the U.S. president who threatened the American tradition of the peaceful transfer of power.\n\n\"It's frustrating,\" said former U.S. Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn, who made his own unsuccessful run for Congress as a Maryland Democrat in the aftermath of Jan. 6, when police engaged in hand-to-hand fighting to stop Trump supporters who stormed the building.\n\nDunn spoke of the \"irony\" of Trump returning to the area and lawmakers now embracing him. \"It just shows the lack of backbone they have when they're truly putting party and person over country,\" he said. \"And it's sad.\"\n\nBiden was overseas Thursday attending a summit of the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations, but the president's campaign unveiled a new ad blaming Trump for lighting the \"fire\" of Jan. 6 and threatening democracy.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nMany of those who once stood up to Trump are long gone from office and the Republicans who remain seem increasingly enthusiastic about the possibility of him retaking the White House, and the down-ballot windfall that could mean for their own GOP majorities in Congress.\n\nOutgoing Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who once blamed Trump for the \"disgraceful\" attack that he called an \"insurrection\" now endorses the party's presumptive nominee and said: \"Of course I'll be at the meeting.\"\n\nSen. John Thune, the GOP whip who is vying to replace McConnell as leader, told The Associated Press that he was interested in hearing from Trump about the fall election. \"I think there's an opportunity there to really make this a big win,\" he said.\n\nAs democracies around the world come under threat from a far-rightward shift, experts warn that the U.S. system, once seemingly immune from authoritarian impulses, is at risk of populist and extremist forces like those that Trump inspired to sack the Capitol.\n\n\"This is just another example of House Republicans bending the knee to Donald Trump,\" said Rep. Pete Aguilar of California, the chairman of the House Democratic caucus.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nMaking Jan. 6 a cornerstone of his reelection campaign, Trump celebrates those who stormed the Capitol as \"warriors\" and \"patriots,\" and he has vowed to pardon any number of the more than 1,300 America convicted of crimes for the assault on the seat of U.S. democracy.\n\nMoreover, Trump has vowed to seek retribution by ousting officials at the U.S. Justice Department, which is prosecuting him in a four-count indictment to overturn the election ahead of the Jan. 6 attack and another case over storing classified documents at his Mar-A-Largo home.\n\nRepublicans, particularly in the House but increasingly in the Senate, are vigorously following his lead, complaining of an unfair justice system. Alongside Trump, the House and Senate GOP campaign arms scored some of their highest fundraising periods yet after a jury found him guilty in the New York hush money case.\n\nWhen former GOP Speaker Paul Ryan on Fox News reiterated this week that he wouldn't be voting for Trump and wished Republicans had another choice for president, he was immediately ostracized by Trump allies.\n\n\"Paul Ryan, you're a piece of garbage,\" said Rep. Troy Nehls, R-Texas. \"We should kick you out of the party.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nOf the Republicans who voted to impeach Trump over Jan. 6 and convict him on the charge of inciting the insurrection, only a few remain in office.\n\nSen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, were not expected to attend Thursday's closed-door session with Trump. But Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, had a change of plans and will now join.\n\nAlso Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said he would likely join the Trump meeting at GOP senators' campaign headquarters, expecting \"he's going to be the next president, so you have to work\" together.\n\nAsked if he was concerned about the direction of the Trump Republican Party, Cassidy: \"Let the day's own troubles be sufficient for the day. You can fill yourself up with anxiety about tomorrow, but will it change a thing? No.\"\n\nSen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who confronted Trump at times but did not join in the vote to convict him in the Capitol attack, said he did not expect the meeting to be contentious as Republicans hope to seize the Senate majority this fall.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"Look, we've got to win. And our ability to get a majority in the Senate is intrinsically linked to Trump winning. So we're like, one team, one vision. And I think that will be largely what we talk about,\" Tillis said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Jill Colvin, Farnoush Amiri, Kevin Freking, Mary Clare Jalonick and Stephen Groves contributed to

We want to see a strong military. ... We want to see just success for our country, and we don't have success right now,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump said high inflation and open borders are of \"great concern' to Republicans going into the election.\n\nThursday marked the first time Trump met with GOP leaders since his 34 felony convictions from his New York hush-money trial.\n\nEarlier, Trump met with House Republicans in a closed-door meeting at the Capitol Hill Club.\n\nIn the meeting, which comes after the Supreme Court struck down an effort to restrict access to the abortion drug mifepristone, Trump expressed his opinion that abortion access should be decided by the states and that exceptions to restrictions ought to be made in the case of rape, incest or to save the mother's life, according to ABC News.\n\nTrump also told Republicans they could have a 40-seat House majority if they weren't so \"afraid\" of the issue, ABC News reported.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said Trump also had \"very complimentary\" things to say about House Republican leaders and that he told Johnson he was doing a good job, according to the Hill.\n\n\"We have to have continuity in leadership,\" Johnson said.\n\nJohnson has openly embraced Trump while hardline House Republicans such as Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., have attempted to oust him over his habit of toeing the line with Democrats to pass controversial spending bills earlier this year.\n\nIn the meeting with House lawmakers, Trump reportedly told Greene in a joking manner to be nice to Johnson after her failed attempt to vacate the speaker earlier this year, according to the Hill.\n\nDuring the meeting, Trump also promised to lean in hard on international trade tariffs because \"other countries have taken advantage of the United States, and we have tools [to address it],\" Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., told the Hill.\n\nTrump then met with Senate Republicans, some of whom voted to convict him in second impeachment trial in 2021, at the National Republican Senatorial Committee headquarters.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who was one of the seven to vote to convict Trump, shook hands with the former president and told reporters they had a \"really positive meeting.\"\n\nIt was the first time the two had met since 2020.\n\nSens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, who also voted to convict Trump in 2021, did not attend the meeting due to prior conflicts, they said.\n\nThursday also marked the first time Trump has been near the U.S. Capitol since the Jan. 6 riot in 2021. His meeting with Republicans prompted an advertisement from the Biden-Harris campaign that highlighted footage from the riot and claimed Trump is trying to \"burn it all down.\"\n\nTrump hit back at Democrats, claiming, \"They are getting away with murder.\"\n\nTrump also is scheduled to join over 200 CEOs in a quarterly meeting with of the Business Roundtable in Washington, D.C.\n\nBusiness Roundtable spokesperson Michael Steel said the group invited both Trump and President Joe Biden to speak, but Biden is currently overseas to attend the G7 Summit.

Susan Collins skipped former President Donald Trump's Thursday meeting with Republicans as the party tries to put up a united front entering the November rematch between Trump and President Joe Biden.\n\nIt was Trump's first time meeting with lawmakers on Capitol Hill since the riots of Jan. 6, 2021. Despite pending federal charges against him for conspiring to overturn the 2020 election and his recent guilty verdict in New York, he arrived emboldened as the party's presumptive nominee.\n\nA packed room of House Republicans sang \"Happy Birthday\" to Trump at a private breakfast meeting at the Republican campaign headquarters across the street from the Capitol. Trump and his most prominent Republican critic, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, shook hands and fist-bumped.\n\n\"There's tremendous unity in the Republican Party,\" Trump said in brief remarks at Senate Republican headquarters.\n\nMany of Trump's former critics within the party have been alienated or driven from office. Of the Republicans who voted to impeach Trump over Jan. 6 and convict him on the charge of inciting the insurrection, only a few remain in office.\n\nOne of them is Collins, a Republican who said last year she is not voting for Trump in November. Neither she nor her centrist ally, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, attended the meeting. A Collins spokesperson cited a private appointment that Collins did not change because it was a campaign meeting, and she is \"not involved in the presidential campaign.\"\n\nAs Washington was buzzing over the Trump summit, her office sent out a news release on the senator's meeting a day earlier with the R&B singer Usher on Type 1 diabetes screenings.\n\nTrump spent about an hour each with House and Senate Republicans delivering free-wheeling remarks, fielding questions and discussing issues from Russia to immigration and tax cuts. During the morning session, Trump said House Speaker Mike Johnson is doing a \"terrific job,\" according to a Republican in the private meeting and granted anonymity to discuss it.\n\nMany potential priorities for a new White House administration are being formulated by a constellation of outside groups, including Project 2025, laying the groundwork for executive and legislative actions, though Trump has made clear he has his own agenda.\n\nBut Trump's private meetings with House and Senate Republicans so close to the Capitol were infused with the symbolism of his return as the U.S. president who threatened the American tradition of the peaceful transfer of power.\n\n\"It's frustrating,\" said former U.S. Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn, who made his own unsuccessful run for Congress as a Maryland Democrat in the aftermath of Jan. 6, the day when police engaged in hand-to-hand fighting to stop Trump supporters who stormed the building in an effort to overturn Biden's election.\n\nThursday afternoon offered the first encounter in years between Trump and McConnell, who once blamed Trump for the \"disgraceful\" attack that he called an \"insurrection\" but now endorses the party's presumptive nominee.\n\nTrump addressed the situation directly, saying he intends to work with everyone and that McConnell had \"done his best\" as leader, said Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Oklahoma, an ally of the former president.\n\nMaking Jan. 6 a cornerstone of his reelection campaign, Trump celebrates those who stormed the Capitol as \"warriors\" and \"patriots,\" and he has vowed to pardon any number of the more than 1,200 people charged with crimes for the assault on the seat of U.S. democracy.\n\nMoreover, Trump has vowed to seek retribution by ousting officials at the U.S. Justice Department, which is prosecuting him in a four-count indictment to overturn the election ahead of the Jan. 6 attack and another case over storing classified documents at his Florida home.\n\nRepublicans, particularly in the House but increasingly in the Senate, are vigorously following his lead, complaining of an unfair justice system. It's having noticeable results: the House and Senate Republican campaign arms scored some of their highest fundraising periods yet after a jury found him guilty in the New York hush money case.",

Will they lay out a 2025 wish list?", "body": "Donald Trump is meeting with House, Senate Republicans in DC. Will they lay out a 2025 wish list?\n\nRiley Beggin and Ken Tran, USA TODAY\n\nJune 13, 2024 at 11:11 AM\n\nWASHINGTON - Former President Donald Trump will meet with Republican lawmakers Thursday to discuss campaign strategies and lay out their wish list if they defeat Democrats in November.\n\nIt's the first time Trump has returned to Capitol Hill since leaving office nearly four years ago, and the trip provides an opportunity for conservative leaders to plot which policy priorities they'll pursue if reelected.\n\nThe meetings with both House and Senate lawmakers also align with a meeting with the Business Roundtable, a powerful cohort of some of the country's largest companies that will host the former president while he's in the nation's capital. Trump is slated to meet with House Republican lawmakers in the morning at the Capitol Hill Club and Senate Republicans in the afternoon at the National Republican Senatorial Committee office, both locations adjacent to the Capitol grounds.\n\nThe visit comes after Trump was convicted by a New York jury in his hush money trial and weeks before he is slated to be formally nominated at the Republican National Convention. The twin meetings with congressional Republicans are supposed to help shore up unity in the party that has, at times, struggled to agree on major policy priorities, such as providing additional aid to Ukraine.\n\nHowever, some moderate members are expected to skip the meeting, such as Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Mitt Romney, R-Utah. Several of their peers insisted that's not necessarily a problem.\n\n\"I think there's lots of reasons for people to not show up,\" including scheduling conflicts, said Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D. \"It's a grand opportunity for us all to get together to kick off the official campaign but also to prepare, possibly, for a transition.\"\n\nDonald Trump, Mitch McConnell will meet for the first time in years as GOP leaders gather\n\nTop Republicans in Congress are expected to attend the meetings Thursday. That includes Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who has not met in-person with the former president since 2020. The two have had a frosty relationship after McConnell accepted the results of the 2020 presidential election and blamed the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack on Trump.\n\nMcConnell declined to say if he would bring up the animosity with the former president at the Senate meeting, reiterating that he intended to support the 2024 GOP nominee, whoever it may be. However, the Kentucky Republican declined to even reference Trump by name.\n\n\"I've said earlier this year I support him. He's earned the nomination by the voters all across the country and of course I'll be at the meeting tomorrow,\" McConnell told reporters.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., on the other hand, is a stalwart Trump ally, having served on the former president's defense team during his first impeachment trial. The speaker told reporters Wednesday morning he wants to use the meetings to lay out a clear-cut conservative agenda should the GOP sweep the coming elections.\n\n\"When (Trump) comes in, we got to have a very aggressive first 100 days agenda. The first year will be important and I think we cannot waste a moment,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said\n\nTrump's visit is important for Johnson's leadership post as well. The former president defended the speaker from Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's threat to oust him last month. At the same time, Trump has occasionally thrown a wrench into Johnson's legislative agenda, including briefly derailing his plans over a controversial spying law in April.\n\nTrump's four sets of criminal charges could also shape the House GOP's legislative agenda this year. A number of Republicans support a bill led by Rep. Russell Fry, R-S.C., that would allow presidents and vice presidents to move civil and criminal state cases to federal court instead. Johnson said he supports the proposal, but a number of Republican lawmakers are skeptical about the legislation. In addition to his New York hush money case, Trump also faces state-level charges in Georgia over allegations he tried to steal the state in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe meetings may also serve another purpose: Giving Trump face time with several of the people he is considering as his running mate. That includes Sens. JD Vance, R-Ohio, Tim Scott, R-S.C., and Marco Rubio, R-Fla., as well as House members such as Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y. and Byron Donalds, R-Fla.\n\nRep. Marc Molinaro, R-N.Y., told reporters he expects to hear Trump give a \"lay of the land as he sees it\" of the 2024 elections. Other lawmakers told USA TODAY they expect the meeting to be critical towards building a working relationship between congressional Republicans and the former president should the GOP take full control of Washington, picking up the White House and the Senate and maintaining control of the House. That kind of sweep would be an uphill battle for either party.\n\n\"We're working on cementing this relationship now so when January 20th comes, we have a plan in place to work together with the White House and Congress,\" Rep. Mark Alford, R-Texas, said, noting a major part of the GOP agenda is renewing Trump's 2017 tax cuts, which expire in 2025.\n\n\"That's the main thing that we need to make sure we talk about: That we communicate for the next few months, have a plan going into January,\" said Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala. As for what is on the table? \"You name it. All the crap that we had to put up for four years.\"\n\nWhat does Mike Johnson want after 2024?\n\nJohnson also met with Senate Republicans over lunch Wednesday to begin discussions on a potential party-line package to chase next year.\n\nJohnson told reporters after the meeting that he expressed interest in enacting new tax and spending cuts. Tax cuts passed during the Trump administration are set to expire in 2025, which means the next president will have a significant opportunity to rewrite the country's tax code.\n\n\"I think now we're in the education\" phase of teaching members what can and cannot be accomplished using the unique legislative tool known as \"reconciliation,\" said Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C. Reconciliation can bypass the Senate's 60-vote threshold for certain budget legislation.\n\nDemocrats used the tool in the first two years of the Biden administration to pass sweeping clean energy tax credits and other policies in the Inflation Reduction Act, a massive piece of legislation that aimed to address issues from transportation and the environment to insulin prices.\n\n\"Then it's appropriate to start talking about, ok, what does a common agenda look like?\" Tillis said of his Republican colleagues. \"This is something we need to do pretty early in Trump's tenure.\"\n\nThis

He was embraced by GOP lawmakers who find themselves newly energized by his bid to retake the White House.\n\nDespite pending federal charges against Trump for conspiring to overturn the 2020 election, and his recent guilty verdict in an unrelated hush money trial, the Republican former president arrived emboldened as the party's presumptive nominee. He has successfully purged the GOP of critics, silenced most skeptics and enticed once-critical lawmakers aboard his MAGA-fueled campaign.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nA packed room of House Republicans sang \"Happy Birthday\" to Trump in a private breakfast meeting at GOP campaign headquarters across the street from the Capitol. The lawmakers gave him a baseball and bat from the annual congressional game. Trump bragged that even his telephone rallies for lawmakers could draw bigger crowds than mega-popstar Taylor Swift, who has yet to make any endorsement.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"There's tremendous unity in the Republican Party,\" Trump said in brief remarks later at Senate GOP headquarters.\n\nTrump spent about an hour each with House and Senate Republicans delivering free-wheeling remarks, fielding questions and discussing issues -- including Russia and immigration, tax cuts and other priorities for a potential second term.\n\nDuring the morning session, Trump said he thinks House Speaker Mike Johnson is doing a \"terrific job,\" according to a Republican in the private breakfast meeting and granted anonymity to discuss it. Trump asked Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the speaker's chief Republican critic, if she was being \"nice\" to Johnson, another Republican said.\n\n\"President Trump brought an extraordinary amount of energy, excitement and enthusiasm this morning,\" Johnson said afterward, noting high fund-raising tallies since the guilty verdict. \"We're feeling good.\"\n\nThe Republican speaker had demurred earlier over whether he's asked Trump to respect the peaceful transfer of presidential power and commit to not doing another Jan. 6. \"Of course he respects that, we all do, and we've all talked about it, ad nauseum.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThursday afternoon offered the first encounter in years between Trump and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, who once blamed Trump for the \"disgraceful\" attack that he called an \"insurrection\" but now endorses the party's presumptive nominee.\n\nMcConnell said Trump received standing ovations from the senators and the two \"had a really positive meeting.\" The senator said, \"He and I got a chance to talk a little bit, shook hands a few times.\"\n\nMany potential priorities for a new White House administration are being formulated by a constellation of outside groups, including Project 2025, laying the groundwork for executive and legislative actions, though Trump has made clear he has his own agenda.\n\nOn one major controversial issue, Trump told lawmakers that abortion rules should be left to the states and said he supported exceptions for rape, incest and to save the life of the mother, lawmakers said.\n\n\"Anybody who thought that this president was going to be down after the sham trial. it's only giving him even more energy,\" said Rep. Tom Emmer, the GOP whip. \"Donald Trump is crushing this election.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBut Trump's private meetings with House and Senate Republicans so close to the Capitol were infused with the symbolism of his return as the U.S. president who threatened the American tradition of the peaceful transfer of power.\n\n\"It's frustrating,\" said former U.S. Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn, who made his own unsuccessful run for Congress as a Maryland Democrat in the aftermath of Jan. 6, the day when police engaged in hand-to-hand fighting to stop Trump supporters who stormed the building in an effort to overturn President Joe Biden's election.\n\nDunn spoke of the \"irony\" of Trump returning to the area and lawmakers now embracing him. \"It just shows the lack of backbone they have when they're truly putting party and person over country,\" he said. \"And it's sad.\"\n\nBiden was overseas Thursday attending a summit of the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations, but the president's campaign unveiled a new ad blaming Trump for lighting the \"fire\" of Jan. 6 and threatening democracy.\n\nMany of those who once stood up to Trump are long gone from office and the Republicans who remain seem increasingly enthusiastic about the possibility of him retaking the White House, and the down-ballot windfall that could mean for their own GOP majorities in Congress.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nSen. John Thune, the GOP whip who is vying to replace McConnell as leader, told The Associated Press that he was interested in hearing from Trump about the fall election. \"I think there's an opportunity there to really make this a big win,\" he said.\n\nAs democracies around the world come under threat from a far-rightward shift, some analysts warn that the U.S. system, once seemingly immune from authoritarian impulses, is at risk of populist and extremist forces like those that Trump inspired to sack the Capitol.\n\n\"This is just another example of House Republicans bending the knee to Donald Trump,\" said Rep. Pete Aguilar of California, the chairman of the House Democratic caucus.\n\nMaking Jan. 6 a cornerstone of his reelection campaign, Trump celebrates those who stormed the Capitol as \"warriors\" and \"patriots,\" and he has vowed to pardon any number of the more than 1,300 convicted of crimes for the assault on the seat of U.S. democracy.\n\nMoreover, Trump has vowed to seek retribution by ousting officials at the U.S. Justice Department, which is prosecuting him in a four-count indictment to overturn the election ahead of the Jan. 6 attack and another case over storing classified documents at his Mar-A-Largo home.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nRepublicans, particularly in the House but increasingly in the Senate, are vigorously following his lead, complaining of an unfair justice system. Alongside Trump, the House and Senate GOP campaign arms scored some of their highest fundraising periods yet after a jury found him guilty in the New York hush money case.\n\nWhen former GOP Speaker Paul Ryan on Fox News reiterated this week that he wouldn't be voting for Trump and wished Republicans had another choice for president, he was immediately ostracized by Trump allies.\n\n\"Paul Ryan, you're a piece of garbage,\" said Rep. Troy Nehls, R-Texas. \"We should kick you out of the party.\"\n\nOf the Republicans who voted to impeach Trump over Jan. 6 and convict him on the charge of inciting the insurrection, only a few remain in office.\n\nSen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, had not been expected to attend Thursday's closed-door session with Trump. But Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, had a change of plans and was to join.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAlso Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said he would likely join the Trump meeting, expecting \"he's going to be the next president, so you have to work\" together.\n\nAsked if he was concerned about the direction of the Trump Republican Party, Cassidy said: \"Let the day's own troubles be sufficient for the day. You can fill yourself up with anxiety about tomorrow, but will it change a thing? No.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Jill Colvin, Farnoush Amiri, Kevin Freking, Mary Clare Jalonick and Stephen Groves contributed to this report.\n\nRead more on the U.S. Election at

However, since the historic guilty verdict, Republicans have largely lined up behind Trump, as he and President Biden continue to find themselves engaged in a tight race.\n\nIt will also be Trump's first public visit to the Capitol since the January 6, 2021 insurrection, in which a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol complex to prevent the certification of Biden's 2020 election victory Although Trump was not at the Capitol that day, his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election, including his actions before and during the attack, are at the heart of the federal charges against him.\n\nAsked Wednesday if he had spoken to Trump about his commitment to a peaceful transfer of power, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said of course. [Trump] respect that, and we all do.\n\n\"We're very happy to welcome back President Trump. There's great anticipation and great excitement here, and I feel great,\" Johnson said, later adding that GOP lawmakers were eager to talk about the plans after November and bouncing off ideas with [Trump] tomorrow.\n\nTrump is first expected to meet with House Republicans at 9:30 a.m. Thursday at the Capitol Hill Club, just steps from the Capitol, followed by another meeting with Senate Republicans also very close to the Capitol at 12:30 p.m.\n\nA Trump campaign official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the meeting, said it would focus on how Republicans can work together to advance policies to save America .\n\nHouse Republican leaders briefed conference members at their weekly meeting on Wednesday about Trump's visit the next day, urging lawmakers to arrive early at the Capitol Hill Club ahead of the gathering. Few details were given about what might be discussed with Trump, who is the Republican Party's presumptive presidential nominee.\n\nI don't know what the point is [of Trumps visit] East. I found out along with everyone else, Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) said Wednesday morning. So, just happy to entertain the former president and hopefully the next president of the United States. Well, see what he has in mind.\n\nSeveral Republican lawmakers said Wednesday they expected Trump to brief them on what he sees as the top concerns of the American people and to outline a role for how lawmakers could support his re-election efforts over the next five months.\n\nWe don't have time to let personalities get in the way, Rep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) said Wednesday, later adding: To me, it's about righting the country, saving the country.\n\nNorman, who supported former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley in the primary, said he would also continue to push her to become Trump's running mate.\n\nA moderate House Republican, who represents a swing district and spoke on condition of anonymity to freely discuss the meeting, said he was bracing for chaos. But Rep. Nick LaLota (R-N.Y.), a moderate from a swing district, rejected the idea that the Thursday meeting could become tense.\n\n\"I think it will be a meeting focused on morale building and team building, where I expect morale to be good,\" he said.\n\nAsked if he was excited about Trump's visit, Rep. Chip Roy (R-Tex.), one of the former president's main GOP antagonists at the Capitol, said he anticipated definitely to attend. Roy said he thinks Republicans need to have a conversation about what we want to accomplish in Spring 25, to talk about the agenda and policies we should address.\n\nI mean, people keep throwing around phrases like reconciliation and all that, but what's that going to mean? what are we doing? What are we doing about tax policy? What are we actually going to do at the border? Roy said. So we need to be very clear about these things. So I hope to be able to talk about it tomorrow.\n\nRepublican senators were asked to expect to hear directly from President Trump when they meet about his plans for the summer and also share our ideas on a strategic government agenda for 2025, according to an invitation obtained by the Washington Post.\n\nTrump has clashed with Senate Republicans in the past, even though the majority of conference attendees strongly support him. Trump is also considering some conference members as his running mates, including Senators JD Vance of Ohio and Tim Scott of South Carolina.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) plans to attend the meeting, which will mark the first time he and Trump have spoken since shortly after the 2020 election.\n\nMcConnell broke with Trump over his refusal to accept the results of the 2020 election and over the Jan. 6 attack, for which McConnell called Trump practically and morally responsible. Trump also later attacked McConnell's wife, former Trump Cabinet Secretary Elaine Chao, in racist terms. But McConnell, who is retiring as leader after the 2024 election, has already supported Trump's re-election, saying it's no surprise that as a candidate he has my support.\n\nAt least one Senate Republican who disagrees with Trump will not attend: Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who voted to convict him after the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol. She told reporters this week that she had a conflict and could not attend Thursday's meeting.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) disparaged the Republican Party's agenda ahead of the meeting Wednesday, saying Republicans' only policy idea was to recycle the same Trump tax cuts which proved to be unsuccessful seven years ago.\n\nTrump demonstrated his power over Senate Republicans from afar when he helped defeat bipartisan border security legislation earlier this year that would have cracked down on asylum applications at the U.S. border. Mexico.\n\nAlthough Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) led the GOP negotiations on the bipartisan legislation, after Trump made his opposition clear, Senate Republicans overwhelmingly abandoned the bill. Senate Republicans rejected the bill a second time last month.\n\nSome moderate House Republicans are still considering not attending their meeting with Trump, which could dampen his attempt to unify the conference. Trump is aware of GOP disunity, according to Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.), who said he speaks to Trump frequently.\n\nBut Donalds, who is reportedly being considered as Trump's running mate, encouraged even lawmakers critical of Trump to attend the meeting.\n\nI think if you just want to be a distraction for the sake of distractions, he has little patience for that but frankly, I have little patience for that, Donalds said Wednesday. So I think members should introduce themselves. They should leave. It will be a full house.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), one of Trump's top allies in the House, downplayed the possibility of tensions resulting Thursday from the presence of figures such as Rep. Bob Good (R-Va.), who is involved in a conflict. public feud with Trump after initially not supporting him in the GOP primary.\n\nI don't think President Trump even cares whether Good is in the room or not, Greene said.\n\nMarianne LeVine contributed to this report.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news",

Matt Gaetz of Florida, a fierce Trump ally, told CNN. \"I think it's gonna be a pep rally environment for the former and future president.\"\n\nAhead of the meeting, Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn noted it would be \"nice\" to \"get everybody singing from the same sheet of music.\" Cornyn has previously criticized Trump and said he preferred to see the GOP move in a different direction, before ultimately endorsing the former president in January.\n\nSenior campaign advisers said Trump was expected to express his campaign priorities and policies -- focusing on the economy, inflation, tax cuts and immigration during his meetings, first with House Republicans at the Capitol Hill club in the morning and then with Senate Republicans at the nearby National Republican Senatorial Committee building. He'll also reiterate his commitment to not cutting entitlement programs for seniors like Social Security and Medicare.\n\n\"We want to get everyone on the same page talking about policy, including the economy and inflation,\" one senior Trump adviser told CNN. \"That's the biggest factor in all the polling, it's the biggest thing people are worried about.\"\n\nTrump, who will be accompanied by his two top campaign officials, Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, among others, is also expected to discuss details around a potential second term agenda, including how to immediately implement his policy goals, with the help of lawmakers, if reelected to the White House. Meanwhile, House Republicans have been eager for information to help them jumpstart legislative action on Capitol Hill next year.\n\n\"We want to be part of that plan to hit the ground running,\" GOP Rep. Darrell Issa of California told CNN. \"When most presidents get elected, they anticipate they have eight years. This president knows he has four.\"\n\nAdvisers said the meetings would also be an opportunity to allow lawmakers to ask questions or bring up any pressing matters ahead of the November election, with Trump planning to open the floor to members after his remarks.\n\nHouse Majority Steve Scalise told CNN he's already talked to Trump directly about using a special budgetary tool to avoid the 60-vote threshold in the Senate - known as reconciliation - to advance tax cuts, border wall funding and other priorities if Republicans control all of Washington.\n\nSome of Trump's plans for a second term agenda have been outlined by the former President himself during rallies and interviews, including mass deportations of undocumented immigrants and leaving reproductive rights to the states, but other elements have been only proposed vaguely or behind closed doors, and leaked out by media outlets.\n\nTrump's reception among House and Senate Republicans is likely to vary\n\nSen. John Barrasso, the third-ranking Senate Republican, invited the full GOP conference to the Thursday event.\n\nHowever, some senators skeptical of Trump would not commit to attending. Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine, among a handful of GOP senators who have not endorsed Trump's 2024 election bid, are not attending, citing scheduling conflicts. Sen. Todd Young of Indiana wouldn't say if he was planning to attend, adding that he wasn't talking about Trump this week.\n\nThough Trump won't be inside the US Capitol building, his appearance on the Hill will also mark his first time meeting with some key Republicans since the January 6, 2021, insurrection there, including Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nMcConnell, who has maintained an icy relationship with the former president ever since the Capitol attack, told CNN he will attend the meeting. The two have not spoken since the electoral college certified Joe Biden's victory in December 2020, though McConnell endorsed Trump earlier this year.\n\nAny tension is likely to be balanced out by some of Trump's biggest cheerleaders and potential vice-presidential picks, who will also be in attendance, including Sens. Tim Scott, Marco Rubio and JD Vance.\n\nOf those attending, many said they were looking for a more urgent focus, including Trump laying out a specific strategy to beat President Joe Biden.\n\n\"I will be honest with you. To think that we are going to talk a whole lot about a governing agenda on Thursday seems a little na\u00efve to me. That's like measuring the curtains,\" said Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina. \"This is about winning in November, and my guess is we may touch on the agenda next year, but that's a multi-variable equation not the least of which is how well we do here in Congress to take the gavels back.\"\n\nOthers see it as an opportunity to try and reset the party after months of internal tensions over the future of House Speaker Mike Johnson, aiding the war in Ukraine and the divisions over the best strategy on border security.\n\nIn the House, a chamber that has traditionally been friendlier to Trump, members said the former president will find a supportive and enthusiastic audience, including some dressed to impress.\n\n\"I just think he wants to get everybody on the same page,\" said Sen. Markwayne Mullin, a key Trump ally. \"There's been a little tension there in the Senate. And so it's just trying to keep the tension from building and saying our focus is Joe Biden and this administration, not each other.\"\n\nGOP Rep. Troy Nehls said he has several different Trump ties to choose from, though he complained that his gold, Trump-branded sneakers are back in Texas.\n\n\"He will know that I support him 110%, and I will do everything I can to fight like hell to make sure that he's the next president,\" Nehls said.\n\nRep. Elise Stefanik, who - as Republican conference chair - was in charge of organizing the House meeting, will also chair the event. Stefanik is one of a short list of vice presidential hopefuls to receive vetting materials from the Trump campaign. Rep. Byron Donalds is also on that list and is expected to attend Thursday.\n\nTrump's visit comes as House GOP leadership is facing increasing pressure from the right flank to go after the Justice Department and defend Trump in the wake of his hush money conviction in New York.\n\nOne legislative proposal Republican leaders are now actively pursuing is a bill that would allow current and former presidents to move state-level cases to federal court. The legislation passed out of committee last September, but GOP leaders only started formally whipping the bill this week - on the eve of Trump's Capitol Hill visit and two weeks after his conviction.\n\nOne thing both House and Senate Republicans agreed on: Trump was unlikely to stay on message.\n\nWhen asked if they believe Trump will discuss policy plans and campaign strategy and while avoiding airing his grievances, one GOP lawmaker told CNN, \"You know the answer to that. It ain't in his DNA.\"\n\n\"What do I expect? You have no idea what Trump is going to talk about. It's just totally unpredictable,\" said Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [{"uri": "melanie_zanona@yahoo.com", "name": "Melanie Zanona", "type":

The meeting was behind closed doors, but multiple sources told ABC News the former president praised House Speaker Mike Johnson as doing a \"good job.\"\n\nTrump also criticized the Department of Justice as \"dirty bastards\" as he aired grievances about his legal challenges.\n\nThe meeting unfolded as the Supreme Court handed down a major decision preserving access to the abortion pill mifepristone. Sources told ABC News Trump did not mention the decision directly, but did discuss his view that abortion access should be decided by the states. He also insisted he believed in three exceptions to abortion restrictions: rape, incest and to save the life of the mother.\n\nPolitically, Trump told Republicans they could have a 40-seat majority in the House if they weren't so \"afraid\" of the issue, according to sources.\n\nHe also went after Democrats like former Speaker Nancy Pelosi and former Rep. Liz Cheney, sources said. Both Pelosi and Cheney, despite being on opposite sides of the aisle, are staunch critics of the former president.\n\nLater on Thursday, Trump will meet with Senate Republicans at the National Republican Senatorial Committee headquarters, where he will hold a news conference afterward.\n\nDuring the meetings, campaign officials say Trump will lay out his policy plans on immigration, entitlement programs and the economy.\n\n\"Looking ahead at the policies that will save the nation such as Trump's commitment to no impact on seniors with any cuts to Social Security or Medicare, policies that actually secure our borders and make our communities safe again, and an America first foreign policy that reclaims peace through strength and world leadership, and economic policies of lower taxes that reignite the vibrant trump economy we had just a few years ago,\" a campaign official said.\n\nTrump's last visit with Republicans happened while he was president in September 2020, when he gave remarks at the same members-only Republican club.\n\nTrump has stayed off the U.S. Capitol campus entirely since he left office shortly after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack. The closest he's come is when he met the executive board of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters near the Capitol building on Jan. 31.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is expected to attend the Thursday meeting between Trump and Senate Republicans.\n\nWhile Johnson and Trump have worked together on key issues since Johnson's rise to the speakership last fall, it will be the first time since 2020 that McConnell and Trump meet face-to-face.\n\nMcConnell and Trump have a rocky relationship, heightened after McConnell recognized President Joe Biden's victory in the wake of Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nMcConnell, asked on Wednesday if he planned to \"confront\" Trump about their disagreements, dodged the question and repeated his usual support for the Republican \"nominee.\"\n\n\"I said three years ago, right after the Capitol was attacked, that I would support our nominee regardless of who it was -- including him,\" McConnell told reporters. \"I've said earlier this year, I support him -- he's earned the nomination by the voters all across the country. And of course, I'll be at the meeting tomorrow.\"\n\nJohnson has openly embraced Trump, who was crucial in supporting him when he faced the threat of being ousted threat by conservative GOP House hard-liners, saying coordination with Trump is important heading into November's election and a potential second Trump presidency.\n\n\"I think it's important for the country, to have us, to have close coordination,\" Johnson said at a news conference on Wednesday. \"I believe he'll have, can be, the most consequential president of the modern era, because we have to fix effectively every area of public policy.\"\n\nAt that news conference, Johnson also told ABC News he supports a bill that would allow current or former presidents to move state charges against them into federal court -- a measure aimed at showing support for Trump after being found guilty in his hush money trial in a New York state court.\n\n\"I think that's an idea that makes sense. It makes sense to most Republicans, and I think almost everyone will be in favor of that,\"\n\nAfter the Thursday morning meeting, Johnson said that Trump \"didn't bring up that specific piece of legislation.\"\n\n\"He did talk about his concern about the lawfare that's been waged against him -- and we all know it -- and I made the point in my introduction that it's backfired fantastically,\" Johnson said. \"President Trump has become a symbol of pushing back against corruption, the deep state of the weaponization of judicial system and that's a very encouraging development. So, I think that he made the point every time they indicted him, his polls went up.\"\n\nHowever, not every Republican is set to fully welcome back Trump when he comes to the nation's capital.\n\nSens. Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, who have been vocal Trump critics, have blamed previous conflicts as a reason for why they couldn't attend the meeting with Trump.\n\nSen. Mitt Romney, who had earlier said he needed to catch a flight, at midday Thursday said the flight had been canceled and he would be there.\n\nAll three voted with Republicans to impeach Trump for his actions related to Jan. 6.\n\nThe group of political meetings comes as Trump is scheduled to be in Washington D.C. to participate in a moderated discussion at a quarterly meeting of the Business Roundtable, a group consisting of more than 200 CEOs. Business Roundtable spokesman Michael Steel said the group invited both presumptive presidential nominees, but with Biden overseas to attend the G7 summit, White House chief of staff Jeff Zients is slated to appear.", "source": {"uri": "weisradio.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WEIS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki",

GOP lawmakers find themselves newly energized and reinvigorated by his bid to retake the White House.\n\nDespite the federal charges against Trump for conspiring to overturn the 2020 election, and his recent guilty verdict in an unrelated hush money trial, the Republican former president arrived emboldened as the party's presumptive nominee. He has successfully purged the GOP of critics, silenced most skeptics and enticed once-critical lawmakers aboard his MAGA-fueled campaign.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber?

John Thune, the GOP whip who is vying to replace McConnell as leader, told The Associated Press that he's interested in hearing from Trump about the fall election and \"ways in which we, as a team, and him individually can appeal to the constituencies and people that may not traditionally vote Republican.\"\n\nThune said, \"I think there's an opportunity there to really make this a big win.\"\n\nAs democracies around the world come under threat from a far-rightward shift, experts warn that the U.S. system, once seemingly immune from authoritarian impulses, is at risk of populist and extremist forces like those that Trump inspired to sack the Capitol.\n\n\"This is just another example of House Republicans bending the knee to Donald Trump,\" said Rep. Pete Aguilar of California, the chairman of the House Democratic caucus.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nMaking Jan. 6 a cornerstone of his reelection campaign, Trump celebrates those who stormed the Capitol as \"warriors\" and \"patriots,\" and he has vowed to pardon any number of the more than 1,300 America convicted of crimes for the assault on the seat of U.S. democracy.\n\nMoreover, Trump has vowed to seek retribution by ousting officials at the U.S. Justice Department, which is prosecuting him in a four-count indictment to overturn the election ahead of the Jan. 6 attack and another case over storing classified documents at his Mar-A-Largo home.\n\nRepublicans, particularly in the House but increasingly in the Senate, are vigorously following his lead, complaining of an unfair justice system. The House voted to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress and is re-investigating the House committee that investigated Jan. 6.\n\nAlongside Trump, the House and Senate GOP campaign arms scored some of their highest fundraising periods yet after a jury found him guilty in the New York hush money case.\n\nWhen former GOP Speaker Paul Ryan on Fox News reiterated this week that he wouldn't be voting for Trump and wished Republicans had another choice for president, he was immediately ostracized by Trump allies.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"Paul Ryan, you're a piece of garbage,\" said Rep. Troy Nehls, R-Texas. \"We should kick you out of the party.\"\n\nOf the Republicans who voted to impeach Trump over Jan. 6 and convict him on the charge of inciting the insurrection, only a few remain in office.\n\nSen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, are not expected to attend Thursday's closed-door session with Trump.\n\nBut Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said he would likely join the Trump meeting at GOP senators' campaign headquarters, expecting \"he's going to be the next president, so you have to work\" together.\n\nAsked if he was concerned about the direction of the Trump Republican Party, Cassidy: \"Let the day's own troubles be sufficient for the day. You can fill yourself up with anxiety about tomorrow, but will it change a thing? No.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nSen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who confronted Trump at times but did not join in the vote to convict him in the Capitol attack, said he did not expect the meeting to be contentious as Republicans hope to seize the Senate majority this fall.\n\n\"Look, we've got to win. And our ability to get a majority in the Senate is intrinsically linked to Trump winning. So we're like, one team, one vision. And I think that will be largely what we talk about,\" Tillis said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Jill Colvin and Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.\n\nRead more on the U.S. Election

(Eric Thayer for The Washington Post)\n\nFormer president Donald Trump plans to return to Washington on Thursday to meet with congressional Republicans near the U.S. Capitol, as the GOP tries to present a united front and coalesce around a policy agenda heading into the November elections.\n\nThe trip will be Trump's first meeting with GOP lawmakers since a jury found him guilty on all 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in his New York hush money case, making Trump the first former U.S. president convicted of a crime. Since the historic guilty verdict, however, Republicans have largely fallen in line behind Trump, as he and President Biden continue to be locked in a tight race.\n\nIt will also be Trump's first public visit to Capitol Hill since the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection, in which a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol complex to stop the certification of Biden's 2020 electoral win. Though Trump was not at the Capitol that day, his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results, including his actions leading up to and during the attack, are at the heart of federal charges against him.\n\nAsked Wednesday if he had spoken to Trump about committing to a peaceful transfer of power, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said \"of course [Trump] respects that, and we all do.\"\n\n\"We're very excited to welcome President Trump back. ... There's high anticipation here and great excitement, and I feel good,\" Johnson said, later adding that GOP lawmakers were anxious to talk about plans after November and \"bounce around ideas with [Trump] tomorrow.\"\n\nTrump is scheduled to meet first with House Republicans at 9:30 a.m. Thursday at the Capitol Hill Club -- steps from the Capitol -- followed by another meeting with Senate Republicans also very near the Capitol at 12:30 p.m.\n\nA Trump campaign official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the meeting said it would be \"forward focused on how Republicans can work together to advance policies to save America.\"\n\nHouse Republican leaders briefed conference members during their weekly meeting Wednesday about Trump's visit the next day, urging lawmakers to arrive early to the Capitol Hill Club before the gathering. There were few specifics given about what might be discussed with Trump, who is the presumptive GOP presidential nominee.\n\n\"I don't know what the purpose [of Trump's visit] is. I found out about it with everybody else,\" Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) said Wednesday morning. \"So, just happy to entertain the former president and hopefully the next president of the United States. We'll see what he has on his mind.\"\n\nSeveral Republican lawmakers said Wednesday they expected Trump to update them on what he saw as top concerns for the American people and to lay out a role for how lawmakers could support his reelection efforts over the next five months.\n\n\"We don't have time to let personalities get in the way,\" Rep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) said Wednesday, later adding: \"With me, it's about turning the country around, saving it.\"\n\nNorman, who endorsed former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley during the primary, said he also would continue pushing her to be Trump's running mate.\n\nOne moderate House Republican, who represents a swing district and who spoke on the condition of anonymity to freely discuss the meeting, said they were bracing for chaos.\n\nSome moderate Republicans are still contemplating not attending, possibly stunting Trump's attempt to unite the conference. Trump is aware of GOP disunity, according to Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.), who said he speaks to Trump frequently.\n\nBut Donalds, who is reported to be under consideration to be Trump's running mate, encouraged even those lawmakers critical of Trump to attend the meeting.\n\n\"I think that if you're just gonna go around just being a distraction for distraction's sake, he has little patience for that -- but quite frankly, I got little patience for that,\" Donalds said Wednesday. \"So I think members should show up. They should go. It'll be a packed house.\"\n\nSenate Republicans were told to expect in their meeting \"to hear directly from President Trump about his plans for the summer and to also share our ideas for a strategic governing agenda for 2025,\" according to an invitation obtained by The Washington Post.\n\nTrump has had conflicts with Senate Republicans in the past, although the majority of the conference is staunchly behind him. Trump is also considering some members of the conference to be his running mate, including Sens. J.D. Vance of Ohio and Tim Scott of South Carolina.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) plans to attend the meeting, which will mark the first time he and Trump have spoken to each other since shortly after the 2020 election.\n\nMcConnell broke with Trump over his refusal to accept the 2020 election results then and over the Jan. 6 attack, for which McConnell called Trump \"practically and morally responsible.\" Trump also later attacked McConnell's wife -- former Trump Cabinet secretary Elaine Chao -- in racist terms. But McConnell, who is retiring as leader after the 2024 election, has already endorsed Trump for reelection, saying \"it should come as no surprise that as nominee, he will have my support.\"\n\nAt least one Senate Republican who has disagreed with Trump won't attend: Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who voted to convict him after the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. She told reporters this week she had a conflict and could not make the Thursday meeting.\n\nOn Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) disparaged the GOP agenda ahead of the meeting, saying Republicans' only policy idea was to recycle \"the same Trump tax cuts that proved to be a dud seven years ago.\"\n\nTrump displayed his power over Senate Republicans from afar when he helped kill bipartisan border security legislation earlier this year that would have cracked down on asylum claims at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThough Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) led the GOP's negotiations on the bipartisan legislation, after Trump made his opposition clear, Senate Republicans defected from the bill en masse. Senate Republicans rejected the bill a second time last month.", "source": {"uri": "stripes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Stars and Stripes"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Matt Gaetz of Florida, a fierce Trump ally, told CNN. \"I think it's gonna be a pep rally environment for the former and future president.\"\n\nAhead of the meeting, Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn noted it would be \"nice\" to \"get everybody singing from the same sheet of music.\" Cornyn has previously criticized Trump and said he preferred to see the GOP move in a different direction, before ultimately endorsing the former president in January.\n\nSenior campaign advisers said Trump was expected to express his campaign priorities and policies -- focusing on the economy, inflation, tax cuts and immigration during his meetings, first with House Republicans at the Capitol Hill club in the morning and then with Senate Republicans at the nearby National Republican Senatorial Committee building. He'll also reiterate his commitment to not cutting entitlement programs for seniors like Social Security and Medicare.\n\n\"We want to get everyone on the same page talking about policy, including the economy and inflation,\" one senior Trump adviser told CNN. \"That's the biggest factor in all the polling, it's the biggest thing people are worried about.\"\n\nTrump, who will be accompanied by his two top campaign officials, Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, among others, is also expected to discuss details around a potential second term agenda, including how to immediately implement his policy goals, with the help of lawmakers, if reelected to the White House. Meanwhile, House Republicans have been eager for information to help them jumpstart legislative action on Capitol Hill next year.\n\n\"We want to be part of that plan to hit the ground running,\" GOP Rep. Darrell Issa of California told CNN. \"When most presidents get elected, they anticipate they have eight years. This president knows he has four.\"\n\nAdvisers said the meetings would also be an opportunity to allow lawmakers to ask questions or bring up any pressing matters ahead of the November election, with Trump planning to open the floor to members after his remarks.\n\nHouse Majority Steve Scalise told CNN he's already talked to Trump directly about using a special budgetary tool to avoid the 60-vote threshold in the Senate - known as reconciliation - to advance tax cuts, border wall funding and other priorities if Republicans control all of Washington.\n\nSome of Trump's plans for a second term agenda have been outlined by the former President himself during rallies and interviews, including mass deportations of undocumented immigrants and leaving reproductive rights to the states, but other elements have been only proposed vaguely or behind closed doors, and leaked out by media outlets.\n\nSen. John Barrasso, the third-ranking Senate Republican, invited the full GOP conference to the Thursday event.\n\nHowever some senators skeptical of Trump would not commit to attending. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, one of a handful of GOP senators who have not endorsed Trump's 2024 election bid, said she would not attend due to a conflict. Sen. Todd Young of Indiana wouldn't say if he was planning to attend, adding that he wasn't talking about Trump this week.\n\nThough Trump won't be inside the US Capitol building, his appearance on the Hill will also mark his first time meeting with some key Republicans since the January 6, 2021, insurrection there, including Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nMcConnell, who has maintained an icy relationship with the former president ever since the Capitol attack, told CNN he will attend the meeting. The two have not spoken since the electoral college certified Joe Biden's victory in December 2020, however McConnell endorsed Trump earlier this year.\n\nAny tension is likely to be balanced out by some of Trump's biggest cheerleaders and potential vice-presidential picks, who will also be in attendance, including Sens. Tim Scott, Marco Rubio and JD Vance.\n\nOf those attending, many said they were looking for a more urgent focus, including Trump laying out a specific strategy to beat President Joe Biden.\n\n\"I will be honest with you. To think that we are going to talk a whole lot about a governing agenda on Thursday seems a little na\u00efve to me. That's like measuring the curtains,\" said Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina. \"This is about winning in November, and my guess is we may touch on the agenda next year, but that's a multi-variable equation not the least of which is how well we do here in Congress to take the gavels back.\"\n\nOthers see it as an opportunity to try and reset the party after months of internal tensions over the future of House Speaker Mike Johnson, aiding the war in Ukraine and the divisions over the best strategy on border security.\n\nIn the House, a chamber that has traditionally been friendlier to Trump, members said the former president will find a supportive and enthusiastic audience, including some dressed to impress.\n\n\"I just think he wants to get everybody on the same page,\" said Sen. Markwayne Mullin, a key Trump ally. \"There's been a little tension there in the Senate. And so it's just trying to keep the tension from building and saying our focus is Joe Biden and this administration, not each other.\"\n\nGOP Rep. Troy Nehls said he has several different Trump ties to choose from, though he complained that his gold, Trump-branded sneakers are back in Texas.\n\n\"He will know that I support him 110%, and I will do everything I can to fight like hell to make sure that he's the next president,\" Nehls said.\n\nRep. Elise Stefanik, who - as Republican conference chair - was in charge of organizing the House meeting, will also chair the event. Stefanik is one of a short list of vice presidential hopefuls to receive vetting materials from the Trump campaign. Rep. Byron Donalds is also on that list and is expected to attend Thursday.\n\nTrump's visit comes as House GOP leadership is facing increasing pressure from the right flank to go after the Justice Department and defend Trump in the wake of his hush money conviction in New York.\n\nOne legislative proposal Republican leaders are now actively pursuing is a bill that would allow current and former presidents to move state-level cases to federal court. The legislation passed out of committee last September, but GOP leaders only started formally whipping the bill this week - on the eve of Trump's Capitol Hill visit and two weeks after his conviction.\n\nOne thing both House and Senate Republicans agreed on: Trump was unlikely to stay on message.\n\nWhen asked if they believe Trump will discuss policy plans and campaign strategy and while avoiding airing his grievances, one GOP lawmaker told CNN, \"You know the answer to that. It ain't in his DNA.\"\n\n\"What do I expect? You have no idea what Trump is going to talk about. It's just totally unpredictable,\" said Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa. -- CNN", "source": {"uri": "saudigazette.com.sa", "dataType": "news", "title": "Saudi Gazette"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

He has successfully purged the GOP of critics, silenced most skeptics and enticed once-critical lawmakers aboard his MAGA-fueled campaign.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nA packed room of House Republicans sang \"Happy Birthday\" to Trump in a private breakfast meeting at GOP campaign headquarters across the street from the Capitol. The lawmakers gave him a baseball and bat from the annual congressional game, and senators later presented an American flag cake with \"45\" candles -- and then \"47\" -- referring to the next presidency. Trump bragged that even his telephone rallies for lawmakers could draw bigger crowds than mega-popstar Taylor Swift, who has yet to make any endorsement.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIn one remarkable moment, Trump and his most prominent Republican critic, Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell, shook hands, and fist-bumped.\n\n\"There's tremendous unity in the Republican Party,\" Trump said in brief remarks at Senate GOP headquarters.\n\nTrump spent about an hour each with House and Senate Republicans delivering free-wheeling remarks, fielding questions and discussing issues -- including Russia and immigration, tax cuts and other priorities for a potential second term.\n\nDuring the morning session, Trump said House Speaker Mike Johnson is doing a \"terrific job,\" according to a Republican in the private meeting and granted anonymity to discuss it. Trump asked Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the speaker's chief Republican critic, if she was being \"nice\" to Johnson, another Republican said.\n\n\"President Trump brought an extraordinary amount of energy, excitement and enthusiasm this morning,\" Johnson said afterward, noting high fund-raising tallies since the guilty verdict. \"We're feeling good.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe Republican speaker had demurred earlier over whether he's asked Trump to respect the peaceful transfer of presidential power and commit to not doing another Jan. 6. \"Of course he respects that, we all do, and we've all talked about it, ad nauseum.\"\n\nMany potential priorities for a new White House administration are being formulated by a constellation of outside groups, including Project 2025, laying the groundwork for executive and legislative actions, though Trump has made clear he has his own agenda.\n\n\"Anybody who thought that this president was going to be down after the sham trial. it's only giving him even more energy,\" said Rep. Tom Emmer, the GOP whip. \"Donald Trump is crushing this election.\"\n\nBut Trump's private meetings with House and Senate Republicans so close to the Capitol were infused with the symbolism of his return as the U.S. president who threatened the American tradition of the peaceful transfer of power.\n\n\"It's frustrating,\" said former U.S. Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn, who made his own unsuccessful run for Congress as a Maryland Democrat in the aftermath of Jan. 6, the day when police engaged in hand-to-hand fighting to stop Trump supporters who stormed the building in an effort to overturn President Joe Biden's election.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nDunn spoke of the \"irony\" of Trump returning to the area and lawmakers now embracing him. \"It just shows the lack of backbone they have when they're truly putting party and person over country,\" he said. \"And it's sad.\"\n\nBiden was overseas Thursday attending a summit of the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations, but the president's campaign unveiled a new ad blaming Trump for lighting the \"fire\" of Jan. 6 and threatening democracy.\n\nMany of those who once stood up to Trump are long gone from office and the Republicans who remain seem increasingly enthusiastic about the possibility of him retaking the White House, and the down-ballot windfall that could mean for their own GOP majorities in Congress.\n\nThursday afternoon offered the first encounter in years between Trump and McConnell, who once blamed Trump for the \"disgraceful\" attack that he called an \"insurrection\" but now endorses the party's presumptive nominee.\n\nTrump addressed the situation directly, saying he intends to work with everyone and that McConnell had \"done his best\" as leader, said Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., an ally of the former president.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAccording to Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., who organized the conference meeting, after Trump addressed the group McConnell gave a thumbs up and the two approached each other and exchanged the fist-bump.\n\n\"We had a really positive meeting,\" McConnell said. \"He and I got a chance to talk a little bit, shook hands a few times.\"\n\nAs democracies around the world come under threat from a far-rightward shift, some analysts warn that the U.S. system, once seemingly immune from authoritarian impulses, is at risk of populist and extremist forces like those that Trump inspired to sack the Capitol.\n\n\"This is just another example of House Republicans bending the knee to Donald Trump,\" said Rep. Pete Aguilar of California, the chairman of the House Democratic caucus.\n\nMaking Jan. 6 a cornerstone of his reelection campaign, Trump celebrates those who stormed the Capitol as \"warriors\" and \"patriots,\" and he has vowed to pardon any number of the more than 1,200 people charged with crimes for the assault on the seat of U.S. democracy.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nMoreover, Trump has vowed to seek retribution by ousting officials at the U.S. Justice Department, which is prosecuting him in a four-count indictment to overturn the election ahead of the Jan. 6 attack and another case over storing classified documents at his Mar-A-Largo home.\n\nRepublicans, particularly in the House but increasingly in the Senate, are vigorously following his lead, complaining of an unfair justice system. It's having noticeable results: the House and Senate GOP campaign arms scored some of their highest fundraising periods yet after a jury found him guilty in the New York hush money case.\n\nWhen former GOP Speaker Paul Ryan on Fox News reiterated this week that he wouldn't be voting for Trump and wished Republicans had another choice for president, he was immediately ostracized by Trump allies.\n\n\"Paul Ryan, you're a piece of garbage,\" said Rep. Troy Nehls, R-Texas. \"We should kick you out of the party.\"\n\nOf the Republicans who voted to impeach Trump over Jan. 6 and convict him on the charge of inciting the insurrection, only a few remain in office.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nSen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, had not been expected to attend Thursday's closed-door session with Trump. But Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, joined as did Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La.\n\nCassidy said he's attending the Trump meeting expecting \"he's going to be the next president, so you have to work\" together.\n\nAsked if he was concerned about the direction of the Trump Republican Party, Cassidy said: \"Let the day's own troubles be sufficient for the day. You can fill yourself up with anxiety about tomorrow, but will it change a thing? No.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Jill Colvin, Farnoush Amiri, Kevin Freking, Mary Clare Jalonick and Stephen Groves contributed to this report.", "source": {"uri":

Will they lay out a 2025 wish list?", "body": "Donald Trump held a rally in 104-degree weather at a park in Las Vegas. Thousands of supporters showed up but some collapsed from the heat.\n\nWASHINGTON - Former President Donald Trump will meet with Republican lawmakers Thursday to discuss campaign strategies and lay out their wish list if they defeat Democrats in November.\n\nIt's the first time Trump has returned to Capitol Hill since leaving office nearly four years ago, and the trip provides an opportunity for conservative leaders to plot which policy priorities they'll pursue if reelected.\n\nThe meetings with both House and Senate lawmakers also align with a meeting with the Business Roundtable, a powerful cohort of some of the country's largest companies that will host the former president while he's in the nation's capital. Trump is slated to meet with House Republican lawmakers in the morning at the Capitol Hill Club and Senate Republicans in the afternoon at the National Republican Senatorial Committee office, both locations adjacent to the Capitol grounds.\n\nThe visit comes after Trump was convicted by a New York jury in his hush money trial and weeks before he is slated to be formally nominated at the Republican National Convention. The twin meetings with congressional Republicans are supposed to help shore up unity in the party that has, at times, struggled to agree on major policy priorities, such as providing additional aid to Ukraine.\n\nHowever, some moderate members are expected to skip the meeting, such as Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Mitt Romney, R-Utah. Several of their peers insisted that's not necessarily a problem.\n\n\"I think there's lots of reasons for people to not show up,\" including scheduling conflicts, said Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D. \"It's a grand opportunity for us all to get together to kick off the official campaign but also to prepare, possibly, for a transition.\"\n\nDonald Trump, Mitch McConnell will meet for the first time in years as GOP leaders gather\n\nTop Republicans in Congress are expected to attend the meetings Thursday. That includes Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who has not met in-person with the former president since 2020. The two have had a frosty relationship after McConnell accepted the results of the 2020 presidential election and blamed the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack on Trump.\n\nMcConnell declined to say if he would bring up the animosity with the former president at the Senate meeting, reiterating that he intended to support the 2024 GOP nominee, whoever it may be. However, the Kentucky Republican declined to even reference Trump by name.\n\n\"I've said earlier this year I support him. He's earned the nomination by the voters all across the country and of course I'll be at the meeting tomorrow,\" McConnell told reporters.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., on the other hand, is a stalwart Trump ally, having served on the former president's defense team during his first impeachment trial. The speaker told reporters Wednesday morning he wants to use the meetings to lay out a clear-cut conservative agenda should the GOP sweep the coming elections.\n\n\"When (Trump) comes in, we got to have a very aggressive first 100 days agenda. The first year will be important and I think we cannot waste a moment,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said\n\nTrump's visit is important for Johnson's leadership post as well. The former president defended the speaker from Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's threat to oust him last month. At the same time, Trump has occasionally thrown a wrench into Johnson's legislative agenda, including briefly derailing his plans over a controversial spying law in April.\n\nTrump's four sets of criminal charges could also shape the House GOP's legislative agenda this year. A number of Republicans support a bill led by Rep. Russell Fry, R-S.C., that would allow presidents and vice presidents to move civil and criminal state cases to federal court instead. Johnson said he supports the proposal, but a number of Republican lawmakers are skeptical about the legislation. In addition to his New York hush money case, Trump also faces state-level charges in Georgia over allegations he tried to steal the state in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe meetings may also serve another purpose: Giving Trump face time with several of the people he is considering as his running mate. That includes Sens. JD Vance, R-Ohio, Tim Scott, R-S.C., and Marco Rubio, R-Fla., as well as House members such as Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y. and Byron Donalds, R-Fla.\n\nRep. Marc Molinaro, R-N.Y., told reporters he expects to hear Trump give a \"lay of the land as he sees it\" of the 2024 elections. Other lawmakers told USA TODAY they expect the meeting to be critical towards building a working relationship between congressional Republicans and the former president should the GOP take full control of Washington, picking up the White House and the Senate and maintaining control of the House. That kind of sweep would be an uphill battle for either party.\n\n\"We're working on cementing this relationship now so when January 20th comes, we have a plan in place to work together with the White House and Congress,\" Rep. Mark Alford, R-Texas, said, noting a major part of the GOP agenda is renewing Trump's 2017 tax cuts, which expire in 2025.\n\n\"That's the main thing that we need to make sure we talk about: That we communicate for the next few months, have a plan going into January,\" said Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala. As for what is on the table? \"You name it. All the crap that we had to put up for four years.\"\n\nWhat does Mike Johnson want after 2024?\n\nJohnson also met with Senate Republicans over lunch Wednesday to begin discussions on a potential party-line package to chase next year.\n\nJohnson told reporters after the meeting that he expressed interest in enacting new tax and spending cuts. Tax cuts passed during the Trump administration are set to expire in 2025, which means the next president will have a significant opportunity to rewrite the country's tax code.\n\n\"I think now we're in the education\" phase of teaching members what can and cannot be accomplished using the unique legislative tool known as \"reconciliation,\" said Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C. Reconciliation can bypass the Senate's 60-vote threshold for certain budget legislation.\n\nDemocrats used the tool in the first two years of the Biden administration to pass sweeping clean energy tax credits and other policies in the Inflation Reduction Act, a massive piece of legislation that aimed to address issues from transportation and the environment to insulin prices.\n\n\"Then it's

I'll be with you always,\" he said. \"If [a relationship] wasn't fantastic, it gets worked out.\"\n\n\"We have one thing in mind, and that's making our county great again,\" he added.\n\nTrump did not take questions from reporters after the news conference, but waved and gave a thumbs up at a small group of supporters shouting \"I love you\".\n\n\"Thank you,\" he mouthed in response.\n\nFollowing a meeting between Trump and House Republicans earlier in the day, House Speaker Mike Johnson said the former president \"brought an extraordinary amount of energy and enthusiasm this morning\".\n\n\"That is what we're seeing in the party throughout the country,\" Mr Johnson said. \"We believe we are going to win back the White House, and the Senate, and grow the House majority.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has been openly critical of Trump in the past, called the visit \"really positive\".\n\n\"He got a lot of standing ovations,\" Mr McConnell added.\n\nIn addition to Mr McConnell, two other Trump critics within the party - Utah Senator Mitt Romney and Louisiana's Bill Cassidy - were present at the meeting.\n\nSenator Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, described Trump as \"extremely gracious\" and \"warm\" to Senate Republicans.\n\n\"I guess I've just been here five years, and that's probably the warmest meeting that I have been in with senators and Trump,\" he told reporters.\n\nMr Hawley said that Trump spoke about abortion \"quite a lot\" at the meeting, where he reiterated his stance that voters should be the ones to decide on the issue.\n\nAt the earlier meeting with House Republicans, Trump reportedly called the Wisconsin city of Milwaukee - which will host the Republican National Convention later this year - \"terrible\", prompting his spokesman to clarify that he was referencing crime in the city rather than the city itself.\n\nBefore the visit, Politico reported that Trump called Mr Johnson to urge him to help reverse his 31 May conviction on 34 counts of falsifying documents in New York.\n\n\"We have to overturn this,\" Trump reportedly said in an expletive-laden call.\n\nNew York Republican representative Marcus Molinaro told CBS, the BBC's US partner, that Trump made no mention of the conviction when meeting with House Republicans.\n\nMore than three years ago, Trump urged supporters to \"fight like hell\" just hours before a mob stormed the US Capitol on 6 January, 2021, in a failed bid to prevent the certification of the election.\n\nMrs Pelosi said in her statement: \"Donald Trump comes to Capitol Hill today with the same mission of dismantling our democracy.\n\n\"Make no mistake - Trump has already cemented his legacy of shame in our hallowed halls.\"", "source": {"uri":

Matt Gaetz, a \"pep rally.\" Rep. Elise Stefanik, who chairs the House Republican Conference, called the meeting a \"very successful\" political gathering.\n\n\"We are 100% unified behind his candidacy and are ready to get to work on behalf of the American people,\" Stefanik told reporters, calling Trump's appearance a \"unifying event.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has openly criticized former Trump for years but endorsed him for president in March, called the meeting \"really positive.\"\n\n\"He and I got a chance to talk a little bit, we shook hands a few times,\" McConnell told reporters. \"He got a lot of standing ovations. It was an entirely positive meeting.\"\n\nGOP Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota said Trump discussed with Republicans how tips perhaps shouldn't be taxed, something Rounds said could be a popular change to the tax code and the economy.\n\nRepublican leaders said Trump addressed immigration and the economy, as well as the various legal situations he faces. The president, who spoke to House Republicans in the morning, has a series of meetings scheduled on Capitol Hill. Trump hasn't visited Capitol Hill since before the Jan. 6, 2021 attack, when his supporters attacked the building and interrupted the joint session of Congress that was certifying President Biden's electoral victory.\n\nThe former president was convicted last month on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to pay off adult film star Stormy Daniels. Trump has denied the allegations and said after the verdict that \"nothing ever happened.\" His campaign has said that his fundraising has skyrocketed since the conviction.\n\nRepublican House Majority Whip Tom Emmer insisted that Trump's Manhattan trial and conviction, which Emmer called a \"sham,\" has \"only given him more energy.\"\n\n\"Donald Tump is going to win, Donald Trump is going to help us win,\" Emmer said.\n\nAs Trump visited Capitol Hill, the Biden campaign released an ad blasting Trump over Jan. 6, and the Democratic National Committee is launching a mobile billboard around the area. The move comes as some of the officers who were present on Jan. 6, 2021, are traveling to swing states on behalf of the Biden campaign.\n\nDemocrats in Congress also denounced the visit, with Rep. Bennie Thompson, the chair of the now-disbanded House committee that investigated the attack, asking \"how dare Trump show his face on these grounds?\"\n\nTrump continues to insist the 2020 presidential election was rigged, and has cast doubt on the integrity of the upcoming November election -- as have several of his GOP allies.\n\nAhead of Trump's meeting with congressional Republicans, Republicans on the House Administration Committee issued subpoenas for documents from President Biden's Cabinet about agency efforts to help with voter registration, election information and to combat election misinformation and conspiracy theories. The subpoenas were sent to 15 Cabinet-level officials.\n\nWhile he was in the area, Trump also met with GOP Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin in Virginia to review recent polling data from the state that suggests the state might be competitive in November, sources familiar with the conversation said. The Trump campaign has recent internal polling that shows Trump within striking distance of Mr. Biden in Virginia, a state that the president won by 10 points in 2020.\n\nIf the Trump campaign starts putting more effort into flipping the state, which has not backed a Republican for president since 2004, it could push the Biden campaign to divert more resources to a state considered to be safe for the president.\n\nThe Biden campaign has six field offices and has held multiple grassroots events in the commonwealth, including a pickleball tournament to court senior voters on Wednesday.\"\n\n\"Virginians have rejected Trump every time he's run here, and his MAGA allies were soundly defeated last year after they campaigned on his agenda of banning abortion across the Commonwealth,\" said Jake Rubenstein, the Biden-Harris 2024 Campaign Virginia state director. \"We're mobilizing voters in every corner of Virginia and looking forward to beating Trump for a third time in November.\"", "source": {"uri": "cbsnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc",

He will then meet with Senate Republicans at the National Republican Senatorial Committee headquarters, where he will hold a news conference afterward.\n\nDuring the meetings, campaign officials say Trump will lay out his policy plans on immigration, entitlement programs and the economy.\n\n\"Looking ahead at the policies that will save the nation such as Trump's commitment to no impact on seniors with any cuts to Social Security or Medicare, policies that actually secure our borders and make our communities safe again, and an America first foreign policy that reclaims peace through strength and world leadership, and economic policies of lower taxes that reignite the vibrant trump economy we had just a few years ago,\" a campaign official said.\n\nTrump's last visit with Republicans happened while he was president in September 2020, when he gave remarks at the same members-only Republican club.\n\nTrump has stayed off the U.S. Capitol campus entirely since he left office shortly after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack. The closest he's come is when he met the executive board of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters near the Capitol building on Jan. 31.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell are both expected to attend the Thursday meetings between their caucuses and Trump.\n\nWhile Johnson and Trump have worked together on key issues since Johnson's rise to the speakership last fall, it will be the first time since 2020 that McConnell and Trump meet face-to-face.\n\nMcConnell and Trump have a rocky relationship, heightened after McConnell recognized President Joe Biden's victory in the wake of Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nMcConnell, asked on Wednesday if he plans to \"confront\" Trump about their disagreements, dodged the question and repeated his usual support for the Republican \"nominee.\"\n\n\"I said three years ago, right after the Capitol was attacked, that I would support our nominee regardless of who it was -- including him,\" McConnell told reporters. \"I've said earlier this year, I support him -- he's earned the nomination by the voters all across the country. And of course, I'll be at the meeting tomorrow.\"\n\nJohnson has openly embraced Trump, who was crucial in supporting him when he faced the threat of being ousted threat by conservative GOP House hard-liners, saying coordination with Trump is important heading into November's election and a potential second Trump presidency.\n\n\"I think it's important for the country, to have us, to have close coordination,\" Johnson said at a news conference on Wednesday. \"I believe he'll have, can be, the most consequential president of the modern era, because we have to fix effectively every area of public policy.\"\n\nAt that news conference, Johnson also told ABC News he supports a bill that would allow current or former presidents to move state charges against them into federal court -- a measure aimed at showing support for Trump after being found guilty in his hush money trial in a New York state court.\n\n\"I think that's an idea that makes sense. It makes sense to most Republicans, and I think almost everyone will be in favor of that. And that's what we're talking about and trying to move some of this forward,\" Johnson told ABC Senior Congressional Correspondent Rachel Scott.\n\nHowever, not every Republican is set to fully welcome back Trump when he comes to the nation's capital.\n\nSens. Susan Collins, Mitt Romney and Lisa Murkowski, who have been vocal Trump critics, have blamed previous conflicts as a reason for why they couldn't attend the meeting with Trump.\n\nAll three voted with Republicans to impeach Trump for his actions related to Jan. 6.\n\nThe group of political meetings comes as Trump is scheduled to be in Washington D.C. to participate in a moderated discussion at a quarterly meeting of the Business Roundtable, a group consisting of more than 200 CEOs. Business Roundtable spokesman Michael Steel said the group invited both presumptive presidential nominees, but with Biden overseas to attend the G7 summit, White House Chief of Staff Jeff Zients is slated to appear.", "source": {"uri": "weisradio.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WEIS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki",

He has successfully purged the GOP of critics, silenced most skeptics and enticed once-critical lawmakers aboard his MAGA-fueled campaign.\n\n\"Great meeting with Republican Representatives. Lots discussed, all positive, great poll numbers!\" Trump posted on social media after meeting with House Republicans.\n\nA packed room of House Republicans sang \"Happy Birthday\" to Trump in the private breakfast meeting at GOP campaign headquarters across the street from the Capitol. The lawmakers gave him a baseball and bat from the annual congressional game.\n\nMichigan Rep. Tom Emmer, the third-ranking House Republican, said the former president received multiple standing ovations and discussed his plans for the U.S.-Mexico border and immigration, the economy and inflation, and the upcoming election.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said Trump \"brought an extraordinary amount of energy and excitement and enthusiasm this morning\" at a press conference afterwards.\n\n\"We talked about how to grow this House majority and how he will help in doing so and then how we'll help him as well. And this is a unified effort by the party,\" said Johnson, who led one of the lawsuits challenging the 2020 election, and had his biggest fundraising day yet after Trump's felony conviction. \"President Trump has set fundraising records. He raised $53 million in the first 24 hours after the verdict in that terrible bogus trial in Manhattan. And I think that shows that people understand what's happening here.\"\n\n\"Because people see that that is a threat to our republic. They see that as a threat to our system of justice, and they don't -- they want to push back,\" Johnson added.\n\nPrior to the Thursday meeting, the Republican speaker demurred over whether he's asked Trump to respect the peaceful transfer of presidential power and commit to not doing another Jan. 6. \"Of course he respects that, we all do, and we've all talked about it, ad nauseum.\"\n\nThe Biden campaign denounced Trump's return to Capitol Hill, issuing statements from Rep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, and Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., who chaired the House panel that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, attack.\n\n\"Three years after waging a continual war on our democracy, Donald Trump, a convicted criminal, returns to Capitol Hill to hang out with the very same MAGA extremists who acted as his proxies on January 6th,\" Crockett said. \"Trump and his cronies attacked our free and fair elections, they attacked our peaceful transition of power, and they attacked our Capitol - and the American people are fighting back at the ballot box to defend democracy.\"\n\n\"After inciting a deadly insurrection that defiled the halls of Congress, how dare Trump show his face on these grounds?\" asked Thompson. \"Congressional Republicans allow him to waltz in here when it's known he has no regard for democracy. Since January 6th, Donald Trump, a twice-impeached convicted felon, has repeatedly doubled down on his disrespect for the rule of law and continues to sow hate and division. He still presents the same dire threat to our democracy that he did three years ago -- and he'd be wise to head back to Mar-a-Lago and await his sentencing.\"\n\nTrump was set to deliver remarks to both groups privately at the House and Senate campaign headquarters near the U.S. Capitol and was expected to discuss issues animating his campaign -- including mass immigration deportations but also tax cuts and other priorities for a potential second term.\n\nHowever, one reported comment of Trump's immediately drew condemnation from Democrats. According to Punchbowl News, Trump told House Republicans that \"Milwaukee, where we are having our convention, is a horrible city.\"\n\nThe DNC belittled Trump's campaign operation in Wisconsin, saying through a spokesperson that Republicans would \"rather stick to telling voters how much they hate the city they chose to hold their convention in.\" And Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Wisconsin Democrat up for reelection in a competitive race, quickly slammed Trump for the reported remark.\n\n\"Milwaukee makes the greatest beer, brats, and motorcycles in the world. It's home to some of our most vibrant communities, hardest workers, and is a part of what makes Wisconsin the best state in the nation,\" Baldwin wrote on social media. \"Donald Trump wouldn't understand even if a jury told him so.\"\n\n\"Add it to the list of things Donald Trump is wrong about,\" Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, wrote in a post of his own, alongisde a clown face emoji.\n\nWisconsin Republican Rep. Derrick Van Orden, insisted Trump was talking about the crime rate in Milwaukee, sharing an image of a Spectrum News article titled \"Milwaukee ranks third for violent crimes nationwide\" from May of last year based on data from 2021. Fellow Wisconsin Rep. Bryan Steil said \"I was in the room. President Trump did not say this.\" A Republican National Convention spokesperson told a local Milwaukee TV reporter that Trump \"was referencing the ongoing political game\" about where protesters will be allowed to demonstrate during the convention.\n\nThe Republican National Convention is scheduled for July 15-18. Trump's sentencing hearing in the New York case is scheduled for July 11.\n\nIn between meetings with House and Senate Republicans, Trump is expected to speak at the Business Roundtable downtown which routinely invites the presumptive presidential nominees to address the executives' group. Many potential priorities for a new White House administration are being formulated by a constellation of outside groups, including Project 2025, that are laying the groundwork for executive and legislative actions, though Trump has made clear he has his own agenda.\n\nBut the private meetings with House and Senate Republicans so close to the Capitol are infused with symbolism of Trump's return as the U.S. president who threatened the American tradition of the peaceful transfer of presidential power.\n\n\"It's frustrating,\" said former U.S. Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn, who made his own unsuccessful run for Congress as a Maryland Democrat in the aftermath of Jan. 6, when police engaged in hand-to-hand fighting to stop Trump supporters who stormed the building trying to overturn President Joe Biden's election.\n\nDunn spoke of the \"irony\" of Trump returning to the area and lawmakers now embracing him. \"It just shows the lack of backbone they have when they're truly putting party and person over country,\" he said. \"And it's sad.\"\n\nMany of those who once stood up to Trump are long gone from office and the Republicans who remain seem increasingly enthusiastic about the possibility of him retaking the White House, and the down-ballot windfall that could mean for their own GOP majorities in Congress.\n\nJohnson met with senators on Wednesday ahead of Trump's arrival as the Republicans mapped out potential priorities.\n\nOutgoing Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who once blamed Trump for the \"disgraceful\" attack that he called an \"insurrection\" now endorses the party's presumptive nominee and said: \"Of course I'll be at the meeting.\"\n\nSen. John Thune, the GOP whip who is vying to replace McConnell as leader, told The Associated Press that he's interested in hearing from Trump about the fall election and \"ways in which we, as a team, and him individually can appeal to the constituencies and people that may not traditionally vote Republican.\"\n\nThune said, \"I think there's an opportunity there to really make this a big win.\"\n\nAs democracies around the world come under threat from a far-rightward shift, experts warn that the U.S. system, once seemingly immune from authoritarian impulses, is at risk of populist and extremist forces like those that Trump inspired to sack the Capitol.\n\n\"This is just another example of House Republicans bending the knee to Donald Trump,\" said Rep. Pete Aguilar of California, the chairman of the House Democratic caucus.\n\nBiden's campaign released a new ad ahead of Trump's visit, saying that the Republican ex-president is \"pouring gasoline\" by weighing pardons for Jan. 6 rioters and \"is ready to burn it all down\" when it comes to American democracy.\n\n\"Today, the instigator of an insurrection is returning to the scene of the crime. January 6th was a crime against the Capitol, that saw Nazi and Confederate flags flying under the dome that Lincoln built,\" former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a statement released by Biden's campaign. \"It was a crime against the Constitution and its peaceful transfer of power, in a desperate attempt to cling to power. And it was a crime against Members, heroic police officers and staff, that resulted in death, injury and trauma that endure to this day.\"\n\n\"With his pledges to be a dictator on day one and seek revenge against his political opponents, Donald Trump comes to Capitol Hill today with the same mission of dismantling our democracy,\" Pelosi added. \"But make no mistake -- Trump has already cemented his legacy of shame in our hallowed halls.\"\n\nOn the subject of Pelosi, Trump reportedly called one of her daughters a \"whacko\" and went on a tear about the California Democrat. One of her daughters disputed his remarks.\n\n\"Speaking for all 4 Pelosi daughters -- this is a LIE,\" Christine Pelosi said of Trump's comments in a social media post. \"His deceitful, deranged obsession with our mother is yet another reason Donald Trump is unwell, unhinged and unfit to step foot anywhere near her -- or the White House.\"\n\nMaking Jan. 6 a cornerstone of his reelection campaign, Trump celebrates those who stormed the Capitol as \"warriors\" and \"patriots,\" and he has vowed to pardon any number of the more than 1,300 America convicted of crimes for the assault on the seat of U.S. democracy.\n\nMoreover, Trump has vowed to seek retribution by ousting officials at the U.S. Justice Department, which is prosecuting him in a four-count indictment to overturn the election ahead of the Jan. 6 attack and another case over storing classified documents at his Mar-A-Largo home.\n\nRepublicans, particularly in the House but increasingly in the Senate, are vigorously following his lead, complaining of an unfair justice system. The House voted to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress and is re-investigating the House committee that investigated Jan. 6.\n\nAlongside Trump, the House and Senate GOP campaign arms scored some of their highest fundraising periods yet after a jury found him guilty in the New York hush money case.\n\nWhen former GOP Speaker Paul Ryan on Fox News reiterated this week that he wouldn't be voting for Trump and wished Republicans had another choice for president, he was immediately ostracized by Trump allies.\n\n\"Paul Ryan, you're a piece of garbage,\" said Rep. Troy Nehls, R-Texas. \"We should kick you out of the party.\"\n\nOf the Republicans who voted to impeach Trump over Jan. 6 and convict him on the charge of inciting the insurrection, only a few remain in office.\n\nSen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, are not expected to attend Thursday's closed-door session with Trump.\n\nBut Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said he would likely join the Trump meeting at GOP senators' campaign headquarters, expecting \"he's going to be the next president, so you have to work\" together.\n\nAsked if he was concerned about the direction of the Trump Republican Party, Cassidy: \"Let the day's own troubles be sufficient for the day. You can fill yourself up with anxiety about tomorrow, but will it change a thing? No.\"\n\nUtah Sen. Mitt Romney, another Trump critic who is retiring at the end of his term, was initially not going to attend the meeting, but did so after his flight was canceled.\n\nSen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who confronted Trump at times but did not join in the vote to convict him in the Capitol attack, said he did not expect the meeting to be contentious as Republicans hope to seize the Senate majority this fall.\n\n\"Look, we've got to win. And our ability to get a majority in the Senate is intrinsically linked to Trump winning. So we're like, one team, one vision. And I think that will be largely what we talk about,\" Tillis said.", "source": {"uri": "baynews9.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Spectrum News Bay News 9"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Thursday marks Trump's first trip back following that fateful day less than four years ago in the midst of a campaign he hopes will return him to Washington and the White House.\n\nSince then, Trump and many GOP lawmakers have tried to revise the history of that day and suggested that some of the rioters are political \"hostages,\" some of whom he plans to pardon. In Las Vegas last weekend, he claimed baselessly \"they were warriors but they were really, more than anything else, they're victims of what happened.\"\n\nBut with few exceptions, his incendiary rhetoric around a seminal moment in American political history has landed on the site of the attack with silence or even support from Republicans.\n\nLike several anti-Trump Republicans, Murkowski has found other plans and will not attend the luncheon at the National Republican Senatorial Committee a couple blocks from the Capitol. But she's already fed up with how much Trump has once again hijacked the events of this week, just like he did every week he was in the Oval Office.\n\n\"So it's like, once again, it's all about Trump all the time,\" the 22-year incumbent said Wednesday.\n\nAcross the Capitol, Rep. Jake Auchincloss (D-Mass.) paused 16 seconds reflecting on what it meant to have Trump back on Capitol Hill, the first meeting taking place Thursday morning with the House GOP in its campaign headquarters.\n\n\"It's an astounding example of GOP amnesia,\" Auchincloss finally said, pausing another dozen seconds before saying something else. \"It was a turning point when the GOP didn't turn on him.\"\n\nFor Auchincloss, who led Marine infantry units in Afghanistan, Jan. 6 was his third full day in Congress, a seminal moment that has shaped his views of life in the Capitol ever since. He used the votes on certifying Biden's victory as a measuring stick about which Republicans he would work with, at times refusing to consider crossing the aisle if the GOP lawmaker had voted to deny the results of a legitimate election.\n\nTrump does not plan to be on official congressional grounds Thursday, but he will be a stone's throw away for the first time since he was president. It will be the closest he has come to visiting since he tried to get the Secret Service and his aides to let him join his supporters in a trip there during the Capitol attack.\n\nRoughly 250 Republicans will attend the two meetings with the ex-president, supporting his attempt to formally return to the Capitol for a Jan. 20, 2025, inauguration ceremony.\n\nFor those supportive Republicans, Trump's visits are just part of the normal routine. Every four years the party out of power selects a nominee, and then he or she treks to Capitol Hill, hoping to forge unity for the election and plot a policy agenda.\n\n\"I think it's important for us to get together and make sure that we have an agenda coming in, so when he gets elected -- I believe that he will -- we're ready to go,\" said Sen. John Barrasso (Wyo.), the No. 3 GOP leader who will serve as the official host of the meeting.\n\nBut nothing with Trump is ever normal. Just two weeks ago a Manhattan jury convicted the former president on 34 felony counts for filing false business records over a hush money payment to cover up an alleged extramarital affair.\n\nSome of the same Capitol Police and D.C. police who clashed with his violent supporters -- about 140 officers were injured, while three died in the days after Jan. 6 -- will be detailed to provide security for Trump and lawmakers around the meetings.\n\nWhen his motorcade leaves the House GOP meeting, Trump will probably drive past the Supreme Court, which is slated to rule on his bid to exempt himself from two other pending federal criminal trials.\n\nWhen he huddles with Senate Republicans, Trump will sit just eight-tenths of a mile from the E. Barrett Prettyman U.S. Courthouse, where he will go on trial for his involvement in attempting to overturn the 2020 election, depending on the Supreme Court decision.\n\nAfter House Democrats voted to impeach him, a week after the Capitol insurrection, many believed they had dispatched with Trump in the political sense. After they led a year-long investigation into those events, the Justice Department got moving and eventually indicted the ex-president.\n\nBut those indictments only rallied conservative voters around Trump, turning his bid for this year's GOP nomination into a cakewalk, and Trump's legal strategy managed to delay the federal trials until likely past Election Day.\n\nThese Democrats view Thursday's visit as the final genuflection by congressional Republicans, a group that stands ready to allow Trump to win the White House and shut down the criminal cases against him.\n\n\"Justice still hasn't completely been served. I mean, until, everybody is held accountable, it's still going to feel incomplete and it's still going to feel unsettled,\" said Rep. Pete Aguilar (Calif.), the No. 3 Democratic leader who served on the select committee that investigated Trump's actions.\n\nTrump has always found greater support among House Republicans, so his morning huddle is likely to be akin to a pep rally. Their ranks have turned over so quickly in this political era that a large majority took office after his shocking presidential victory eight years ago.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), who first won in 2016, authored a legal brief in December 2020 that a majority of the House GOP signed onto, trying to invalidate Biden's win. Johnson was one of a couple dozen Republicans who sycophantishly headed to New York during the trial to show public support for Trump.\n\nEven House Republicans in swing districts came out with strong statements of support after the Manhattan conviction.\n\nSenate Republicans, most of whom hold traditional conservative views, have always had a more distant relationship with the former reality-TV star. But Trump is unlikely to face a hostile audience.\n\nOf the four remaining Senate Republicans who voted to convict Trump in the 2021 impeachment trial, only Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) is expected to attend the meeting Thursday. And, perhaps thinking ahead to his 2026 election, Cassidy has fallen in line.\n\n\"The polls say he's going to be our next president, so you got to work with him,\" Cassidy told reporters.\n\nTrump's last official visit to Senate Republicans appears to have been in May 2020, at the height of pandemic response. The news conference afterward led Trump into discussions about his weight, his support of a dangerous and unproven drug for fighting the coronavirus, his desire to fire certain State Department officials and broadsides against U.S. intelligence programs.\n\n\"He's always going to do the unexpected,\" Cassidy said, waxing philosophical about the future of his party under Trump. \"You can fill yourself up with anxiety about tomorrow, but will it change a thing? No, not at all.\"\n\nSens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Mitt Romney (R-Utah), who joined Murkowski and Cassidy in voting to convict Trump, have found other plans for lunch.\n\nSen. Todd Young (R-Ind.), whose GOP political role models come from the Ronald Reagan and John McCain wing, has declared he will not support Trump in November.

Associated Press\n\nSen. Lisa Murkowski got flashbacks upon returning to the Capitol on Tuesday facing an endless stream of questions about one topic.\n\n\"I have been asked questions by about 20 reporters since then, 19 of the 20 have asked me whether I'm going to lunch,\" the GOP senator from Alaska said Wednesday.\n\n\"Lunch,\" as it were, is Thursday's gathering of Senate Republicans with their presumptive presidential nominee, Donald Trump, whom Murkowski voted to convict in an impeachment trial the month after the ex-president's supporters attacked the Capitol in an attempt to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nThat happened on Jan. 6, 2021, the day pro-Trump rioters stormed the Capitol in an attempt to prevent the certification of Joe Biden's victory. Thursday marks Trump's first trip back after that fateful day less than four years ago in the midst of a campaign he hopes will return him to Washington and the White House.\n\nSince then, Trump and many GOP lawmakers have tried to revise the history of that day and suggested that some of the rioters are political \"hostages,\" some of whom he plans to pardon. In Las Vegas last weekend, he claimed baselessly that \"they were warriors but they were really, more than anything else, they're victims of what happened.\"\n\nBut with few exceptions, his incendiary rhetoric around a seminal moment in American political history has landed on the site of the attack with silence or even support from Republicans.\n\nLike several anti-Trump Republicans, Murkowski has found other plans and will not attend the luncheon at the National Republican Senatorial Committee a couple blocks from the Capitol. But she's already fed up with how much Trump has once again hijacked the events of this week, just like he did every week he was in the Oval Office.\n\n\"So it's like, once again, it's all about Trump all the time,\" the 22-year incumbent said Wednesday.\n\nAcross the Capitol, Rep. Jake Auchincloss, a Massachusetts Democrat, paused 16 seconds reflecting on what it meant to have Trump back on Capitol Hill, the first meeting taking place Thursday morning with the House GOP in its campaign headquarters.\n\n\"It's an astounding example of GOP amnesia,\" Auchincloss finally said, pausing another dozen seconds before saying something else. \"It was a turning point when the GOP didn't turn on him.\"\n\nFor Auchincloss, who led Marine infantry units in Afghanistan, Jan. 6 was his third full day in Congress, a seminal moment that has shaped his views of life in the Capitol ever since. He used the votes on certifying Biden's victory as a measuring stick about which Republicans he would work with, at times refusing to consider crossing the aisle if the GOP lawmaker had voted to deny the results of a legitimate election.\n\nTrump does not plan to be on official congressional grounds Thursday, but he will be a stone's throw away for the first time since he was president. It will be the closest he has come to visiting since he tried to get the Secret Service and his aides to let him join his supporters in a trip there during the Capitol attack.\n\nRoughly 250 Republicans will attend the two meetings with the ex-president, supporting his attempt to formally return to the Capitol for a Jan. 20, 2025, inauguration ceremony.\n\nFor those supportive Republicans, Trump's visits are just part of the normal routine. Every four years the party out of power selects a nominee, and then he or she treks to Capitol Hill, hoping to forge unity for the election and plot a policy agenda.\n\n\"I think it's important for us to get together and make sure that we have an agenda coming in, so when he gets elected -- I believe that he will -- we're ready to go,\" said Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, the No. 3 GOP leader who will serve as the official host of the meeting.\n\nBut nothing with Trump is ever normal. Just two weeks ago, a Manhattan jury convicted the former president on 34 felony counts for filing false business records over a hush money payment to cover up an alleged extramarital affair.\n\nSome of the same Capitol Police and D.C. police who clashed with his violent supporters -- about 140 officers were injured, while three died in the days after Jan. 6 -- will be detailed to provide security for Trump and lawmakers around the meetings.\n\nWhen his motorcade leaves the House GOP meeting, Trump will probably drive past the Supreme Court, which is slated to rule on his bid to exempt himself from two other pending federal criminal trials.\n\nWhen he huddles with Senate Republicans, Trump will sit just eight-tenths of a mile from the E. Barrett Prettyman U.S. Courthouse, where he will go on trial for his involvement in attempting to overturn the 2020 election, depending on the Supreme Court decision.\n\nAfter House Democrats voted to impeach him, a week after the Capitol insurrection, many believed they had dispatched with Trump in the political sense. After they led a yearlong investigation into those events, the Justice Department got moving and eventually indicted the ex-president.\n\nBut those indictments only rallied conservative voters around Trump, turning his bid for this year's GOP nomination into a cakewalk, and Trump's legal strategy managed to delay the federal trials until probably past Election Day.\n\nThese Democrats view Thursday's visit as the final genuflection by congressional Republicans, a group that stands ready to allow Trump to win the White House and shutdown the criminal cases against him.\n\n\"Justice still hasn't completely been served. I mean, until everybody is held accountable, it's still going to feel incomplete and it's still going to feel unsettled,\" said California Rep. Pete Aguilar, the No. 3 Democratic leader who served on the select committee that investigated Trump's actions.\n\nTrump has always found greater support among House Republicans, so his morning huddle is likely to be akin to a pep rally. Their ranks have turned over so quickly in this political era that a large majority took office after his shocking presidential victory eight years ago.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican who first won in 2016, wrote a legal brief in December 2020 that a majority of the House GOP signed onto, trying to invalidate Biden's win. Johnson was one of a couple dozen Republicans who sycophantishly headed to New York during the trial to show public support for Trump.\n\nEven House Republicans in swing districts came out with strong statements of support after the Manhattan conviction.\n\nSenate Republicans, most of whom hold traditional conservative views, have always had a more distant relationship with the former reality-TV star. But Trump is unlikely to face a hostile audience.\n\nOf the four remaining Senate Republicans who voted to convict Trump in the 2021 impeachment trial, only Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican, is expected to attend the meeting Thursday. And, perhaps thinking ahead to his 2026 election, Cassidy has fallen in line.\n\n\"The polls say he's going to be our next president, so you got to work with him,\" Cassidy told reporters.\n\nTrump's last official visit to Senate Republicans appears to have been in May 2020, at the height of pandemic response. The news conference afterward led Trump into discussions about his weight, his support of a dangerous and unproven drug for fighting the coronavirus, his desire to fire certain State Department officials and broadsides against U.S. intelligence programs.\n\n\"He's always going to do the unexpected,\" Cassidy said, waxing philosophical about the future of his party under Trump. \"You can fill yourself up with anxiety about tomorrow, but will it change a thing? No, not at all.\"\n\nSens. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, and Mitt Romney, a Utah Republican who joined Murkowski and Cassidy in voting to convict Trump, have also found other plans for lunch.\n\nSen. Todd Young, an Indiana Republican whose GOP political role models come from the Ronald Reagan and John McCain wing, has declared that he will not support Trump in November. He refused to say where he will have lunch Thursday.\n\n\"No Trump questions today,\" Young told reporters.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, has not been in Trump's presence for almost four years. The two have not spoken since McConnell called him in mid-December 2020 to say he would recognize Biden's victory, and ever since Trump has regularly ridiculed the longest-serving Senate leader.\n\nAsked about Thursday's meeting, McConnell gave a vintage comment that expressed support for Trump without ever saying his name. \"He's earned the nomination by the voters all across the country,\" he said.\n\nFor Murkowski, the entire experience is a bit of political PTSD, seeing the Trump circus come back to town and consume Capitol Hill.\n\n\"All of a sudden everything else stops,\" she said, \"because they all want to know: Are you going to lunch, what do you think he's going to say, what are your expectations?\"", "source": {"uri": "dailyherald.com", "dataType":

Matt Gaetz of Florida, a fierce Trump ally, told CNN. I think this is going to be a pep rally environment for the former and future president.\n\nBefore the meeting, Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn said it would be nice if everyone sang from the same sheet of music. Cornyn previously criticized Trump and said he preferred to see the Republican Party move in a different direction, before ultimately supporting the former president in January.\n\nTop campaign advisers said Trump is expected to articulate his campaign priorities and policies focused on the economy, inflation, tax cuts and immigration in his meetings, first with Republican Party members. Room at the Capitol Hill club in the morning, then with Senate Republicans at the neighboring National. Republican Senatorial Committee Building. Hell also reiterates his commitment to not eliminating senior benefit programs like Social Security and Medicare.\n\nWe want everyone to be on the same page when talking about policy, including the economy and inflation, a senior Trump adviser told CNN. It's the biggest factor in all the polls, it's the biggest thing that worries people.\n\nTrump, who will be accompanied by his two top campaign officials, Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, among others, is also expected to discuss the details of a possible agenda for a second term, including how to immediately implement his policy goals, with the help of legislators. if he is re-elected to the White House. Meanwhile, House Republicans were hungry for information to help them jumpstart legislative action at the Capitol next year.\n\nWe want to be part of this plan to be operational, Republican Party Rep. Darrell Issa of California told CNN. When most presidents are elected, they anticipate that they will have eight years. This president knows he has four.\n\nAdvisers said the meetings would also be an opportunity for lawmakers to ask questions or raise pressing topics ahead of the November election, with Trump planning to open the floor to members after his remarks.\n\nHouse majority Steve Scalise told CNN he has already spoken directly with Trump about using a special budget tool to avoid the 60-vote threshold in the Senate, known as reconciliation, to make advance tax cuts, border wall funding and other priorities if Republicans control all of Washington.\n\nSome of Trump's plans for a second term have been outlined by the former president himself in rallies and interviews, including mass deportations of undocumented immigrants and leaving reproductive rights to the states, but d Other elements were proposed only vaguely or behind closed doors, and were disclosed. relayed by the media.\n\nTrump's reception among House and Senate Republicans likely to vary\n\nSen. John Barrasso, the third-ranking Republican in the Senate, invited the entire GOP conference to Thursday's event.\n\nHowever, some senators skeptical of Trump have not committed to attending. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, one of the few Republican senators who did not support Trump's bid in the 2024 election, said she would not participate in the election due to a conflict. Sen. Todd Young of Indiana would not say whether he planned to attend, adding that he was not talking about Trump this week.\n\nAlthough Trump will not be inside the U.S. Capitol building, his appearance on the Hill will also mark his first meeting with some key Republicans since the January 6, 2021 insurrection, including Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nMcConnell, who has had a frosty relationship with the former president since the Capitol attack, told CNN he would attend the meeting. The two have not spoken since the Electoral College certified Joe Biden's victory in December 2020, but McConnell supported Trump earlier this year.\n\nAny tension will likely be offset by some of Trump's biggest cheerleaders and potential vice presidential picks, who will also be in attendance, including Senators Tim Scott, Marco Rubio and JD Vance.\n\nAmong attendees, many said they were looking for a more pressing priority, including Trump laying out a specific strategy to beat President Joe Biden.\n\nI'll be honest with you. To think that we are going to talk a lot about the government agenda on Thursday seems a little naive to me. It's like measuring curtains, said Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina. It's about winning in November, and I suppose we could tackle the agenda next year, but it's an equation with many variables, not the least of which is how successful we are, here in Congress, to take up the gavels.\n\nOthers see it as an opportunity to try to reset the party after months of internal tension over the future of House Speaker Mike Johnson, contributing to the war in Ukraine and divisions over the best security strategy. borders.\n\nIn the House, a traditionally more Trump-friendly chamber, members said the former president would find a supportive and enthusiastic audience, some dressed to impress.\n\nI just think he wants to get everyone on the same page, said Sen. Markwayne Mullin, a key Trump ally. There was a bit of tension in the Senate. It's just about trying to keep the tension from building and saying our focus is on Joe Biden and this administration, not on each other.\n\nGOP Rep. Troy Nehls said he had several different Trump ties to choose from, although he complained that his Trump-branded gold sneakers were back in Texas.\n\n\"He will know that I support him 110 percent and I will do everything I can to fight like hell to make sure he is the next president,\" Nehls said.\n\nRep. EliseStefanik, who as Republican conference chairwoman was responsible for organizing the House meeting, will also chair the event. Stefanik is among a short list of vice presidential candidates who will receive verification materials from the Trump campaign. Rep. Byron Donalds is also on that list and is expected to be in attendance Thursday.\n\nTrump's visit comes as House Republican leaders face growing pressure from the right flank to take on the Justice Department and defend Trump following his hush money conviction at New York.\n\nOne legislative proposal that Republican leaders are actively pursuing is a bill that would allow current and former presidents to bring state-level cases in federal court. The bill passed out of committee last September, but Republican Party leaders only began formally introducing it this week, on the eve of Trump's visit to the Capitol and two weeks after his conviction.\n\nOne thing House and Senate Republicans agreed on: Trump was unlikely to stick to his message.\n\nAsked if they thought Trump would discuss policy plans and campaign strategy and while avoiding airing his grievances, one Republican lawmaker told CNN: \"You know the answer to that question.\" It's not in his DNA.\n\nWhat am I waiting for? You have no idea what Trump is going to talk about. It's just completely unpredictable, said Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors":

Trump used the events, each held blocks from the U.S. Capitol, to push for GOP members to unify behind him ahead of this year's presidential election.\n\nTrump ended his visit with Senate Republicans with a brief press availability where he listed goals for a GOP-led government and described the current state of the country in bleak and dysfunctional terms.\n\n\"We have great unity, we have great common sense,\" he said. \"A lot of very smart people in this room.\"\n\nTrump did not take any questions.\n\nThe former president began the day with a closed-door meeting with House Republicans where he pledged to support members so they can \"win big\" in November, praised Speaker Mike Johnson and discussed a wide range of issues including inflation and abortion.\n\nThe meeting, which took place near the U.S. Capitol, was his first visit back since he left office and since hiscriminal convictions in the New York hush money trial. Trump is meeting with Senate Republicans this afternoon.\n\nIt is also the first time Trump has visited Capitol Hill since the January 6th riot at the Capitol. Trump was not present that day as his supporters stormed the building and he has not visited the Capitol building in the years that followed - including President Biden's inauguration, which Trump skipped.\n\n\"President Trump brought an extraordinary amount of energy, and excitement and enthusiasm this morning,\" Johnson said while flanked by other House leaders after their more than hour-long meeting.\n\nThe afternoon session with the Senate was also an opportunity for Trump to address skeptics within the party. In recent months, more Senate Republicans, including those initially resistant to weigh in, have said they're supporting Trump's re-election run. Others, like Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., have refused to back him or continue to avoid discussing their support for the former president.\n\nSen. Susan Collins of Maine, who was one of seven Senate Republicans to vote to convict Trump during his second impeachment trial, said she wouldn't attending the meeting because of a longstanding conflict.\n\nThe meetings mark a high-stakes affair for Trump and Republicans heading into the contentious final months of the campaign. While many Congressional Republicans are firmly behind Trump, there remains a divide among some as the former president faces multiple legal battles.\n\nSeveral members leaving the meeting highlighted Trump asking Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene to be \"nice\" to Johnson. Greene responded with a hand motion that signaled, \"maybe.\"\n\n\"President Trump was very much himself - no teleprompter, no notecards,\" said Greene, who led the failed effort to oust Johnson last month. \"He joked with everybody.\"\n\nGreene said there were no discussions about Trump's potential pick for vice president, and that Trump told members he \"feels a lot of states are in play\" with plans to spend money in New Jersey, New York, Minnesota and Virginia.\n\n\"He did say there's a few of you in the room that might not be happy with me because I'm supporting your opponent, but I will be doing tele-town halls for many of you, helping you get across the line, doing whatever it takes to win the House and win it big,\" she added.\n\nRep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C. said Trump was casting a wide net.\n\n\"There's no state he's not going in,\" he said.\n\nThat includes includes races where he isn't backing the incumbent.\n\nThe former president endorsed GOP Virginia Rep. Bob Good's primary challenger, John Maguire, ahead of next week's Republican primary. Good attended the meeting, but declined to discuss it with NPR on his way out.\n\nMembers said Trump did most of the talking in the meeting. Rep Ben Cline, R-Va., noted well over an hour into the session, \"it wasn't a discussion, Trump's just been talking,\" but he added Trump took some questions.\n\nTrump also took a swipe at those House GOP lawmakers who voted to impeach him in 2021, noting there weren't many left in Congress.\n\nLater, several members said he appeared to signal support of California Rep. David Valadao, who voted to impeach, but without naming him.\n\nHe also took a jab at Taylor Swift, noting he signed a bill during his administration to help songwriters, and that he was surprised Swift wasn't supporting him.\n\nSouth Carolina Rep. Nancy Mace said Trump devoted a significant portion of his remarks to speaking about abortion.\n\n\"Ensuring that women know that we care and that we're pro-woman and pro-life is a really important message for us going into November,\" Mace said. \"He talked about exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother.\"\n\nMace, one of Trump's former enemies, now has his endorsement, and was congratulated on her recent primary win.\n\nRep. Marc Molinaro, running for reelection in a competitive district in New York, told reporters on the abortion discussion, \"his point was obviously to speak from your heart. And I've embraced this in my own district for the people I represent, just we've got to be respectful of the very difficult choices women have to make.\"\n\nNorman said the message from Trump on abortion was \"let the states decide.\" He told lawmakers he's not going to get into the details on specific restrictions and they shouldn't either, but if they weigh in on specific restrictions in terms of 8, 10, 12 week ban, \"use your heart.\"\n\nMultiple Republicans told NPR that Trump talked about ramping up pressure on China, and touted his own policy as president imposing tariffs on China.\n\nOne House Republican who has not yet endorsed Trump, Rep. Dave Schweikert, R-Ariz., said about the discussion, \"I was actually pleased it was mostly on economy, on inflation. He told reporters he planned to endorse Trump after the GOP convention.\n\nGOP lawmakers said Trump didn't weigh in on a specific tax strategy, or the speaker's proposal to push through an aggressive package early in 2025 using expedited budget rules, but urged them to vote to cut taxes.\n\n\"He talked about tax-free tips, which is a great opportunity for middle class workers, people who basically make a living on tips to not pay taxes on those things, a good thing, a popular thing with the middle class,\" Rep. Mike Garcia, R-Calif., said.\n\nFor their part, congressional Democrats said today marked a reminder of a dark moment in the country's history, pointing to Trump's role in the Jan. 6 attack.\n\n\"On January 6th, Donald Trump lit a match to democracy with an insurrection on Capitol Hill, and, today, he's arrived at the scene of the crime and continues to throw fuel on the flame,\" said California Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren, who served on the former Jan. 6 committee.", "source": {"uri": "kpbs.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "KPBS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Will they lay out a 2025 wish list?", "body": "WASHINGTON - Former President Donald Trump will meet with Republican lawmakers Thursday to discuss campaign strategies and lay out their wish list if they defeat Democrats in November.\n\nIt's the first time Trump has returned to Capitol Hill since leaving office nearly four years ago, and the trip provides an opportunity for conservative leaders to plot which policy priorities they'll pursue if reelected.\n\nThe meetings with both House and Senate lawmakers also align with a meeting with the Business Roundtable, a powerful cohort of some of the country's largest companies that will host the former president while he's in the nation's capital. Trump is slated to meet with House Republican lawmakers in the morning at the Capitol Hill Club and Senate Republicans in the afternoon at the National Republican Senatorial Committee office, both locations adjacent to the Capitol grounds.\n\nThe visit comes after Trump was convicted by a New York jury in his hush money trial and weeks before he is slated to be formally nominated at the Republican National Convention. The twin meetings with congressional Republicans are supposed to help shore up unity in the party that has, at times, struggled to agree on major policy priorities, such as providing additional aid to Ukraine.\n\nHowever, some moderate members are expected to skip the meeting, such as Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Mitt Romney, R-Utah. Several of their peers insisted that's not necessarily a problem.\n\n\"I think there's lots of reasons for people to not show up,\" including scheduling conflicts, said Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D. \"It's a grand opportunity for us all to get together to kick off the official campaign but also to prepare, possibly, for a transition.\"\n\nDonald Trump, Mitch McConnell will meet for the first time in years as GOP leaders gather\n\nTop Republicans in Congress are expected to attend the meetings Thursday. That includes Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who has not met in-person with the former president since 2020. The two have had a frosty relationship after McConnell accepted the results of the 2020 presidential election and blamed the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack on Trump.\n\nMcConnell declined to say if he would bring up the animosity with the former president at the Senate meeting, reiterating that he intended to support the 2024 GOP nominee, whoever it may be. However, the Kentucky Republican declined to even reference Trump by name.\n\n\"I've said earlier this year I support him. He's earned the nomination by the voters all across the country and of course I'll be at the meeting tomorrow,\" McConnell told reporters.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., on the other hand, is a stalwart Trump ally, having served on the former president's defense team during his first impeachment trial. The speaker told reporters Wednesday morning he wants to use the meetings to lay out a clear-cut conservative agenda should the GOP sweep the coming elections.\n\n\"When (Trump) comes in, we got to have a very aggressive first 100 days agenda. The first year will be important and I think we cannot waste a moment,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said\n\nTrump's visit is important for Johnson's leadership post as well. The former president defended the speaker from Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's threat to oust him last month. At the same time, Trump has occasionally thrown a wrench into Johnson's legislative agenda, including briefly derailing his plans over a controversial spying law in April.\n\nTrump's four sets of criminal charges could also shape the House GOP's legislative agenda this year. A number of Republicans support a bill led by Rep. Russell Fry, R-S.C., that would allow presidents and vice presidents to move civil and criminal state cases to federal court instead. Johnson said he supports the proposal, but a number of Republican lawmakers are skeptical about the legislation. In addition to his New York hush money case, Trump also faces state-level charges in Georgia over allegations he tried to steal the state in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe meetings may also serve another purpose: Giving Trump face time with several of the people he is considering as his running mate. That includes Sens. JD Vance, R-Ohio, Tim Scott, R-S.C., and Marco Rubio, R-Fla., as well as House members such as Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y. and Byron Donalds, R-Fla.\n\nRep. Marc Molinaro, R-N.Y., told reporters he expects to hear Trump give a \"lay of the land as he sees it\" of the 2024 elections. Other lawmakers told USA TODAY they expect the meeting to be critical towards building a working relationship between congressional Republicans and the former president should the GOP take full control of Washington, picking up the White House and the Senate and maintaining control of the House. That kind of sweep would be an uphill battle for either party.\n\n\"We're working on cementing this relationship now so when January 20th comes, we have a plan in place to work together with the White House and Congress,\" Rep. Mark Alford, R-Texas, said, noting a major part of the GOP agenda is renewing Trump's 2017 tax cuts, which expire in 2025.\n\n\"That's the main thing that we need to make sure we talk about: That we communicate for the next few months, have a plan going into January,\" said Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala. As for what is on the table? \"You name it. All the crap that we had to put up for four years.\"\n\nWhat does Mike Johnson want after 2024?\n\nJohnson also met with Senate Republicans over lunch Wednesday to begin discussions on a potential party-line package to chase next year.\n\nJohnson told reporters after the meeting that he expressed interest in enacting new tax and spending cuts. Tax cuts passed during the Trump administration are set to expire in 2025, which means the next president will have a significant opportunity to rewrite the country's tax code.\n\n\"I think now we're in the education\" phase of teaching members what can and cannot be accomplished using the unique legislative tool known as \"reconciliation,\" said Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C. Reconciliation can bypass the Senate's 60-vote threshold for certain budget legislation.\n\nDemocrats used the tool in the first two years of the Biden administration to pass sweeping clean energy tax credits and other policies in the Inflation Reduction Act, a massive piece of legislation that aimed to address issues from transportation and the environment to insulin prices.\n\n\"Then it's appropriate to start talking about, ok, what does a common agenda look like?\" Tillis said of his Republican colleagues. \"This is something we need to do pretty early in Trump's tenure.\"", "source":

Trump is meeting with Senate Republicans this afternoon.\n\nIt is also the first time Trump has visited Capitol Hill since the January 6th riot at the Capitol. Trump was not present that day as his supporters stormed the building and he has not visited the Capitol building in the years that followed - including President Biden's inauguration, which Trump skipped.\n\n\"President Trump brought an extraordinary amount of energy, and excitement and enthusiasm this morning,\" Johnson said while flanked by other House leaders after their more than hour-long meeting.\n\nThe meetings mark a high-stakes affair for Trump and Republicans heading into the contentious final months of the campaign. While many Congressional Republicans are firmly behind Trump, there remains a divide among some as the former president faces multiple legal battles.\n\nSeveral members leaving the meeting highlighted Trump asking Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene to be \"nice\" to Johnson. Greene responded with a hand motion that signaled, \"maybe.\"\n\n\"President Trump was very much himself - no teleprompter, no notecards,\" said Greene, who led the failed effort to oust Johnson last month. \"He joked with everybody.\"\n\nGreene said there were no discussions about Trump's potential pick for vice president, and that Trump told members he \"feels a lot of states are in play\" with plans to spend money in New Jersey, New York, Minnesota and Virginia.\n\n\"He did say there's a few of you in the room that might not be happy with me because I'm supporting your opponent, but I will be doing tele-town halls for many of you, helping you get across the line, doing whatever it takes to win the House and win it big,\" she added.\n\nRep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C. said Trump was casting a wide net.\n\n\"There's no state he's not going in,\" he said.\n\nThat includes includes races where he isn't backing the incumbent.\n\nThe former president endorsed GOP Virginia Rep. Bob Good's primary challenger, John Maguire, ahead of next week's Republican primary. Good attended the meeting, but declined to discuss it with NPR on his way out.\n\nMembers said Trump did most of the talking in the meeting. Rep Ben Cline, R-Va., noted well over an hour into the session, \"it wasn't a discussion, Trump's just been talking,\" but he added Trump took some questions.\n\nTrump also took a swipe at those House GOP lawmakers who voted to impeach him in 2021, noting there weren't many left in Congress.\n\nLater, several members said he appeared to signal support of California Rep. David Valadao, who voted to impeach, but without naming him.\n\nHe also took a jab at Taylor Swift, noting he signed a bill during his administration to help songwriters, and that he was surprised Swift wasn't supporting him.\n\nSouth Carolina Rep. Nancy Mace said Trump devoted a significant portion of his remarks to speaking about abortion.\n\n\"Ensuring that women know that we care and that we're pro-woman and pro-life is a really important message for us going into November,\" Mace said. \"He talked about exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother.\"\n\nMace, one of Trump's former enemies, now has his endorsement, and was congratulated on her recent primary win.\n\nRep. Marc Molinaro, running for reelection in a competitive district in New York, told reporters on the abortion discussion, \"his point was obviously to speak from your heart. And I've embraced this in my own district for the people I represent, just we've got to be respectful of the very difficult choices women have to make.\"\n\nNorman said the message from Trump on abortion was \"let the states decide.\" He told lawmakers he's not going to get into the details on specific restrictions and they shouldn't either, but if they weigh in on specific restrictions in terms of 8, 10, 12 week ban, \"use your heart.\"\n\nMultiple Republicans told NPR that Trump talked about ramping up pressure on China, and touted his own policy as president imposing tariffs on China.\n\nOne House Republican who has not yet endorsed Trump, Rep. Dave Schweikert, R-Ariz., said about the discussion, \"I was actually pleased it was mostly on economy, on inflation. He told reporters he planned to endorse Trump after the GOP convention.\n\nGOP lawmakers said Trump didn't weigh in on a specific tax strategy, or the speaker's proposal to push through an aggressive package early in 2025 using expedited budget rules, but urged them to vote to cut taxes.\n\n\"He talked about tax-free tips, which is a great opportunity for middle class workers, people who basically make a living on tips to not pay taxes on those things, a good thing, a popular thing with the middle class,\" Rep. Mike Garcia, R-Calif., said.\n\nWyoming GOP Sen. John Barrasso, who chairs the Senate Republican Conference, said he invited Trump to hear his \"plans for the summer and policy agenda for 2025,\" his spokesperson said.\n\nThe Senate meeting will also be a chance for Trump to address skeptics within the party. In recent months, more Senate Republicans, including those initially resistant to weigh in, have said they're supporting Trump's re-election run. Others, like Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., have refused to back him or continue to avoid discussing their support for the former president.\n\nSen. Susan Collins of Maine, who was one of seven Senate Republicans to vote to convict Trump during his second impeachment trial, said she isn't attending Thursday's meeting because of a longstanding conflict.\n\nFor their part, congressional Democrats said today marked a reminder of a dark moment in the country's history, pointing to Trump's role in the Jan. 6 attack.\n\n\"On January 6th, Donald Trump lit a match to democracy with an insurrection on Capitol Hill, and, today, he's arrived at the scene of the crime and continues to throw fuel on the flame,\" said California Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren, who served on the former Jan. 6 committee.", "source": {"uri": "kpbs.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "KPBS"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Matt Gaetz of Florida, a fierce Trump ally, told CNN. \"I think it's gonna be a pep rally environment for the former and future president.\"\n\nAhead of the meeting, Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn noted it would be \"nice\" to \"get everybody singing from the same sheet of music.\" Cornyn has previously criticized Trump and said he preferred to see the GOP move in a different direction, before ultimately endorsing the former president in January.\n\nSenior campaign advisers said Trump was expected to express his campaign priorities and policies -- focusing on the economy, inflation, tax cuts and immigration during his meetings, first with House Republicans at the Capitol Hill club in the morning and then with Senate Republicans at the nearby National Republican Senatorial Committee building. He'll also reiterate his commitment to not cutting entitlement programs for seniors like Social Security and Medicare.\n\n\"We want to get everyone on the same page talking about policy, including the economy and inflation,\" one senior Trump adviser told CNN. \"That's the biggest factor in all the polling, it's the biggest thing people are worried about.\"\n\nTrump, who will be accompanied by his two top campaign officials, Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, among others, is also expected to discuss details around a potential second term agenda, including how to immediately implement his policy goals, with the help of lawmakers, if reelected to the White House. Meanwhile, House Republicans have been eager for information to help them jumpstart legislative action on Capitol Hill next year.\n\n\"We want to be part of that plan to hit the ground running,\" GOP Rep. Darrell Issa of California told CNN. \"When most presidents get elected, they anticipate they have eight years. This president knows he has four.\"\n\nAdvisers said the meetings would also be an opportunity to allow lawmakers to ask questions or bring up any pressing matters ahead of the November election, with Trump planning to open the floor to members after his remarks.\n\nHouse Majority Steve Scalise told CNN he's already talked to Trump directly about using a special budgetary tool to avoid the 60-vote threshold in the Senate - known as reconciliation - to advance tax cuts, border wall funding and other priorities if Republicans control all of Washington.\n\nSome of Trump's plans for a second term agenda have been outlined by the former President himself during rallies and interviews, including mass deportations of undocumented immigrants and leaving reproductive rights to the states, but other elements have been only proposed vaguely or behind closed doors, and leaked out by media outlets.\n\nSen. John Barrasso, the third-ranking Senate Republican, invited the full GOP conference to the Thursday event.\n\nHowever some senators skeptical of Trump would not commit to attending. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, one of a handful of GOP senators who have not endorsed Trump's 2024 election bid, said she would not attend due to a conflict. Sen. Todd Young of Indiana wouldn't say if he was planning to attend, adding that he wasn't talking about Trump this week.\n\nThough Trump won't be inside the US Capitol building, his appearance on the Hill will also mark his first time meeting with some key Republicans since the January 6, 2021, insurrection there, including Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nMcConnell, who has maintained an icy relationship with the former president ever since the Capitol attack, told CNN he will attend the meeting. The two have not spoken since the electoral college certified Joe Biden's victory in December 2020, however McConnell endorsed Trump earlier this year.\n\nAny tension is likely to be balanced out by some of Trump's biggest cheerleaders and potential vice-presidential picks, who will also be in attendance, including Sens. Tim Scott, Marco Rubio and JD Vance.\n\nOf those attending, many said they were looking for a more urgent focus, including Trump laying out a specific strategy to beat President Joe Biden.\n\n\"I will be honest with you. To think that we are going to talk a whole lot about a governing agenda on Thursday seems a little na\u00efve to me. That's like measuring the curtains,\" said Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina. \"This is about winning in November, and my guess is we may touch on the agenda next year, but that's a multi-variable equation not the least of which is how well we do here in Congress to take the gavels back.\"\n\nOthers see it as an opportunity to try and reset the party after months of internal tensions over the future of House Speaker Mike Johnson, aiding the war in Ukraine and the divisions over the best strategy on border security.\n\nIn the House, a chamber that has traditionally been friendlier to Trump, members said the former president will find a supportive and enthusiastic audience, including some dressed to impress.\n\n\"I just think he wants to get everybody on the same page,\" said Sen. Markwayne Mullin, a key Trump ally. \"There's been a little tension there in the Senate. And so it's just trying to keep the tension from building and saying our focus is Joe Biden and this administration, not each other.\"\n\nGOP Rep. Troy Nehls said he has several different Trump ties to choose from, though he complained that his gold, Trump-branded sneakers are back in Texas.\n\n\"He will know that I support him 110%, and I will do everything I can to fight like hell to make sure that he's the next president,\" Nehls said.\n\nRep. Elise Stefanik, who - as Republican conference chair - was in charge of organizing the House meeting, will also chair the event. Stefanik is one of a short list of vice presidential hopefuls to receive vetting materials from the Trump campaign. Rep. Byron Donalds is also on that list and is expected to attend Thursday.\n\nTrump's visit comes as House GOP leadership is facing increasing pressure from the right flank to go after the Justice Department and defend Trump in the wake of his hush money conviction in New York.\n\nOne legislative proposal Republican leaders are now actively pursuing is a bill that would allow current and former presidents to move state-level cases to federal court. The legislation passed out of committee last September, but GOP leaders only started formally whipping the bill this week - on the eve of Trump's Capitol Hill visit and two weeks after his conviction.\n\nOne thing both House and Senate Republicans agreed on: Trump was unlikely to stay on message.\n\nWhen asked if they believe Trump will discuss policy plans and campaign strategy and while avoiding airing his grievances, one GOP lawmaker told CNN, \"You know the answer to that. It ain't in his DNA.\"\n\n\"What do I expect? You have no idea what Trump is going to talk about. It's just totally unpredictable,\" said Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

He has successfully purged the GOP of critics, silenced skeptics and enticed once-critical lawmakers aboard his MAGA-fueled campaign.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\n\"We're excited to have Trump back,\" said House Speaker Mike Johnson, who led one of the lawsuits challenging the 2020 election, and had his biggest fundraising day yet after Trump's felony conviction.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe Republican speaker demurred over whether he's asked Trump to respect the peaceful transfer of presidential power and commit to not doing another Jan. 6. \"Of course he respects that, we all do, and we've all talked about it, ad nauseum.\"\n\nTrump is scheduled to deliver remarks to both groups at the House and Senate campaign headquarters near the U.S. Capitol and discuss issues animating his campaign -- including mass immigration deportations but also tax cuts and other priorities for a potential second term.\n\nIn between, Trump is expected to speak at the Business Roundtable downtown which routinely invites the presumptive presidential nominees to address the executives' group. Many potential priorities for a new White House administration are being formulated by a constellation of outside groups, including Project 2025, that are laying the groundwork for executive and legislative actions, though Trump has made clear he has his own agenda.\n\nBut the private meetings with House and Senate Republicans so close to the Capitol are infused with symbolism of Trump's return as the U.S. president who threatened the American tradition of the peaceful transfer of presidential power.\n\n\"It's frustrating,\" said former U.S. Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn, who made his own unsuccessful run for Congress as a Maryland Democrat in the aftermath of Jan. 6, when police engaged in hand-to-hand fighting to stop Trump supporters who stormed the building trying to overturn President Joe Biden's election.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nDunn spoke of the \"irony\" of Trump returning to the area and lawmakers now embracing him. \"It just shows the lack of backbone they have when they're truly putting party and person over country,\" he said. \"And it's sad.\"\n\nMany of those who once stood up to Trump are long gone from office and the Republicans who remain seem increasingly enthusiastic about the possibility of him retaking the White House, and the down-ballot windfall that could mean for their own GOP majorities in Congress.\n\nJohnson met with senators on Wednesday ahead of Trump's arrival as the Republicans mapped out potential priorities.\n\nOutgoing Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who once blamed Trump for the \"disgraceful\" attack that he called an \"insurrection\" now endorses the party's presumptive nominee and said: \"Of course I'll be at the meeting.\"\n\nSen. John Thune, the GOP whip who is vying to replace McConnell as leader, told The Associated Press that he's interested in hearing from Trump about the fall election and \"ways in which we, as a team, and him individually can appeal to the constituencies and people that may not traditionally vote Republican.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThune said, \"I think there's an opportunity there to really make this a big win.\"\n\nAs democracies around the world come under threat from a far-rightward shift, experts warn that the U.S. system, once seemingly immune from authoritarian impulses, is at risk of populist and extremist forces like those that Trump inspired to sack the Capitol.\n\n\"This is just another example of House Republicans bending the knee to Donald Trump,\" said Rep. Pete Aguilar of California, the chairman of the House Democratic caucus.\n\nMaking Jan. 6 a cornerstone of his reelection campaign, Trump celebrates those who stormed the Capitol as \"warriors\" and \"patriots,\" and he has vowed to pardon any number of the more than 1,300 America convicted of crimes for the assault on the seat of U.S. democracy.\n\nMoreover, Trump has vowed to seek retribution by ousting officials at the U.S. Justice Department, which is prosecuting him in a four-count indictment to overturn the election ahead of the Jan. 6 attack and another case over storing classified documents at his Mar-A-Largo home.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nRepublicans, particularly in the House but increasingly in the Senate, are vigorously following his lead, complaining of an unfair justice system. The House voted to hold hAttorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress and is re-investigating the House committee that investigated Jan. 6.\n\nAlongside Trump, the House and Senate GOP campaign arms scored some of their highest fundraising periods yet after a jury found him guilty in the New York hush money case.\n\nWhen former GOP Speaker Paul Ryan on Fox News reiterated this week that he wouldn't be voting for Trump and wished Republicans had another choice for president, he was immediately ostracized by Trump allies.\n\n\"Paul Ryan, you're a piece of garbage,\" said Rep. Troy Nehls, R-Texas. \"We should kick you out of the party.\"\n\nOf the Republicans who voted to impeach Trump over Jan. 6 and convict him on the charge of inciting the insurrection, only a few remain in office.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nSen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, are not expected to attend Thursday's closed-door session with Trump.\n\nBut Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said he would likely join the Trump meeting at GOP senators' campaign headquarters, expecting \"he's going to be the next president, so you have to work\" together.\n\nAsked if he was concerned about the direction of the Trump Republican Party, Cassidy: \"Let the day's own troubles be sufficient for the day. You can fill yourself up with anxiety about tomorrow, but will it change a thing? No.\"\n\nSen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who confronted Trump at times but did not join in the vote to convict him in the Capitol attack, said he did not expect the meeting to be contentious as Republicans hope to seize the Senate majority this fall.\n\n\"Look, we've got to win. And our ability to get a majority in the Senate is intrinsically linked to Trump winning. So we're like, one team, one vision. And I think that will be largely what we talk about,\" Tillis said.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Jill Colvin and Mary Clare Jalonick

And of course, I will be at the meeting,\" McConnell told reporters.\n\nThursday's events are expected to be more of an effort to boost morale and ensure the party is moving in one direction ahead of the election than to drill down on specific policy proposals.\n\nBut Trump is likely to be quizzed on plans to extend the tax cuts he implemented in 2017, as well as his proposals for a tough illegal immigration crackdown and his view of the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe conflict has exposed fissures between Trump's isolationist \"America First\" movement and more traditional conservatives who want to see Russia's Vladimir Putin defeated with the help of American weapons.\n\nThe former president is also due to make his case for a White House return to chief executives at a meeting of Washington lobby group Business Roundtable.\n\nPolitical news outlet Axios quoted a source familiar with Trump's expected remarks who said the former president was likely to focus on his plan \"to immediately reduce inflation and roll back anti-business Biden regulations.\"\n\nAn election forecast model combining state and national polls with economic indicators, out Wednesday from The Economist, gives Trump a two-in-three chance of winning reelection.

Bennie Thompson, chairman of the now-disbanded House committee that investigated the attack, asking \"how dare Trump show his face for such reasons?\"\n\nTrump continues to insist that the 2020 presidential election was rigged and has questioned the integrity of the upcoming November election -- as have several of his Republican allies.\n\nAhead of Trump's meeting with congressional Republicans, Republicans on the House Administration Committee issued subpoenas for documents from President Biden's Cabinet on the agency's efforts to help with voter registration , electoral information and to combat electoral disinformation and conspiracy theories.

Matt Gaetz of Florida, a fierce Trump ally, told CNN. \"I think it's gonna be a pep rally environment for the former and future president.\"\n\nAhead of the meeting, Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn noted it would be \"nice\" to \"get everybody singing from the same sheet of music.\" Cornyn has previously criticized Trump and said he preferred to see the GOP move in a different direction, before ultimately endorsing the former president in January.\n\nSenior campaign advisers said Trump was expected to express his campaign priorities and policies -- focusing on the economy, inflation, tax cuts and immigration during his meetings, first with House Republicans at the Capitol Hill club in the morning and then with Senate Republicans at the nearby National Republican Senatorial Committee building. He'll also reiterate his commitment to not cutting entitlement programs for seniors like Social Security and Medicare.\n\n\"We want to get everyone on the same page talking about policy, including the economy and inflation,\" one senior Trump adviser told CNN. \"That's the biggest factor in all the polling, it's the biggest thing people are worried about.\"\n\nTrump, who will be accompanied by his two top campaign officials, Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, among others, is also expected to discuss details around a potential second term agenda, including how to immediately implement his policy goals, with the help of lawmakers, if reelected to the White House. Meanwhile, House Republicans have been eager for information to help them jumpstart legislative action on Capitol Hill next year.\n\n\"We want to be part of that plan to hit the ground running,\" GOP Rep. Darrell Issa of California told CNN. \"When most presidents get elected, they anticipate they have eight years. This president knows he has four.\"\n\nAdvisers said the meetings would also be an opportunity to allow lawmakers to ask questions or bring up any pressing matters ahead of the November election, with Trump planning to open the floor to members after his remarks.\n\nHouse Majority Steve Scalise told CNN he's already talked to Trump directly about using a special budgetary tool to avoid the 60-vote threshold in the Senate - known as reconciliation - to advance tax cuts, border wall funding and other priorities if Republicans control all of Washington.\n\nSome of Trump's plans for a second term agenda have been outlined by the former President himself during rallies and interviews, including mass deportations of undocumented immigrants and leaving reproductive rights to the states, but other elements have been only proposed vaguely or behind closed doors, and leaked out by media outlets.\n\nTrump's reception among House and Senate Republicans is likely to vary\n\nSen. John Barrasso, the third-ranking Senate Republican, invited the full GOP conference to the Thursday event.\n\nHowever some senators skeptical of Trump would not commit to attending. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, one of a handful of GOP senators who have not endorsed Trump's 2024 election bid, said she would not attend due to a conflict. Sen. Todd Young of Indiana wouldn't say if he was planning to attend, adding that he wasn't talking about Trump this week.\n\nThough Trump won't be inside the US Capitol building, his appearance on the Hill will also mark his first time meeting with some key Republicans since the January 6, 2021, insurrection there, including Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nMcConnell, who has maintained an icy relationship with the former president ever since the Capitol attack, told CNN he will attend the meeting. The two have not spoken since the electoral college certified Joe Biden's victory in December 2020, however McConnell endorsed Trump earlier this year.\n\nAny tension is likely to be balanced out by some of Trump's biggest cheerleaders and potential vice-presidential picks, who will also be in attendance, including Sens. Tim Scott, Marco Rubio and JD Vance.\n\nOf those attending, many said they were looking for a more urgent focus, including Trump laying out a specific strategy to beat President Joe Biden.\n\n\"I will be honest with you. To think that we are going to talk a whole lot about a governing agenda on Thursday seems a little na\u00efve to me. That's like measuring the curtains,\" said Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina. \"This is about winning in November, and my guess is we may touch on the agenda next year, but that's a multi-variable equation not the least of which is how well we do here in Congress to take the gavels back.\"\n\nOthers see it as an opportunity to try and reset the party after months of internal tensions over the future of House Speaker Mike Johnson, aiding the war in Ukraine and the divisions over the best strategy on border security.\n\nIn the House, a chamber that has traditionally been friendlier to Trump, members said the former president will find a supportive and enthusiastic audience, including some dressed to impress.\n\n\"I just think he wants to get everybody on the same page,\" said Sen. Markwayne Mullin, a key Trump ally. \"There's been a little tension there in the Senate. And so it's just trying to keep the tension from building and saying our focus is Joe Biden and this administration, not each other.\"\n\nGOP Rep. Troy Nehls said he has several different Trump ties to choose from, though he complained that his gold, Trump-branded sneakers are back in Texas.\n\n\"He will know that I support him 110%, and I will do everything I can to fight like hell to make sure that he's the next president,\" Nehls said.\n\nRep. Elise Stefanik, who - as Republican conference chair - was in charge of organizing the House meeting, will also chair the event. Stefanik is one of a short list of vice presidential hopefuls to receive vetting materials from the Trump campaign. Rep. Byron Donalds is also on that list and is expected to attend Thursday.\n\nTrump's visit comes as House GOP leadership is facing increasing pressure from the right flank to go after the Justice Department and defend Trump in the wake of his hush money conviction in New York.\n\nOne legislative proposal Republican leaders are now actively pursuing is a bill that would allow current and former presidents to move state-level cases to federal court. The legislation passed out of committee last September, but GOP leaders only started formally whipping the bill this week - on the eve of Trump's Capitol Hill visit and two weeks after his conviction.\n\nOne thing both House and Senate Republicans agreed on: Trump was unlikely to stay on message.\n\nWhen asked if they believe Trump will discuss policy plans and campaign strategy and while avoiding airing his grievances, one GOP lawmaker told CNN, \"You know the answer to that. It ain't in his DNA.\"\n\n\"What do I expect? You have no idea what Trump is going to talk about. It's just totally unpredictable,\" said Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

He will then meet with Senate Republicans at the National Republican Senatorial Committee headquarters, where he will hold a news conference afterward.\n\nDuring the meetings, campaign officials say Trump will lay out his policy plans on immigration, entitlement programs and the economy.\n\n\"Looking ahead at the policies that will save the nation such as Trump's commitment to no impact on seniors with any cuts to Social Security or Medicare, policies that actually secure our borders and make our communities safe again, and an America first foreign policy that reclaims peace through strength and world leadership, and economic policies of lower taxes that reignite the vibrant trump economy we had just a few years ago,\" a campaign official said.\n\nTrump's last visit with Republicans happened while he was president in September 2020, when he gave remarks at the same members-only Republican club.\n\nTrump has stayed off the U.S. Capitol campus entirely since he left office shortly after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack. The closest he's come is when he met the executive board of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters near the Capitol building on Jan. 31.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell are both expected to attend the Thursday meetings between their caucuses and Trump.\n\nWhile Johnson and Trump have worked together on key issues since Johnson's rise to the speakership last fall, it will be the first time since 2020 that McConnell and Trump meet face-to-face.\n\nMcConnell and Trump have a rocky relationship, heightened after McConnell recognized President Joe Biden's victory in the wake of Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nMcConnell, asked on Wednesday if he plans to \"confront\" Trump about their disagreements, dodged the question and repeated his usual support for the Republican \"nominee.\"\n\n\"I said three years ago, right after the Capitol was attacked, that I would support our nominee regardless of who it was -- including him,\" McConnell told reporters. \"I've said earlier this year, I support him -- he's earned the nomination by the voters all across the country. And of course, I'll be at the meeting tomorrow.\"\n\nJohnson has openly embraced Trump, who was crucial in supporting him when he faced the threat of being ousted threat by conservative GOP House hard-liners, saying coordination with Trump is important heading into November's election and a potential second Trump presidency.\n\n\"I think it's important for the country, to have us, to have close coordination,\" Johnson said at a news conference on Wednesday. \"I believe he'll have, can be, the most consequential president of the modern era, because we have to fix effectively every area of public policy.\"\n\nAt that news conference, Johnson also told ABC News he supports a bill that would allow current or former presidents to move state charges against them into federal court -- a measure aimed at showing support for Trump after being found guilty in his hush money trial in a New York state court.\n\n\"I think that's an idea that makes sense. It makes sense to most Republicans, and I think almost everyone will be in favor of that. And that's what we're talking about and trying to move some of this forward,\" Johnson told ABC Senior Congressional Correspondent Rachel Scott.\n\nHowever, not every Republican is set to fully welcome back Trump when he comes to the nation's capital.\n\nSens. Susan Collins, Mitt Romney and Lisa Murkowski, who have been vocal Trump critics, have blamed previous conflicts as a reason for why they couldn't attend the meeting with Trump.\n\nAll three voted with Republicans to impeach Trump for his actions related to Jan. 6.\n\nThe group of political meetings comes as Trump is scheduled to be in Washington D.C. to participate in a moderated discussion at a quarterly meeting of the Business Roundtable, a group consisting of more than 200 CEOs. Business Roundtable spokesman Michael Steel said the group invited both presumptive presidential nominees, but with Biden overseas to attend the G7 summit, White House Chief of Staff Jeff Zients is slated to appear.", "source": {"uri": "abcnews.go.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ABC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type":

GOP lawmakers find themselves newly energized and reinvigorated by his bid to retake the White House.\n\nDespite the federal charges against Trump for conspiring to overturn the 2020 election, and his recent guilty verdict in an unrelated hush money trial, the Republican former president arrived emboldened as the party's presumptive nominee. He has successfully purged the GOP of critics, silenced most skeptics and enticed once-critical lawmakers aboard his MAGA-fueled campaign.\n\nA packed room of House Republicans sang \"Happy Birthday\" to Trump in the private breakfast meeting at GOP campaign headquarters across the street from the Capitol. The lawmakers gave him a baseball and bat from the annual congressional game.\n\n\"We're excited to welcome President Trump back,\" said House Speaker Mike Johnson a day earlier.\n\nThe Republican speaker had demurred over whether he's asked Trump to respect the peaceful transfer of presidential power and commit to not doing another Jan. 6. \"Of course he respects that, we all do, and we've all talked about it, ad nauseum.\"\n\nTrump told Johnson Thursday he thinks the speaker is doing a \"terrific job,\" according to a Republican in the private meeting and granted anonymity to discuss it. Trump asked Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the speaker's chief Republican critic, if she was being nice to Johnson, another Republican said.\n\nTrump is expected to be delivering remarks and discussing issues animating his campaign -- including mass immigration deportations but also tax cuts and other priorities for a potential second term.\n\nMany potential priorities for a new White House administration are being formulated by a constellation of outside groups, including Project 2025, that are laying the groundwork for executive and legislative actions, though Trump has made clear he has his own agenda.\n\nBut the private meetings with House and later in the afternoon Senate Republicans so close to the Capitol are infused with symbolism of Trump's return as the U.S. president who threatened the American tradition of the peaceful transfer of presidential power.\n\n\"It's frustrating,\" said former U.S. Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn, who made his own unsuccessful run for Congress as a Maryland Democrat in the aftermath of Jan. 6, when police engaged in hand-to-hand fighting to stop Trump supporters who stormed the building trying to overturn President Joe Biden's election.\n\nDunn spoke of the \"irony\" of Trump returning to the area and lawmakers now embracing him. \"It just shows the lack of backbone they have when they're truly putting party and person over country,\" he said. \"And it's sad.\"", "source": {"uri": "fox5dc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX 5 DC"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type":

I'll be with you always,\" he said. \"If [a relationship] wasn't fantastic, it gets worked out.\"\n\n\"We have one thing in mind, and that's making our county great again,\" he added.\n\nTrump did not take questions from reporters after the news conference, but waved and gave a thumbs up at a small group of supporters shouting \"I love you\".\n\n\"Thank you,\" he mouthed in response.\n\nFollowing a meeting between Trump and House Republicans earlier in the day, House Speaker Mike Johnson said the former president \"brought an extraordinary amount of energy and enthusiasm this morning\".\n\n\"That is what we're seeing in the party throughout the country,\" Mr Johnson said. \"We believe we are going to win back the White House, and the Senate, and grow the House majority.\"\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has been openly critical of Trump in the past, called the visit \"really positive\".\n\n\"He got a lot of standing ovations,\" Mr McConnell added.\n\nAt the meeting, Trump reportedly called the Wisconsin city of Milwaukee - which will host the Republican National Convention later this year - \"terrible\", prompting his spokesman to clarify that he was referencing crime in the city rather than the city itself.\n\nBefore the visit, Politico reported that Trump called Mr Johnson to urge him to help reverse his 31 May conviction on 34 counts of falsifying documents in New York.\n\n\"We have to overturn this,\" Trump reportedly said in an expletive-laden call.\n\nNew York Republican representative Marcus Molinaro told CBS, the BBC's US partner, that Trump made no mention of the conviction when meeting with House Republicans.\n\nMore than three years ago, Trump urged supporters to \"fight like hell\" just hours before a mob stormed the US Capitol on 6 January, 2021, in a failed bid to prevent the certification of the election.\n\nMrs Pelosi said in her statement: \"Donald Trump comes to Capitol Hill today with the same mission of dismantling our democracy.\n\n\"Make no mistake -

And of course, I will be at the meeting,\" McConnell told reporters.\n\nUS Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has not spoken to Donald Trump since 2021, but he said he would attend an upcoming meeting between the former president and Republican lawmakers on Capitol Hill\n\nThursday's events are expected to be more of an effort to boost morale and ensure the party is moving in one direction ahead of the election than to drill down on specific policy proposals.\n\nBut Trump is likely to be quizzed on plans to extend the tax cuts he implemented in 2017, as well as his proposals for a tough illegal immigration crackdown and his view of the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe conflict has exposed fissures between Trump's isolationist \"America First\" movement and more traditional conservatives who want to see Russia's Vladimir Putin defeated with the help of American weapons.\n\nThe former president is also due to make his case for a White House return to chief executives at a meeting of Washington lobby group Business Roundtable.\n\nPolitical news outlet Axios quoted a source familiar with Trump's expected remarks who said the former president was likely to focus on his plan \"to immediately reduce inflation and roll back anti-business Biden regulations.\"\n\nAn election forecast model combining state and national polls with economic indicators, out Wednesday from The Economist, gives Trump a two-in-three chance of winning reelection.

It comes at a crucial time in the cycle as he holds a slim lead over President Biden in battleground states, and Senate Republicans have grown bullish that they will win back the chamber after four years in the minority.\n\nFor Republicans, the hope is Thursday will help get them on the same page as they head toward the Republican National Convention next month and as Trump deals with the fallout from his felony conviction in New York two weeks ago.\n\n\"Division only helps our opposition,\" said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), a top McConnell ally who is running to succeed him atop the conference. \"So unity is really important, and I think President Trump understands that.\"\n\nPart of McConnell's calculus for supporting Trump was giving all of his members a boost for their Senate bids, including in a pair of red states where the former president is popular, and to help usher through the party's preferred primary candidates.\n\nThat was on display over the weekend as Trump backed Sam Brown in Nevada after much cajoling from party leaders. Brown easily won his primary Tuesday with 60 percent of the vote.\n\nTrump and McConnell also have an interest in getting in tune ahead of November, one source noted. If Trump runs well at the top of the ticket, it could bolster down-ballot candidates who hold the keys to the Senate majority.\n\nThat would allow Trump to push through a slew of policy priorities, while McConnell would end his tenure as Republican leader having helped usher in a new GOP majority.\n\n\"They're going to have to all be on the same page, and Trump is going to be the one to tell them exactly how to do it,\" said one GOP strategist who is friendly with the Trump campaign.\n\nMcConnell on Wednesday declined to say what he plans to say to Trump on Thursday, including over their shared bad blood. He added only that he has said multiple times since Jan. 6, 2021, that he would support the GOP nominee and that he backs Trump.\n\n\"And of course, I'll be at the meeting tomorrow,\" McConnell said.\n\nA senior Trump campaign official told The Hill the meeting will be focused on setting a policy agenda that could be quickly enacted if Republicans win control of Congress and the White House in November.\n\nThat includes efforts to extend the 2017 tax cuts, which are set to expire in 2025, as well as immigration and border policy.\n\nThis would mark the second policy-related conversation Senate Republicans have had in as many days after Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) met with them over lunch to discuss possible budget reconciliation options if the GOP hits the trifecta in November.\n\n\"I hope we do get into a little bit of policy, actually. You talk about uniting factors -- policy is where we're pretty united,\" Cramer said. \"I think it would be good politics as well.\"\n\nBut officials close to the Trump campaign acknowledged the meeting, and Trump's trip to D.C. in general, serves a broader purpose to assert the former president's control over the party and to demonstrate a show of force with the first debate against President Biden on the horizon.\n\n\"It's a direct and obvious signal that Donald Trump and no one else is the head of the Republican Party,\" one Trump ally said.\n\nBut one thing that is certain is that all of the Senate GOP conference will not greet Trump with open arms when they meet at the National Republican Senatorial Committee, including a number who are hostile toward the ex-president.\n\nAt least three Senate Republicans -- Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), Susan Collins (Maine) and Mitt Romney (Utah) -- said they will not be in attendance and said they have conflicts.\n\nTwo Senate Republicans, Todd Young (Ind.) and Bill Cassidy (La.), are also up in the air. Young has declined to answer all Trump-related questions this week, while Cassidy said that he was trying to finagle his schedule accordingly.\n\nMurkowski, Collins, Romney and Cassidy all voted to convict Trump in his impeachment trial over trying to overturn the election. Romney also voted to convict Trump in his first impeachment trial related to Ukraine.\n\nBut for those attending who have been in these sorts of meetings with the ex-president, the one thing they know to expect is the unknown.\n\n\"You have no idea what Trump's going to talk about,\" said Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa.). \"It's just totally unpredictable.\"\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

Credit - Anna Moneymaker -- Getty Images\n\nWhen Donald Trump hosted meetings with Republicans in Congress on Thursday, it was the first time the GOP nominee for President had been on Capitol Hill since his supporters stormed into the chambers by force on Jan. 6, 2021 to stop the certification of Joe Biden's victory.\n\nA lot has happened since then. The Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion. House Republicans booted Kevin McCarthy as Speaker. And Trump was convicted of 34 felonies in a New York courthouse.\n\nThere was much to talk about.\n\nOver the course of separate meetings with House members and Senators, Trump laughed about his conviction, praised current House Speaker Mike Johnson, and emphasized the need for Republicans to stay unified heading into November. He told Johnson's frequent antagonist, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, to be \"nice\" to the Speaker, eliciting laughter from every corner of the room, according to some in attendance.\n\nDuring his meeting with Senators at the National Republican Senatorial Committee offices, Trump also appeared to \"bury the hatchet\" with Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and other Senators who have been critical of the former President, a senior Republican Senate aide told TIME. In March, McConnell endorsed Trump for President, despite having previously said Trump was \"morally responsible\" for the Jan. 6 riot. \"I don't think Trump was taking shots at anyone,\" the aide said.\n\n\"I'm with them 1,000 percent. They're with me 1,000 percent,\" Trump told reporters Thursday afternoon after meeting with most Republican senators. \"We agree on just about everything and if there isn't, we work it out.\"\n\nTrump's visit coincided with a failed effort by Democrats in the Senate to pass a bill affirming the right for women nationwide to access in vitro fertilization (IVF) amid a national debate over the popular fertility treatment after the Alabama Supreme Court ruled in February that embryos are considered children. The Southern Baptist Convention this week suggested the government should \"restrain\" how IVF is used.\n\nTrump did not mention IVF in his meeting with House Republicans, lawmakers who attended the meetings told TIME, but he did emphasize that Republicans should unite behind his current position that decisions about abortion access should be left to the states. That stance is at odds with some of the GOP base, who are calling on Congress to pass a nationwide ban on abortion with no exceptions. \"He just reminded us that it is a state issue,\" says Rep. Roger Williams, a Texas Republican.\n\nRepublicans said that Trump spent the most time talking about the economy and criticizing the Biden Administration's policies. \"Trump was as energized as I've ever seen him,\" Rep. Ralph Norman, a Republican from South Carolina who originally backed former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley in the presidential primary, tells TIME of the meeting. \"He laid out a vision of what he's gonna do... He's confident he's going to be reelected.\"\n\nTrump told Fox News after his meeting with Senators that his running mate was \"probably\" in the room and that he would most likely unveil his pick during the Republican convention that starts on July 15. Punchbowl News reported that Trump mentioned Senators Tim Scott of South Carolina, Marco Rubio of Florida and J.D. Vance of Ohio by name during the meeting and joked that Scott \"wasn't a good presidential candidate\" but has been a \"great surrogate for him.\"\n\nTrump appeared to go slightly off topic during the House meeting, sources say, and at one point started ranting about crime rates. He called Milwaukee -- where Republicans are holding their convention next month -- a \"horrible city.\" Democrats quickly tore into Trump's denigration of the biggest city in a pivotal swing state. \"Add it to the list of things Donald Trump is wrong about,\" Wisconsin's Democratic Gov. Tony Evers wrote on X, including the clown emoji.\n\nAt one point, Trump floated the idea of eliminating the U.S. income tax and replacing it with tariffs on imports, according to those who attended the House meeting. Norman said the tariffs were pitched as a way to even the playing field with China.\n\nThe former President also commented on the flotilla of Russian warships that reached Cuba on Wednesday. The surprising move by President Vladimir Putin was viewed by many as a show of force after the Biden Administration said that Ukraine could use U.S.-provided weapons near Kharkiv while attacking Russian forces. The Russian ships are not carrying nuclear weapons, but they are capable of launching some of Russia's most highly touted missiles. Trump said such a display by Russia \"would not happen with him\" and that it's a \"very real threat,\" according to Norman.\n\nWhen a Republican asked him about immigration and the border, Trump allegedly claimed falsely that there are \"15 to 17 million\" illegal migrants in the U.S. who are registered to vote. Trump vowed to deport them all.\n\n\"I think he did the right thing,\" Williams says, \"by coming to where his base is and where his ambassadors will be -- guys like me... He brought the whole team in. He gave everybody a pep talk, and I thought it was great.\"\n\nSen. Raphael Warnock, a Democrat from Georgia, spoke with TIME on Thursday on his way to vote on the IVF measure. \"Trump is an American citizen and he can come to the Capitol,\" Warnock says. \"The question is why are my Republican colleagues going over there at a moment when we're trying to stand up for families and their ability to have children.\" Republicans ultimately blocked the measure.\n\nAsked what signal it sends that Republican lawmakers met with Trump, Warnock says, \"I think it shows the American people who they work for.\"\n\nTrump's visit to the Capitol comes two weeks after a Manhattan jury found him guilty on 34 felony counts for falsifying business records related to a sex scandal before the 2016 election, making him the first former President ever to be convicted of a crime. Congressional Republicans have blasted the verdict in an unprecedented and unified manner, claiming the prosecutor and judge were biased. Some have echoed Trump's baseless suggestion that the Biden administration played a role in the prosecution. During his meeting with House Republicans, Trump didn't appear too concerned about his felon status or his upcoming sentencing on July 11. \"He laughed about it,\" Norman said. \"It has actually helped him.\"\n\nHouse Republicans began their meeting by singing \"Happy Birthday\" to the former President, who turns 78 on Friday, and by presenting him with the game ball and bat from the congressional baseball game the previous night. Republicans beat the Democrats 31-11.\n\n\"He told me, 'I watched the baseball game...y'all played great,'\" says Williams, who coached the House Republicans to their fourth straight win. \"He picked out a few players who he said could have done a little better.\"", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

first time since January 6", "body": "The former president is meeting with House and Senate Republicans as he looks to reclaim the White House in November.\n\nHe is expected to be delivering remarks and discussing issues dominating his campaign, including mass immigration deportations, tax cuts and other priorities for a potential second term.\n\nMany potential priorities for a new White House administration are being formulated by a constellation of outside groups, though Trump has made clear he has his own agenda.\n\nBut the private meetings with House, and later in the afternoon the Senate, Republicans are infused with symbolism of Trump's return as the US president who threatened the American tradition of the peaceful transfer of presidential power.\n\nTrump appeared emboldened and enthusiastic on his arrival, despite the federal charges against him for conspiring to overturn the 2020 election and his recent guilty verdict in an unrelated hush money trial involving adult film star Stormy Daniels.\n\nAs the party's presumptive nominee, Trump has successfully rid the Republican Party of critics, silenced most skeptics among his circles and enticed once-critical lawmakers into assisting with his campaign.\n\nA packed room of House Republicans sang \"Happy Birthday\" to Trump in the private breakfast meeting at GOP campaign headquarters across the street from the Capitol.\n\n\"We're excited to welcome President Trump back,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson had said on Wednesday.\n\nThe Republican speaker was questioned on whether he asked Trump to respect the peaceful transfer of presidential power and commit to not repeating the actions of January 6. \"Of course he respects that, we all do, and we've all talked about it, ad nauseum,\" he said.\n\n\"It's frustrating,\" former US Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn said.\n\nHe made his own unsuccessful run for Congress as a Maryland Democrat in the aftermath of January 6 when police engaged in hand-to-hand fighting to stop Trump supporters who stormed the building trying to overturn President Joe Biden's election.\n\nDunn spoke of the \"irony\" of Trump returning to the area and lawmakers now embracing him.\n\n\"It just shows the lack of backbone they have when they're truly putting party and person over country,\" he said. \"And it's sad.\"\n\nMany of those who once stood up to Trump are long gone from office and the Republicans who remain appear to be increasingly enthusiastic about the possibility of him retaking the White House.\n\nBiden's team meanwhile is intensifying its focus on Trump and his role in the 2021 riot, according to CNN reports.\n\nThe campaign is using the presumptive Republican nominee's Capitol Hill appearance to launch a new attack ad spotlighting the insurrection.\n\nThe campaign recently announced Biden's endorsements from several January 6 police officers and now is unveiling a 30-second advert accusing Trump of inciting the events at the Capitol.\n\n\"There's nothing more sacred than our democracy, but Trump's ready to burn it all down,\" a narrator says in the 30-second TV advert, which the president's reelection campaign said would air in battleground states during local news broadcasts on Thursday.", "source": {"uri": "itv.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ITV Hub"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Matt Gaetz of Florida, a fierce Trump ally, told CNN. \"I think it's gonna be a pep rally environment for the former and future president.\"\n\nAhead of the meeting, Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn noted it would be \"nice\" to \"get everybody singing from the same sheet of music.\" Cornyn has previously criticized Trump and said he preferred to see the GOP move in a different direction, before ultimately endorsing the former president in January.\n\nSenior campaign advisers said Trump was expected to express his campaign priorities and policies -- focusing on the economy, inflation, tax cuts and immigration during his meetings, first with House Republicans at the Capitol Hill club in the morning and then with Senate Republicans at the nearby National Republican Senatorial Committee building. He'll also reiterate his commitment to not cutting entitlement programs for seniors like Social Security and Medicare.\n\n\"We want to get everyone on the same page talking about policy, including the economy and inflation,\" one senior Trump adviser told CNN. \"That's the biggest factor in all the polling, it's the biggest thing people are worried about.\"\n\nTrump, who will be accompanied by his two top campaign officials, Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, among others, is also expected to discuss details around a potential second term agenda, including how to immediately implement his policy goals, with the help of lawmakers, if reelected to the White House. Meanwhile, House Republicans have been eager for information to help them jumpstart legislative action on Capitol Hill next year.\n\n\"We want to be part of that plan to hit the ground running,\" GOP Rep. Darrell Issa of California told CNN. \"When most presidents get elected, they anticipate they have eight years. This president knows he has four.\"\n\nAdvisers said the meetings would also be an opportunity to allow lawmakers to ask questions or bring up any pressing matters ahead of the November election, with Trump planning to open the floor to members after his remarks.\n\nHouse Majority Steve Scalise told CNN he's already talked to Trump directly about using a special budgetary tool to avoid the 60-vote threshold in the Senate - known as reconciliation - to advance tax cuts, border wall funding and other priorities if Republicans control all of Washington.\n\nSome of Trump's plans for a second term agenda have been outlined by the former President himself during rallies and interviews, including mass deportations of undocumented immigrants and leaving reproductive rights to the states, but other elements have been only proposed vaguely or behind closed doors, and leaked out by media outlets.\n\nTrump's reception among House and Senate Republicans is likely to vary\n\nSen. John Barrasso, the third-ranking Senate Republican, invited the full GOP conference to the Thursday event.\n\nHowever some senators skeptical of Trump would not commit to attending. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, one of a handful of GOP senators who have not endorsed Trump's 2024 election bid, said she would not attend due to a conflict. Sen. Todd Young of Indiana wouldn't say if he was planning to attend, adding that he wasn't talking about Trump this week.\n\nThough Trump won't be inside the US Capitol building, his appearance on the Hill will also mark his first time meeting with some key Republicans since the January 6, 2021, insurrection there, including Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nMcConnell, who has maintained an icy relationship with the former president ever since the Capitol attack, told CNN he will attend the meeting. The two have not spoken since the electoral college certified Joe Biden's victory in December 2020, however McConnell endorsed Trump earlier this year.\n\nAny tension is likely to be balanced out by some of Trump's biggest cheerleaders and potential vice-presidential picks, who will also be in attendance, including Sens. Tim Scott, Marco Rubio and JD Vance.\n\nOf those attending, many said they were looking for a more urgent focus, including Trump laying out a specific strategy to beat President Joe Biden.\n\n\"I will be honest with you. To think that we are going to talk a whole lot about a governing agenda on Thursday seems a little na\u00efve to me. That's like measuring the curtains,\" said Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina. \"This is about winning in November, and my guess is we may touch on the agenda next year, but that's a multi-variable equation not the least of which is how well we do here in Congress to take the gavels back.\"\n\nOthers see it as an opportunity to try and reset the party after months of internal tensions over the future of House Speaker Mike Johnson, aiding the war in Ukraine and the divisions over the best strategy on border security.\n\nIn the House, a chamber that has traditionally been friendlier to Trump, members said the former president will find a supportive and enthusiastic audience, including some dressed to impress.\n\n\"I just think he wants to get everybody on the same page,\" said Sen. Markwayne Mullin, a key Trump ally. \"There's been a little tension there in the Senate. And so it's just trying to keep the tension from building and saying our focus is Joe Biden and this administration, not each other.\"\n\nSens. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., center, talks with his GOP colleagues at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on Wednesday, April 26, 2023.\n\nTom Williams/CQ Roll Call/AP\n\nGOP Rep. Troy Nehls said he has several different Trump ties to choose from, though he complained that his gold, Trump-branded sneakers are back in Texas.\n\n\"He will know that I support him 110%, and I will do everything I can to fight like hell to make sure that he's the next president,\" Nehls said.\n\nRep. Elise Stefanik, who - as Republican conference chair - was in charge of organizing the House meeting, will also chair the event. Stefanik is one of a short list of vice presidential hopefuls to receive vetting materials from the Trump campaign. Rep. Byron Donalds is also on that list and is expected to attend Thursday.\n\nTrump's visit comes as House GOP leadership is facing increasing pressure from the right flank to go after the Justice Department and defend Trump in the wake of his hush money conviction in New York.\n\nOne legislative proposal Republican leaders are now actively pursuing is a bill that would allow current and former presidents to move state-level cases to federal court. The legislation passed out of committee last September, but GOP leaders only started formally whipping the bill this week - on the eve of Trump's Capitol Hill visit and two weeks after his conviction.\n\nOne thing both House and Senate Republicans agreed on: Trump was unlikely to stay on message.\n\nWhen asked if they believe Trump will discuss policy plans and campaign strategy and while avoiding airing his grievances, one GOP lawmaker told CNN, \"You know the answer to that. It ain't in his DNA.\"\n\n\"What do I expect? You have no idea what Trump is going to talk about. It's just totally unpredictable,\" said Sen. Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lauren_fox@cnn.com", "name": "Lauren Fox", "type": "author",

Brandon Bell/Getty Images .\n\nswitch captionBrandon Bell/Getty Images\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is in Washington on Thursday to visit congressional Republicans for the first time since he left office and since his historic criminal convictions in New York's secret trial.\n\nTrump is expected to meet with lawmakers in closed-door discussions near the Capitol, with a breakfast with House Republicans and an afternoon session with their Senate counterparts.\n\n\"There's a lot of anticipation and a lot of excitement here,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said before the meeting, adding that his members wanted to \"kick off ideas\" with Trump.\n\nThe meeting marks a high-stakes affair for Trump and Republicans heading into the contentious final months of the presidential campaign. Even though many congressional Republicans strongly support Trump, some Republican members remain divided over how strongly to support the former president as he faces multiple legal battles.\n\nJohnson said it was critical that House Republicans plan an \"aggressive agenda for the first 100 days.\"\n\n\"I think we can't waste a moment, because there's so much to do,\" Johnson said Wednesday. \"So in light of that, we are having discussions with [Trump] and his team now and between us to plan accordingly. You don't put the cart before the horse, but you must be willing to lead. And we're going to be prepared. \"\n\nBefore the meeting, Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., said he expected Trump to rally the conference and \"lay out a vision, lay out what our role is, lay out for the next five months what he will concentrate.\" on.\"\n\nSen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, the third-ranking Republican in the Upper House, told colleagues he had invited Trump. Barrasso, who chairs the Senate Republican Conference, said he invited Trump to hear \"Trump's plans for the summer and his policy agenda for 2025,\" his spokesperson said.\n\nSen. Markwayne Mullin, Republican of Oklahoma, told reporters he expects the meeting to be a \"team-building moment.\"\n\n\"Our fight is not between us. Our fight is to fight against the agenda presented by the Biden administration,\" he said Wednesday. \"We're all on the same team and we have to win the Super Bowl in November, and that's kind of the message he's going to bring.\"\n\nA senior Trump campaign official told NPR this week that the meeting would involve policy discussions on Social Security, Medicare, immigration and the U.S.-Mexico border, taxes and foreign politic.\n\nThe Senate meeting will also be an opportunity for Trump to address skeptics within the Republican Party. In recent months, more Republican senators, including those initially reluctant to intervene, have said they support Trump's re-election. Others, like Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., declined to support him or continued to avoid discussing their support for the former president.\n\nSen. Susan Collins of Maine, who was one of seven Senate Republicans to vote to convict Trump in his second impeachment trial, said she would not attend Thursday's meeting due to a conflict for a long time.\n\nFor their part, congressional Democrats said the plans were no surprise and illustrate the chaos facing much of the Republican Party today.\n\n\"This is just another example of how House Republicans are kneeling in the face of Donald Trump,\" said House Democratic Caucus Chairman Pete Aguilar. \"He wants them to indict [President] Joe Biden, they didn't make it. Now they move on to [Attorney General] Merrick Garland. You know, the censorship, the impeachments, that's how dysfunctional the Republican conference is. \"\n\nNPR's Franco Ordoez and Jeongyoon Han contributed to this report.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits

Hill and whips up Republican...", "body": "Donald Trump made a return on Thursday to Capitol Hill, whipping up US House and Senate Republicans in his first meetings since the January 6 2021 attacks.\n\nHe was embraced by Republican legislators who find themselves newly energised by his bid to retake the White House.\n\nDespite pending federal charges against Mr Trump for conspiring to overturn the 2020 election, and his recent guilty verdict in an unrelated hush money trial, the Republican former president arrived emboldened as the party's presumptive nominee.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump arrives to speak to reporters at the National Republican Senatorial Committee in Washington (Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nHe has successfully purged the Republican Party of critics, silenced most sceptics and enticed once-critical legislators aboard his MAGA-fuelled campaign.\n\nA packed room of House of Representatives Republicans sang Happy Birthday to Mr Trump in a private breakfast meeting at Republican Party campaign headquarters across the street from the Capitol.\n\nThe legislators gave him a baseball and bat from the annual congressional game.\n\nMr Trump bragged that even his telephone rallies for legislators could draw bigger crowds than mega-popstar Taylor Swift, who has yet to make any endorsement.\n\n\"There's tremendous unity in the Republican Party,\" Mr Trump said in brief remarks later at Senate Republican Party headquarters.\n\nMr Trump spent about an hour each with House and Senate Republicans delivering free-wheeling remarks, fielding questions and discussing issues - including Russia and immigration, tax cuts and other priorities for a potential second term.\n\nDuring the morning session, Mr Trump said he thinks House speaker Mike Johnson is doing a \"terrific job\", according to a Republican in the private breakfast meeting.\n\nPresident Trump brought an extraordinary amount of energy, excitement and enthusiasm this morning Mike Johnson, House of Representatives speaker\n\nMr Trump asked Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, the speaker's chief Republican critic, if she was being \"nice\" to Mr Johnson, another Republican said.\n\n\"President Trump brought an extraordinary amount of energy, excitement and enthusiasm this morning,\" Mr Johnson said afterwards, noting high fundraising tallies since the guilty verdict.\n\n\"We're feeling good.\"\n\nThe Republican speaker had demurred earlier over whether he has asked Mr Trump to respect the peaceful transfer of presidential power and commit to not doing another January 6.\n\nHe said: \"Of course he respects that, we all do, and we've all talked about it, ad nauseum.\"\n\nThursday afternoon offered the first encounter in years between Mr Trump and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who once blamed Mr Trump for the \"disgraceful\" attack that he called an \"insurrection\" but now endorses the party's presumptive nominee.\n\nMr McConnell said Mr Trump received standing ovations from the senators and the two \"had a really positive meeting\".\n\nThe senator said: \"He and I got a chance to talk a little bit, shook hands a few times.\"\n\nMany potential priorities for a new White House administration are being formulated by a constellation of outside groups, including Project 2025, laying the groundwork for executive and legislative actions, though Mr Trump has made clear he has his own agenda.\n\nIt just shows the lack of backbone they have when they're truly putting party and person over country Harry Dunn, former US Capitol Police officer\n\nOn one major controversial issue, Mr Trump told legislators that abortion rules should be left to the states and said he supported exceptions for rape, incest and to save the life of the mother, legislators said.\n\n\"Anybody who thought that this president was going to be down after the sham trial, it's only giving him even more energy,\" said Representative Tom Emmer, the Republican Party whip.\n\n\"Donald Trump is crushing this election.\"\n\nBut Mr Trump's private meetings with House and Senate Republicans so close to the Capitol were infused with the symbolism of his return as the US president who threatened the American tradition of the peaceful transfer of power.\n\n\"It's frustrating,\" said former US Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn, who made his own unsuccessful run for Congress as a Maryland Democrat in the aftermath of January 6, the day when police engaged in hand-to-hand fighting to stop Trump supporters who stormed the building in an effort to overturn Joe Biden's election.\n\nMr Dunn spoke of the \"irony\" of Mr Trump returning to the area and legislators now embracing him.\n\n\"It just shows the lack of backbone they have when they're truly putting party and person over country,\" he said.\n\n\"And it's sad.\"\n\nMr Biden was overseas on Thursday attending a summit of the Group of Seven leading industrialised nations, but the president's campaign unveiled a new ad blaming Mr Trump for lighting the \"fire\" of January 6 and threatening democracy.", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily

Brandon Bell/Getty Images hide caption\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is in Washington on Thursday to visit with congressional Republicans for the first time since he left office -- and since his historic criminal convictions in the New York hush money trial.\n\nTrump is expected to meet lawmakers in closed-door talks near Capitol Hill, with a breakfast visit set with House Republicans and an afternoon session with their Senate counterparts.\n\n\"There's high anticipation here and great excitement,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said ahead of the meeting, adding that his members want to \"bounce around ideas\" with Trump.\n\nThe meeting marks a high-stakes affair for Trump and Republicans heading into the contentious final months of the presidential campaign. While many congressional Republicans are firmly behind Trump, there remains a divide among some Republican members on how strongly to support the former president as he faces multiple legal battles.\n\nJohnson said it's critical for House Republicans to plan for an \"aggressive first 100 days agenda.\"\n\n\"I think we cannot waste a moment, because there's so many things to do,\" Johnson said Wednesday. \"So in light of that, we're having discussions with [Trump] and his team now and amongst ourselves to plan accordingly. You don't put the cart before the horse, but you do have to be prepared to lead. And we're going to be prepared.\"\n\nAhead of the meeting, Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., said he expects Trump to rally the conference and \"lay out a vision, lay out what our role is, lay out for the next five months what he's going to be concentrating on.\"\n\nSen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, the No. 3 Republican in the upper chamber, told colleagues that he invited Trump. Barrasso, who chairs the Senate Republican Conference, said he made the invitation to hear Trump's \"plans for the summer and policy agenda for 2025,\" his spokesperson said.\n\nSen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., told reporters that he expects the meeting to be a \"team-building time.\"\n\n\"Our fight is not among each other. Our fight is fighting against the agenda that the Biden administration is putting out,\" he said Wednesday. \"We're all on the same team and we need to go win the Super Bowl in November, and that's kind of the message he'll bring.\"\n\nA senior Trump campaign official told NPR this week that the meeting will involve policy discussions looking ahead on Social Security, Medicare, immigration and the U.S.-Mexico border, taxes and foreign policy.\n\nThe Senate meeting will also be a chance for Trump to address skeptics within the Republican Party. In recent months, more Senate Republicans, including those initially resistant to weigh in, have said they're supporting Trump's reelection run. Others, like Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., have refused to back him or have continued to avoid discussing their support for the former president.\n\nSen. Susan Collins of Maine, who was one of seven Senate Republicans to vote to convict Trump during his second impeachment trial, said she isn't attending Thursday's meeting because of a long-standing conflict.\n\nFor their part, congressional Democrats said the plans were no surprise and are illustrative of the chaos that faces much of the Republican Party today.\n\n\"This is just another example of House Republicans bending the knee to Donald Trump,\" said House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar. \"He wants them to impeach [President] Joe Biden -- they failed at that. Now they're moving on to [Attorney General] Merrick Garland. You know, censure, impeachments -- that's just how dysfunctional the Republican conference is.\"", "source": {"uri": "npr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "NPR"}, "authors": [{"uri":

David Valadao of California.\n\n\"I never loved him,\" Trump said of Valadao, according to a GOP member.\n\nAs a number of House Republicans find themselves in competitive primary races, the former president said he wanted to do tele-town halls, but acknowledged his help would not be welcomed by some, given that he had endorsed their primary opponents.\n\nTrump did not shy away from acknowledging the bad blood between House Speaker Mike Johnson and GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who unsuccessfully tried to oust Johnson against Trump's wishes. The former president playfully asked Greene, a staunch ally of his who he strongly supports, to be nice to the speaker.\n\n\"He's always so sweet, recognizing me, and he said 'are you being nice to Speaker Johnson?' He was joking. And I said 'eh,'\" as she gestured with her hands. \"He said 'OK be nice to him' and I nodded my head,\" she added.\n\nJohnson, after the meeting, said the former president told him that he was doing \"a very good job\" and that he plans to be \"fully prepared\" to implement Trump's plans if he wins in November.\n\nThe former president's conviction also hung heavy over Thursday's meeting.\n\nTrump's allies on Capitol Hill immediately sprung into action following the guilty verdict -proposing to defund the Department of Justice and even shut down the government. House Republicans voted to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress on Wednesday. And one legislative proposal Republican leaders are now actively pursuing is a bill that would allow current and former presidents to move state-level cases to federal court. The legislation passed out of committee last September, but GOP leaders only started formally whipping the bill this week - on the eve of Trump's Capitol Hill visit and two weeks after his conviction.\n\nIn his meeting with GOP lawmakers, Trump called the Department of Justice \"dirty no good bastards,\" according to another source in the room.\n\nGOP Rep. Kevin Hern of Oklahoma said the former president expressed he was \"gravely concerned\" about the federal government being weaponized.\n\nIn a news conference after the meeting, House Majority Whip Tom Emmer said that the former president's felony convictions have only energized the party that will propel them to victory in November.\n\n\"Anybody who thought that this President was going to be down after the sham trial, after that crooked trial that we saw in New York, I think, again, it's only given him even more energy,\" Emmer said. \"And what he did for us upstairs just now is, he showed us that energy and he showed us that positive outlook, despite all the garbage they've been throwing at him with their lawfare and their nonsense.\"\n\nTrump tells GOP lawmakers to 'follow your own heart' on abortion\n\nTrump had a direct message for House Republicans on how to approach abortion leading into November, an issue Republicans have struggled to unify around in the wake of Roe v. Wade being overturned.\n\nJohnson relayed that Trump told the group to \"exercise your own conscience to talk about it, share your conviction, and do that in a way that makes sense to people. And I think he had made a good point.\"\n\nTrump, in a low voice, advised Republicans to not be afraid of the issue, according to sources in room, and claimed that Democrats are the extreme ones on the topic. He called on Republicans to follow their convictions but cautioned how they address the matter on the campaign trail and advocated for exceptions.\n\n\"He talked and pushed for exceptions for rape, life of the mother and incest. He talked about the way that we need to talk about it, quote correctly, his words, not mine,\" GOP Rep. Nancy Mace told CNN. \"And I really appreciated his comments as a woman, as a suburban mom.\"\n\nTrump also talked about how Roe v. Wade finally put the decision to the states as they always wanted, though he noted some of them made \"not so good\" decisions.\n\n\"But like Ronald Reagan, you have to have three choices: life of mother, rape and incest you have to do, but you have to follow your own heart,\" Trump said, according to a source in the room.\n\nTrump's message came as the Supreme Court rejected a lawsuit challenging the Food and Drug Administration's approach to regulating the abortion pill mifepristone with a ruling that will continue to allow the pills to be mailed to patients without an in-person doctor's visit.\n\nThe former president also ticked through a handful of other priorities, including his proposal to eliminate taxes on tips, building the southern border, and halting further aid for Ukraine, even though a number of lawmakers in his party support it.\n\nTrump off topic\n\nThere were a number of moments where the former president went off topic.\n\nAs Trump was ranting about crime rates and so-called election integrity issues, the former president called Milwaukee - where Republicans are holding their convention this summer - \"horrible,\" according to a source in the room.\n\nRep. Derrick Van Orden, a Wisconsin Republican who was in the room, made clear to CNN that Trump was \"specifically referring to crime in Milwaukee\" and not the city itself.\n\nIn one bizarre moment, Trump called Pelosi's daughter a \"wacko\" and then claimed her daughter once told him that he and the former House speaker would have had a \"great romance\" in another life, according to a lawmaker in the room..\n\nIn response to Trump's comments, one of Pelosi's daughters posted on X: \"speaking for all 4 Pelosi daughters -- this is a LIE. His deceitful, deranged obsession with our mother is yet another reason Donald Trump is unwell, unhinged and unfit to step foot anywhere near her -- or the White House.\"\n\nHe also questioned why popstar Taylor Swift would support President Joe Biden over him, whom he referred to as a \"dope.\"\n\n\"Why would she endorse this dope,\" Trump said, according to a member in the room. \"He doesn't know how to get off a stage.\"\n\nThe former president even said at one point of Hannibal Lecter: \"nNice guy ... he even had a friend over for dinner.\"\n\nAt the start of the meeting, House Republicans sang happy birthday to the former president, whose birthday is Friday, and presented him with the game ball and bat from the congressional baseball game that Republican won on Wednesday, according to a source in the room.\n\nSenate meeting striking a more unifying tone\n\nA few hours later, Trump met with Senate Republicans behind closed doors and - lawmakers said - struck a unifying tone.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has had a distant and icy relationship with the former president and has not spoken directly to him since December 2020, said that he shook hands with Trump and that the meeting was positive.\n\n\"I can't think of anything to tell you out of it that was negative,\" he said.\n\nThe former president sat between McConnell and Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, who also has had a rocky relationship with the former president.\n\n\"He is the choice of our voters overwhelmingly. It shows that he is absolutely the leader of the party,\" Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri said of Trump. \"I mean, you had people who have vociferously opposed him, who were sitting right next to him in the room.\"\n\nTrump himself praised a \"great meeting\" with Senate Republicans, saying there's \"tremendous unity\" in the GOP.\n\nTrump made a point of saying he'll stand behind GOP lawmakers in their own races, telling the senators beside him, \"You're all either elected or you're going to be elected again and reelected, and I'm with every one of you and you know that.\"\n\nSen. Marco Rubio of Florida characterized the meeting as \"getting the team back together\" and providing the state of the former president's campaign.\n\n\"Optimism, but a lot of work to be done,\" Rubio said.\n\nMeanwhile, Sen. John Cornyn of Texas said the former president \"expressed frustration\" over his recent conviction.\n\n\"He expressed frustration over the recent trial, you can imagine, and justifiably in my view,\" Cornyn said. He said Trump did not bring up January 6.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

A nonpartisan audit of the 2020 election in Wisconsin found no evidence of irregularities.\n\nMEMORIES OF JAN. 6\n\nTrump's supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, fueled by his false claims that his defeat was the result of fraud. Thursday's visit was his first public appearance on Capitol Hill since that day and Democrats said he was not welcome.\n\n\"After inciting a deadly insurrection that defiled the halls of Congress, how dare Trump show his face on these grounds?\" Democratic Representative Bennie Thompson said in a statement.\n\nThe Biden campaign on Thursday began running an ad in battleground states highlighting the violence of Jan. 6.\n\nRepublican lawmakers said Trump told them he would work to expand the party's narrow 218-213 House majority and take control of a Senate that Democrats currently lead 51-49.\n\nTrump also advised House Republicans not to push a national ban on abortion and urged them to abandon the intra-party squabbling that has hobbled their effectiveness, lawmakers said.\n\nIt was Trump's first face to face meeting with McConnell since the Jan. 6 attack. The two had not spoken since a few weeks before then, when McConnell affirmed Biden's 2020 victory. Two moderate Republican senators, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, skipped the event.\n\nMcConnell did not appear with Trump at a news conference after the meeting.\n\nTIPS AND TARIFFS\n\nTrump also urged lawmakers to cut taxes on income from tips, an idea he first floated on Sunday to appeal to service workers, multiple lawmakers said.\n\nTrump used tariffs aggressively during his 2017-2021 term in office, placing levies of up to 25% on a wide range of Chinese products as one of many efforts to thwart competition.\n\nSenator Mike Rounds said that cutting taxes on tips could help Republicans win over working-class voters.\n\n\"If there was something we could do to really energize that particular segment of the population, that might be a real popular thing to do,\" Rounds told reporters.\n\nBiden's support among voters without college degrees or living in households earning $50,000 a year or less has fallen sharply, Reuters/Ipsos polling shows, though large numbers of those voters have not shifted their support to Trump.\n\nTrump also criticized a $60 billion aid package for Ukraine that recently passed with Republican support, lawmakers said.\n\n\"He's like, if Ukraine wins, what will be the benefit?\" Republican Representative Don Bacon told reporters.\n\nTrump told Republicans they should allow states to set their own policies on abortion, rather than push for a nationwide ban following the Supreme Court's 2022 decision that ended the nationwide guarantee of abortion access. Many in the party want to outlaw the procedure entirely.\n\n\"He reiterated he thought that was the right decision, that some states will do one thing and some states will do another,\" Republican Representative French Hill told reporters.\n\nTrump also spoke to the Business Roundtable, an association of more than 200 corporate chief executives.

It also marked his first appearance on the Hill since becoming a convicted felon two weeks ago, and put him face-to-face with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., with whom he has clashed, for the first time in three years.\n\nTrump's morning session in private with House Republicans at the Capitol Hill Club was described as something of a pep rally for conservative causes. Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., and others said the atmosphere was a mix of civil and serious, with some lighter moments. Trump was slated to meet with GOP senators later in the day.\n\n\"The president was having a little fun cracking jokes, that kind of thing,\" said Donalds, mentioned on some lists as a potential Trump running mate. \"But then, also talking seriously just about [members] just working hard to get to the finish line in this election.\"\n\nHouse Appropriations Chairman Tom Cole, R-Okla., described the session as \"a pretty good rally-the-troops kind of speech.\" Trump will turn 78 on Friday, and several members, with grins, said House Republicans sang \"Happy Birthday.\"\n\nAs they dodged a handful of anti-Trump protesters outside, multiple members said Trump said Speaker Mike Johnson is doing a \"great job,\" and he teased Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Georgia Republican who has clashed with Johnson, R-La. Members said Trump asked if she has been more \"nice\" to Johnson. \"Some people kind of laughed. A few cheered,\" said Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn. \"I thought she took it very gracious.\"\n\nLawmakers said Trump stood by his boasting about how conservatives on the Supreme Court - including three that he appointed - ended federal abortion protections. He also vowed to again use tariffs as president and endorsed a House-passed Republican immigration measure known as H.R. 2.\n\n\"He's a big believer in tariffs,\" Cole said, noting Trump spoke about the trade tactic \"at great length,\" and added: \"He clearly supports them as a tool.\"\n\nOn abortion, \"he still believes that the Dobbs decision was the right decision for America, and the American people need to decide the issue, as they are doing right now,\" said Republican Study Committee Chair Kevin Hern, R-Okla., referring to the Supreme Court decision that ended federal protections for abortion access.\n\nAt campaign rallies and in other public remarks of late, Trump has said the Dobbs ruling rightfully handed the hot-button issue - on which polls show voters siding with Democrats - to state governments. To that end, he told House members Thursday that state \"legislatures need to make that decision and we're seeing that happen across America,\" Hern said.\n\n\"He said there may be a time and place for the federal government to get involved, but right now, what needs to be done is the voices of the people in the states [should be heard],\" the chairman added. \"Some are going the right way for Republicans and some are not and he acknowledged that.\"\n\nHis meetings with Hill Republicans were intended as a show of support for the presumptive GOP presidential nominee following his conviction on 34 criminal counts of falsifying business records. It also was meant as a display of Republican unity after, especially on the House side, GOP members have clashed with themselves in recent months.\n\nWhile Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitt Romney of Utah - all Trump critics - said they would skip the afternoon session with Trump, the former president's popularity within the party is as strong as ever. For instance, 80.4% of GOP voters had a favorable view of Trump, according to a FiveThirtyEight analysis. (Less than one-third, 17.8%, reported having an unfavorable view.)\n\nTrump, despite becoming the first former U.S. president to be convicted by a jury, continues to run a competitive race against President Joe Biden. Another FiveThirtyEight metric put them in a dead heat nationally, with Trump leading 40.9% to Biden's 40%.\n\nRatings by Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales give Trump the advantage five months from Election Day in the Electoral College race, with a projected 235 votes to Biden's 226 - but both would be shy of the 270 needed to secure the presidency.\n\nHern told reporters that Trump described the swing states that are expected to decide the presidential race as \"looking really good right now,\" noting that Trump told House members \"people are really turning out in huge numbers\" and that the former president believes \"his message is being well received.\"\n\nAs the 2024 campaign heats up, Cole - who faces a primary challenge on Tuesday - said the House GOP conference \"will be extraordinarily supportive\" of Trump, and along with Senate Republicans \"will give him an exceptional platform - lots of chips to play.\"\n\nInside Elections and other political prognosticators see control of both chambers as up for grabs. To that end, Donalds said Trump indicated he intends to get involved in congressional races. That's despite the former president's poor record with helping the party win congressional races since he first was on the ballot in 2016.\n\n\"He's going to work hard. You know, he wants everybody to be successful,\" he said. \"It's all hands on deck.\"\n\nBut Hern said Trump made clear that \"he's not going to carry the load for us - we can't stop working as individuals.\"\n\nAs always, both sessions were vintage Trump. \"He ran the gamut\" of issues, said Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C. But did he show any cards about who he will select to be his running mate during his third White House bid?\n\n\"No,\" Donalds said with a chuckle behind sunglasses on one of the warmest days so far this year in Washington, D.C. \"We didn't get into that.\"", "source": {"uri": "charlotteobserver.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Charlotte Observer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cq_roll_call@charlotteobserver.com", "name": "CQ-Roll Call", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "john_t_bennett@charlotteobserver.com", "name": "John T.

The Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion. House Republicans booted Kevin McCarthy as Speaker. And Trump was convicted of 34 felonies in a New York courthouse.\n\nThere was much to talk about.\n\nOver the course of separate meetings with House members and Senators, Trump laughed about his conviction, praised current House Speaker Mike Johnson, and emphasized the need for Republicans to stay unified heading into November. He told Johnson's frequent antagonist, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, to be \"nice\" to the Speaker, eliciting laughter from every corner of the room, according to some in attendance.\n\nDuring his meeting with Senators at the National Republican Senatorial Committee offices, Trump also appeared to \"bury the hatchet\" with Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and other Senators who have been critical of the former President, a senior Republican Senate aide told TIME. In March, McConnell endorsed Trump for President, despite having previously said Trump was \"morally responsible\" for the Jan. 6 riot. \"I don't think Trump was taking shots at anyone,\" the aide said.\n\n\"I'm with them 1,000 percent. They're with me 1,000 percent,\" Trump told reporters Thursday afternoon after meeting with most Republican senators. \"We agree on just about everything and if there isn't, we work it out.\"\n\nTrump's visit coincided with a failed effort by Democrats in the Senate to pass a bill affirming the right for women nationwide to access in vitro fertilization (IVF) amid a national debate over the popular fertility treatment after the Alabama Supreme Court ruled in February that embryos are considered children. The Southern Baptist Convention this week suggested the government should \"restrain\" how IVF is used.\n\nTrump did not mention IVF in his meeting with House Republicans, lawmakers who attended the meetings told TIME, but he did emphasize that Republicans should unite behind his current position that decisions about abortion access should be left to the states. That stance is at odds with some of the GOP base, who are calling on Congress to pass a nationwide ban on abortion with no exceptions. \"He just reminded us that it is a state issue,\" says Rep. Roger Williams, a Texas Republican.\n\nRepublicans said that Trump spent the most time talking about the economy and criticizing the Biden Administration's policies. \"Trump was as energized as I've ever seen him,\" Rep. Ralph Norman, a Republican from South Carolina who originally backed former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley in the presidential primary, tells TIME of the meeting. \"He laid out a vision of what he's gonna do... He's confident he's going to be reelected.\"\n\nTrump told Fox News after his meeting with Senators that his running mate was \"probably\" in the room and that he would most likely unveil his pick during the Republican convention that starts on July 15. Punchbowl News reported that Trump mentioned Senators Tim Scott of South Carolina, Marco Rubio of Florida and J.D. Vance of Ohio by name during the meeting and joked that Scott \"wasn't a good presidential candidate\" but has been a \"great surrogate for him.\"\n\nTrump appeared to go slightly off topic during the House meeting, sources say, and at one point started ranting about crime rates. He called Milwaukee -- where Republicans are holding their convention next month -- a \"horrible city.\" Democrats quickly tore into Trump's denigration of the biggest city in a pivotal swing state. \"Add it to the list of things Donald Trump is wrong about,\" Wisconsin's Democratic Gov. Tony Evers wrote on X, including the clown emoji.\n\nAt one point, Trump floated the idea of eliminating the U.S. income tax and replacing it with tariffs on imports, according to those who attended the House meeting. Norman said the tariffs were pitched as a way to even the playing field with China.\n\nThe former President also commented on the flotilla of Russian warships that reached Cuba on Wednesday. The surprising move by President Vladimir Putin was viewed by many as a show of force after the Biden Administration said that Ukraine could use U.S.-provided weapons near Kharkiv while attacking Russian forces. The Russian ships are not carrying nuclear weapons, but they are capable of launching some of Russia's most highly touted missiles. Trump said such a display by Russia \"would not happen with him\" and that it's a \"very real threat,\" according to Norman.\n\nWhen a Republican asked him about immigration and the border, Trump allegedly claimed falsely that there are \"15 to 17 million\" illegal migrants in the U.S. who are registered to vote. Trump vowed to deport them all.\n\n\"I think he did the right thing,\" Williams says, \"by coming to where his base is and where his ambassadors will be -- guys like me... He brought the whole team in. He gave everybody a pep talk, and I thought it was great.\"\n\nSen. Raphael Warnock, a Democrat from Georgia, spoke with TIME on Thursday on his way to vote on the IVF measure. \"Trump is an American citizen and he can come to the Capitol,\" Warnock says. \"The question is why are my Republican colleagues going over there at a moment when we're trying to stand up for families and their ability to have children.\" Republicans ultimately blocked the measure.\n\nAsked what signal it sends that Republican lawmakers met with Trump, Warnock says, \"I think it shows the American people who they work for.\"\n\nTrump's visit to the Capitol comes two weeks after a Manhattan jury found him guilty on 34 felony counts for falsifying business records related to a sex scandal before the 2016 election, making him the first former President ever to be convicted of a crime. Congressional Republicans have blasted the verdict in an unprecedented and unified manner, claiming the prosecutor and judge were biased. Some have echoed Trump's baseless suggestion that the Biden administration played a role in the prosecution. During his meeting with House Republicans, Trump didn't appear too concerned about his felon status or his upcoming sentencing on July 11. \"He laughed about it,\" Norman said. \"It has actually helped him.\"\n\nHouse Republicans began their meeting by singing \"Happy Birthday\" to the former President, who turns 78 on Friday, and by presenting him with the game ball and bat from the congressional baseball game the previous night. Republicans beat the Democrats 31-11.\n\n\"He told me, 'I watched the baseball game...y'all played great,'\" says Williams, who coached the House Republicans to their fourth straight win. \"He picked out a few players who he said could have done a little better.\"", "source": {"uri": "time.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TIME"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brian_bennett@time.com", "name": "Brian

Capitol Hill and whips up Republican legislators", "body": "The former US president was embraced by Republican legislators who find themselves newly energised by his bid to retake the White House.\n\nDonald Trump made a return on Thursday to Capitol Hill, whipping up US House and Senate Republicans in his first meetings since the January 6 2021 attacks.\n\nHe was embraced by Republican legislators who find themselves newly energised by his bid to retake the White House.\n\nDespite pending federal charges against Mr Trump for conspiring to overturn the 2020 election, and his recent guilty verdict in an unrelated hush money trial, the Republican former president arrived emboldened as the party's presumptive nominee.\n\nA packed room of House of Representatives Republicans sang Happy Birthday to Mr Trump in a private breakfast meeting at Republican Party campaign headquarters across the street from the Capitol.\n\nThe legislators gave him a baseball and bat from the annual congressional game.\n\nMr Trump bragged that even his telephone rallies for legislators could draw bigger crowds than mega-popstar Taylor Swift, who has yet to make any endorsement.\n\n\"There's tremendous unity in the Republican Party,\" Mr Trump said in brief remarks later at Senate Republican Party headquarters.\n\nMr Trump spent about an hour each with House and Senate Republicans delivering free-wheeling remarks, fielding questions and discussing issues - including Russia and immigration, tax cuts and other priorities for a potential second term.\n\nDuring the morning session, Mr Trump said he thinks House speaker Mike Johnson is doing a \"terrific job\", according to a Republican in the private breakfast meeting.\n\n\"President Trump brought an extraordinary amount of energy, excitement and enthusiasm this morning,\" Mr Johnson said afterwards, noting high fundraising tallies since the guilty verdict.\n\n\"We're feeling good.\"\n\nThe Republican speaker had demurred earlier over whether he has asked Mr Trump to respect the peaceful transfer of presidential power and commit to not doing another January 6.\n\nHe said: \"Of course he respects that, we all do, and we've all talked about it, ad nauseum.\"\n\nThursday afternoon offered the first encounter in years between Mr Trump and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who once blamed Mr Trump for the \"disgraceful\" attack that he called an \"insurrection\" but now endorses the party's presumptive nominee.\n\nMr McConnell said Mr Trump received standing ovations from the senators and the two \"had a really positive meeting\".\n\nThe senator said: \"He and I got a chance to talk a little bit, shook hands a few times.\"\n\nMany potential priorities for a new White House administration are being formulated by a constellation of outside groups, including Project 2025, laying the groundwork for executive and legislative actions, though Mr Trump has made clear he has his own agenda.\n\n\"Anybody who thought that this president was going to be down after the sham trial, it's only giving him even more energy,\" said Representative Tom Emmer, the Republican Party whip.\n\n\"Donald Trump is crushing this election.\"\n\nBut Mr Trump's private meetings with House and Senate Republicans so close to the Capitol were infused with the symbolism of his return as the US president who threatened the American tradition of the peaceful transfer of power.\n\n\"It's frustrating,\" said former US Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn, who made his own unsuccessful run for Congress as a Maryland Democrat in the aftermath of January 6, the day when police engaged in hand-to-hand fighting to stop Trump supporters who stormed the building in an effort to overturn Joe Biden's election.\n\nMr Dunn spoke of the \"irony\" of Mr Trump returning to the area and legislators now embracing him.\n\n\"It just shows the lack of backbone they have when they're truly putting party and person over country,\" he said.\n\n\"And it's sad.\"\n\nMr Biden was overseas on Thursday attending a summit of the Group of Seven leading industrialised nations, but the president's campaign unveiled a new ad blaming Mr Trump for lighting the \"fire\" of January 6 and threatening democracy.", "source": {"uri": "guernseypress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Guernsey Press"},

Hill and whips up Republican legislators | BreakingNews.ie", "body": "Donald Trump made a return on Thursday to Capitol Hill, whipping up US House and Senate Republicans in his first meetings since the January 6 2021 attacks.\n\nHe was embraced by Republican legislators who find themselves newly energised by his bid to retake the White House.\n\nDespite pending federal charges against Mr Trump for conspiring to overturn the 2020 election, and his recent guilty verdict in an unrelated hush money trial, the Republican former president arrived emboldened as the party's presumptive nominee.\n\nHe has successfully purged the Republican Party of critics, silenced most sceptics and enticed once-critical legislators aboard his MAGA-fuelled campaign.\n\nA packed room of House of Representatives Republicans sang Happy Birthday to Mr Trump in a private breakfast meeting at Republican Party campaign headquarters across the street from the Capitol.\n\nThe legislators gave him a baseball and bat from the annual congressional game.\n\nMr Trump bragged that even his telephone rallies for legislators could draw bigger crowds than mega-popstar Taylor Swift, who has yet to make any endorsement.\n\n\"There's tremendous unity in the Republican Party,\" Mr Trump said in brief remarks later at Senate Republican Party headquarters.\n\nMr Trump spent about an hour each with House and Senate Republicans delivering free-wheeling remarks, fielding questions and discussing issues - including Russia and immigration, tax cuts and other priorities for a potential second term.\n\nDuring the morning session, Mr Trump said he thinks House speaker Mike Johnson is doing a \"terrific job\", according to a Republican in the private breakfast meeting.\n\nMr Trump asked Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, the speaker's chief Republican critic, if she was being \"nice\" to Mr Johnson, another Republican said.\n\n\"President Trump brought an extraordinary amount of energy, excitement and enthusiasm this morning,\" Mr Johnson said afterwards, noting high fundraising tallies since the guilty verdict.\n\n\"We're feeling good.\"\n\nThe Republican speaker had demurred earlier over whether he has asked Mr Trump to respect the peaceful transfer of presidential power and commit to not doing another January 6.\n\nHe said: \"Of course he respects that, we all do, and we've all talked about it, ad nauseum.\"\n\nThursday afternoon offered the first encounter in years between Mr Trump and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who once blamed Mr Trump for the \"disgraceful\" attack that he called an \"insurrection\" but now endorses the party's presumptive nominee.\n\nMr McConnell said Mr Trump received standing ovations from the senators and the two \"had a really positive meeting\".\n\nThe senator said: \"He and I got a chance to talk a little bit, shook hands a few times.\"\n\nMany potential priorities for a new White House administration are being formulated by a constellation of outside groups, including Project 2025, laying the groundwork for executive and legislative actions, though Mr Trump has made clear he has his own agenda.\n\nOn one major controversial issue, Mr Trump told legislators that abortion rules should be left to the states and said he supported exceptions for rape, incest and to save the life of the mother, legislators said.\n\n\"Anybody who thought that this president was going to be down after the sham trial, it's only giving him even more energy,\" said Representative Tom Emmer, the Republican Party whip.\n\n\"Donald Trump is crushing this election.\"\n\nBut Mr Trump's private meetings with House and Senate Republicans so close to the Capitol were infused with the symbolism of his return as the US president who threatened the American tradition of the peaceful transfer of power.\n\n\"It's frustrating,\" said former US Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn, who made his own unsuccessful run for Congress as a Maryland Democrat in the aftermath of January 6, the day when police engaged in hand-to-hand fighting to stop Trump supporters who stormed the building in an effort to overturn Joe Biden's election.\n\nMr Dunn spoke of the \"irony\" of Mr Trump returning to the area and legislators now embracing him.\n\n\"It just shows the lack of backbone they have when they're truly putting party and person over country,\" he said.\n\n\"And it's sad.\"\n\nMr Biden was overseas on Thursday attending a summit of the Group of Seven leading industrialised nations, but the president's campaign unveiled a new ad blaming Mr Trump for lighting the \"fire\" of January 6 and threatening democracy.", "source": {"uri": "breakingnews.ie", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breaking News.ie"},

Will they lay out a 2025 wish list?", "body": "WASHINGTON - Former President Donald Trump will meet with Republican lawmakers Thursday to discuss campaign strategies and lay out their wish list if they defeat Democrats in November.\n\nIt's the first time Trump has returned to Capitol Hill since leaving office nearly four years ago, and the trip provides an opportunity for conservative leaders to plot which policy priorities they'll pursue if reelected.\n\nThe meetings with both House and Senate lawmakers also align with a meeting with the Business Roundtable, a powerful cohort of some of the country's largest companies that will host the former president while he's in the nation's capital. Trump is slated to meet with House Republican lawmakers in the morning at the Capitol Hill Club and Senate Republicans in the afternoon at the National Republican Senatorial Committee office, both locations adjacent to the Capitol grounds.\n\nThe visit comes after Trump was convicted by a New York jury in his hush money trial and weeks before he is slated to be formally nominated at the Republican National Convention. The twin meetings with congressional Republicans are supposed to help shore up unity in the party that has, at times, struggled to agree on major policy priorities, such as providing additional aid to Ukraine.\n\nHowever, some moderate members are expected to skip the meeting, such as Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Mitt Romney, R-Utah. Several of their peers insisted that's not necessarily a problem.\n\n\"I think there's lots of reasons for people to not show up,\" including scheduling conflicts, said Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D. \"It's a grand opportunity for us all to get together to kick off the official campaign but also to prepare, possibly, for a transition.\"\n\nTop Republicans in Congress are expected to attend the meetings Thursday. That includes Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who has not met in-person with the former president since 2020. The two have had a frosty relationship after McConnell accepted the results of the 2020 presidential election and blamed the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack on Trump.\n\nMcConnell declined to say if he would bring up the animosity with the former president at the Senate meeting, reiterating that he intended to support the 2024 GOP nominee, whoever it may be. However, the Kentucky Republican declined to even reference Trump by name.\n\n\"I've said earlier this year I support him. He's earned the nomination by the voters all across the country and of course I'll be at the meeting tomorrow,\" McConnell told reporters.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., on the other hand, is a stalwart Trump ally, having served on the former president's defense team during his first impeachment trial. The speaker told reporters Wednesday morning he wants to use the meetings to lay out a clear-cut conservative agenda should the GOP sweep the coming elections.\n\n\"When (Trump) comes in, we got to have a very aggressive first 100 days agenda. The first year will be important and I think we cannot waste a moment,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said\n\nTrump's visit is important for Johnson's leadership post as well. The former president defended the speaker from Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's threat to oust him last month. At the same time, Trump has occasionally thrown a wrench into Johnson's legislative agenda, including briefly derailing his plans over a controversial spying law in April.\n\nTrump's four sets of criminal charges could also shape the House GOP's legislative agenda this year. A number of Republicans support a bill led by Rep. Russell Fry, R-S.C., that would allow presidents and vice presidents to move civil and criminal state cases to federal court instead. Johnson said he supports the proposal, but a number of Republican lawmakers are skeptical about the legislation. In addition to his New York hush money case, Trump also faces state-level charges in Georgia over allegations he tried to steal the state in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe meetings may also serve another purpose: Giving Trump face time with several of the people he is considering as his running mate. That includes Sens. JD Vance, R-Ohio, Tim Scott, R-S.C., and Marco Rubio, R-Fla., as well as House members such as Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y. and Byron Donalds, R-Fla.\n\nRep. Marc Molinaro, R-N.Y., told reporters he expects to hear Trump give a \"lay of the land as he sees it\" of the 2024 elections. Other lawmakers told USA TODAY they expect the meeting to be critical towards building a working relationship between congressional Republicans and the former president should the GOP take full control of Washington, picking up the White House and the Senate and maintaining control of the House. That kind of sweep would be an uphill battle for either party.\n\n\"We're working on cementing this relationship now so when January 20th comes, we have a plan in place to work together with the White House and Congress,\" Rep. Mark Alford, R-Texas, said, noting a major part of the GOP agenda is renewing Trump's 2017 tax cuts, which expire in 2025.\n\n\"That's the main thing that we need to make sure we talk about: That we communicate for the next few months, have a plan going into January,\" said Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala. As for what is on the table? \"You name it. All the crap that we had to put up for four years.\"\n\nJohnson also met with Senate Republicans over lunch Wednesday to begin discussions on a potential party-line package to chase next year.\n\nJohnson told reporters after the meeting that he expressed interest in enacting new tax and spending cuts. Tax cuts passed during the Trump administration are set to expire in 2025, which means the next president will have a significant opportunity to rewrite the country's tax code.\n\n\"I think now we're in the education\" phase of teaching members what can and cannot be accomplished using the unique legislative tool known as \"reconciliation,\" said Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C. Reconciliation can bypass the Senate's 60-vote threshold for certain budget legislation.\n\nDemocrats used the tool in the first two years of the Biden administration to pass sweeping clean energy tax credits and other policies in the Inflation Reduction Act, a massive piece of legislation that aimed to address issues from transportation and the environment to insulin prices.\n\n\"Then it's appropriate to start talking about, ok, what does a common agenda look like?\" Tillis said of his Republican colleagues. \"This is something we need to do pretty early in Trump's tenure.\"", "source":

And of course, I will be at the meeting,\" McConnell told reporters.\n\nThursday's events are expected to be more of an effort to boost morale and ensure the party is moving in one direction ahead of the election than to drill down on specific policy proposals.\n\nBut Trump is likely to be quizzed on plans to extend the tax cuts he implemented in 2017, as well as his proposals for a tough illegal immigration crackdown and his view of the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe conflict has exposed fissures between Trump's \"America First\" movement and more traditional conservatives who want to see Russia's Vladimir Putin defeated with the help of American weapons.\n\nThe former president is also due to make his case for a White House return to chief executives at a meeting of Washington lobby group Business Roundtable.\n\nPolitical news outlet Axios quoted a source familiar with Trump's expected remarks who said the former president was likely to focus on his plan \"to immediately reduce inflation and roll back anti-business Biden regulations.\"\n\nAn election forecast model combining state and national polls with economic indicators, out Wednesday from The Economist, gives Trump a 2-in-3 chance of winning reelection.

David Valadao of California.\n\n\"I never loved him,\" Trump said of Valadao, according to a GOP member.\n\nAs a number of House Republicans find themselves in competitive primary races, the former president said he wanted to do tele-town halls, but acknowledged his help would not be welcomed by some, given that he had endorsed their primary opponents.\n\nTrump did not shy away from acknowledging the bad blood between House Speaker Mike Johnson and GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who unsuccessfully tried to oust Johnson against Trump's wishes. The former president playfully asked Greene, a staunch ally of his who he strongly supports, to be nice to the speaker.\n\n\"He's always so sweet, recognizing me, and he said 'are you being nice to Speaker Johnson?' He was joking. And I said 'eh,'\" as she gestured with her hands. \"He said 'OK be nice to him' and I nodded my head,\" she added.\n\nJohnson, after the meeting, said the former president told him that he was doing \"a very good job\" and that he plans to be \"fully prepared\" to implement Trump's plans if he wins in November.\n\nThe former president's conviction also hung heavy over Thursday's meeting.\n\nTrump's allies on Capitol Hill immediately sprung into action following the guilty verdict -proposing to defund the Department of Justice and even shut down the government. House Republicans voted to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress on Wednesday. And one legislative proposal Republican leaders are now actively pursuing is a bill that would allow current and former presidents to move state-level cases to federal court. The legislation passed out of committee last September, but GOP leaders only started formally whipping the bill this week - on the eve of Trump's Capitol Hill visit and two weeks after his conviction.\n\nIn his meeting with GOP lawmakers, Trump called the Department of Justice \"dirty no good bastards,\" according to another source in the room.\n\nGOP Rep. Kevin Hern of Oklahoma said the former president expressed he was \"gravely concerned\" about the federal government being weaponized.\n\nIn a news conference after the meeting, House Majority Whip Tom Emmer said that the former president's felony convictions have only energized the party that will propel them to victory in November.\n\n\"Anybody who thought that this President was going to be down after the sham trial, after that crooked trial that we saw in New York, I think, again, it's only given him even more energy,\" Emmer said. \"And what he did for us upstairs just now is, he showed us that energy and he showed us that positive outlook, despite all the garbage they've been throwing at him with their lawfare and their nonsense.\"\n\nTrump tells GOP lawmakers to 'follow your own heart' on abortion\n\nTrump had a direct message for House Republicans on how to approach abortion leading into November, an issue Republicans have struggled to unify around in the wake of Roe v. Wade being overturned.\n\nJohnson relayed that Trump told the group to \"exercise your own conscience to talk about it, share your conviction, and do that in a way that makes sense to people. And I think he had made a good point.\"\n\nTrump, in a low voice, advised Republicans to not be afraid of the issue, according to sources in room, and claimed that Democrats are the extreme ones on the topic. He called on Republicans to follow their convictions but cautioned how they address the matter on the campaign trail and advocated for exceptions.\n\n\"He talked and pushed for exceptions for rape, life of the mother and incest. He talked about the way that we need to talk about it, quote correctly, his words, not mine,\" GOP Rep. Nancy Mace told CNN. \"And I really appreciated his comments as a woman, as a suburban mom.\"\n\nTrump also talked about how Roe v. Wade finally put the decision to the states as they always wanted, though he noted some of them made \"not so good\" decisions.\n\n\"But like Ronald Reagan, you have to have three choices: life of mother, rape and incest you have to do, but you have to follow your own heart,\" Trump said, according to a source in the room.\n\nTrump's message came as the Supreme Court rejected a lawsuit challenging the Food and Drug Administration's approach to regulating the abortion pill mifepristone with a ruling that will continue to allow the pills to be mailed to patients without an in-person doctor's visit.\n\nThe former president also ticked through a handful of other priorities, including his proposal to eliminate taxes on tips, building the southern border, and halting further aid for Ukraine, even though a number of lawmakers in his party support it.\n\nTrump off topic\n\nThere were a number of moments where the former president went off topic.\n\nAs Trump was ranting about crime rates and so-called election integrity issues, the former president called Milwaukee - where Republicans are holding their convention this summer - \"horrible,\" according to a source in the room.\n\nRep. Derrick Van Orden, a Wisconsin Republican who was in the room, made clear to CNN that Trump was \"specifically referring to crime in Milwaukee\" and not the city itself.\n\nIn one bizarre moment, Trump called Pelosi's daughter a \"wacko\" and then claimed her daughter once told him that he and the former House speaker would have had a \"great romance\" in another life, according to a lawmaker in the room..\n\nIn response to Trump's comments, one of Pelosi's daughters posted on X: \"speaking for all 4 Pelosi daughters -- this is a LIE. His deceitful, deranged obsession with our mother is yet another reason Donald Trump is unwell, unhinged and unfit to step foot anywhere near her -- or the White House.\"\n\nHe also questioned why popstar Taylor Swift would support President Joe Biden over him, whom he referred to as a \"dope.\"\n\n\"Why would she endorse this dope,\" Trump said, according to a member in the room. \"He doesn't know how to get off a stage.\"\n\nThe former president even said at one point of Hannibal Lecter: \"nNice guy ... he even had a friend over for dinner.\"\n\nAt the start of the meeting, House Republicans sang happy birthday to the former president, whose birthday is Friday, and presented him with the game ball and bat from the congressional baseball game that Republican won on Wednesday, according to a source in the room.\n\nSenate meeting striking a more unifying tone\n\nA few hours later, Trump met with Senate Republicans behind closed doors and - lawmakers said - struck a unifying tone.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has had a distant and icy relationship with the former president and has not spoken directly to him since December 2020, said that he shook hands with Trump and that the meeting was positive.\n\n\"I can't think of anything to tell you out of it that was negative,\" he said.\n\nThe former president sat between McConnell and Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, who also has had a rocky relationship with the former president.\n\n\"He is the choice of our voters overwhelmingly. It shows that he is absolutely the leader of the party,\" Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri said of Trump. \"I mean, you had people who have vociferously opposed him, who were sitting right next to him in the room.\"\n\nTrump himself praised a \"great meeting\" with Senate Republicans, saying there's \"tremendous unity\" in the GOP.\n\nTrump made a point of saying he'll stand behind GOP lawmakers in their own races, telling the senators beside him, \"You're all either elected or you're going to be elected again and reelected, and I'm with every one of you and you know that.\"\n\nSen. Marco Rubio of Florida characterized the meeting as \"getting the team back together\" and providing the state of the former president's campaign.\n\n\"Optimism, but a lot of work to be done,\" Rubio said.\n\nMeanwhile, Sen. John Cornyn of Texas said the former president \"expressed frustration\" over his recent conviction.\n\n\"He expressed frustration over the recent trial, you can imagine, and justifiably in my view,\" Cornyn said. He said Trump did not bring up January 6.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri": "annie_grayer@aol.com", "name": "Annie Grayer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "melanie_zanona@aol.com", "name": "Melanie Zanona", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "lauren_fox@aol.com", "name": "Lauren Fox", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Valadao", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "David Valadao"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Emmer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tom Emmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

While many congressional Republicans are firmly behind Trump, there remains a divide among some Republican members on how strongly to support the former president as he faces multiple legal battles.\n\nJohnson said it's critical for House Republicans to plan for an \"aggressive first 100 days agenda.\"\n\n\"I think we cannot waste a moment, because there's so many things to do,\" Johnson said Wednesday. \"So in light of that, we're having discussions with [Trump] and his team now and amongst ourselves to plan accordingly. You don't put the cart before the horse, but you do have to be prepared to lead. And we're going to be prepared.\"\n\nAhead of the meeting, Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., said he expects Trump to rally the conference and \"lay out a vision, lay out what our role is, lay out for the next five months what he's going to be concentrating on.\"\n\nSen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, the No. 3 Republican in the upper chamber, told colleagues that he invited Trump. Barrasso, who chairs the Senate Republican Conference, said he made the invitation to hear Trump's \"plans for the summer and policy agenda for 2025,\" his spokesperson said.\n\nSen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., told reporters that he expects the meeting to be a \"team-building time.\"\n\n\"Our fight is not among each other. Our fight is fighting against the agenda that the Biden administration is putting out,\" he said Wednesday. \"We're all on the same team and we need to go win the Super Bowl in November, and that's kind of the message he'll bring.\"\n\nA senior Trump campaign official told NPR this week that the meeting will involve policy discussions looking ahead on Social Security, Medicare, immigration and the U.S.-Mexico border, taxes and foreign policy.\n\nThe Senate meeting will also be a chance for Trump to address skeptics within the Republican Party. In recent months, more Senate Republicans, including those initially resistant to weigh in, have said they're supporting Trump's reelection run. Others, like Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., have refused to back him or have continued to avoid discussing their support for the former president.\n\nSen. Susan Collins of Maine, who was one of seven Senate Republicans to vote to convict Trump during his second impeachment trial, said she isn't attending Thursday's meeting because of a long-standing conflict.\n\nFor their part, congressional Democrats said the plans were no surprise and are illustrative of the chaos that faces much of the Republican Party today.\n\n\"This is just another example of House Republicans bending the knee to Donald Trump,\" said House Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar. \"He wants them to impeach [President] Joe Biden -- they failed at that. Now they're moving on to [Attorney General] Merrick Garland. You know, censure, impeachments -- that's just how dysfunctional the Republican conference is.\"", "source": {"uri": "bpr.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "bpr.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

And it served as a highly choreographed unity moment, complete with a press conference with GOP senators, joking with members and even a birthday cake for Trump, who celebrates his 78th birthday on Friday.\n\n\"There was certainly a sense of unity, the most unified I felt our caucus has been in a long time,\" said Sen. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.). \"I think we passed that magic moment when we are all ready to move forward.\"\n\nHis visit to the House Republicans favorite private club, and subsequent meeting with senators, was meant to rev up the 2024 campaign and offer a glimpse into his second term plans.\n\nYet amid the cheering and clapping, there were some hints of challenges to come. According to a senior Trump campaign adviser who was granted anonymity to discuss the matter, Trump introduced some policy plans, including on Social Security and Medicare, border security, reducing inflation and foreign policy that will \"reestablish peace through strength and a strong America.\" And he made free-flowing comments on abortion, which promises to be one of the toughest issues facing Republicans going into November.\n\nBut up on the Hill, the former president's potential second term plans were delivered with typical Trumpian flair and lack of specifics: In a meeting with House Republicans, he gushed that \"loves tariffs,\" according to a person in the room. GOP lawmakers described his remarks as policy-light -- not even mentioning plans for more 2025 tax cuts -- though he urged members to talk about abortion as a state issue.\n\n\"It was about winning,\" said Rep. Buddy Carter (R-Ga.).\n\nFor House Republicans, Trump's \"pep rally,\" as one member described it, came at a badly-needed time. Inside the room, the former president devoted a chunk of his address with his friendliest D.C. audience -- shouting out many members by their first names -- to try to boost Speaker Mike Johnson and his beleaguered majority.\n\nIn a rambling speech that veered from Taylor Swift to former Speaker Nancy Pelosi's daughter, Trump seemed careful to avoid his most explosive positions: There were no demands that the House help fight back against his criminal convictions. There was no call to impeach President Joe Biden.\n\nOn the failed effort to oust Johnson earlier this year, Trump ribbed his ally, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), asking the MAGA firebrand: \"Are you being nice to him?\" to laughter and cheers.\n\nHe even seemingly offered an olive branch to the Republicans who had previously voted to impeach him -- including one sitting in the room, Rep. Dan Newhouse (R-Wash.).\n\n\"He spent probably half of that time talking about how he's going to help us, which is amazing,\" said Rep. Derrick Van Orden (R-Wis.), who has survived his own difficult election fights. \"President Trump understands the necessity for unity.\"\n\nTrump, appearing at the National Republican Senatorial Committee flanked by more than half the Senate GOP conference, pointed to \"tremendous unity in the Republican Party.\"\n\nSen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) said that among the things Trump shared was a story about a waitress from Las Vegas who encouraged him to end taxes on tips, a new policy point for Trump, and he reiterated his support for abortion being decided by the states.\n\n\"There was a birthday cake brought in, and there were candles, and President Trump said, 'I'm going to make a wish, I'm not going to tell you what it is, but it has to do with everyone in this room, which was really kind,\" said Lummis.\n\nTrump's confidence about his position in November -- even trumpeting his popularity in a blue state like Virginia -- was a welcome mindset shift for many House Republicans who are fretting over the prospect of big losses this fall. The former president even committed to doing 100 tele-town halls for members facing the toughest reelection odds.\n\nThere's one major exception to that promise: Freedom Caucus Chair Rep. Bob Good (R-Va.), who's locked in a primary fight against a Trump-endorsed challenger this month.\n\n\"He pledged support for every Republican running for reelection,\" Greene told reporters.\n\nAnd he was perhaps more confident about the Senate GOP taking the majority, pledging to campaign against two of the Democrats' most endangered incumbents, Sen. Sherrod Brown in Ohio and Jon Tester in Montana.\n\nSince leaving the White House, Trump has maintained close ties with Capitol Hill. He frequently speaks with allies in the House and Senate and has wielded power over their agenda. This spring, Trump played a big role in tanking a bipartisan immigration bill. And he's been a critical lifeline to Johnson, helping the speaker survive multiple tough votes, including his own political survival.\n\nSandwiched between Trump's meetings with Republicans in the House and Senate was a meeting with the Business Roundtable, a lobbying organization whose membership includes the country's most powerful CEOs.\n\nTrump was met by protesters on the Hill while the Biden campaign and the DNC launched a new ad, part of a seven-figure advertising buy in battleground states, that focused on the chaos and violence on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\n\"Today, the instigator of an insurrection is returning to the scene of the crime,\" said Pelosi, who is Biden-Harris 2024 chair of the National Advisory Board. \"With his pledges to be a dictator on day one and seek revenge against his political opponents, Donald Trump comes to Capitol Hill today with the same mission of dismantling our democracy. But make no mistake -- Trump has already cemented his legacy of shame in our hallowed halls.\"", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

Trump has unabashedly expressed his intentions, even going as far to suggest he would prosecute his adversaries, such as Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and New York Attorney General Letitia James. Johnson has \"sympathized with Trump's frustration,\" Politico Playbook reported Thursday, citing sources who said the speaker is weighing congressional actions that could advance Trump's revenge mission. Some House Republicans have floated proposals like cutting Justice Department funding used in Special Counsel Jack Smith's two cases against Trump and allowing presidents charged at the state level to transfer their cases to federal court, giving Trump the option to pardon himself.\n\nTrump will speak at the Business Roundtable's annual meeting in between his sit-down with House and Senate Republicans. J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon and Apple CEO Tim Cook are among the lobbying group's members expected to attend. White House Chief of Staff Jeff Zients is also slated to address the group.\n\nSince leaving office, Trump has maintained his influence over Republicans in Congress. In one of their most recent displays of loyalty to Trump, House Republicans voted Wednesday to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress for refusing to release audio tapes of a special counsel interview with Biden, as Trump and his allies have warred with the Justice Department for its prosecutions against Trump. At Trump's urging, the GOP has pushed an impeachment probe against Biden that even some Republicans say was a longshot effort -- and one that appears to be losing steam. Republicans also blocked bipartisan legislation that would have implemented new border controls, killing the bill at Trump's behest after he openly predicted it would be a \"gift\" to Democrats in an election year when immigration is a top issue for voters. A parade of Republicans, including Johnson, Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., and top Trump running mate contender, Sen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, also attended his Manhattan hush money trial in a show of support.\n\nRepublicans Attend Trump NYC Trial And Make Attacks Trump Can't Under Gag Order (Forbes)", "source": {"uri": "forbes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Forbes"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "January 6 United States Capitol attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Smith_(lawyer)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jack Smith (lawyer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mueller_special_counsel_investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mueller special counsel investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Bragg", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Alvin Bragg"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_General_of_New_York", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Attorney General of New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letitia_James", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Letitia James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_County_District_Attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York County District Attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Dimon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jamie Dimon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pardon", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pardon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States district court"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lobbying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tim Cook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Apple Inc."}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_executive_officer", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Chief executive officer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Zients", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jeff Zients"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_impeachment_in_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal impeachment in the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Gaetz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Matt Gaetz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Merrick Garland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Contempt of Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hush_money", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Hush money"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Chief_of_Staff", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House Chief of Staff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "J.

He aimed to mend Republican divisions ahead of the November elections, while also discussing policies on tariffs, tips, and abortion. His visit drew mixed reactions from party members and Democrats.\n\nDonald Trump criticized U.S. aid to Ukraine and suggested raising tariffs to replace the U.S. income tax on a Thursday visit to Capitol Hill where he also called the city hosting his party's presidential convention \"horrible.\"\n\nIn separate meetings with Republicans in the House of Representatives and the Senate, Trump sought to mend divisions ahead of the Nov. 5 election that could see his party win control of the White House and both chambers of Congress. Trump floated the idea of reducing the U.S. income tax and replacing it with tariffs, said Representatives Thomas Massie and Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\nParticipants said he shook hands with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, despite their frosty relationship, and encouraged hard-liner Greene to \"be nice\" to House Speaker Mike Johnson, after her failed attempt to depose him. \"There's tremendous unity in the Republican Party,\" Trump said after the Senate meeting.\n\nBut Republicans scrambled to explain after several media outlets reported that Trump privately called Milwaukee a \"horrible\" city, roughly one month before he is due to receive his party's presidential nomination there. That could potentially alienate residents of the biggest city in Wisconsin, one of a handful of competitive states that will determine the outcome of the election.\n\nA campaign spokesperson and several Republican lawmakers said Trump was referring to what they said were the city's problems with crime and voter fraud. A nonpartisan audit of the 2020 election in Wisconsin found no evidence of irregularities. MEMORIES OF JAN. 6\n\nTrump's supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, fueled by his false claims that his defeat was the result of fraud. Thursday's visit was his first public appearance on Capitol Hill since that day and Democrats said he was not welcome. \"After inciting a deadly insurrection that defiled the halls of Congress, how dare Trump show his face on these grounds?\" Democratic Representative Bennie Thompson said in a statement.\n\nThe Biden campaign on Thursday began running an ad in battleground states highlighting the violence of Jan. 6. Republican lawmakers said Trump told them he would work to expand the party's narrow 218-213 House majority and take control of a Senate that Democrats currently lead 51-49.\n\nTrump also advised House Republicans not to push a national ban on abortion and urged them to abandon the intra-party squabbling that has hobbled their effectiveness, lawmakers said. It was Trump's first face to face meeting with McConnell since the Jan. 6 attack. The two had not spoken since a few weeks before then, when McConnell affirmed Biden's 2020 victory. Two moderate Republican senators, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, skipped the event.\n\nMcConnell did not appear with Trump at a news conference after the meeting. TIPS AND TARIFFS\n\nTrump also urged lawmakers to cut taxes on income from tips, an idea he first floated on Sunday to appeal to service workers, multiple lawmakers said. Trump used tariffs aggressively during his 2017-2021 term in office, placing levies of up to 25% on a wide range of Chinese products as one of many efforts to thwart competition.\n\nSenator Mike Rounds said that cutting taxes on tips could help Republicans win over working-class voters. \"If there was something we could do to really energize that particular segment of the population, that might be a real popular thing to do,\" Rounds told reporters.\n\nBiden's support among voters without college degrees or living in households earning $50,000 a year or less has fallen sharply, Reuters/Ipsos polling shows, though large numbers of those voters have not shifted their support to Trump. Trump also criticized a $60 billion aid package for Ukraine that recently passed with Republican support, lawmakers said.\n\n\"He's like, if Ukraine wins, what will be the benefit?\" Republican Representative Don Bacon told reporters. Trump told Republicans they should allow states to set their own policies on abortion, rather than push for a nationwide ban following the Supreme Court's 2022 decision that ended the nationwide guarantee of abortion access. Many in the party want to outlaw the procedure entirely.\n\n\"He reiterated he thought that was the right decision, that some states will do one thing and some states will do another,\" Republican Representative French Hill told reporters. Trump also spoke to the Business Roundtable, an association of more than 200 corporate chief executives.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a

Matt Gaetz of Florida, a fierce Trump ally, told CNN. \"I think it's gonna be a pep rally environment for the former and future president.\"\n\nDemocrats had a different view of the events. Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California, the former House speaker, issued a statement ahead of the meetings, saying, \"Today, the instigator of an insurrection is returning to the scene of the crime. January 6th was a crime against the Capitol that saw Nazi and Confederate flags flying under the dome that Lincoln built.\"\n\nJoining Trump was House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell - who criticized Trump after Jan. 6 and whose wife Trump once publicly insulted - and other top congressional Republicans. Some of those in attendance, such as Sens. Tim Scott, Marco Rubio and J.D. Vance, are under consideration as a potential vice president on the Trump ticket.\n\nIn comments made after the meeting with House Republicans ended, Johnson said that the former president \"said very complementary things about all of us. We had sustained applause. He said I'm doing a very good job. We're grateful for that.\"\n\n\"We have to have continuity in leadership, we have to have a plan and it has to be very carefully executed,\" Johnson added.\n\nOther reports said Trump talked about a broad array of tariffs on imported goods, as well as promising to secure the southern border.\n\n\"President Trump talked a lot, too, about how to get the economy back on track and reduce inflation for those families who are struggling all across America, families can't afford to buy groceries, can't afford to fill up their cars because of the failed policies of Joe Biden,\" House Majority Leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana said, according to the Washington Post. \"And President Trump talked about what we can do working with a Republican Congress to fix these problems. But it all starts November 5th.\"\n\nIn addition to huddling with House and Senate Republicans, Trump is meeting with the Business Roundtable, the preeminent group of corporate CEOs. The organization extended an invitation to President Joe Biden, but he is in Italy for the G-7 meeting. Chief of Staff Jeff Zients was scheduled to appear in Biden's place.\n\nTop of the agenda for Trump and Republicans is having a legislative and executive road map for when the former president assumes office, as they all expect and hope for, in January, 2025. Extending or even broadening the 2017 tax cuts that were heavily tilted toward lowering taxes on corporations and the wealthy is a top priority, as is cleaning out the federal civil service, reducing immigration and rolling back regulations on industry.\n\nSome Republicans in Congress have also indicated a desire to thwart the various criminal investigations and prosecutions of Trump, who was convicted on state charges of falsifying business records to cover up a payment to former porn star Stormy Daniels.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia is one among many who have suggested they could cut funding to the Justice Department, and the House on Wednesday narrowly passed a measure to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt for failing to provide some materials related to the department's prosecution of Hunter Biden.", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News & World Report"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "January 6 United States Capitol attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Gaetz", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Matt Gaetz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Heritage_Foundation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Heritage Foundation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Vance", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "J.

to Capitol Hill and whips up Republican legislators", "body": "The former US president was embraced by Republican legislators who find themselves newly energised by his bid to retake the White House.\n\nDonald Trump made a return on Thursday to Capitol Hill, whipping up US House and Senate Republicans in his first meetings since the January 6 2021 attacks.\n\nHe was embraced by Republican legislators who find themselves newly energised by his bid to retake the White House.\n\nDespite pending federal charges against Mr Trump for conspiring to overturn the 2020 election, and his recent guilty verdict in an unrelated hush money trial, the Republican former president arrived emboldened as the party's presumptive nominee.\n\nHe has successfully purged the Republican Party of critics, silenced most sceptics and enticed once-critical legislators aboard his MAGA-fuelled campaign.\n\nA packed room of House of Representatives Republicans sang Happy Birthday to Mr Trump in a private breakfast meeting at Republican Party campaign headquarters across the street from the Capitol.\n\nThe legislators gave him a baseball and bat from the annual congressional game.\n\nMr Trump bragged that even his telephone rallies for legislators could draw bigger crowds than mega-popstar Taylor Swift, who has yet to make any endorsement.\n\n\"There's tremendous unity in the Republican Party,\" Mr Trump said in brief remarks later at Senate Republican Party headquarters.\n\nMr Trump spent about an hour each with House and Senate Republicans delivering free-wheeling remarks, fielding questions and discussing issues - including Russia and immigration, tax cuts and other priorities for a potential second term.\n\nDuring the morning session, Mr Trump said he thinks House speaker Mike Johnson is doing a \"terrific job\", according to a Republican in the private breakfast meeting.\n\nMr Trump asked Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, the speaker's chief Republican critic, if she was being \"nice\" to Mr Johnson, another Republican said.\n\n\"President Trump brought an extraordinary amount of energy, excitement and enthusiasm this morning,\" Mr Johnson said afterwards, noting high fundraising tallies since the guilty verdict.\n\n\"We're feeling good.\"\n\nThe Republican speaker had demurred earlier over whether he has asked Mr Trump to respect the peaceful transfer of presidential power and commit to not doing another January 6.\n\nHe said: \"Of course he respects that, we all do, and we've all talked about it, ad nauseum.\"\n\nThursday afternoon offered the first encounter in years between Mr Trump and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who once blamed Mr Trump for the \"disgraceful\" attack that he called an \"insurrection\" but now endorses the party's presumptive nominee.\n\nMr McConnell said Mr Trump received standing ovations from the senators and the two \"had a really positive meeting\".\n\nThe senator said: \"He and I got a chance to talk a little bit, shook hands a few times.\"\n\nMany potential priorities for a new White House administration are being formulated by a constellation of outside groups, including Project 2025, laying the groundwork for executive and legislative actions, though Mr Trump has made clear he has his own agenda.\n\nOn one major controversial issue, Mr Trump told legislators that abortion rules should be left to the states and said he supported exceptions for rape, incest and to save the life of the mother, legislators said.\n\n\"Anybody who thought that this president was going to be down after the sham trial, it's only giving him even more energy,\" said Representative Tom Emmer, the Republican Party whip.\n\n\"Donald Trump is crushing this election.\"\n\nBut Mr Trump's private meetings with House and Senate Republicans so close to the Capitol were infused with the symbolism of his return as the US president who threatened the American tradition of the peaceful transfer of power.\n\n\"It's frustrating,\" said former US Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn, who made his own unsuccessful run for Congress as a Maryland Democrat in the aftermath of January 6, the day when police engaged in hand-to-hand fighting to stop Trump supporters who stormed the building in an effort to overturn Joe Biden's election.\n\nMr Dunn spoke of the \"irony\" of Mr Trump returning to the area and legislators now embracing him.\n\n\"It just shows the lack of backbone they have when they're truly putting party and person over country,\" he said.\n\n\"And it's sad.\"\n\nMr Biden was overseas on Thursday attending a summit of the Group of Seven leading industrialised nations, but the president's campaign unveiled a new ad blaming Mr Trump for lighting the \"fire\" of January 6 and threatening democracy.", "source": {"uri": "shropshirestar.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Shropshire Star"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Trump's false claims that his defeat was the result of fraud inspired the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.\n\nDespite their differences, the Kentucky Republican emphasized his support for Trump's candidacy. \"I support him. He's earned the nomination by the voters all across the country. And of course, I'll be at the meeting,\" McConnell told reporters on Wednesday.\n\nOthers, including moderates such as Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski and Mitt Romney, will not attend, citing scheduling conflicts.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson met with Senate Republicans over lunch on Wednesday to talk about how a united Republican government could use a parliamentary vehicle called budget reconciliation to bypass Democrats in the Senate.\n\n\"We have big policy changes that we'd like to enact,\" Johnson told reporters afterward. \"So, we want to make the most use of that and be coordinated between the two chambers.\"\n\nAlso read | He said he was ashamed of storming the capitol. Now he's running for office.\n\nA main focus for House and Senate Republicans will be making permanent tax cuts under Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that will otherwise expire next year.\n\nLawmakers also expect to discuss their spending plans for the fiscal year beginning October 1 and how to handle the looming January 1 deadline to raise or suspend the nation's debt ceiling. Brinkmanship around debt-ceiling deadlines has spooked financial markets in the past.\n\nRepublican centrists also hope Trump will persuade hardline conservatives to get in line after ousting former Speaker Kevin McCarthy in October, attempting to oust Johnson last month and repeatedly blocking their own party's legislation over the past year.\n\n\"The president has an opportunity to reaffirm to the members of our conference how important it is to stick together,\" said US Representative Anthony D'Esposito. \"Our success will be depend on us sticking together as Republicans.\"", "source":

It also marked his first appearance on the Hill since becoming a convicted felon two weeks ago, and put him face-to-face with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., with whom he has clashed, for the first time in three years.\n\nTrump's morning session in private with House Republicans at the Capitol Hill Club was described as something of a pep rally for conservative causes. Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., and others said the atmosphere was a mix of civil and serious, with some lighter moments. Trump was slated to meet with GOP senators later in the day.\n\n\"The president was having a little fun cracking jokes, that kind of thing,\" said Donalds, mentioned on some lists as a potential Trump running mate. \"But then, also talking seriously just about [members] just working hard to get to the finish line in this election.\"\n\nHouse Appropriations Chairman Tom Cole, R-Okla., described the session as \"a pretty good rally-the-troops kind of speech.\" Trump will turn 78 on Friday, and several members, with grins, said House Republicans sang \"Happy Birthday.\"\n\nAs they dodged a handful of anti-Trump protesters outside, multiple members said Trump said Speaker Mike Johnson is doing a \"great job,\" and he teased Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Georgia Republican who has clashed with Johnson, R-La. Members said Trump asked if she has been more \"nice\" to Johnson. \"Some people kind of laughed. A few cheered,\" said Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn. \"I thought she took it very gracious.\"\n\nLawmakers said Trump stood by his boasting about how conservatives on the Supreme Court -- including three that he appointed -- ended federal abortion protections. He also vowed to again use tariffs as president and endorsed a House-passed Republican immigration measure known as H.R. 2.\n\n\"He's a big believer in tariffs,\" Cole said, noting Trump spoke about the trade tactic \"at great length,\" and added: \"He clearly supports them as a tool.\"\n\nOn abortion, \"he still believes that the Dobbs decision was the right decision for America, and the American people need to decide the issue, as they are doing right now,\" said Republican Study Committee Chair Kevin Hern, R-Okla., referring to the Supreme Court decision that ended federal protections for abortion access.\n\nAt campaign rallies and in other public remarks of late, Trump has said the Dobbs ruling rightfully handed the hot-button issue -- on which polls show voters siding with Democrats -- to state governments. To that end, he told House members Thursday that state \"legislatures need to make that decision and we're seeing that happen across America,\" Hern said.\n\n\"He said there may be a time and place for the federal government to get involved, but right now, what needs to be done is the voices of the people in the states [should be heard],\" the chairman added. \"Some are going the right way for Republicans and some are not and he acknowledged that.\"\n\nHis meetings with Hill Republicans were intended as a show of support for the presumptive GOP presidential nominee following his conviction on 34 criminal counts of falsifying business records. It also was meant as a display of Republican unity after, especially on the House side, GOP members have clashed with themselves in recent months.\n\nWhile Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitt Romney of Utah -- all Trump critics -- said they would skip the afternoon session with Trump, the former president's popularity within the party is as strong as ever. For instance, 80.4% of GOP voters had a favorable view of Trump, according to a FiveThirtyEight analysis. (Less than one-third, 17.8%, reported having an unfavorable view.)\n\nTrump, despite becoming the first former U.S. president to be convicted by a jury, continues to run a competitive race against President Joe Biden. Another FiveThirtyEight metric put them in a dead heat nationally, with Trump leading 40.9% to Biden's 40%.\n\nRatings by Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales give Trump the advantage five months from Election Day in the Electoral College race, with a projected 235 votes to Biden's 226 -- but both would be shy of the 270 needed to secure the presidency.\n\nHern told reporters that Trump described the swing states that are expected to decide the presidential race as \"looking really good right now,\" noting that Trump told House members \"people are really turning out in huge numbers\" and that the former president believes \"his message is being well received.\"\n\nAs the 2024 campaign heats up, Cole -- who faces a primary challenge on Tuesday -- said the House GOP conference \"will be extraordinarily supportive\" of Trump, and along with Senate Republicans \"will give him an exceptional platform -- lots of chips to play.\"\n\nInside Elections and other political prognosticators see control of both chambers as up for grabs. To that end, Donalds said Trump indicated he intends to get involved in congressional races. That's despite the former president's poor record with helping the party win congressional races since he first was on the ballot in 2016.\n\n\"He's going to work hard. You know, he wants everybody to be successful,\" he said. \"It's all hands on deck.\"\n\nBut Hern said Trump made clear that \"he's not going to carry the load for us -- we can't stop working as individuals.\"\n\nAs always, both sessions were vintage Trump. \"He ran the gamut\" of issues, said Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C. But did he show any cards about who he will select to be his running mate during his third White House bid?\n\n\"No,\" Donalds said with a chuckle behind sunglasses on one of the warmest days so far this year in Washington, D.C. \"We didn't get into that.\"\n\n-------\n\n(Aidan Quigley contributed to this report.)\n\n\u00a92024 CQ-Roll Call, Inc., All Rights Reserved.

House GOP Conference Chairwoman Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York advised lawmakers early Tuesday of the coming meeting with Trump.\n\nIt's a pivotal moment for the indicted former president, weeks before he is to be sentenced after being found guilty in the hush money trial and ahead of the Republican National Convention when he is expected to become the formal GOP nominee for president.\n\nThe Trump campaign did not confirm the meeting with House Republicans, but a senior campaign official said the Senate meeting will be focused on policy issues -- including tax cuts.\n\nTrump's return to the GOP campaign offices across from the Capitol, his first since the mob of supporters rioted at the Capitol in 2021, comes as he faces other legal charges, including the four-part federal indictment brought by Justice Department Special Prosecutor Jack Smith in the conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election results.\n\nMost Republicans have endorsed Trump in the expected rematch against Biden, including Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, and other leaders who were critical of him in the aftermath of the 2021 attack.\n\nMany of the Republicans in Congress have joined Trump in attacking the U.S. justice system for the cases against him. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., led lawmakers in rallying to Trump's defense outside the New York courthouse last month in the hush money trial.\n\nBRAGG TO TESTIFY\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has agreed to testify before Congress on July 12, a day after Trump's sentencing.\n\nA spokesperson for Bragg's office confirmed Tuesday that he will appear before the House Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government alongside Matthew Colangelo, the former high-ranking Justice Department official who was hired by Bragg in 2022 and helped lead the Trump investigation.\n\nBragg and Colangelo will face what's likely to be a hostile, Republican-controlled hearing where the chairman, Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, has accused both men of conducting a \"political prosecution\" in the case against the former president. It will mark the latest effort by Trump's closest allies in Congress to discredit the recent 34-count conviction by going after local and federal prosecutors who have charged him.\n\n\"It undermines the rule of law to spread dangerous misinformation, baseless claims, and conspiracy theories following the jury's return of a full-count felony conviction in People v. Trump,\" a spokesperson for the Manhattan district attorney's office said. \"Nonetheless, we respect our government institutions and plan to appear voluntarily before the subcommittee after sentencing.\"\n\nBragg, a Democrat, sued Jordan last year, seeking to halt a House Judiciary Committee inquiry into Trump's indictment. He later agreed to let the Republican-led committee question ex-prosecutor Mark Pomerantz, who once oversaw the investigation but left the job after clashing with Bragg over the direction of the case.\n\nSoon after Trump's April 2023 arraignment, Jordan took the Judiciary Committee on the road for a field hearing near Bragg's offices to examine what he decried as the Democrat's \"pro-crime, anti-victim\" policies. Democrats described the hearing and various efforts since by Republicans as a partisan stunt aimed at amplifying conservative anger at Bragg.\n\nInformation for this article was contributed by Lisa Mascaro, Farnoush Amiri and Michael R.

A nonpartisan audit of the 2020 election in Wisconsin found no evidence of irregularities.\n\nMEMORIES OF JAN. 6\n\nTrump's supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, fueled by his false claims that his defeat was the result of fraud. Thursday's visit was his first public appearance on Capitol Hill since that day and Democrats said he was not welcome.\n\n\"After inciting a deadly insurrection that defiled the halls of Congress, how dare Trump show his face on these grounds?\" Democratic Representative Bennie Thompson said in a statement.\n\nThe Biden campaign on Thursday began running an ad in battleground states highlighting the violence of Jan. 6.\n\nRepublican lawmakers said Trump told them he would work to expand the party's narrow 218-213 House majority and take control of a Senate that Democrats currently lead 51-49.\n\nTrump also advised House Republicans not to push a national ban on abortion and urged them to abandon the intra-party squabbling that has hobbled their effectiveness, lawmakers said.\n\nIt was Trump's first face to face meeting with McConnell since the Jan. 6 attack. The two had not spoken since a few weeks before then, when McConnell affirmed Biden's 2020 victory. Two moderate Republican senators, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, skipped the event.\n\nMcConnell did not appear with Trump at a news conference after the meeting.\n\nTIPS AND TARIFFS\n\nTrump also urged lawmakers to cut taxes on income from tips, an idea he first floated on Sunday to appeal to service workers, multiple lawmakers said.\n\nTrump used tariffs aggressively during his 2017-2021 term in office, placing levies of up to 25% on a wide range of Chinese products as one of many efforts to thwart competition.\n\nSenator Mike Rounds said that cutting taxes on tips could help Republicans win over working-class voters.\n\n\"If there was something we could do to really energize that particular segment of the population, that might be a real popular thing to do,\" Rounds told reporters.\n\nBiden's support among voters without college degrees or living in households earning $50,000 a year or less has fallen sharply, Reuters/Ipsos polling shows, though large numbers of those voters have not shifted their support to Trump.\n\nTrump also criticized a $60 billion aid package for Ukraine that recently passed with Republican support, lawmakers said.\n\n\"He's like, if Ukraine wins, what will be the benefit?\" Republican Representative Don Bacon told reporters.\n\nTrump told Republicans they should allow states to set their own policies on abortion, rather than push for a nationwide ban following the Supreme Court's 2022 decision that ended the nationwide guarantee of abortion access. Many in the party want to outlaw the procedure entirely.\n\n\"He reiterated he thought that was the right decision, that some states will do one thing and some states will do another,\" Republican Representative French Hill told reporters.\n\nTrump also spoke to the Business Roundtable, an association of more than 200 corporate chief executives.\n\n(Reporting by David Morgan, Andy Sullivan and

David Valadao of California.\n\nI never liked him, Trump said of Valadao, according to a GOP staffer.\n\nAs a number of House Republicans find themselves in competitive primary races, the former speaker said he wanted to hold teletown halls but acknowledged his help would not be welcomed by some, given that he had supported their main opponents.\n\nTrump did not hesitate to acknowledge tensions between House Speaker Mike Johnson and Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who unsuccessfully tried to oust Johnson against Trump's wishes. The former president playfully asked Greene, a loyal ally of his whom he strongly supports, to be nice to the speaker.\n\nHe's always so nice, he recognizes me, and he said to me: are you nice to President Johnson? He was joking. And I said huh, as she gestured with her hands. He said OK, be nice to him and I nodded, she added.\n\nJohnson, after the meeting, said the former president told him he was doing a very good job and planned to be fully prepared to implement Trump's plans if he wins in November.\n\nThe former president's conviction also weighed heavily during Thursday's meeting.\n\nTrump's allies on Capitol Hill immediately took action after the guilty verdict proposing to defund the Justice Department and even shut down the government. House Republicans voted Wednesday to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress. And one of the legislative proposals that Republican leaders are actively pursuing is a bill that would allow current and former presidents to bring state-level cases in federal court. The bill passed out of committee last September, but Republican Party leaders only began formally adopting it this week, on the eve of Trump's visit to the Capitol and two weeks after his conviction.\n\nDuring his meeting with Republican lawmakers, Trump called the Justice Department dirty bastards, according to another source in the room.\n\nOklahoma Republican Rep. Kevin Hern said the former president expressed grave concern that the federal government was being weaponized.\n\nAt a news conference after the meeting, House Majority Whip Tom Emmer said the former president's felony convictions only energized the party that would propel them to victory in November.\n\n\"Anyone who thought that this president was going to be overthrown after the show trial, after this crooked trial that we saw in New York, I think, again, that just gave him even more energy,\" Emmer said. And what he did for us upstairs earlier was he showed us this energy and this positive attitude, despite all the garbage that they threw at him with their legal speeches and their absurdities.\n\nTrump had a direct message for House Republicans on how to approach abortion through November, an issue on which Republicans have struggled to unite in the wake of the overturning of Roe v. Wade.\n\nJohnson reported that Trump asked the group to exercise their own conscience to talk about it, share their beliefs and do it in a way that makes sense to people. And I think he made a good point.\n\nTrump, in a hushed tone, advised Republicans not to be afraid of the issue, according to sources in the room, and said Democrats were the most extreme on the issue. He called on Republicans to follow their beliefs, but cautioned how they will approach the issue on the campaign trail and argued for exceptions.\n\nHe spoke out and called for exceptions for rape, maternal life and incest. He talked about how we need to talk about this, correctly quote his words, not mine, GOP Rep. Nancy Mace told CNN. And I really appreciated her comments as a woman, as a suburban mom.\n\nTrump also explained how Roe v. Wade ultimately turned the decision over to the states as they had always wanted, although he noted that some of them hadn't made very good decisions.\n\nBut like Ronald Reagan, you have to have three choices: motherhood, rape and incest, you have to do it, but you have to follow your own heart, Trump said, according to a source in the room.\n\nTrump's message came as the Supreme Court dismissed a lawsuit challenging the Food and Drug Administration's approach to regulating the abortion pill mifepristone, with a ruling that will continue to allow the pills to be sent to patients without an in-person medical visit.\n\nThe former president also discussed a handful of other priorities, including his proposal to eliminate taxes on tips, building the southern border and stopping aid to Ukraine, even though a number of legislators from her party support her.\n\nThere were a number of moments where the former president veered off topic.\n\nAs Trump raged about crime rates and so-called election integrity issues, the former president called Milwaukee, where Republicans are holding their convention this summer, horrible, according to a source in the room.\n\nRep. Derrick Van Orden, a Wisconsin Republican in the room, made clear to CNN that Trump was specifically referring to crime in Milwaukee and not the city itself.\n\nIn bizarre moment, Trump called Pelosis daughter wacky, then claimed his daughter once told him that he and the former House speaker would have had a great romance in another life, according to a lawmaker present in the room.\n\nIn response to Trump's comments, one of Pelosis daughters posted on X: Speaking on behalf of Pelosi's 4 daughters, this is a LIE. His deceptive and deranged obsession with our mother is yet another reason why Donald Trump is sick, unhinged and unfit to set foot near her or the White House.\n\nHe also questioned why popstar Taylor Swift would support President Joe Biden over him, whom he called a dope.\n\nWhy would she approve this drug, Trump said, according to a member in the room. He doesn't know how to get off stage.\n\nThe former president even said at one point about Hannibal Lecter: \"Nice guy, he even invited a friend to dinner.\"\n\nAt the start of the meeting, House Republicans sang happy birthday to the former president, whose birthday is Friday, and presented him with the ball and bat from the congressional baseball game the Republican won Wednesday, according to a source present in the room.\n\nWhat Are The Main Benefits Of Comparing Car Insurance Quotes Online", "source": {"uri": "exbulletin.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ExBulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Lyndon B.

first in-person encounter between the two since nearly four years ago.\n\nThe gathering, slated to take place in Washington, DC, underscores a significant moment of potential reconciliation within the Republican Party, Fox News reports.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, positioning himself as the presumptive presidential nominee for the GOP, is scheduled to convene with Senate and House Republicans in separate sessions behind closed doors.\n\nThese meetings aim to foster unity within the party and advance a cohesive policy and political agenda as Republicans gear up for the 2025 White House bid.\n\nTrump's discussions with Republican lawmakers will emphasize the importance of aligning their efforts to propel the party forward and address pressing national issues, according to the Washington Post.\n\nWhile the Trump campaign has not officially confirmed the House meeting, House GOP Conference chairwoman Elise Stefanik has reportedly notified lawmakers of the impending session.\n\nREAD NEXT: Donald Trump Draws Thousands of Supporters in First Rally Since New York Convention\n\nThe backdrop against which Donald Trump's return to Capitol Hill unfolds is fraught with the echoes of past discord and the realities of a shifting political landscape.\n\nThe events of January 6, 2021, when Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol, remain vivid in memory as Trump seeks to reengage with GOP leadership.\n\nDespite the tumultuous aftermath of the Capitol riot and subsequent legal battles, Trump's influence within the Republican Party remains substantial.\n\nMany GOP leaders, including Mitch McConnell, who previously criticized Trump's role in the events of January 6, have since aligned themselves with the former president.\n\nAs Republican senators prepare to engage with Trump, they focus on crafting a unified message and strategy to bolster the party's prospects in upcoming elections.\n\nWith Trump's endorsement carrying significant weight among GOP voters, senators are eager to align their priorities with his agenda.\n\nKey Republican senators, including John Cornyn of Texas and Chuck Grassley of Iowa, emphasize the importance of addressing critical issues such as border security and inflation while rallying behind Trump's leadership, the Independent noted.\n\nThe prospect of reclaiming control of the Senate underscores the significance of GOP unity in the pursuit of shared objectives.\n\nWhile Trump's return to Capitol Hill signifies a rallying point for many Republicans, divisions within the party persist.\n\nSome GOP members, such as Senator Susan Collins of Maine, have opted not to attend Trump's meeting, reflecting ongoing tensions within Republican ranks.\n\nCollins, known for her independent stance within the party, symbolizes the nuanced dynamics as Republicans navigate the complexities of Trump's leadership and their own political identities.\n\nAs the GOP charts its course forward, reconciling differing perspectives and priorities remains a critical challenge.\n\nThe impending meeting between Senate Republicans and former President Donald Trump represents a pivotal moment in the ongoing evolution of the Republican Party.\n\nAs GOP leaders converge to strategize and unify their efforts, the legacy of past conflicts and the imperatives of future electoral success converge in the corridors of power in Washington, DC.\n\nREAD MORE: Donald Trump Attends Mandatory Interview Before Sentencing in NY Hush Money Case", "source": {"uri": "latinpost.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Latin Post"},

So, we're like one team/one vision, and I think that'll be largely what we talk about,\" Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., told reporters.\n\nRepublicans hope to see Trump defeat Biden, extend their current razor-thin 218-213 majority in the House and take control of a Senate that Democrats currently lead 51-49.\n\nOld Grievances\n\nBut the visit has also put a spotlight on longstanding tensions between Trump and members of Congress, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who has not spoken to the former president since he acknowledged Biden's election victory in December 2020. Trump's seeking election integrity investigations inspired the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.\n\nDespite their differences, McConnell emphasized his support for Trump's candidacy.\n\n\"I support him. He's earned the nomination by the voters all across the country. And of course, I'll be at the meeting,\" McConnell told reporters Wednesday.\n\nOthers, including moderates such as Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine; Lisa Murkowksi, R-Alaska; and Mitt Romney, R-Utah, will not attend, citing scheduling conflicts.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., met with Senate Republicans over lunch Wednesday to talk about how a united Republican government could use a parliamentary vehicle called budget reconciliation to bypass Democratic objections in the Senate.\n\n\"We have big policy changes that we'd like to enact,\" Johnson told reporters afterward. \"So, we want to make the most use of that and be coordinated between the two chambers.\"\n\nA main focus for House and Senate Republicans will be making permanent tax cuts under Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that will otherwise expire next year.\n\nLawmakers also expect to discuss their plans around spending for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 and how to handle the looming Jan. 1 deadline to raise or suspend the nation's debt ceiling. Brinkmanship around debt-ceiling deadlines has spooked financial markets in the past.\n\nHouse Republican centrists also hope Trump will persuade hardline conservatives who ousted former Speaker Kevin McCarthy in October, sought to oust Johnson last month and have blocked their own party's legislation over the past year, to get in line with the rest of the conference.\n\n\"The president has an opportunity to reaffirm to the members of our conference how important it is to stick together,\" Rep. Anthony D'Esposito, R-N.Y. \"Our success will be depend on us sticking together as Republicans.\"", "source": {"uri": "newsmax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NewsMax"}, "authors": [{"uri":

It also marked his first appearance on the Hill since becoming a convicted felon two weeks ago, and put him face-to-face with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., with whom he has clashed, for the first time in three years.\n\nTrump's morning session in private with House Republicans at the Capitol Hill Club was described as something of a pep rally for conservative causes. Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., and others said the atmosphere was a mix of civil and serious, with some lighter moments. Trump was slated to meet with GOP senators later in the day.\n\n\"The president was having a little fun cracking jokes, that kind of thing,\" said Donalds, mentioned on some lists as a potential Trump running mate. \"But then, also talking seriously just about [members] just working hard to get to the finish line in this election.\"\n\nHouse Appropriations Chairman Tom Cole, R-Okla., described the session as \"a pretty good rally-the-troops kind of speech.\" Trump will turn 78 on Friday, and several members, with grins, said House Republicans sang \"Happy Birthday.\"\n\nAs they dodged a handful of anti-Trump protesters outside, multiple members said Trump said Speaker Mike Johnson is doing a \"great job,\" and he teased Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Georgia Republican who has clashed with Johnson, R-La. Members said Trump asked if she has been more \"nice\" to Johnson. \"Some people kind of laughed. A few cheered,\" said Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn. \"I thought she took it very gracious.\"\n\nLawmakers said Trump stood by his boasting about how conservatives on the Supreme Court -- including three that he appointed -- ended federal abortion protections. He also vowed to again use tariffs as president and endorsed a House-passed Republican immigration measure known as H.R. 2.\n\n\"He's a big believer in tariffs,\" Cole said, noting Trump spoke about the trade tactic \"at great length,\" and added: \"He clearly supports them as a tool.\"\n\nOn abortion, \"he still believes that the Dobbs decision was the right decision for America, and the American people need to decide the issue, as they are doing right now,\" said Republican Study Committee Chair Kevin Hern, R-Okla., referring to the Supreme Court decision that ended federal protections for abortion access.\n\nAt campaign rallies and in other public remarks of late, Trump has said the Dobbs ruling rightfully handed the hot-button issue -- on which polls show voters siding with Democrats -- to state governments. To that end, he told House members Thursday that state \"legislatures need to make that decision and we're seeing that happen across America,\" Hern said.\n\n\"He said there may be a time and place for the federal government to get involved, but right now, what needs to be done is the voices of the people in the states [should be heard],\" the chairman added. \"Some are going the right way for Republicans and some are not and he acknowledged that.\"\n\nHis meetings with Hill Republicans were intended as a show of support for the presumptive GOP presidential nominee following his conviction on 34 criminal counts of falsifying business records. It also was meant as a display of Republican unity after, especially on the House side, GOP members have clashed with themselves in recent months.\n\nWhile Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitt Romney of Utah -- all Trump critics -- said they would skip the afternoon session with Trump, the former president's popularity within the party is as strong as ever. For instance, 80.4 percent of GOP voters had a favorable view of Trump, according to a FiveThirtyEight analysis. (Less than one-third, 17.8 percent, reported having an unfavorable view.)\n\nTrump, despite becoming the first former U.S. president to be convicted by a jury, continues to run a competitive race against President Joe Biden. Another FiveThirtyEight metric put them in a dead heat nationally, with Trump leading 40.9 percent to Biden's 40 percent.\n\nRatings by Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales give Trump the advantage five months from Election Day in the Electoral College race, with a projected 235 votes to Biden's 226 -- but both would be shy of the 270 needed to secure the presidency.\n\nHern told reporters that Trump described the swing states that are expected to decide the presidential race as \"looking really good right now,\" noting that Trump told House members \"people are really turning out in huge numbers\" and that the former president believes \"his message is being well received.\"\n\nAs the 2024 campaign heats up, Cole -- who faces a primary challenge on Tuesday -- said the House GOP conference \"will be extraordinarily supportive\" of Trump, and along with Senate Republicans \"will give him an exceptional platform -- lots of chips to play.\"\n\nInside Elections and other political prognosticators see control of both chambers as up for grabs. To that end, Donalds said Trump indicated he intends to get involved in congressional races.

He mingled with Republicans, despite past tensions, and aimed to unify the party. His remarks on Milwaukee and past events sparked controversy, while his policy suggestions drew mixed reactions.\n\ncriticized U.S. aid to Ukraine, urged his fellow Republicans to cut taxes on gratuities and talked up tariffs on a Thursday visit to Capitol Hill where he also called the city hosting his party's presidential convention \"horrible.\" In separate meetings with Republicans in the House of Representatives and the Senate, Trump sought to mend divisions ahead of the\n\nNov. 5 election that could see his party win control of the White House and both chambers of Congress.\n\nParticipants said he shook hands with Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, despite their frosty relationship, and encouraged hard-line Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene to \"be nice\" to House Speaker Mike Johnson, after her failed attempt to depose him. \"There's tremendous unity in the Republican Party,\" Trump said after the Senate meeting.\n\nBut Republicans scrambled to explain after several media outlets reported that Trump privately called\n\nMilwaukee a \"horrible\" city, roughly one month before he is due to receive his party's presidential nomination there. That could potentially alienate residents of the biggest city in Wisconsin, one of a handful of competitive states that will determine the outcome of the election.\n\nA campaign spokesman and several Republican lawmakers said Trump was referring to the city's problems with crime and vote fraud. A nonpartisan audit of the 2020 election in Wisconsin found no evidence of irregularities. MEMORIES OF JAN. 6\n\nTrump's supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, fueled by his false claims that his defeat was the result of fraud. Thursday's visit was his first public appearance on Capitol Hill since that day and Democrats said he was not welcome back. \"After inciting a deadly insurrection that defiled the halls of Congress, how dare Trump show his face on these grounds?\" Democratic Representative Bennie Thompson said in a statement.\n\nRepublican lawmakers said Trump told them he would work to expand the party's narrow 218-213 House majority and take control of a Senate that Democrats currently lead 51-49. Trump also advised House Republicans not to push a national ban on abortion and urged them to abandon the intra-party squabbling that has hobbled their effectiveness, lawmakers said.\n\nIt was Trump's first face to face meeting with McConnell since the Jan. 6 attack. The two had not spoken since a few weeks before then, when McConnell affirmed Biden's 2020 victory. Two moderate Republican senators, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, skipped the event. TIPS AND TARIFFS\n\nTrump urged lawmakers to cut taxes on income from tips, an idea he first floated on Sunday to appeal to service workers and voiced support for tariffs on Chinese goods and to protect the U.S. steel industry, multiple lawmakers said. Trump used tariffs aggressively during his 2017-2021 term in office, placing levies of up to 25% on a wide range of Chinese products as one of many efforts to thwart competition.\n\nSenator Mike Rounds said that cutting taxes on tips could help Republicans with working-class voters. \"These are the folks you really want to help. I think everybody recognizes that these folks have a real challenge and they work hard for the tips they get,\" Rounds told reporters. \"If there was something we could do to really energize that particular segment of the population, that might be a real popular thing to do.\"\n\nBiden's support among voters without college degrees or living in households earning $50,000 a year or less has fallen sharply\n\n, Reuters/Ipsos polling\n\nshows, though large numbers of those voters have not shifted their support to Trump. Trump also criticized a $60-billion aid package for Ukraine that recently passed with Republican support, lawmakers said.\n\n\"He's like, if Ukraine wins, what will be the benefit?\" Republican Representative Don Bacon told reporters. Trump told Republicans that they should allow states to set their own policies on abortion, rather than push for a nationwide ban following the Supreme Court's 2022 decision that ended the nationwide guarantee of abortion access. Many in the party want to outlaw the procedure entirely.\n\n\"He reiterated he thought that was the right decision, that some states will do one thing and some states will do another,\" Republican Representative French Hill told reporters. Trump also spoke to the Business Roundtable, an association of more than 200 corporate chief executives.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a

David Valadao of California.\n\n\"I never loved him,\" Trump said of Valadao, according to a GOP member.\n\nAs a number of House Republicans find themselves in competitive primary races, the former president said he wanted to do tele-town halls, but acknowledged his help would not be welcomed by some, given that he had endorsed their primary opponents.\n\nTrump did not shy away from acknowledging the bad blood between House Speaker Mike Johnson and GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who unsuccessfully tried to oust Johnson against Trump's wishes. The former president playfully asked Greene, a staunch ally of his who he strongly supports, to be nice to the speaker.\n\n\"He's always so sweet, recognizing me, and he said 'are you being nice to Speaker Johnson?' He was joking. And I said 'eh,'\" as she gestured with her hands. \"He said 'OK be nice to him' and I nodded my head,\" she added.\n\nJohnson, after the meeting, said the former president told him that he was doing \"a very good job\" and that he plans to be \"fully prepared\" to implement Trump's plans if he wins in November.\n\nThe former president's conviction also hung heavy over Thursday's meeting.\n\nTrump's allies on Capitol Hill immediately sprung into action following the guilty verdict -proposing to defund the Department of Justice and even shut down the government. House Republicans voted to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress on Wednesday. And one legislative proposal Republican leaders are now actively pursuing is a bill that would allow current and former presidents to move state-level cases to federal court. The legislation passed out of committee last September, but GOP leaders only started formally whipping the bill this week - on the eve of Trump's Capitol Hill visit and two weeks after his conviction.\n\nIn his meeting with GOP lawmakers, Trump called the Department of Justice \"dirty no good bastards,\" according to another source in the room.\n\nGOP Rep. Kevin Hern of Oklahoma said the former president expressed he was \"gravely concerned\" about the federal government being weaponized.\n\nIn a news conference after the meeting, House Majority Whip Tom Emmer said that the former president's felony convictions have only energized the party that will propel them to victory in November.\n\n\"Anybody who thought that this President was going to be down after the sham trial, after that crooked trial that we saw in New York, I think, again, it's only given him even more energy,\" Emmer said. \"And what he did for us upstairs just now is, he showed us that energy and he showed us that positive outlook, despite all the garbage they've been throwing at him with their lawfare and their nonsense.\"\n\nTrump tells GOP lawmakers to 'follow your own heart' on abortion\n\nTrump had a direct message for House Republicans on how to approach abortion leading into November, an issue Republicans have struggled to unify around in the wake of Roe v. Wade being overturned.\n\nJohnson relayed that Trump told the group to \"exercise your own conscience to talk about it, share your conviction, and do that in a way that makes sense to people. And I think he had made a good point.\"\n\nTrump, in a low voice, advised Republicans to not be afraid of the issue, according to sources in room, and claimed that Democrats are the extreme ones on the topic. He called on Republicans to follow their convictions but cautioned how they address the matter on the campaign trail and advocated for exceptions.\n\n\"He talked and pushed for exceptions for rape, life of the mother and incest. He talked about the way that we need to talk about it, quote correctly, his words, not mine,\" GOP Rep. Nancy Mace told CNN. \"And I really appreciated his comments as a woman, as a suburban mom.\"\n\nTrump also talked about how Roe v. Wade finally put the decision to the states as they always wanted, though he noted some of them made \"not so good\" decisions.\n\n\"But like Ronald Reagan, you have to have three choices: life of mother, rape and incest you have to do, but you have to follow your own heart,\" Trump said, according to a source in the room.\n\nTrump's message came as the Supreme Court rejected a lawsuit challenging the Food and Drug Administration's approach to regulating the abortion pill mifepristone with a ruling that will continue to allow the pills to be mailed to patients without an in-person doctor's visit.\n\nThe former president also ticked through a handful of other priorities, including his proposal to eliminate taxes on tips, building the southern border, and halting further aid for Ukraine, even though a number of lawmakers in his party support it.\n\nTrump off topic\n\nThere were a number of moments where the former president went off topic.\n\nAs Trump was ranting about crime rates and so-called election integrity issues, the former president called Milwaukee - where Republicans are holding their convention this summer - \"horrible,\" according to a source in the room.\n\nRep. Derrick Van Orden, a Wisconsin Republican who was in the room, made clear to CNN that Trump was \"specifically referring to crime in Milwaukee\" and not the city itself.\n\nIn one bizarre moment, Trump called Pelosi's daughter a \"wacko\" and then claimed her daughter once told him that he and the former House speaker would have had a \"great romance\" in another life, according to a lawmaker in the room..\n\nIn response to Trump's comments, one of Pelosi's daughters posted on X: \"speaking for all 4 Pelosi daughters -- this is a LIE. His deceitful, deranged obsession with our mother is yet another reason Donald Trump is unwell, unhinged and unfit to step foot anywhere near her -- or the White House.\"\n\nHe also questioned why popstar Taylor Swift would support President Joe Biden over him, whom he referred to as a \"dope.\"\n\n\"Why would she endorse this dope,\" Trump said, according to a member in the room. \"He doesn't know how to get off a stage.\"\n\nThe former president even said at one point of Hannibal Lecter: \"nNice guy ... he even had a friend over for dinner.\"\n\nAt the start of the meeting, House Republicans sang happy birthday to the former president, whose birthday is Friday, and presented him with the game ball and bat from the congressional baseball game that Republican won on Wednesday, according to a source in the room.", "source": {"uri": "cnn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CNN"}, "authors": [{"uri": "annie_grayer@cnn.com", "name": "Annie Grayer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "lauren_fox@cnn.com", "name": "Lauren Fox", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "melanie_zanona@cnn.com", "name": "Melanie Zanona", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}, {"uri": "kit_maher@cnn.com", "name": "Kit Maher", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Valadao", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "David Valadao"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Emmer", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tom Emmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Taylor Swift"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Impeachment"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Hern", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Hern"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrick_Garland", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Merrick Garland"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Contempt of Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Federal judiciary of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Attorney General"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

He's earned the nomination by the voters all across the country, and of course, I'll be at the meeting tomorrow.\"\n\nMcConnell endorsed Trump in March, a stunning reversal from previously blaming him for \"disgraceful\" acts on Jan. 6, 2021, and after Trump's attacks against the senator's wife, former Trump Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, that have been panned as racist.\n\nSens. Susan Collins (R-ME) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) told the Washington Examiner they won't attend because of busy schedules. Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT) said he won't either because he has a flight to catch.\n\n\"I've got a conflict,\" Murkowski said. \"We just got the invite [Monday]. I've got a pretty crazy week. I've just got a lot going on.\"\n\nSen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) initially told the Washington Examiner he was undecided due to his schedule but later told reporters he was inclined to attend.\n\n\"I think he's going to be the next president,\" Cassidy said. \"You got to work with the next president.\"\n\nCollins, Murkowski, Cassidy, and Romney are the remaining of the seven GOP senators who voted to convict Trump of impeachment over the Capitol riot. The other three have since retired from Congress.\n\nApproached off the Senate floor by reporters, an aide accompanying Sen. Todd Young (R-IN), the former chairman of Senate Republicans' campaign arm under Trump, said the senator would not be answering any questions related to the former president.\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-KY) said he will \"probably\" attend.\n\nThe invite to Trump was extended by Republican Conference Chairman John Barrasso (R-WY) to discuss the GOP's 2025 agenda.\n\n\"I believe it will be helpful to hear directly from President Trump about his plans for the summer and to also share our ideas for a strategic governing agenda in 2025,\" Barrasso wrote in an email invitation to GOP colleagues on Monday.\n\nTrump was already slated to be in town to meet with the Business Roundtable lobbying group. He'll meet with House Republicans at the Capitol Hill Club on Thursday morning before joining Senate Republicans at the National Republican Senatorial Committee later that afternoon.\n\nOther Senate Republicans were disappointed to hear there would be some GOP boycotts.\n\n\"I would hope that we'd all be unified for -- hopefully -- the next president of the United States because if we're not, we're going to get our ears beat off,\" Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) said.\n\n\"He's our nominee,\" Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL), one of three Republicans vying to be McConnell's successor as the next GOP leader, said. \"We got to win the White House. We got to win the Senate. We got to win the House.\"\n\nSens. John Cornyn (R-TX) and Minority Whip John Thune (R-SD) are also running to replace McConnell and emphasized party unity.\n\n\"[Trump's] team is coordinating with us on all the key Senate races,\" Thune said. \"I think it'll be just an attempt to make sure that we're united as we head into November.\"\n\nCornyn stressed that \"unity is helpful.\"\n\nDemocrats were eager to use the meeting as another opportunity to whack Republicans for their affinity to Trump.\n\n\"No other former president enjoys having their ass kissed more than Trump, so it's going to be a lot of that,\" Sen.

and whips up Republican legislators", "body": "He was embraced by Republican legislators who find themselves newly energised by his bid to retake the White House.\n\nDespite pending federal charges against Mr Trump for conspiring to overturn the 2020 election, and his recent guilty verdict in an unrelated hush money trial, the Republican former president arrived emboldened as the party's presumptive nominee.\n\nHe has successfully purged the Republican Party of critics, silenced most sceptics and enticed once-critical legislators aboard his MAGA-fuelled campaign.\n\nA packed room of House of Representatives Republicans sang Happy Birthday to Mr Trump in a private breakfast meeting at Republican Party campaign headquarters across the street from the Capitol.\n\nThe legislators gave him a baseball and bat from the annual congressional game.\n\nMr Trump bragged that even his telephone rallies for legislators could draw bigger crowds than mega-popstar Taylor Swift, who has yet to make any endorsement.\n\n\"There's tremendous unity in the Republican Party,\" Mr Trump said in brief remarks later at Senate Republican Party headquarters.\n\nMr Trump spent about an hour each with House and Senate Republicans delivering free-wheeling remarks, fielding questions and discussing issues - including Russia and immigration, tax cuts and other priorities for a potential second term.\n\nDuring the morning session, Mr Trump said he thinks House speaker Mike Johnson is doing a \"terrific job\", according to a Republican in the private breakfast meeting.\n\nMr Trump asked Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, the speaker's chief Republican critic, if she was being \"nice\" to Mr Johnson, another Republican said.\n\n\"President Trump brought an extraordinary amount of energy, excitement and enthusiasm this morning,\" Mr Johnson said afterwards, noting high fundraising tallies since the guilty verdict.\n\n\"We're feeling good.\"\n\nThe Republican speaker had demurred earlier over whether he has asked Mr Trump to respect the peaceful transfer of presidential power and commit to not doing another January 6.\n\nHe said: \"Of course he respects that, we all do, and we've all talked about it, ad nauseum.\"\n\nThursday afternoon offered the first encounter in years between Mr Trump and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who once blamed Mr Trump for the \"disgraceful\" attack that he called an \"insurrection\" but now endorses the party's presumptive nominee.\n\nMr McConnell said Mr Trump received standing ovations from the senators and the two \"had a really positive meeting\".\n\nThe senator said: \"He and I got a chance to talk a little bit, shook hands a few times.\"\n\nMany potential priorities for a new White House administration are being formulated by a constellation of outside groups, including Project 2025, laying the groundwork for executive and legislative actions, though Mr Trump has made clear he has his own agenda.\n\nOn one major controversial issue, Mr Trump told legislators that abortion rules should be left to the states and said he supported exceptions for rape, incest and to save the life of the mother, legislators said.\n\n\"Anybody who thought that this president was going to be down after the sham trial, it's only giving him even more energy,\" said Representative Tom Emmer, the Republican Party whip.\n\n\"Donald Trump is crushing this election.\"\n\nBut Mr Trump's private meetings with House and Senate Republicans so close to the Capitol were infused with the symbolism of his return as the US president who threatened the American tradition of the peaceful transfer of power.\n\n\"It's frustrating,\" said former US Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn, who made his own unsuccessful run for Congress as a Maryland Democrat in the aftermath of January 6, the day when police engaged in hand-to-hand fighting to stop Trump supporters who stormed the building in an effort to overturn Joe Biden's election.\n\nMr Dunn spoke of the \"irony\" of Mr Trump returning to the area and legislators now embracing him.\n\n\"It just shows the lack of backbone they have when they're truly putting party and person over country,\" he said.\n\n\"And it's sad.\"\n\nMr Biden was overseas on Thursday attending a summit of the Group of Seven leading industrialised nations, but the president's campaign unveiled a new ad blaming Mr Trump for lighting the \"fire\" of January 6 and threatening democracy.", "source": {"uri": "ayradvertiser.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Ayr Advertiser"},

So, we're like one team/one vision, and I think that'll be largely what we talk about,\" Republican Senator Thom Tillis told reporters.\n\nRepublicans hope to see Trump defeat Biden, extend their current razor-thin 218-213 majority in the House and take control of a Senate that Democrats currently lead 51-49.\n\nOLD GRIEVANCES\n\nBut the visit has also put a spotlight on longstanding tensions between Trump and members of Congress, including Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who has not spoken to the former president since he acknowledged Biden's election victory in December 2020. Trump's false claims that his defeat was the result of fraud inspired the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.\n\nDespite their differences, the Kentucky Republican emphasized his support for Trump's candidacy. \"I support him. He's earned the nomination by the voters all across the country. And of course, I'll be at the meeting,\" McConnell told reporters on Wednesday.\n\nOthers, including moderates such as Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowksi and Mitt Romney, will not attend, citing scheduling conflicts.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson met with Senate Republicans over lunch on Wednesday to talk about how a united Republican government could use a parliamentary vehicle called budget reconciliation to bypass Democratic objections in the Senate.\n\n\"We have big policy changes that we'd like to enact,\" Johnson told reporters afterward. \"So, we want to make the most use of that and be coordinated between the two chambers.\"\n\nA main focus for House and Senate Republicans will be making permanent tax cuts under Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that will otherwise expire next year.\n\nLawmakers also expect to discuss their plans around spending for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 and how to handle the looming Jan. 1 deadline to raise or suspend the nation's debt ceiling. Brinkmanship around debt-ceiling deadlines has spooked financial markets in the past.\n\nHouse Republican centrists also hope Trump will persuade hardline conservatives who ousted former Speaker Kevin McCarthy in October, sought to oust Johnson last month and have blocked their own party's legislation over the past year, to get in line with the rest of the conference.\n\n\"The president has an opportunity to reaffirm to the members of our conference how important it is to stick together,\" said U.S. Representative Anthony D'Esposito. \"Our success will be depend on us sticking together as Republicans.\"\n\n(Reporting by David Morgan; Editing by Scott Malone and Lincoln Feast.)", "source": {"uri": "usnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "U.S. News & World Report"}, "authors": [],

Elise Stefanik advised lawmakers early Tuesday of the upcoming meeting with Trump.", "source": {"uri": "messenger-inquirer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Owensboro Messenger-Inquirer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "lisa_mascaro@messenger-inquirer.com", "name": "Lisa Mascaro", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elise_Stefanik", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elise Stefanik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Residential", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Residential", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice_and_Guides", "label": "dmoz/Health/Fitness/Advice and Guides", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Conferences", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/messenger-inquirer.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/cf/0cfdfec7-8979-50bc-a073-a8f14491f142/665a529abf6fb.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C125&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9641178", "eventUri": "eng-9641178", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 160, "relevance": 1}

Some protesters held signs calling Republicans \"boot licker\" and warned them \"don't drink the Kool-Aid.\" Other protesters from Code Pink, a radical anti-war group, protested US support for Israel and called on ending support for its war on Hamas that has killed more than 35,000 people.\n\nThe meeting is part of a full day for Trump in Washingtonm. After the meeting, he will stick around in Washington where he is expected to record an appearance on social media star Logan Paul's podcast.\n\nTrump is also set to address a gathering of CEOs this afternoon, as he continues his trend of explicitly offering to enact or dismantle policies to benefit major donors. Afterward, he will meet with Senate Republicans, though some of his biggest critics in the Senate GOP conference will not attend.\n\nBut Republicans seemed unbothered about despite the fact that last month, a jury in Manhattan found Trump guilty on 34 counts of falsifying business records as part of a conspiracy to corruptly influence the 2016 presidential election.\n\nMany Republicans expressed optimism after their meeting with him.\n\n\"Talked about the border, talked about the crazy inflation rate, things that we need to fix,\" House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan told The Independent.\n\nRepublicans said that Trump spoke about numerous subjects ranging from helping Republicans down ballot, to abortion to the war in Ukraine.\n\n\"He talked about exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother,\" Representative Nancy Mace of South Carolina told The Independent. Mace, who previously criticized Trump for his actions on January 6, received his endorsement ahead of her primary on Tuesday, which propelled her to victory despite her vote to eject Kevin McCarthy as speaker last year.\n\nMace has previously expressed concern that Republicans' messaging on abortion would repel female voters.\n\n\"He talked about, 'it's in the people's hands now, and that we have to speak about abortion correctly,' which is a message that the party needs to hear,\" she told The Independent.\n\nRepublicans have a razor-thin majority in the House of Representatives, with 17 Republicans hailing from seats that voted for President Joe Biden. The direction of the House could easily hinge on how voters decide the presidential race.\n\nBut Representative Marc Molinaro of New York, a Biden district Republican, did not seem concerned going into the meeting with Trump, noting how his district voted for Trump in 2016.\n\n\"I am exceptionally tied to the people that I represent,\" Molinaro told The Independent. \"So if President Trump's going to deliver to make it easier for the people of upstate New York, then that will be better than what they've been experiencing these last four years.\"\n\nRepresentative Matt Gaetz of Florida, one of Trump's strongest allies in the House, told The Independent that Trump would be a boost for Republicans on the ticket.\n\n\"President Trump talked about his specific strategies he was going to use to ensure that Trump voters show up in November and that they go all the way down the ticket,\" he said. \"He was there to really let Republicans know that he was there to elect big majorities in the House and the Senate and that he thought that would be essential to getting his agenda accomplished.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden's campaign denounced Trump's visit, with Representative Bennie Thompson, who served as the chairman of the House select committee that investigated the January 6 riot, putting out a statement.\n\n\"Since January 6th, Donald Trump, a twice-impeached convicted felon, has repeatedly doubled down on his disrespect for the rule of law and continues to sow hate and division,\" Thompson said. \"He still presents the same dire threat to our democracy that he did three years ago -- and he'd be wise to head back to Mar-a-Lago and await his sentencing.\"\n\nRepresentative Madeleine Dean of Pennsylvania served as an manager for Trump's second impeachment, which was related to the January 6 riot.\n\n\"Every one of themselves has given over their soul their credibility in service of one man who is a criminal,\" she told The Independent outside of the Capitol Hill Club.", "source": {"uri": "ca.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type":

Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said he was disappointed in his Senate GOP colleagues for meeting with former President Trump on Thursday, calling Trump a \"danger to American democracy.\"\n\n\"I just get sick thinking about my Republican colleagues in the Senate, many of whom I consider to be friends, many of whom I know that support American democracy, watching them get behind this candidate that they know to be a danger to American democracy,\" Murphy said in a CNN interview.\n\nTrump met with House Republicans on Thursday morning, in what Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) described as a \"pep rally,\" and was meeting with Senate Republicans in the afternoon.\n\nIt marks the first time Trump has traveled to Capitol Hill since the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot and also comes as GOP members rally behind the former president two weeks after his conviction on 34 felony counts in his hush money trial in New York.\n\nFor their part, Republicans in both chambers have started to plot an ambitious agenda if Trump is reelected in November and they control both the House and Senate starting next year.\n\nMurphy maintained Thursday that Trump is \"openly endorsing violence in our politics\" and said the former president's rhetoric makes him concerned about the future, including a scenario where President Biden wins election again but Trump supporters protest the results.\n\n\"I'm deeply worried about what happens if Joe Biden wins the election,\" Murphy said.\n\nRep. Mark Amodei (R-Nev.) said the feeling in the House meeting Thursday morning was less of a policy discussion and more of encouraging members to \"vote with the team,\" adding there were multiple standing ovations for the former president.\n\nTrump also emphasized the importance of the abortion rights issue for the 2024 election, multiple sources in the House meeting told The Hill. The former president said that exceptions to abortion bans are necessary, and that the issue is too important to ignore this fall.\n\nHis meeting with Senate Republicans on Thursday afternoon marks the first time he and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) will be in the same room since late 2020, with the pair since having a tense relationship.\n\nBoth meetings featured Republicans considered to be on the shortlist to be Trump's vice presidential pick, including Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) and Reps. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.) and Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), among others.\n\nCopyright 2024 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

It also offered a preview of how Mr. Trump could leverage those ties in a second presidential term to enact major policy changes.\n\n\"You don't put the cart before the horse, but you do have to be prepared to lead,\" said House Speaker Mike Johnson in response to a question from the Monitor on the eve of Mr. Trump's visit. Mr. Johnson is bullish on Republicans retaining the House and winning both the Senate and White House, though polls show a less certain outlook. \"When you have unified government like that, it comes with great responsibility, and I look forward to those days and fixing lots and lots of things.\"\n\nComing out of their morning meeting at the Capitol Hill Club just off campus, House Republicans said the mood was upbeat, with a focus on unity and reinforcing \"some backbone,\" as fiscal conservative Tim Burchett of Tennessee put it.\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, who threw the GOP into disarray last fall when he led the ouster of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, said Mr. Trump's main message was the need to be unified as a party.\n\n\"President Trump ... made it very clear it's not just about his victory,\" said Mr. Gaetz. \"It's also about ensuring large majorities in the House and Senate.\"\n\nMr. Trump's visits with congressional Republicans, while in town for a meeting with CEOs at a Business Roundtable event, follow on the heels of his conviction last month for falsifying business records in a hush-money scheme. The trial was based on untested legal theories, which added to GOP concerns about the politicization of the justice system.\n\nCritics say Mr. Trump's visit is a crass attempt to get congressional Republicans to inappropriately intervene in his legal troubles, including by promoting a bill to move state court cases involving a president to federal court.\n\nFor their part, congressional Republicans frame the visit as part rallying the troops ahead of the election and part laying the groundwork for a strong start to a Trump 2.0 presidency. That would contrast with his first term, when he reportedly was not expecting to win, had few relationships in Washington, and got off to a chaotic start.\n\n\"We're going to see definitely a far more honed approach\" in a second Trump presidency, says Rep. William Timmons of South Carolina. \"He's going to have just a lot more alignment with Republicans in Congress.\"\n\nEndorsed by Mr. Trump, Representative Timmons this week narrowly fended off an effort by the right-wing House Freedom Caucus to unseat him in the South Carolina primary. Mr. Timmons is one of many Republicans who owes their seat in Congress in part to a Trump endorsement. And the congressman's victory is one of numerous recent examples where Mr. Trump's intervention muted the influence of hardliners, including Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's failed effort to replace Mr. Johnson as speaker just six months after the House ousted his predecessor, Kevin McCarthy.\n\nMr. Trump has perturbed even supporters with his withering attacks on social media, garnering a reputation as mercurial, callous, and demanding loyalty - and exacting revenge on those who defy him.\n\nHis resources and sway with voters have made it hard for Republicans to stand up to him; only two of the 10 House members who voted to impeach him remain in Congress. Those who criticize him rarely do so publicly.\n\nBut Mr. Trump also has had many consistent, vocal supporters. Numerous Republicans interviewed for this piece painted a different picture of the former president as personable, generous with his time, and tolerant of more dissent than he is credited with.\n\n\"President Trump welcomed rank-and-file House Republicans in the Oval Office and the White House, on Air Force One, and the limo,\" says Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana, adding that as a newer member of Congress, he got calls from the president \"all the time\" and was invited to Camp David. When in 2021-22 he led the Republican Study Committee, a conservative policy group, he would bring members to visit the former president at his various estates. Such visits, together with his political endorsements, will yield dividends in a second term, says Mr. Banks.\n\n\"President Trump welcomed everybody, and it paid off in a big way for him back then. I think it's going to pay off in an even bigger way this time,\" he says. \"Our party is unified behind him in a way that I think speaks volumes.\"\n\nSome critics have raised concerns that Mr. Trump's cultivation of more allies on the Hill could result in a GOP Congress that would essentially rubber stamp Trump policies if he were to retake the White House - policies that many Democrats warn could be more extreme.\n\nAnd indeed, earlier this year he was blamed for torpedoing the bipartisan border bill negotiated by conservative Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford along with Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, an independent, and Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat.\n\nIt's normal for any new president to press their party's members of Congress to support key policies, and those members usually comply so as not to undercut the president, says Kevin Kosar, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.\n\nBut, he adds, \"A party is a party. It's not a cult.\"\n\nOpponents have in fact accused Mr. Trump, who values loyalty, of in fact turning the GOP into a personality cult. But Republicans say there's a misperception that he demands that people be in lockstep with him.\n\n\"He actually can look past a lot of disagreement,\" says Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, who also benefited from a Trump endorsement.\n\nThat was the case for GOP House Rep. Debbie Lesko of Arizona. Soon after being elected, she was part of a group whom Mr. Trump invited to the White House to encourage them to vote for a GOP immigration bill. But despite it being her first time speaking with the president, she told him her constituents wouldn't support it.\n\nShe worried he would tweet against her. \"But as it turned out,\" she says, \"he likes fighters and people that speak their minds.\"\n\nWhen he faced impeachment the next year, he selected her to serve on his impeachment defense team.\n\nSen. Susan Collins of Maine was among seven GOP senators who voted to convict Mr. Trump in his second impeachment after Jan. 6. But she pushes back on concerns that the former president has inculcated a reflexive loyalty among congressional Republicans through his endorsements.\n\n\"It's natural that those individuals would feel a sense of gratitude,\" she says. But \"it doesn't mean that they're going to ask, 'How high?' when he says, 'Jump.'\"", "source": {"uri": "csmonitor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Christian Science Monitor"}, "authors":

David Valadao of California.\n\n\"I never loved him,\" Trump said of Valadao, according to a GOP member.\n\nAs a number of House Republicans find themselves in competitive primary races, the former president said he wanted to do tele-town halls, but acknowledged his help would not be welcomed by some, given that he had endorsed their primary opponents.\n\nTrump did not shy away from acknowledging the bad blood between House Speaker Mike Johnson and GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who unsuccessfully tried to oust Johnson against Trump's wishes. The former president playfully asked Greene, a staunch ally of his who he strongly supports, to be nice to the speaker.\n\n\"He's always so sweet, recognizing me, and he said 'are you being nice to Speaker Johnson?' He was joking. And I said 'eh,'\" as she gestured with her hands. \"He said 'OK be nice to him' and I nodded my head,\" she added.\n\nJohnson, after the meeting, said the former president told him that he was doing \"a very good job\" and that he plans to be \"fully prepared\" to implement Trump's plans if he wins in November.\n\nThe former president's conviction also hung heavy over Thursday's meeting.\n\nTrump's allies on Capitol Hill immediately sprung into action following the guilty verdict -proposing to defund the Department of Justice and even shut down the government. House Republicans voted to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt of Congress on Wednesday. And one legislative proposal Republican leaders are now actively pursuing is a bill that would allow current and former presidents to move state-level cases to federal court. The legislation passed out of committee last September, but GOP leaders only started formally whipping the bill this week - on the eve of Trump's Capitol Hill visit and two weeks after his conviction.\n\nIn his meeting with GOP lawmakers, Trump called the Department of Justice \"dirty no good bastards,\" according to another source in the room.\n\nGOP Rep. Kevin Hern of Oklahoma said the former president expressed he was \"gravely concerned\" about the federal government being weaponized.\n\nIn a news conference after the meeting, House Majority Whip Tom Emmer said that the former president's felony convictions have only energized the party that will propel them to victory in November.\n\n\"Anybody who thought that this President was going to be down after the sham trial, after that crooked trial that we saw in New York, I think, again, it's only given him even more energy,\" Emmer said. \"And what he did for us upstairs just now is, he showed us that energy and he showed us that positive outlook, despite all the garbage they've been throwing at him with their lawfare and their nonsense.\"\n\nTrump had a direct message for House Republicans on how to approach abortion leading into November, an issue Republicans have struggled to unify around in the wake of Roe v. Wade being overturned.\n\nJohnson relayed that Trump told the group to \"exercise your own conscience to talk about it, share your conviction, and do that in a way that makes sense to people. And I think he had made a good point.\"\n\nTrump, in a low voice, advised Republicans to not be afraid of the issue, according to sources in room, and claimed that Democrats are the extreme ones on the topic. He called on Republicans to follow their convictions but cautioned how they address the matter on the campaign trail and advocated for exceptions.\n\n\"He talked and pushed for exceptions for rape, life of the mother and incest. He talked about the way that we need to talk about it, quote correctly, his words, not mine,\" GOP Rep. Nancy Mace told CNN. \"And I really appreciated his comments as a woman, as a suburban mom.\"\n\nTrump also talked about how Roe v. Wade finally put the decision to the states as they always wanted, though he noted some of them made \"not so good\" decisions.\n\n\"But like Ronald Reagan, you have to have three choices: life of mother, rape and incest you have to do, but you have to follow your own heart,\" Trump said, according to a source in the room.\n\nTrump's message came as the Supreme Court rejected a lawsuit challenging the Food and Drug Administration's approach to regulating the abortion pill mifepristone with a ruling that will continue to allow the pills to be mailed to patients without an in-person doctor's visit.\n\nThe former president also ticked through a handful of other priorities, including his proposal to eliminate taxes on tips, building the southern border, and halting further aid for Ukraine, even though a number of lawmakers in his party support it.\n\nThere were a number of moments where the former president went off topic.\n\nAs Trump was ranting about crime rates and so-called election integrity issues, the former president called Milwaukee - where Republicans are holding their convention this summer - \"horrible,\" according to a source in the room.\n\nRep. Derrick Van Orden, a Wisconsin Republican who was in the room, made clear to CNN that Trump was \"specifically referring to crime in Milwaukee\" and not the city itself.\n\nIn one bizarre moment, Trump called Pelosi's daughter a \"wacko\" and then claimed her daughter once told him that he and the former House speaker would have had a \"great romance\" in another life, according to a lawmaker in the room..\n\nIn response to Trump's comments, one of Pelosi's daughters posted on X: \"speaking for all 4 Pelosi daughters -- this is a LIE. His deceitful, deranged obsession with our mother is yet another reason Donald Trump is unwell, unhinged and unfit to step foot anywhere near her -- or the White House.\"\n\nHe also questioned why popstar Taylor Swift would support President Joe Biden over him, whom he referred to as a \"dope.\"\n\n\"Why would she endorse this dope,\" Trump said, according to a member in the room. \"He doesn't know how to get off a stage.\"\n\nThe former president even said at one point of Hannibal Lecter: \"nNice guy ... he even had a friend over for dinner.\"\n\nAt the start of the meeting, House Republicans sang happy birthday to the former president, whose birthday is Friday, and presented him with the game ball and bat from the congressional baseball game that Republican won on Wednesday, according to a source in the room.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

Milwaukee ... deserves better than a convicted felon, racist, and wannabe dictator who hates us and our values.\"\n\nAnd another explanation has emerged as to why Trump said what he reportedly did:\n\nOthers shouted out \"bootlicker\" and \"don't drink the Kool-Aid.\"\n\nAnother protester in a bear costume held up a sign reading \"bigger tax breaks, bigger profit.\"\n\nAlex Woodward reports:\n\nTrump's MAGA allies forced to face heckling protesters before meeting ex-president\n\nA man's attempt to trademark the phrase \"TRUMP TOO SMALL\" has run its course after the Supreme Court ruled that the law protecting individuals from having their name trademarked without their consent does not violate the First Amendment.\n\nIn a unanimous decision on Thursday, Justice Clarence Thomas said the law restricting the trademarking of names reflects the, \"historic rationale of identifying the source of goods\" to ensure \"customers know the source of a product\".\n\n\"A party has no First Amendment right to piggyback off the goodwill another entity has built in its name,\" Justice Thomas added.\n\nAriana Baio has the full story:\n\nHands off: 'Trump too small' can't be trademarked, Supreme Court rules\n\n16:55 , Oliver O'Connell\n\nAfter Donald Trump reportedly called Milwaukee \"a horrible city,\" Democratic National Committee Rapid Response Director Alex Floyd released the following statement:\n\nDonald Trump and the RNC haven't even bothered to set up a real campaign operation in Wisconsin -- they'd rather stick to telling voters how much they hate the city they chose to hold their convention in. Let's be clear: Milwaukee is not a horrible city -- and Wisconsinites should remember what Donald Trump thinks of them when they vote in November.\n\nDavid Urban, who advised the former president's 2016 and 2020 campaigns, told CNN's Erica Hill on Wednesday that President Joe Biden's stance on pardoning his son versus commutating a potential sentence was \"all too cute by half.\"\n\nAriana Baio has the story:\n\nEx-adviser says Trump should pardon Hunter Biden if he's elected\n\n16:34 , Oliver O'Connell\n\nWe've already seen how the Biden campaign has reacted to Donald Trump's return to Capitol Hill with the release of a new ad:\n\nBiden campaign says Trump 'ready to burn it all down' as he returns to Capitol Hill\n\nBut here's how Democrat members of Congress feel:\n\nStatement From Former January 6 Select Committee Chairman Congressman Bennie Thompson (D-MS) on Trump's Return to Capitol Hill\n\nAfter inciting a deadly insurrection that defiled the halls of Congress, how dare Trump show his face on these grounds? Congressional Republicans allow him to waltz in here when it's known he has no regard for democracy. Since January 6th, Donald Trump, a twice-impeached convicted felon, has repeatedly doubled down on his disrespect for the rule of law and continues to sow hate and division. He still presents the same dire threat to our democracy that he did three years ago -- and he'd be wise to head back to Mar-a-Lago and await his sentencing.\n\nMeanwhile, Rep Eric Swalwell went on CNN and said: \"The House Speaker runs a law firm. They only have one client, but it's a pretty big firm. And they work every day on behalf of that client -- Donald Trump.\"\n\nDonald Trump's busy day in DC will also include an address to some of the world's most powerful corporate leaders - although there will be some notable absences in the audience.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's chief of staff Jeff Zients will also speak to the Business Roundtable in DC in Biden's place, while he attends the G7 meeting in Italy.\n\nApproximately 100 chief executives will attend the meeting, according to a spokesperson for the group, which holds quarterly meetings in Washington.\n\nCNBC yesterday asked companies listed as members of the group whether their CEOs planned to attend.\n\nOnly 17 responded to the network, with four saying they would attend: JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon; Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, and the CEO of Edison International Pedro Pizarro.\n\nAnother 13 of them said their CEOs will not be going to see Trump and Zients speak, including Blackstone CEO and Trump ally Steve Schwarzman; Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon; Steelcase CEO Sara Armbruster, ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods; Delta CEO Ed Bastian; Morgan Stanley CEO Ted Pick and the company's executive chairman James Gorman; and Lynn Good, the CEO of Duke Energy.\n\nSome have travel conflicts (Armbruster, Good, and Solomon) while BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella are reportedly at the G7 summit.\n\nDonald Trump didn't bring up Israel in his remarks to the House GOP according to Rep Michael McCaul, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.\n\n16:05 , Oliver O'Connell\n\nThis could have been eclipsed as one of Trump's weirdest remarks by the sharks and batteries anecdote in his Las Vegas speech but he has apparently brought it back...\n\nThis is awkward. Don't Republicans need to win Wisconsin?\n\n15:39 , Oliver O'Connell\n\nTrump reportedly took a question on migrants already in the US and again pushed his plan for mass deportations.\n\n15:36 , Oliver O'Connell\n\nOne of the daughters of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has responded to Donald Trump's bizarre claim to Republican members of the House about their mother.\n\nJake Sherman of Punchbowl News reports that Trump told GOP lawmakers: \"Nancy Pelosi's daughter is a whacko, her daughter told me if things were different Nancy and I would be perfect together, there's an age difference though.\"\n\nChristine Pelosi posted in response: \"Speaking for all 4 Pelosi daughters -- this is a LIE. His deceitful, deranged obsession with our mother is yet another reason Donald Trump is unwell, unhinged and unfit to step foot anywhere near her -- or the White House.\"\n\n15:30 , Oliver O'Connell\n\nDonald Trump has filed a motion to have the limited gag order in his falsifying records case lifted now that a verdict has been handed down by the jury, finding him guilty of all 34 counts.\n\nThe former president argues that his rivals can speak about the case and the verdict during campaigning while he is not, and the first presidential debate is just two weeks away.\n\nAttorneys for Trump argued in a 21-page filing made public on Wednesday that the former president is being attacked from all sides, including by two of the witnesses who testified against him -- Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels -- and he is specifically not allowed to talk about them.\n\nNew York Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan issued the gag order before the start of the six-week criminal trial, citing safety concerns for court staff, witnesses, the jury, and their families.\n\nTrump and his attorneys argued throughout the trial that his rights were being trampled on, though the former president often incorrectly characterized the extent of the order -- at one point claiming it didn't allow him to testify, which was not true.\n\n\"President Trump's opponents and adversaries are using the Gag Order as a political sword to attack President Trump with reference to this case, on the understanding that his ability to mount a detailed response is severely restricted by the Gag Order,\" Trump lawyers Todd Blanche and Emil Bove wrote in the motion.\n\nHere's our coverage of their initial letter to the judge asking for the removal of the gag:\n\nTrump lawyers ask New York judge to lift hush money trial gag order\n\nIn light of today's Logan Paul interview, here's Indy100's Catherine Shuttleworth on the Republican's long association with the world of wrestling, whose trash-talking culture he surely learned a trick or two from.\n\nWe'll try and make sense of them and bring you more as they come in...\n\n15:00 , Oliver O'Connell\n\nThe State of Georgia has filed a motion to dismiss an appeal by Donald Trump and his co-defendants in the Fulton County 2020 election subversion case on the ruling that allows District Attorney Fani Willis to remain on the case.\n\nTrump and his co-accused have fought hard to have Willis removed from the case over her affair with colleague and lead prosecutor Nathan Wade. After a contentious hearing in February and March, Judge Scott McAfee ruled that while Willis could continue to prosecute the case, Wade would have to resign, which he did.\n\nYou can read the full filing on the motion to dismiss Trump's appeal of the ruling here.\n\nLast night, Wade spoke with CNN's Kaitlan Collins about his removal from prosecuting the former president:\n\nNathan Wade defends Fani Willis affair during CNN interview that talked Trump case\n\nHere's our coverage of Willis accepting Wade's resignation in March:\n\nFani Willis accepts Wade's resignation stressing the stakes of Trump's Georgia case\n\nHere's Michelle Del Rey to tell us who is being briefed against as our man prepares to name his new sidekick at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee next month.\n\nThis top Trump veep candidate's 'extremely unlikely' to get picked\n\nTrump is surely waaay too petty and nowhere near magnanimous enough to do this, isn't he?\n\nNevertheless, former Trump campaign aide David Urban suggested as much on CNN's Out Front with Erin Burnett last night, telling the host:\n\n\"Listen, what I'd like to see happen is I'd like to see President Trump come out with a statement saying, 'Look, if Hunter Biden commits to a program of sobriety, inpatient or maybe outpatient, shows up, keeps his sobriety, I'll pardon him.\n\n\"I'd love for President Trump to say that. It would be a magnanimous offer on his part, shows humanity and, and really flip the tables on the Democrats.\"\n\n14:00 , Joe Sommerlad\n\nA day after CNN called out Fox's hypocrisy over the Trump and Hunter Biden verdicts, here's JD Vance and Laura Ingraham ably demonstrating precisely what Abby Phillip was talking about.\n\nThis was also pretty brazen from \"Judge\" Jeanine Pirro.\n\n13:45 , Joe Sommerlad\n\nTrump opened up a marginal two percentage point lead over Joe Biden this week in the race for the White House, according to a new Reuters/Ipsos poll, as voters consider the recent criminal convictions of both the Republican candidate and the president's son Hunter Biden.\n\nAn estimated 41 per cent of registered voters in the two-day poll, which closed on Tuesday, said they would vote for Trump if the election were held today, while 39 per cent opted for the Democratic incumbent.\n\nSome 20 per cent of voters said they remained undecided, were leaning toward third-party options or might not vote at all on November 5.\n\n13:30 , Joe Sommerlad\n\nThe Republican was so angry when the guilty verdict was read aloud at his New York hush money trial last month that he was heard afterwards subjecting Mike Johnson, the speaker of the House of Representatives, to a foul-mouthed rant by phone, according to a new report.\n\nPolitico's Playbook newsletter recounts that the GOP presidential contender was overheard \"dropping frequent F-bombs\" in his call with Johnson on May 30 as he told the speaker: \"We have to overturn this.\"\n\nHere's our report.\n\nTrump 'demanded House speaker help him overturn conviction' in foul-mouthed call\n\n13:15 , Joe Sommerlad\n\nA fundraising email blast from the chief political action committees supporting Trump shared a troubling new message yesterday: \"Haul out the guillotine.\"\n\nThe email went on to blast \"sicko\" Kathy Griffin for her 2017 image holding a mock-severed Trump head and instead accused his Democratic rivals of wanting to behead him.\n\n\"The SAD and HORRIFIC TRUTH is that this is STILL the Sick Dream of every Trump-Deranged lunatic out there!\" the message says.\n\n\"And it's not just me they want gone, THEY'RE REALLY COMING AFTER YOU!

Just under 3 in 10 disapprove of the conviction, according to newly released polling by AP-NORC.\n\nThe public is closely divided on whether his conviction by a Manhattan jury was motivated by politics.\n\nPeople are more likely to say Trump's conviction benefits President Biden's campaign than the Trump 2024 campaign. There is little consensus on whether the first conviction of a former president is a positive or a negative for either the country's democratic system or the country as a whole.\n\nA large portion of the country is paying attention to Trump's conviction. Eighty per cent of adults report reading or hearing at least something about the felony convictions, including 43 per cent who say they've read or heard a lot. Just 4 per cent report they haven't been attending to the news at all. Partisans on both sides of the aisle are more likely to be paying attention to the conviction than independents.\n\nOpinions about Trump's conviction are highly influenced by partisanship. Most Republicans disapprove of his conviction and consider it to be driven by politics. Democrats tend to approve of the conviction and disagree that there were any political motivations. About half of independents lack an opinion and say they neither approve nor disapprove of the conviction.\n\nWednesday 12 June 2024 17:20 , AP\n\nThe White House is not ruling out a potential commutation for Hunter Biden, the president's son who was convicted on three federal gun crimes.\n\n\"As we all know, the sentencing hasn't even been scheduled yet,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Wednesday on Air Force One as President Joe Biden traveled to the Group of Seven summit in Italy.\n\nShe said she has not spoken to the president about the issue since the verdict was delivered Tuesday.\n\nBiden definitively ruled out pardoning his son during an ABC News interview last week.\n\n\"He was very clear, very upfront, obviously very definitive,\" Jean-Pierre said of the president's remarks about a potential pardon. But on a commutation, \"I just don't have anything beyond that.\"\n\nHunter Biden was convicted of lying on a mandatory gun purchase form by saying he was not illegally using or addicted to drugs, and illegally having the gun for 11 days.\n\nThe three counts carry up to 25 years in prison. But whether the president's son actually serves any time behind bars will be up to US District Judge Maryellen Noreika. The judge, who was nominated to the bench by former Republican President Donald Trump, didn't immediately set a date for sentencing.\n\nWednesday 12 June 2024 17:10 , Oliver O'Connell\n\nSenator Susan Collins of Maine say she won't be attending the meeting between Senate Republicans and Donald Trump on Thursday.\n\nNBC News reports that she says: \"I have a conflict.\"\n\nAsked if she would attend if she did not have a conflict, she replies: \"I don't really see a purpose for my going, but I truly do have a conflict.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the district attorney's office confirmed to The Independent Tuesday that Bragg and Assistant District Attorney Matthew Colangelo have agreed to \"voluntarily appear\" before the House Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government on July 12.\n\n\"The Manhattan DA's Office is proud to play a crucial role in upholding and enforcing the rule of law for the people of New York,\" a spokesperson for the office said in a statement shared with The Independent.\n\nAlex Woodward filed this report:\n\nAlvin Bragg set to be dragged to the Hill one day after Trump's sentencing\n\nWednesday 12 June 2024 16:30 , Oliver O'Connell\n\nAt this morning's House Republican press conference, Speaker Mike Johnson was asked about the importance of Attorney General Merrick Garland complying with a congressional subpoena versus Republican members declining to appear before the January 6 committee while under subpoena.\n\nHe was also asked about Donald Trump's first visit to the US Capitol since his supporters attacked Congress on January 6, 2021, and whether he had spoken with the former president about respecting the peaceful transfer of power.\n\nRepublican Representative Ralph Norman reprimanded his Democratic colleague Jerry Nadler after he interrupted to correct him about Donald Trump's conviction during a House Rules Committee meeting on Tuesday.\n\n\"They bring up the trial of Donald Trump, a convicted felony. Really? By a judge that is a known anti-Trumper,\" Norman said.\n\nAt that moment, Nadler interrupted to correct his colleague that he was not found guilty by a judge, a lie that Trump has amplified, but rather by a jury.\n\nRepublican snaps at rival for reminding him Trump was found guilty: 'So rude!'\n\nWednesday 12 June 2024 16:00 , Oliver O'Connell\n\nDonald Trump's latest fundraising appeal has a dark twist, reading: \"HAUL OUT THE GUILLOTINE.\"\n\nIt continues: \"They want me BEHEADED after this verdict!\"\n\n\"And it's not just me they want gone, THEY'RE REALLY COMING AFTER YOU!\"\n\nThe email to supporters is referencing the viral photo of comedian Kathy Griffin holding Trump's severed head that got her canceled in his first term in office.\n\nThere have been no calls for a beheading and Trump is unlikely to even get a prison sentence at his sentencing on July 11.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Party leaders say they want to work in \"close coordination\" with a possible Trump administration in the future that will keep the party united on all fronts.\n\n\"I believe President Trump in his second term, which I believe he will have, to be the most consequential president of the modern era because we have to fix effectively every area of public policy,\" Johnson said on Wednesday. \"I think when he comes in, we've got to have a very aggressive 'First 100 Days' agenda. The first year will be important. I think we cannot waste a moment because there's so many things to do. So in light of that, we're having a discussion this week.\"\n\nRank-and-file members say they were looking forward to speaking with the president, especially as the party has experienced bouts of division on issues such as government spending and foreign aid. However, lawmakers say Trump's presence on the Hill, his first trip to Capitol Hill since the Jan. 6 attack, will be crucial to uniting the GOP as it looks to defend its slim majority in November.\n\nTrump is scheduled to meet with House Republicans at the Capitol Hill Club in the morning ahead of a meeting with Republican senators at the National Republican Senatorial Committee headquarters in the afternoon. The meetings with Trump come as lawmakers are looking to the former president to dictate their strategy.\n\n\"He should come in here and say, 'I am the nominee,' as he is. And if we want to get the White House back, we got to remain united. Let the American people know that we are in charge of the House of Representatives,\" Rep. Troy Nehls (R-TX), a staunch supporter of the former president, said. \"Some of the squabbling that we have, I think, has really kind of damaged our party up here. I think it's all about unity, and I think Donald Trump can bring that unity.\"\n\n\"I think Trump will lay out a vision for the country,\" Rep. Ralph Norman (R-SC) said. \"I hope he tells us specifically how we can help.\"\n\nBut Trump's presence amid several competitive House primaries could also pull at some loose threads among lawmakers, especially as some members have gotten involved with their colleagues' primaries, particularly Freedom Caucus Chairman Bob Good (R-VA).\n\nGood faces a tough primary challenge next week against challenger state Rep. John McGuire, whom Trump has endorsed. The former president has even gone so far as to say Good is \"BAD FOR VIRGINIA AND BAD FOR THE USA.\"\n\nThat discourse could make for an awkward and possibly tense meeting with Good and other House Republicans who have publicly backed his reelection.\n\nWhen asked about the meeting, Good told the Washington Examiner he would not comment on Trump's trip to the Capitol. Pressed about whether he would be in attendance, Good simply said, \"I don't have any comment about his visit.\"\n\nGood's office later clarified to say he would be in attendance, with the Virginia Republican telling the Washington Examiner in a statement, \"I will be in attendance to listen to what our presumptive nominee and the effective leader of our party has to say.\"\n\nSome Republicans rejected the idea that Trump's comments could cause tension among Republicans as they look to unite ahead of the 2024 election, noting lawmakers cannot take primary challenges too seriously.\n\n\"It's a big boy sport,\" Nehls said.\n\n\"I don't think President Trump even cares,\" Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) told the Washington Examiner.\n\nOther lawmakers who endorsed candidates challenging Trump's chosen contenders acknowledged the disparity but argued it would not cause problems in working with the former president.\n\n\"I trust Trump's judgment. He can make whatever call he wants for who endorses,\" Norman, who endorsed Adam Morgan in his challenge to Rep. William Timmons (R-SC) in South Carolina's primary this week, said. Timmons defeated Morgan by 3 points.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\n\"A lot of people he endorsed, though, in South Carolina are working against him,\" Norman said. \"And I think that hurts him. But he's a free agent -- we all are -- and his track record is pretty good.\"\n\nThe planned visit comes as Trump prepares to make the rounds with GOP lawmakers in Washington, D.C., this week, including a meeting with Republican senators on Thursday afternoon. The former president will then meet with Johnson again in Mar-a-Lago on Monday, along with National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Richard Hudson (R-NC).", "source": {"uri":

So, we're like one team/one vision, and I think that'll be largely what we talk about,\" Republican senator Thom Tillis told reporters.\n\nRepublicans hope to see Mr Trump defeat Mr Biden, extend their current razor-thin 218-213 majority in the House and take control of a Senate that Democrats currently lead 51-49.\n\nBut the visit has also put a spotlight on longstanding tensions between Mr Trump and members of Congress, including Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who has not spoken to the former president since he acknowledged Mr Biden's election victory in December 2020. Mr Trump's false claims that his defeat was the result of fraud inspired the January 6th, 2021, attack on the Capitol.\n\nDespite their differences, the Kentucky Republican emphasised his support for Mr Trump's candidacy. \"I support him. He's earned the nomination by the voters all across the country. And of course, I'll be at the meeting,\" McConnell told reporters on Wednesday.\n\nOthers, including moderates such as Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski and Mitt Romney, will not attend, citing scheduling conflicts.\n\nUS House speaker Mike Johnson met with Senate Republicans over lunch on Wednesday to talk about how a united Republican government could use a parliamentary vehicle called budget reconciliation to bypass Democrats in the Senate.\n\n\"We have big policy changes that we'd like to enact,\" MrJohnson told reporters afterward. \"So, we want to make the most use of that and be coordinated between the two chambers.\"\n\nA main focus for House and Senate Republicans will be making permanent tax cuts under Mr Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that will otherwise expire next year.\n\nLawmakers also expect to discuss their spending plans for the fiscal year beginning October 1st and how to handle the looming January 1st deadline to raise or suspend the nation's debt ceiling. Brinkmanship around debt-ceiling deadlines has spooked financial markets in the past.\n\nRepublican centrists also hope Mr Trump will persuade hardline conservatives to get in line after ousting former speaker Kevin McCarthy in October, attempting to oust Mr Johnson last month and repeatedly blocking their own party's legislation over the past year.\n\n\"The president has an opportunity to reaffirm to the members of our conference how important it is to stick together,\" said US representative Anthony D'Esposito. \"Our success will be depend on us sticking together as Republicans.\"",

And of course, I will be at the meeting,\" McConnell told reporters.\n\nThursday's events are expected to be more of an effort to boost morale and ensure the party is moving in one direction ahead of the election than to drill down on specific policy proposals.\n\nBut Trump is likely to be quizzed on plans to extend the tax cuts he implemented in 2017, as well as his proposals for a tough illegal immigration crackdown and his view of the war in Ukraine.\n\nThe conflict has exposed fissures between Trump's isolationist \"America First\" movement and more traditional conservatives who want to see Russia's Vladimir Putin defeated with the help of American weapons.\n\nThe former president is also due to make his case for a White House return to chief executives at a meeting of Washington lobby group Business Roundtable.\n\nPolitical news outlet Axios quoted a source familiar with Trump's expected remarks who said the former president was likely to focus on his plan \"to immediately reduce inflation and roll back anti-business Biden regulations.\"\n\nAn election forecast model combining state and national polls with economic indicators, out Wednesday from The Economist, gives Trump a two-in-three chance of winning reelection. The same model four years ago had Biden at 83 percent.", "source": {"uri": "digitaljournal.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Digital Journal"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Some protesters held signs calling Republicans \"boot lickers\" and warned them: \"Don't drink the Kool-Aid.\" Other protesters from Code Pink, a radical anti-war group, protested US support for Israel.\n\nThe meeting is part of a full day for Trump in Washington. Afterwards, he will stick around in the city, where he is expected to record an appearance on social media star Logan Paul's podcast.\n\nTrump is also set to address a gathering of CEOs this afternoon, as he continues his trend of explicitly offering to enact or dismantle policies to benefit major donors. Afterward, he will meet with Senate Republicans, though some of his biggest critics in the Senate GOP conference will not attend.\n\nMany Republicans expressed optimism to The Independent after their morning meeting with him.\n\n\"We talked about the border, talked about the crazy inflation rate, things that we need to fix,\" House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan said.\n\nOthers said that Trump spoke about numerous subjects, ranging from helping Republicans down-ballot, to abortion, to the war in Ukraine.\n\n\"He talked about exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother,\" Representative Nancy Mace of South Carolina told The Independent. Mace, who previously criticized Trump for his actions on January 6, received his endorsement ahead of her primary on Tuesday, which propelled her to victory despite her vote to eject Kevin McCarthy as speaker last year.\n\nMace has previously expressed concern that Republicans' messaging on abortion would repel female voters.\n\n\"He talked about, 'it's in the people's hands now, and that we have to speak about abortion correctly,' which is a message that the party needs to hear,\" Mace added, in conversation with The Independent.\n\nRepublicans have a razor-thin majority in the House of Representatives, with 17 Republicans hailing from seats that voted for President Joe Biden. The direction of the House could easily hinge on how voters decide the presidential race.\n\nBut Representative Marc Molinaro of New York, a Biden district Republican, did not seem concerned going into the meeting with Trump, noting how his district voted for Trump in 2016.\n\n\"I am exceptionally tied to the people that I represent,\" Molinaro said. \"So if President Trump's going to deliver to make it easier for the people of upstate New York, then that will be better than what they've been experiencing these last four years.\"\n\nRepresentative Matt Gaetz of Florida, one of Trump's strongest allies in the House, told The Independent that Trump would be a boost for Republicans on the ticket.\n\n\"President Trump talked about his specific strategies he was going to use to ensure that Trump voters show up in November and that they go all the way down the ticket,\" he said. \"He was there to really let Republicans know that he was there to elect big majorities in the House and the Senate and that he thought that would be essential to getting his agenda accomplished.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden's campaign denounced Trump's visit.\n\nRepresentative Bennie Thompson -- who served as the chairman of the House select committee that investigated the January 6 riot -- put out a statement that read: \"Since January 6th, Donald Trump, a twice-impeached convicted felon, has repeatedly doubled down on his disrespect for the rule of law and continues to sow hate and division. He still presents the same dire threat to our democracy that he did three years ago -- and he'd be wise to head back to Mar-a-Lago and await his sentencing.\"\n\nRepublicans in attendance seemed unbothered by Trump's recent legal woes, which include being convicted of 34 charges in New York.\n\nRepresentative Madeleine Dean of Pennsylvania served as an manager for Trump's second impeachment, which was related to the January 6 riot.\n\n\"Every one of themselves has given over their soul, their credibility, in service of one man who is a criminal,\" she told The Independent outside of the Capitol Hill Club.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Mace", "type": "person", "score": 5,

Many said they would \"support but would not endorse the nominee\" when asked, conspicuously avoiding saying Trump's name. When Trump won the presidency, many Republicans -- like then-House speaker Paul Ryan -- would tell reporters they hadn't seen his tweets. And for a while after the January 6 riot, a brief moment existed where Republicans might have made Trump persona non grata.\n\nSince then, many Trump-critical Republicans have either lost their races (Liz Cheney); announced their plans to retire, as is the case with Ryan and Mitch McConnell; or have died, as John McCain did in 2018.\n\nIn their place now are Republicans far more comfortable with Trump. Instead of Ryan, House Speaker Mike Johnson, who has forged a marriage of convenience with the former president, will welcome the twice-impeached, four-times-indicted Trump to the Hill on Thursday.\n\nAhead of the summit, Johnson joined Senate Republicans to talk about a potential agenda for the first 100 days of a second Trump term. Such an outcome is looking likely these days, given that Trump is beating Biden pretty consistently in polling.\n\n\"We would want to have a very vigorous agenda and make the most use of the time [when Trump is on the Hill],\" Johnson told reporters on Wednesday.\n\nSenator John Cornyn of Texas, who is in the running to replace Mitch McConnell, didn't mince words about what he wants to hear from the former president this week: \"What's his plan to win?\" Texas looks likely to stay Republican this cycle, but Trump's takeover of the GOP, combined with the Dobbs v Jackson decision, which came as a result of Trump-nominated Supreme Court justices, has repelled the suburbs of places like Houston, Dallas and San Antonio. That puts Republicans like Cornyn and Ted Cruz in danger.\n\n\"I think we need to try to talk about what he's going to be talking about [on the campaign trail],\" Cornyn added. \"So [we can] hopefully have a unity message.\"\n\nMany other Republicans echoed those concerns about unity. Senator Chuck Grassley, who said in the past that Trump \"displayed poor leadership in his words and actions\" on January 6, had an agenda in mind.\n\n\"I think [the election will be determined by] the extent to which he emphasizes or doesn't emphasize the two biggest issues in this campaign -- open borders and inflation,\" Grassley told The Independent.\n\nGrassley received Trump's endorsement ahead of his 2022 campaign largely on the back of his confirming Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh when he led the Senate Judiciary Committee. If Republicans win back the Senate, he could retake the gavel and help Trump further reshape the federal bench.\n\nSenator Roger Marshall of Kansas, one of eight Republicans who voted to object to election results after the January 6 riot, told The Independent that he wants Republicans to overwhelmingly get behind the former president.\n\n\"I don't have a message for him, except I hope he feels the support the way a team would circle around their leader who maybe was being attacked by the press,\" he said.\n\nBut that supportive team-like atmosphere is in no way guaranteed. Senator Susan Collins of Maine said she will not be attending Trump's talk.\n\n\"I have a conflict. That's long-standing,\" she told The Independent.\n\nWhile many liberals may roll their eyes at Collins rebuffing Trump, she was one of only a handful of Republicans who voted to convict Trump for his actions on January 6 and she voted against his efforts to repeal Obamacare. She is far from all talk.\n\nIndeed, Collins might be an even bigger roadblock to Trump if he wins a second term, given that she's now the top Republican on the Senate Appropriations Committee, the committee responsible for actually spending money to implement the president's agenda. If Republicans retake the Senate, as they are expected to do, Trump might have to deal with the fact his biggest critic in the Senate will control his pocketbook.", "source": {"uri":

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) to remove his gavel -- fueling questions about his future atop the conference.\n\nBut on Thursday, Trump sided with Johnson over those in the right flank, lauding the Speaker's performance in his still nascent leadership tenure and joking to Greene that she should \"be nice\" to Johnson. Greene acknowledged the exchange and said Trump also noted her loyalty to him.\n\nThose dynamics bode well for Johnson's political future as he faces off against pointed -- and public -- criticism from hard-liners who are vowing to block him from keeping the gavel if Republicans retain control of the lower chamber in November.\n\n\"He said he was doing a fantastic job,\" said Rep. Keven Hern (R-Okla.), head of the Republican Study Committee, relaying Trump's message to the conference.\n\nRep. Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.) delivered a similar report, saying the former president is \"absolutely\" standing behind Johnson heading into an election cycle where Republicans are bullish about their chances of winning all levers of power in Washington.\n\n\"Said he's doing a good job -- more than once,\" Burchett said.\n\nJohnson, for his part, was quick to spotlight Trump's praise after the hour-plus huddle, underscoring the need for \"continuity of leadership\" -- an unsubtle pitch to remain at the helm come next year.\n\n\"He said very complimentary things about all of us,\" Johnson said. \"He said I'm doing a very good job. We're grateful for that. We have to have continuity of leadership, we have to have a plan and it has to be very carefully executed.\"\n\nJohnson noted that he spends \"a lot of time talking to President Trump about what happens after the election,\" and said he was set to meet with the former president at Mar-a-Lago on Monday to discuss 2024 campaign strategy.\n\nTrump's visit with the House GOP conference -- which Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) described as a \"pep rally\" -- was just one part of a swing through the nation's capital, which also included meetings with Senate Republicans and high-powered business executives.\n\nThe huddle with House Republicans, which lasted just over one hour, started off on a jovial note, with GOP lawmakers singing Trump happy birthday -- he turns 78 on Friday -- and Rep. Roger Williams (R-Texas) presenting the former president with a game ball and bat from the GOP's decisive win over Democrats at the Congressional baseball game on Wednesday.\n\nBut the conversation included policy, too, with Trump touching on the issues of abortion, immigration, the border, taxes and being tough on China -- some of which Johnson discussed on Wednesday in a meeting with Senate Republicans.\n\n\"You never put the cart before the horse, but we have to plan to lead because there's so many problems to fix,\" he said. \"So we're working through that right now.\"\n\nRep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.), echoing other lawmakers, said that he saw the Trump meeting on Thursday as helpful for Johnson, expressing that Trump wanted Republicans to stay united on the big issues rather than battling each other.\n\nStill, Trump did veer into his own political revenge instincts.\n\nThe former president expressed pleasure that almost all of the 10 Republicans who voted to impeach him after the Jan. 6 Capitol attack are no longer in office, noting that Reps. Tom Rice (S.C.) and Liz Cheney (Wyo.) lost re-election to Trump-endorsed primary challengers.\n\nAnd Trump made a reference to Rep. David Valadao (R-Calif.), one of the two pro-impeachment Republicans left in the House, saying that he had saved the California Republican by not backing an opponent against him, according to a source. Lawmakers leaving the meeting described it as a friendly, joking quip.\n\nValadao did not attend the Trump meeting. The other one of the two members who voted for impeachment, Rep. Dan Newhouse (R-Wash.), was in the room, though he escaped Trump's ire.\n\nTrump got into some other electoral score-keeping, too. He praised Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.), a Trump critic-turned-supporter who won a primary on Tuesday against a challenger backed by former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), whom she voted to remove. And he reportedly warned members against working with Jeff Roe, a political strategist who boosted Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis's presidential bid.\n\nRep. Bob Good (R-Va.), who had endorsed DeSantis for president and now faces a primary challenge from a Trump-backed candidate, ignored reporter questions when leaving the meeting.\n\nTrump referenced the number of legal proceedings against him. But Johnson and other lawmakers said that Trump did not make any specific requests of Republicans in that meeting to extract revenge on prosecutors.\n\nNonetheless, Johnson said that House GOP leadership is working on a bill that is essentially a Trump defense measure. The bill, Sponsored by Rep. Russell Fry (R-S.C.), would allow presidents to push state-level cases to federal court. That could clear the way for federal prosecutors to drop the case, or issue a pardon.\n\nTrump also used Thursday's meeting to promote a laundry list of policy priorities he hopes to take on in a second term.\n\nHe attacked Biden's border policies and promised to adopt much more stringent measures like those he championed in his first term.\n\n\"We have to secure the border. We have to stop this massive influx,\" said Rep. Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.).\n\nTrump promoted the idea of using tariffs to help U.S. businesses interests in the face of foreign trade policies he deems unfair.\n\n\"He's a big believer in tariffs, and I think he's probably done more to impact the thinking of the Republican conference than [anyone else],\" said Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), chairman of the powerful Appropriations Committee.\n\nTrump also vowed to end overseas conflicts, like the one in Ukraine, which Republicans have blamed on Biden.\n\n\"As he has mentioned, he had a great working relationship with China and Russia, and we didn't have wars,\" Hern said. \"And wars cost lives, and they're very expensive.\"\n\nOn abortion, Trump urged Republicans to be cautious with how they talk about abortion in their elections, urging them to support exceptions and to keep abortion policy legislated at the state -- not federal -- level, and he advocated for exceptions for the medical procedure, according to two sources in the room.\n\nRep. Marc Molinaro (R-N.Y.) said that Trump told lawmakers \"to show respect for women and the choices that they have to make.\"\n\nTrump also volunteered to help Republicans on the campaign trail, including lawmakers in the toughest races. It's unclear how many of those vulnerable incumbents will accept the offer, particularly those in districts carried by Biden in 2020. But at least some of those Republicans say there are distinct advantages to that strategy.\n\n\"He turns out people that otherwise would not vote. So there is a benefit there,\" said Rep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.).\n\nRep. David Schwikert (R-Ariz.), another Biden-district Republican, said he \"was pleased that a big chunk of it [Trump's message] was on economy and inflation.\"\n\nOthers said Trump is sure to help Republicans down-ballot, even despite his recent felony convictions.\n\n\"He's got more popularity and support than he's ever had before,\" Mace said.", "source": {"uri": "wtaj.com", "dataType":

It also offered a preview of how Mr. Trump could leverage those ties in a second presidential term to enact major policy changes.\n\n\"You don't put the cart before the horse, but you do have to be prepared to lead,\" said House Speaker Mike Johnson in response to a question from the Monitor on the eve of Mr. Trump's visit. Mr. Johnson is bullish on Republicans retaining the House and winning both the Senate and White House, though polls show a less certain outlook. \"When you have unified government like that, it comes with great responsibility, and I look forward to those days and fixing lots and lots of things.\"\n\nComing out of their morning meeting at the Capitol Hill Club just off campus, House Republicans said the mood was upbeat, with a focus on unity and reinforcing \"some backbone,\" as fiscal conservative Tim Burchett of Tennessee put it.\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, who threw the GOP into disarray last fall when he led the ouster of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, said Mr. Trump's main message was the need to be unified as a party.\n\n\"President Trump ... made it very clear it's not just about his victory,\" said Mr. Gaetz. \"It's also about ensuring large majorities in the House and Senate.\"\n\nMr. Trump's visits with congressional Republicans, while in town for a meeting with CEOs at a Business Roundtable event, follows on the heels of his felony conviction last month for hush-money payments. The trial was based on untested legal theories, which added to GOP concerns about the politicization of the justice system.\n\nCritics say Mr. Trump's visit is a crass attempt to get congressional Republicans to inappropriately intervene in his legal troubles, including by promoting a bill to move state court cases involving a president to federal court.\n\nFor their part, congressional Republicans frame the visit as part rallying the troops ahead of the election and part laying the groundwork for a strong start to a Trump 2.0 presidency. That would contrast with his first term, when he reportedly was not expecting to win, had few relationships in Washington, and got off to a chaotic start.\n\n\"We're going to see definitely a far more honed approach\" in a second Trump presidency, says Rep. William Timmons of South Carolina. \"He's going to have just a lot more alignment with Republicans in Congress.\"\n\nEndorsed by Mr. Trump, Representative Timmons this week narrowly fended off an effort by the right-wing House Freedom Caucus to unseat him in the South Carolina primary. Mr. Timmons is one of many Republicans who owes their seat in Congress in part to a Trump endorsement. And the congressman's victory is one of numerous recent examples where Mr. Trump's intervention muted the influence of hardliners, including Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's failed effort to replace Mr. Johnson as speaker just six months after the House ousted his predecessor, Kevin McCarthy.\n\nMr. Trump has perturbed even supporters with his withering attacks on social media, garnering a reputation as mercurial, callous, and demanding loyalty - and exacting revenge on those who defy him.\n\nHis resources and sway with voters have made it hard for Republicans to stand up to him; only two of the 10 House members who voted to impeach him remain in Congress. Those who criticize him rarely do so publicly.\n\nBut Mr. Trump also has had many consistent, vocal supporters. Numerous Republicans interviewed for this piece painted a different picture of the former president as personable, generous with his time, and tolerant of more dissent than he is credited with.\n\n\"President Trump welcomed rank-and-file House Republicans in the Oval Office and the White House, on Air Force One, and the limo,\" says Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana, adding that as a newer member of Congress, he got calls from the president \"all the time\" and was invited to Camp David. When in 2021-22 he led the Republican Study Committee, a conservative policy group, he would bring members to visit the former president at his various estates. Such visits, together with his political endorsements, will yield dividends in a second term, says Mr. Banks.\n\n\"President Trump welcomed everybody, and it paid off in a big way for him back then. I think it's going to pay off in an even bigger way this time,\" he says. \"Our party is unified behind him in a way that I think speaks volumes.\"\n\nSome critics have raised concerns that Mr. Trump's cultivation of more allies on the Hill could result in a GOP Congress that would essentially rubber stamp Trump policies if he were to retake the White House - policies that many Democrats warn could be more extreme.\n\nAnd indeed, earlier this year he was blamed for torpedoing the bipartisan border bill negotiated by conservative Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford along with Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, an independent, and Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat.\n\nIt's normal for any new president to press their party's members of Congress to support key policies, and those members usually comply so as not to undercut the president, says Kevin Kosar, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.\n\nBut, he adds, \"A party is a party. It's not a cult.\"\n\nOpponents have in fact accused Mr. Trump, who values loyalty, of in fact turning the GOP into a personality cult. But Republicans say there's a misperception that he demands that people be in lockstep with him.\n\n\"He actually can look past a lot of disagreement,\" says Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, who also benefited from a Trump endorsement.\n\nThat was the case for GOP House Rep. Debbie Lesko of Arizona. Soon after being elected, she was part of a group whom Mr. Trump invited to the White House to encourage them to vote for a GOP immigration bill. But despite it being her first time speaking with the president, she told him her constituents wouldn't support it.\n\nShe worried he would tweet against her. \"But as it turned out,\" she says, \"he likes fighters and people that speak their minds.\"\n\nWhen he faced impeachment the next year, he selected her to serve on his impeachment defense team.\n\nSen. Susan Collins of Maine was among seven GOP senators who voted to convict Mr. Trump in his second impeachment after Jan. 6. But she pushes back on concerns that the former president has inculcated a reflexive loyalty among congressional Republicans through his endorsements.\n\n\"It's natural that those individuals would feel a sense of gratitude,\" she says. But \"it doesn't mean that they're going to ask, 'How high?' when he says, 'Jump.'\"", "source": {"uri": "csmonitor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Christian Science Monitor"}, "authors":

Later, he plans to deliver remarks to the Business Roundtable.\n\n\"There's tremendous unity in the Republican Party,\" former President Trump said at a press conference after his meeting with Senate Republicans.\n\n\"We want to see borders, we want to see strong military, we want to see money not wasted all over the world,\" he said.\n\nThe presumptive GOP nominees' visit comes one day after House Republicans voted to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt for failing to hand over tapes of President Joe Biden's interviews with special counsel Robert Hur. Mr. Garland and Democrats dismissed the move as a partisan attack.\n\nThe former president's remarks to the House Republican conference largely echoed the statements he has made on the campaign trail.\n\nAccording to lawmakers leaving the meeting, he made no specific requests of House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) or the conference as a whole.\n\nThe energetic conversation, according to Republicans, touched on an array of issues: election strategy, divisions within the conference, immigration, the economy, abortion, tariffs and taxation, and allegations of a weaponized justice system.\n\nRep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) told The Epoch Times that the former president and the Republican conference discussed \"deportation, getting [the Keystone XL pipeline] opened back up, oil flowing and getting inflation down, cutting taxes.\"\n\n\"He hit everything, he really did, that's the most energized I've ever seen him,\" the House Freedom Caucus member said.\n\nNear the start of the meeting, former President Trump chided Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), an outspoken critic of Mr. Johnson, asking, \"Marjorie, are you being nice to Speaker Johnson?\"\n\nThat comment referred to Ms. Greene's effort last month to remove Mr. Johnson from his position as speaker, using the same mechanism that ousted House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's (R-Calif.) in October 2023.\n\nMs. Greene told reporters that she answered the former president with a sheepish \"Yeah,\" interpreting the question largely as a lighthearted joke.\n\nFormer President Trump has on multiple occasions indicated his support for Mr. Johnson.\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), one of former President Trump's closest allies in the House, said that election strategy was also discussed during the meeting.\n\n\"President Trump talked about his specific strategies he was going to use to ensure that Trump voters show up in November, and that they go all the way down to ticket,\" Mr. Gaetz said.\n\nHe added that former President Trump's goal is to ensure Republicans win down-ballot victories through holding, among other means, 100 \"telephone town halls for members.\"\n\nAdditionally, Mr. Gaetz said that the former president \"lamented the fact that we're sending $60 billion to Ukraine, and we're not paying our troops more.\"\n\nFormer President Trump also hit on his allegations of weaponization at the Department of Justice.\n\n\"So he went over that and he laughed,\" Mr. Norman said. \"He said they think they're doubling down on it, let them keep doing it. He's raising money. People sense an injustice is going on.\"\n\nMr. Garland has forcefully hit back at Republican claims of political prosecutions, particularly targeting former President Trump. He said earlier this week the department has seen a rise in attacks as a result of such claims that have become \"dangerous for our democracy.\"\n\nRep. Nicole Malliotakis (R-N.Y.) also confirmed that former President Trump floated an idea to replace income taxation with import tariffs.\n\nIn the early days of the Republic, this was the source of most of the federal government's revenue.\n\nHowever, Ms. Malliotakis expressed doubt that this could be achieved, as income taxation now makes up a substantial share of government revenue.\n\nAdditionally, former President Trump reiterated his pledge to end taxation on income from tips, which Ms. Malliotakis said would come as part of an upcoming revamping of the tax code.\n\nWith Trump-era tax cuts to expire at the end of next year, Congress and the next administration will be looking to set key reforms to tax policy.", "source": {"uri": "ntd.com", "dataType":

Officials from his campaign said that his meetings were also intended to promote unity among the Republican party. \"President Trump brought an extraordinary amount of energy and enthusiasm this morning,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson said. \"That is what we're seeing in the party throughout the country.\" \"We believe we are going to win back the White House, and the Senate, and grow the House majority.\"Republican Senator Thom Tillis said gaining a majority in the Senate was \"intrinsically linked\" to Trump winning the presidential election. \"We're like one team, one vision,\" Mr Tillis ...", "source": {"uri": "rocketnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "RocketNews | Top News Stories From Around the Globe"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Pelosi", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Pelosi"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Bribery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thom_Tillis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thom Tillis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'\u00e9tat", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coup d'\u00e9tat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns_and_Elections", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Campaigns and Elections", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Real_Estate/Residential", "label": "dmoz/Business/Real Estate/Residential", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Restoration", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Restoration", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 93}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9641178", "eventUri": "eng-9641178", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-06", "textStart": 103, "textEnd": 112}], "sentiment": 0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 146, "relevance": 1}

Some protesters held signs calling Republicans \"boot licker\" and warned them \"don't drink the Kool-Aid.\" Other protesters from Code Pink, a radical anti-war group, protested US support for Israel and called on ending support for its war on Hamas that has killed more than 35,000 people.\n\nThe meeting is part of a full day for Trump in Washingtonm. After the meeting, he will stick around in Washington where he is expected to record an appearance on social media star Logan Paul's podcast.\n\nTrump is also set to address a gathering of CEOs this afternoon, as he continues his trend of explicitly offering to enact or dismantle policies to benefit major donors. Afterward, he will meet with Senate Republicans, though some of his biggest critics in the Senate GOP conference will not attend.\n\nBut Republicans seemed unbothered about despite the fact that last month, a jury in Manhattan found Trump guilty on 34 counts of falsifying business records as part of a conspiracy to corruptly influence the 2016 presidential election.\n\nMany Republicans expressed optimism after their meeting with him.\n\n\"Talked about the border, talked about the crazy inflation rate, things that we need to fix,\" House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan told The Independent.\n\nRepublicans said that Trump spoke about numerous subjects ranging from helping Republicans down ballot, to abortion to the war in Ukraine.\n\n\"He talked about exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother,\" Representative Nancy Mace of South Carolina told The Independent. Mace, who previously criticized Trump for his actions on January 6, received his endorsement ahead of her primary on Tuesday, which propelled her to victory despite her vote to eject Kevin McCarthy as speaker last year.\n\nMace has previously expressed concern that Republicans' messaging on abortion would repel female voters.\n\n\"He talked about, 'it's in the people's hands now, and that we have to speak about abortion correctly,' which is a message that the party needs to hear,\" she told The Independent.\n\nRepublicans have a razor-thin majority in the House of Representatives, with 17 Republicans hailing from seats that voted for President Joe Biden. The direction of the House could easily hinge on how voters decide the presidential race.\n\nBut Representative Marc Molinaro of New York, a Biden district Republican, did not seem concerned going into the meeting with Trump, noting how his district voted for Trump in 2016.\n\n\"I am exceptionally tied to the people that I represent,\" Molinaro told The Independent. \"So if President Trump's going to deliver to make it easier for the people of upstate New York, then that will be better than what they've been experiencing these last four years.\"\n\nPresident Joe Biden's campaign denounced Trump's visit, with Representative Bennie Thompson, who served as the chairman of the House select committee that investigated the January 6 riot, putting out a statement.\n\n\"Since January 6th, Donald Trump, a twice-impeached convicted felon, has repeatedly doubled down on his disrespect for the rule of law and continues to sow hate and division,\" Thompson said. \"He still presents the same dire threat to our democracy that he did three years ago -- and he'd be wise to head back to Mar-a-Lago and await his sentencing.\"\n\nRepresentative Madeleine Dean of Pennsylvania served as an manager for Trump's second impeachment, which was related to the January 6 riot.\n\n\"Every one of themselves has given over their soul their credibility in service of one man who is a criminal,\" she told The Independent outside of the Capitol Hill Club.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "katie_hawkinson@uk.news.yahoo.com",

He is a fraud, a crook, and a failed businessman and president who left America in economic ruin,\" a spokesman said.", "source": {"uri": "rfi.fr", "dataType": "news", "title": "RFI"}, "authors": [],

time since Jan 6 to meet with top Republicans", "body": "Donald Trump will make his first return to Capitol Hill in Washington DC on Thursday since his supporters laid siege to the US Capitol on January 6 2021 in protest at his defeat to Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe Republican presidential candidate and convicted felon was already scheduled to meet behind closed doors with GOP senators but will now also reportedly sit down with their House counterparts in a separate session.\n\nHouse GOP Conference chairwoman and prospective Trump running mate Elise Stefanik notified lawmakers on Tuesday about the upcoming meeting with their party's presumptive nominee, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe Trump campaign has not confirmed the meeting with House Republicans but a senior campaign official has said the Senate session will be focused on policy issues, including tax cuts.\n\nTrump's return to the Republican Party's campaign offices across from the Capitol will inevitably stir up vivid memories of the events of January 6, when he addressed \"Stop the Steal\" protesters on the Ellipse and urged them to \"fight like hell\".\n\nThey took that appeal literally, attacking the legislative complex and battling law enforcement for several hours as they attempted to storm the building in order to prevent the formal certification of the 2020 election results at a joint-session of Congress.\n\nLawmakers and their families were sent fleeing for their lives as the rioters stalked the halls, invaded representatives' offices and called for the hanging of Mike Pence, Trump's then vice-president who had rejected his boss's call to subvert his ceremonial role at the session by blocking the certification process.\n\nThe attack resulted in Trump's historic second impeachment and more than 1,000 prosecutions of would-be insurrectionists who joined the fray on a day destined to live on in infamy.\n\nTrump has since been found liable for a historic sexual assault and associated defamation, found liable for business fraud in a separate case and convicted on May 30 of falsifying business records to interfere in the 2016 presidential election in another - and is still facing three further criminal indictments.\n\nFor all that, most Republicans have endorsed him ahead of November's expected rematch against Biden, including outgoing Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and other leaders who were highly critical of him in the immediate aftermath of the 2021 attack.\n\nA majority of GOP politicians in Congress have also joined their candidate in echoing his baseless claims that the US justice system has been \"weaponised\" against him by the Biden administration.\n\nHouse speaker Mike Johnson was one of a number of populist GOP lawmakers who descended on the New York courthouse hearing Trump's hush money trial last month to protest his innocence and denounce the proceedings as corrupt before his eventual guilty conviction by a unanimous jury.", "source": {"uri": "independent.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Independent"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

We now know, of course, that this did not happen, and the Republican was unable to lead a mob into the halls of Congress for a confrontation.\n\nTrump had to settle for a different approach: He fueled a group of violent rioters with anti-election lies and deployed them to attack his own country's Capitol.\n\nToday, the presumptive GOP nominee will return to the scene of the crime. If all goes according to plan, Trump will make his first visit to Congress since before the insurrectionist violence of Jan. 6, meeting behind closed doors with Republican lawmakers to discuss campaign messaging and legislative strategy.\n\nThe intraparty gathering will take place roughly three blocks from the courthouse where Trump was arraigned last summer on alleged felonies related to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. The former president will also be protected today in part by police officers who faced violent pro-Trump rioters during the 2021 assault that he instigated.\n\nAhead of the Republicans' private chat with their presumptive nominee, House Speaker Mike Johnson oversaw a partisan stunt that likely made Trump happy -- the House GOP majority voted to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt for defying a misguided subpoena -- which followed a Capitol Hill press conference in which the party's top lawmaker read from a decidedly Trumpian script.\n\nA reporter noted that several House Republicans, including Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, ignored subpoenas from the Jan. 6 committee, raising the question of why GOP members would try to punish Garland for doing the same thing. The House speaker replied:\n\nAs part of the same Q&A, the Louisiana Republican was also asked whether he believes Trump respects the peaceful transfer of presidential power. \"Of course he respects that, we all do,\" Johnson responded.\n\nSo, a few things.\n\nFirst, the idea that the bipartisan Jan. 6 committee \"hid\" and \"destroyed\" evidence is popular at Mar-a-Lago, but there's no evidence to bolster such a claim.\n\nSecond, the idea that the House select panel wasn't \"properly constituted,\" rendering its subpoenas meaningless, is belied by multiple federal court rulings.\n\nThird, if Johnson genuinely believes that Trump \"respects\" the peaceful transfer of presidential power, I'd encourage the speaker to read both the Jan. 6 committee's report and the Trump indictment filed by special counsel Jack Smith's office.\n\nAnd finally, the idea that \"all\" Republicans respect the process of outgoing presidents transferring power to their successors is also contradicted by Johnson's own record. He did, after all, help spearhead an ill-fated effort to convince the Supreme Court to keep Trump in power despite the voters' verdict, before voting with his party to reject certifying the results of a free and fair election.\n\nJohnson also echoed some of the wilder conspiracy theories about the race, and more than three years later, the Louisiana Republican is still reluctant to acknowledge the legitimacy of the 2020 elections.\n\nBut while the House speaker's rhetoric yesterday was literally unbelievable, it also likely impressed Trump, which for the GOP in 2024, appears more important than honoring reality.", "source": {"uri": "msnbc.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MSNBC.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score":

Members also sang Happy Birthday to the 45th president.\n\nTrump also spoke about some more serious policy topics, including pushing for exceptions for abortion and protecting women's sports.\n\nIn a GOP Leadership press conference after the meeting, House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik stated Trump \"was warmly welcomed by\" the GOP members, adding, \"We are 100 percent unified behind his candidacy.\"\n\nStefanik said House Republicans \"are ready to get to work on behalf of the American people to secure the border, unleash American energy independence, bring back peace through strength, stand up for election integrity, and defeat this illegal weaponization of the justice system.\"\n\n\"It was a unifying event, and I am grateful to the president for answering questions from our colleagues today,\" she added.\n\nTrump is also set to visit the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) on Thursday as well for a meeting with Republican senators.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nick_gilbertson@breitbart.com", "name": "Nick Gilbertson", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Williams_(Texas_politician)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roger Williams (Texas politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Gaetz", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Matt Gaetz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Mace", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Mace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/78th_United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "78th United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Baseball_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Congressional Baseball Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Republican_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "House Republican Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elise_Stefanik", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elise Stefanik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Republican_Senatorial_Committee", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Republican Senatorial Committee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Revolution"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "label": "dmoz/Science/Technology/Energy", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Event_Planning_and_Production", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Event Planning and Production", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Conferences", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/03/donald-trump-cpac2019file-ap-photo.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9641178", "eventUri": "eng-9641178", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2013-06-", "textStart": 495, "textEnd": 502}], "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

We now know, of course, that this did not happen, and the Republican was unable to lead a mob into the halls of Congress for a confrontation.\n\nTrump had to settle for a different approach: He fueled a group of violent rioters with anti-election lies and deployed them to attack his own country's Capitol.\n\nToday, the presumptive GOP nominee will return to the scene of the crime. If all goes according to plan, Trump will make his first visit to Congress since before the insurrectionist violence of Jan. 6, meeting behind closed doors with Republican lawmakers to discuss campaign messaging and legislative strategy.\n\nThe intraparty gathering will take place roughly three blocks from the courthouse where Trump was arraigned last summer on alleged felonies related to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. The former president will also be protected today in part by police officers who faced violent pro-Trump rioters during the 2021 assault that he instigated.\n\nAhead of the Republicans' private chat with their presumptive nominee, House Speaker Mike Johnson oversaw a partisan stunt that likely made Trump happy -- the House GOP majority voted to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in contempt for defying a misguided subpoena -- which followed a Capitol Hill press conference in which the party's top lawmaker read from a decidedly Trumpian script.\n\nA reporter noted that several House Republicans, including Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, ignored subpoenas from the Jan. 6 committee, raising the question of why GOP members would try to punish Garland for doing the same thing. The House speaker replied:\n\nAs part of the same Q&A, the Louisiana Republican was also asked whether he believes Trump respects the peaceful transfer of presidential power. \"Of course he respects that, we all do,\" Johnson responded.\n\nSo, a few things.\n\nFirst, the idea that the bipartisan Jan. 6 committee \"hid\" and \"destroyed\" evidence is popular at Mar-a-Lago, but there's no evidence to bolster such a claim.\n\nSecond, the idea that the House select panel wasn't \"properly constituted,\" rendering its subpoenas meaningless, is belied by multiple federal court rulings.\n\nThird, if Johnson genuinely believes that Trump \"respects\" the peaceful transfer of presidential power, I'd encourage the speaker to read both the Jan. 6 committee's report and the Trump indictment filed by special counsel Jack Smith's office.\n\nAnd finally, the idea that \"all\" Republicans respect the process of outgoing presidents transferring power to their successors is also contradicted by Johnson's own record. He did, after all, help spearhead an ill-fated effort to convince the Supreme Court to keep Trump in power despite the voters' verdict, before voting with his party to reject certifying the results of a free and fair election.\n\nJohnson also echoed some of the wilder conspiracy theories about the race, and more than three years later, the Louisiana Republican is still reluctant to acknowledge the legitimacy of the 2020 elections.\n\nBut while the House speaker's rhetoric yesterday was literally unbelievable, it also likely impressed Trump, which for the GOP in 2024, appears more important than honoring reality.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type":

Plus, senior political reporter Jonathan Allen details why the \"Blue Wall\" is Joe Biden's best bet to reach 270 electoral votes.\n\nSign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.\n\nThree and a half years ago, then-President Donald Trump incited a violent riot at the Capitol in a bid to overturn Joe Biden's election victory and remain in power, a special House committee concluded after a lengthy investigation.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump made his first visit to Capitol Hill since before the Jan. 6 attack as Republicans gave a hero's welcome to their party's presumptive 2024 nominee.\n\nThe closed-door meetings with House and Senate Republicans represented a rare moment of unity for a party that has been engaged in a civil war since that day.\n\nDo you have a news tip? Let us know\n\nHere are the top moments from Trump's trip to Washington:\n\nMending fences: Trump made peace with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who had blamed the former president for the deadly Capitol riot. The two men had not spoken since December 2020. McConnell said he and Trump shook hands several times Thursday, calling it \"a good meeting\" and an \"entirely positive session.\"\n\nTrump delivered a message about \"unity,\" one source in his meeting with House Republicans said. He offered to do tele-town halls for members facing tough races and stressed that Republicans should not attack one another.\n\nAt one point, two sources said, Trump implored a close ally, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., to get along with Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., whom she attempted to oust from power.\n\n\"Marjorie, are you being nice to Mike?\" Trump asked, the sources said, eliciting laughter from House Republicans. One source who observed Greene's reaction said she made a \"sort of\" hand gesture, which Greene herself confirmed afterward.\n\nAbortion caution: Trump acknowledged that the issue of abortion rights had cost Republicans and that it's too important to ignore, while adding it's now back in the hands of the people and the states. He also voiced support for abortion policy that includes exceptions like in cases of rape, incest and the life of the mother.\n\n\"We're the party of common sense\" on this and other key issues, Trump told the lawmakers. Members in the room had mixed reactions to his abortion riff, the sources said.\n\nBashing Milwaukee: Trump also took a shot at Milwaukee, which is hosting the Republican National Convention. The former president called the city, the most populous in the battleground state of Wisconsin, \"horrible\" and overrun by crime, a source said, adding that no one in the room disagreed with him.\n\nRead more from Trump's day on Capitol Hill \u2192\n\nIf Biden loses in November, his aides may regret the spending decisions they're making right now.\n\nThe \"clearest path\" for Biden to win re-election runs through Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin -- the three states that flipped to the Republicans in 2016 and back to the Democrats in 2020 -- according to Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., who serves as co-chairman on the campaign, and many other Democratic strategists.\n\nIf Biden keeps those states, along with Nebraska's 2nd Congressional District, he can lose the rest of the swing states and still amass exactly the 270 electoral votes he needs to secure a second term.\n\nBut Biden campaign officials are convinced that it's a mistake to put all their eggs atop the \"Blue Wall.\" Flush with early campaign cash, they are also deploying staff, surrogates and ad dollars to Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada.\n\nThey could be right that Biden is best served by pursuing all the permutations that could lead to an Electoral College majority.\n\nSimple arithmetic dictates that winning 16 electoral votes in Georgia or North Carolina, or 11 in Arizona, would more than make up for losing 10 in Wisconsin. Likewise, holding Nevada's six electoral votes would outweigh losing the 2nd District in Nebraska, which awards a single elector for each congressional district a candidate wins.\n\nBut polls consistently show Biden trailing in Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada. Moreover, with the exception of Nevada, those states have been weaker for Democrats than the Rust Belt trio in recent presidential elections.\n\nPennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin are the \"must have\" states, according to Faiz Shakir, a Democratic strategist who ran Bernie Sanders' 2020 campaign.\n\nThere's a very modern model for winning the presidency by focusing on those three states: It's how Trump claimed the Oval Office in 2016. At the time, Hillary Clinton's campaign team talked a lot about the value of pursuing multiple paths to 270 electoral votes. As it turned out, they were all cut off by Trump's performance in the Rust Belt.\n\nSo, while political junkies play with the electoral map to see how they can produce 270 votes for one candidate or the other, the most valuable turf hasn't changed.\n\nBiden aides say it is way too early for triage. But in yet another election that promises to be close, it could get late soon.\n\nThat's all from The Politics Desk for now.

Later, he plans to deliver remarks to the Business Roundtable.\n\n\"There's tremendous unity in the Republican Party,\" former President Trump said at a press conference after his meeting with Senate Republicans.\n\n\"We want to see borders, we want to see strong military, we want to see money not wasted all over the world,\" he said.\n\nThe former president's remarks to the House Republican conference largely echoed the statements he has made on the campaign trail.\n\nAccording to lawmakers leaving the meeting, he made no specific requests of House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) or the conference as a whole.\n\nThe energetic conversation, according to Republicans, touched on an array of issues: election strategy, divisions within the conference, immigration, the economy, abortion, tariffs and taxation, and allegations of a weaponized justice system.\n\nRep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) told The Epoch Times that the former president and the Republican conference discussed \"deportation, getting [the Keystone XL pipeline] opened back up, oil flowing and getting inflation down, cutting taxes.\"\n\n\"He hit everything, he really did, that's the most energized I've ever seen him,\" the House Freedom Caucus member said.\n\nNear the start of the meeting, former President Trump chided Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), an outspoken critic of Mr. Johnson, asking, \"Marjorie, are you being nice to Speaker Johnson?\"\n\nThat comment referred to Ms. Greene's effort last month to remove Mr. Johnson from his position as speaker, using the same mechanism that ousted House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's (R-Calif.) in October 2023.\n\nMs. Greene told reporters that she answered the former president with a sheepish \"Yeah,\" interpreting the question largely as a lighthearted joke.\n\nFormer President Trump has on multiple occasions indicated his support for Mr. Johnson.\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), one of former President Trump's closest allies in the House, said that election strategy was also discussed during the meeting.\n\n\"President Trump talked about his specific strategies he was going to use to ensure that Trump voters show up in November, and that they go all the way down to ticket,\" Mr. Gaetz said.\n\nHe added that former President Trump's goal is to ensure Republicans win down-ballot victories through holding, among other means, 100 \"telephone town halls for members.\"\n\nAdditionally, Mr. Gaetz said that the former president \"lamented the fact that we're sending $60 billion to Ukraine, and we're not paying our troops more.\"\n\nFormer President Trump also hit on his allegations of weaponization at the Department of Justice.\n\n\"So he went over that and he laughed,\" Mr. Norman said. \"He said they think they're doubling down on it, let them keep doing it. He's raising money. People sense an injustice is going on.\"\n\nRep. Nicole Malliotakis (R-N.Y.) also confirmed that former President Trump floated an idea to replace income taxation with import tariffs.\n\nIn the early days of the Republic, this was the source of most of the federal government's revenue.\n\nHowever, Ms. Malliotakis expressed doubt that this could be achieved, as income taxation now makes up a substantial share of government revenue.\n\nWith Trump-era tax cuts to expire at the end of next year, Congress and the next administration will be looking to set key reforms to tax policy.", "source": {"uri": "theepochtimes.com", "dataType":

Trump praised House Speaker Mike Johnson and pledged to help Republicans \"win big\" in the upcoming election, adding that he plans to make a bid to win every state.\n\nThe meeting came on the eve of the former president's 78th birthday and Senator Tommy Tuberville told Newsweek that Republicans presented him with a cake. It was reportedly chocolate.\n\nRepresentative Mike Lee said the cake had \"45\" and \"47\" candles on it, a reference to his first term as president and the potential for him to be the 47th president, as well. Before blowing out the candles, Trump said he would make a wish that related to \"everyone in this room,\" according to Senator Cynthia Lummis.\n\nRepresentative Matt Gaetz characterized the House meeting as a \"pep rally\" for Trump, emphasizing unity within the party. Trump urged Republicans to come together and avoid internal conflicts, offering to support members in tough races through tele-townhalls and other means. However, he also acknowledged that he was supporting some of their opponents.\n\nTrump addressed several contentious issues, including border security, China and abortion. On abortion, he acknowledged that the issue had cost Republicans in past elections and emphasized the need for \"common sense\" policies that include exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother.\n\nTrump also criticized Milwaukee, the host city for the upcoming Republican National Convention, calling it \"horrible\" and plagued by crime.\n\nOn Friday, Trump will spend his birthday in Michigan, a battleground state. He'll speak at The People's Convention, which is being hosted by Turning Point USA. In honor of his birthday, the MAGA Conservative Coalition planned a MAGA Boat Parade on Saturday on Lake St. Clair.\n\nDespite the celebratory mood among his supporters, Trump's birthday and campaign activities come amid ongoing political controversies. Former U.S. Capitol Police Officer Harry Dunn, who opposed Trump in the aftermath of the January 6 attacks, expressed frustration over the continued support for Trump among GOP lawmakers.\n\n\"It just shows the lack of backbone they have when they're truly putting party and person over country,\" he said.\n\nTrump's birthday comes as he prepares to be sentenced in his hush money case in New York City.

It also marked his first appearance on the Hill since becoming a convicted felon two weeks ago, and put him face-to-face with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., with whom he has clashed, for the first time in three years.\n\nTrump's morning session in private with House Republicans at the Capitol Hill Club was described as something of a pep rally for conservative causes. Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., and others said the atmosphere was a mix of civil and serious, with some lighter moments. Trump was slated to meet with GOP senators later in the day.\n\n\"The president was having a little fun cracking jokes, that kind of thing,\" said Donalds, mentioned on some lists as a potential Trump running mate. \"But then, also talking seriously just about [members] just working hard to get to the finish line in this election.\"\n\nHouse Appropriations Chairman Tom Cole, R-Okla., described the session as \"a pretty good rally-the-troops kind of speech.\" Trump will turn 78 on Friday, and several members, with grins, said House Republicans sang \"Happy Birthday.\"\n\nAs they dodged a handful of anti-Trump protesters outside, multiple members said Trump said Speaker Mike Johnson is doing a \"great job,\" and he teased Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Georgia Republican who has clashed with Johnson, R-La. Members said Trump asked if she has been more \"nice\" to Johnson. \"Some people kind of laughed. A few cheered,\" said Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn. \"I thought she took it very gracious.\"\n\nLawmakers said Trump stood by his boasting about how conservatives on the Supreme Court -- including three that he appointed -- ended federal abortion protections. He also vowed to again use tariffs as president and endorsed a House-passed Republican immigration measure known as H.R. 2.\n\n\"He's a big believer in tariffs,\" Cole said, noting Trump spoke about the trade tactic \"at great length,\" and added: \"He clearly supports them as a tool.\"\n\nOn abortion, \"he still believes that the Dobbs decision was the right decision for America, and the American people need to decide the issue, as they are doing right now,\" said Republican Study Committee Chair Kevin Hern, R-Okla., referring to the Supreme Court decision that ended federal protections for abortion access.\n\nAt campaign rallies and in other public remarks of late, Trump has said the Dobbs ruling rightfully handed the hot-button issue -- on which polls show voters siding with Democrats -- to state governments. To that end, he told House members Thursday that state \"legislatures need to make that decision and we're seeing that happen across America,\" Hern said.\n\n...continued", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2020 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minority_leader", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Minority leader"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_McConnell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mitch McConnell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Donalds", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Byron Donalds"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Cole", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tom Cole"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Conservatism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobbs_v._Jackson_Women's_Health_Organization", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dobbs v.

With us now, New York Times senior political correspondent, Maggie Haberman, also former Colorado Republican Congressman Ken Buck.\n\nMaggie, first to you. What is on the agenda for this meeting, particularly the Senate meeting? What does Donald Trump and the Trump campaign hope to gain from it?\n\nMAGGIE HABERMAN, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: They've been pretty vague about the specifics of what they're hoping to talk about. It's been left sort of in broad strokes about policy, the border, Medicare, Social Security and I expect we will hear a lot about that.\n\n[20:20:05]\n\nBut I think this is mostly, as one lawmaker put it to me, about Trump trying to garner enthusiasm. The senators in particular, as you know, this is the first time he's going to be in a room with Mitch McConnell since 2020 and the Senate Republicans, unlike House Republicans, have been a group that have been not more resistant to him, but certainly less pliant in terms of his demands.\n\nHowever, what we have seen in the days since his conviction in Manhattan is a pretty broad array of Republicans, including senators, rallying around him and saying that this conviction is improper or that Democrats should be investigated or prosecutors should be prosecuted. And I think this might be a different tone of meeting than we've seen him have with senators before.\n\nBERMAN: You know, Congressman, in 2017, when Trump took office the first time, there were some Republican members of Congress who went their own way or pushed back on some controversial statements or some policies that he had at the time. Are there any of them really left? Do non-Trump Republicans have any power in Congress anymore?\n\nKEN BUCK, (R-CO) FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE: One, I think this is going to be a great opportunity for President Trump to be surrounded by Republicans after felony convictions and show that he is still the leader of the party and still generates enthusiasm. I think that there are some Republicans who are running in Biden districts, districts that President Biden won in 2020, that will be concerned about being too close to President Trump. And I think President Trump understands that they have to win their races.\n\nSo while they won't push back verbally, they won't push back publicly, they will certainly have some distance before their election in November.\n\nBERMAN: So Maggie, as we said, Mitt Romney and Lisa Murkowski won't be there. I guess not for them specifically, but maybe others who haven't been fully in the Trump camp, what outreach has there been from Trump or the Trump campaign, do they do the outreach thing?\n\nHABERMAN: They do actually do the outreach thing. They have people who work in Trump's world or close to Trump's world who do a lot of Congressional relations. You know, Brian Jack, before he ran for Congress himself, did a lot of that work. There are others who have taken over the political work. There are people who work for Trump directly who have their own relationships.\n\nThey do, do outreach. But again, it's not always the kind of traditional political outreach we have experienced before in the past or seen in the past. In some cases, it is.\n\nI mean, one thing I will say about Trump is he has been working the phones a lot himself. I mean, there are Republicans who have been shown over and over as these primaries took place that Trump is dominating and he's not going away and he is the presumptive nominee now. And yes, there are some people who have races that are - it is more sensitive to be close to Trump and they need some distance from him. But they recognize that he is potentially going to win.\n\nThe polling at the moment is showing him slightly ahead in a number of polls, not all of them, but in a number of them. And so they're cognizant of the fact that, that he is faring well and the message is clear to him that they may not want to be so at odds with the leader of their party.", "source": {"uri": "mediaite.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Mediaite"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "CNN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maggie_Haberman", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Maggie Haberman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "January 6 United States Capitol attack"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Buck", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ken Buck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderson_Cooper", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anderson Cooper"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_science", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Political science"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Colorado"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Medicare (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Social Security (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_McConnell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mitch McConnell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Murkowski", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lisa Murkowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Primary election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitt_Romney", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mitt Romney"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Niche/Politics", "wgt": 7}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Conferences", "wgt": 8}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://www.mediaite.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/CNNs-John-Berman-Asks-Maggie-Haberman-What-Does-Trump-Hope-To-Gain-From-Meetings-On-Capitol-Hill-2024-06-12.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9641178", "eventUri": "eng-9641178", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-06", "textStart": 341, "textEnd": 350}], "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 142, "relevance": 1}

There's been a lot of infighting with Republicans, particularly on the House side. And now it is all about rallying behind Donald Trump, knowing that a united Republican Party will be good for down-ballot races,\" Burgat said.\n\nGOP members of Congress care most about the unification of a Republican Party and winning in November, Burgat said.\n\nA smaller set in leadership positions are already thinking about how they might implement a Republican agenda should they win.\n\nBurgat said they'll want to hit the ground running if they win the White House and maybe even both chambers of Congress.\n\nAnd then there are Trump's grievances following his conviction in the hush money case.\n\n\"Any room he is in, particularly when he knows that he'll receive a broad swath of support, he wants to talk about grievances and hear other people saying that yes, he was wronged,\" Burgat said. \"Whether it's the conviction in New York, whether it's the other cases, whether it's even, frankly, the election in 2020, which he can't stop talking about.\"\n\nJohnson told reporters that Trump talked \"about his concern about the 'lawfare' that's been waged against him.\"\n\nAnd Johnson noted how they saw massive levels of fundraising in the hours after Trump's hush money conviction.\n\nBut nothing really else matters for Trump and the GOP lawmakers - their 2025 agenda or grievances - if they don't win in November, Burgat said.\n\nCharles Hunt, a politics professor at Boise State University who focuses on Congress, previously told The National Desk that control of Congress is really up for grabs this fall.\n\nDemocrats have a small edge now in the Senate. There are 48 Democrats to 49 Republicans, but Democrats have three independents who caucus with them plus the tiebreaker if needed from the vice president.\n\nThings are nearly as tight in the House, where Republicans have the edge: 218 to 213. There are also four vacancies in the House.\n\nThe Cook Political Report has just three toss-ups in the Senate this election cycle, along with four competitive races leaning to Democrats.\n\nAll seven of those seats are currently held by Democrats or a Democratic-aligned independent.\n\nThe Cook Political Report has 22 toss-ups in the House, evenly split between the parties. There are also 14 competitive House races leaning Democrat and eight leaning Republican.\n\nAll House seats, of course, are up for election this fall. Thirty-four of the 100 Senate seats are also up for grabs.\n\n\"It's such a tough map (for Democrats in the Senate),\" Hunt said. \"They have to win everywhere, basically.\"\n\nDemocrats can really only afford to lose one seat and keep the Senate, Hunt said. They can't afford to lose any seats and control the Senate if Trump wins. That will give the Republicans the vice presidency and the Senate tiebreaker, too.\n\nRepublicans have the House right now by the skin of their teeth.\n\nAnd it's gotten even closer since the beginning of last year with members leaving.\n\n\"For the Democrats, you see them defending a lot of Midwestern sort of Trump-adjacent seats,\" Hunt said. \"And then the Republicans, you see them defending areas and Democratic territory in California and New York.\"\n\nWill Trump's meeting with GOP lawmakers on Thursday make a difference in the election?\n\n\"No,\" Burgat said.\n\n\"If you're paying attention to what is coming out of the readouts of a Republican meeting on Capitol Hill six months before the election, you definitely know who you're going to go vote for anyway,\" he said.\n\nBut it does give Republicans an opportunity to get on the same page.\n\nEven Republicans who don't love Trump see him as good for them as the name on the top of the ticket.\n\nBurgat said they like Trump's energized base and what his victory this fall would mean for their policies.\n\n\"They know that their electoral fates are tied up together,\" he said.", "source": {"uri":

He'd been among the first batch of Republican lawmakers to appear alongside Trump at the Manhattan trial. He'd been harping on Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's case and the alleged broader abuse of the justice system since before he took the gavel.\n\nThe speaker didn't really need to be convinced, one person familiar with the conversation said: Johnson, a former attorney himself, already believed the House had a role to play in addressing Trump's predicament. The two have since spoken on the subject multiple times.\n\nBut sympathy can only go so far. With a slim majority and skittish swing-district members, Johnson is already finding it difficult to deliver for Trump.\n\nRepublicans have all but abandoned their effort to impeach President Joe Biden, as Trump wants. Wednesday's contempt vote against Attorney General Merrick Garland squeaked by only after an intense whipping effort. And now a series of proposals targeting what Republicans call \"rogue prosecutors\" (i.e., those investigating Trump) appear to have a wobbly future.\n\nHouse GOP leaders, for instance, spent yesterday afternoon whipping a bill written by Rep. Russell Fry (R-S.C.) that would allow presidents charged at the state level to move those cases to federal court -- effectively nullifying the power of officials like Bragg and Fani Willis, Trump's prosecutor in Fulton County, Georgia. The bill was filed in April 2023 and reported by the Judiciary Committee in last September; only now is it being readied for possible floor action.\n\nJohnson has also been in talks with Judiciary Committee chair and Trump ally Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) about using the appropriations process to target special counsel Jack Smith's probe. It's an apparent softening of his position: He said in a POLITICO interview last month that he found a similar idea by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) unworkable; now, he's actually looking into it.\n\n\"That country certainly sees what's going on, and they don't want Fani Willis and Alvin Bragg and these kinds of folks to be able to continue to use grant dollars for targeting people in a political lawfare type of way,\" Jordan told us.\n\nThe problem, of course, is that these proposals don't yet have the votes to pass. One senior appropriator, Rep. Mike Simpson (R-Idaho), said the idea of defunding Smith was \"stupid.\"\n\n\"I don't think it's a good idea unless you can show that [the prosecutors] acted in bad faith or fraud or something like that,\" he said. \"They're just doing their job -- even though I disagree with what they did.\"\n\n\"We accuse Democrats of weaponizing the Justice system,\" said another skeptical senior Republican who was granted anonymity to speak with fear of MAGA blowback. \"That's exactly what we'd be doing.\"\n\nJohnson's leadership team isn't giving up just yet. Off the House floor yesterday, Fry -- who said he's not spoken to Trump about his proposal -- said there's an education effort underway inside the House GOP.\n\nHis argument: Federal lawmakers, executive officials and judges currently have the ability to try to move their local cases to federal court. Why shouldn't the leader of the free world? (One difference, of course, is that unlike those federal officials, Trump isn't currently in office.)\n\n\"In my experience so far, the more [House members] have heard about it, the more comfortable they are with it,\" he said. \"It's not a unique concept.\"\n\nThe plan for Trump's meetings -- 9:30 a.m. meeting with House Republicans at the Capitol Hill Club and a 12:30 p.m. lunch with GOP senators at NRSC headquarters -- doesn't explicitly include discussions of Trump's legal matters and how they might be addressed. (That, of course, is no guarantee that Trump won't bring them up.)\n\nInstead, the visit is being cast as a chance for Hill Republicans to unite behind their party leader heading into a contentious election season and to also talk about what comes next should Republicans manage to win a governing trifecta in November.\n\nA person close with Trump said the former president will: (1) express his desire to \"protect seniors\" by not allowing cuts to Social Security or Medicare; (2) reiterate his intention to crack down on the border; (3) lay out a broad vision for economic policy, including cutting taxes and bringing down prices, and (4) preview a U-turn on Biden's foreign policy priorities.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [],

The Cook Political Report rates his race as a toss-up, and his district -- New York's 19th -- voted for President Joe Biden in 2020.\n\nUnder typical circumstances, endangered incumbents hope to create some distance from a nominee who may drag them down. Joe Manchin, the now-retiring independent senator who won in coal-friendly West Virginia, famously shot an Obama-era climate bill with a rifle despite being a Democrat. And before she put herself in the running to be Trump's running mate, Representative Elise Stefanik voted against the Trump tax cuts.\n\nYet Molinaro, a freshman Republican, joined his colleagues in heading over to the Capitol Hill Club on Wednesday morning to hear the former president rally the troops.\n\nMolinaro told The Independent that his district voted for Trump in 2016, which is true, and tried to position himself as independent.\n\n\"I am exceptionally tied to the people that I represent,\" he said. \"So if President Trump's going to deliver to make it easier for the people of upstate New York, then that will be better than what they've been experiencing these last four years.\"\n\nIn the past, Representative Nancy Mace of South Carolina rebuked Trump for inciting a riot on Capitol Hill three days after she was sworn in for her freshman term. She told The Independent last year, after the Dobbs v Jackson case that killed Roe v Wade, \"We're not going to win hearts and minds over by being a**holes to women.\"\n\nBut on Thursday, just two days after she won a primary thanks to Trump's support, she said that the former president had abortion figured out.\n\n\"He talked about exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother,\" she said. \"He talked about, 'it's in the people's hands now, and that we have to speak about abortion correctly,' which is a message that the party needs to hear.\"\n\nRepublicans would not need to worry about going on defense when it comes to abortion rights had it not been for the three Supreme Court justices that Trump nominated and Mitch McConnell confirmed. Indeed, McConnell said that Trump was \"practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of\" January 6. Yet he, too, kissed the ring when he met with Trump recently -- despite the fact he will no longer be leader at the end of this term.\n\nNow, Republicans might not have any choice but to embrace Trump. Their base will raise hell if they distance themselves from him -- and there is little chance they could create distance unless they voted to convict him.\n\nLisa Murkowski, the Republican Senator from Alaska who voted to convict the former president in 2021, told The Independent that instead of meeting Trump with her colleagues, \"I had lunch.\"\n\n\"I think there was this obvious interest in knowing what Trump might want to lay out as part of his campaign,\" she told The Independent, when asked about why so many other Republicans attended. Murkowski -- like Susan Collins of Maine, who also did not attend Trump's speech -- hails from a state with ranked-choice voting, meaning she does not need to cater to the most conservative voters.\n\nDemocrats for their part could not wait to tie congressional Republicans with Trump, knowing that his guilty verdict last month in New York has moved the needle with voters, even if only a tiny bit. Biden's campaign put out statements from luminaries of the January 6 select committee such as its chairman Bennie Thompson and Maryland Representative Jamie Raskin, who led the second impeachment trial in the Senate.\n\nWhen news reports leaked that Trump reportedly called Milwaukee, where the Republicans will hold their national convention, \"horrible,\" Republicans offered weak sauce arguments. Meanwhile, Wisconsin's Democratic Senator Tammy Baldwin relished in the disarray.\n\n\"Milwaukee makes the greatest beer, the greatest brats, the greatest motorcycles. Hardworking people. Don't mess with Milwaukee,\" she said.\n\nDemocrats also used the day to further tie Republicans to Trump by having a vote to protect in vitro fertilization (IVF.) Alabama's Supreme Court issued a ruling in February that cited Dobbs and classified frozen embryos as children under state law. That would have ended IVF.\n\nDemocrats brought a bill to protect the fertility treatment on Thursday -- but Republicans blocked the legislation.\n\nSenator Ted Cruz accused Democrats of politicizing the bill, citing the fact that he and Senator Katie Britt of Alabama had crafted their own bill.\n\n\"What they want to do is scare the voters in November and pretend that the big bad Republicans want to take away IVF,\" he told The Independent.\n\nDespite the fact that Trump summarily humiliated him -- and despite the fact that the suburbs of Houston, Dallas and San Antonio that Cruz will need to win in November have moved away from the GOP -- he also said he thought Trump would have a positive down-ballot effect.\n\nWhile Cruz was talking, Senator Gary Peters, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Chairman who is responsible for challenging Republicans and protecting incumbents, popped up behind him, almost as a reminder that Republicans like Cruz and Molinaro should not get too close to Trump when Democrats are on their heels.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo News UK"}, "authors": [{"uri": "eric_garcia@uk.news.yahoo.com", "name": "Eric Garcia", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Independent", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "The Independent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Independent politician"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Senate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cook_Political_Report_with_Amy_Walter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Cook Political Report with Amy Walter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Molinaro", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Marc Molinaro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elise_Stefanik", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Elise Stefanik"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Mace", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nancy Mace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Manchin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Manchin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upstate_New_York", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Upstate New York"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_McConnell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mitch McConnell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Running mate"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Barack_Obama", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Presidency of Barack Obama"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Virginia", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "West Virginia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "West Virginia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "South Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Murkowski", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Lisa Murkowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion-rights_movements", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Abortion-rights movements"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) called out Republicans in Congress for inviting Trump back to the place that he tried to attack on 1/6.\n\nRep. Crockett said in a statement provided to PoltiicusUSA,\n\n\"Three years after waging a continual war on our democracy, Donald Trump, a convicted criminal, returns to Capitol Hill to hang out with the very same MAGA extremists who acted as his proxies on January 6th. Trump and his cronies attacked our free and fair elections, they attacked our peaceful transition of power, and they attacked our Capitol \u00e2\u20ac\" and the American people are fighting back at the ballot box to defend democracy. That's why this November, in addition to helping elect Hakeem Jeffries as the next Speaker to restore order to the House, voters will send Joe Biden to the White House and Donald Trump packing.\"\n\nInviting Trump back to the Capitol is part of normalizing convicted felon Trump as a presidential candidate.\n\nIt is obvious what Republicans are trying to do. House Republicans claim that Trump's appearance is about uniting the party, when in reality, Republicans are trying to create the visual of a convicted felon insurrectionist welcomed back to a seat of governance and political power.\n\nThe real goal is to beam the image around the world of Trump at the Capitol to make it look like a man who could be facing jail time belongs as the leader of the United States of America.\n\nRep.

Congressional Republicans allow him to waltz in here when it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s known he has no regard for democracy.

The Biden campaign responded to Trump's visit with an ad reminding swing state voters of what Trump did and tried to do to the country on 1/6/2021.\n\nIt is encouraging that Democrats are not allowing Donald Trump to be normalized. Trump isn't any ex-president, or presumptive party nominee visiting the Capitol. Donald J. Trump is a convicted felon who tried to overthrow the United States government that Republicans have embraced and invited back to the Capitol.\n\nRep. Thompson was correct. Donald Trump is just as big of a threat to democracy today as he was on 1/6.

Except for a few outliers, including Maryland's own Larry Hogan, the former governor running for U.S. Senate, GOP politicians seem dismissive of all of Trump's criminal indictments, from mishandling classified documents to trying to overturn the 2020 election. Yet it's not so long ago when Trump's actions frequently triggered broad, bipartisan criticism.\n\nDo you remember when Trump disparaged the legendary Vietnam POW John McCain as \"not a hero,\" saying: \"I like people who weren't captured?\" Or when he claimed that there were \"some very fine people on both sides\" after a neo-Nazi parade in Charlottesville, Virginia, left a woman dead? How about his lewd boast, captured by \"Access Hollywood,\" that as \"a star,\" he could grab women, and \"they let you do it?\" Or his infamous suggestion to inject bleach to cure COVID? The list goes on, full of conspiracies (Sen. Ted Cruz's father helped assassinate John F. Kennedy), fabrications (President Obama wasn't born in the United States), and false claims (the 2016 Iowa caucuses were \"rigged,\" but by Cruz, not Democrats.)\n\nBack then, at least some GOP politicians publicly denounced him. But those days are gone.\n\nTrump has made it clear he will exact revenge on any Republican who dares to voice even the slightest disapproval. On this -- unlike his promises of \"infrastructure week\" or to replace the Affordable Care Act with something \"terrific\" -- Trump has kept his word. Nervous office-holders understand the message when Liz Cheney, the GOP congresswoman who dared to hold televised hearings on the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol, lost her Wyoming seat.\n\nAs a result, we hear from Republican acolytes who insist that every charge against him is bogus, drummed up by Democrats, the \"deep state,\" and a weaponized judicial system.\n\nThey dismiss the Manhattan jury finding Trump guilty of 34 felonies. They bristle at the suggestion he did anything improper as the Capitol descended into chaos, or jeopardized national security in stashing top-secret documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate. What they ignore is that in all these cases, most of the evidence comes from Republicans, including Trump's own associates.\n\nIn the New York trial, the key witnesses against Trump were two men he knew for decades: Michael Cohen, his former lawyer and \"fixer,\" and David Pecker, the National Enquirer publisher. Pecker described his friendship with Trump before explaining their \"catch-and-kill\" deal to buy off porn star Stormy Daniels and bury her story. A young Trump aide, Hope Hicks, took the stand and acknowledged the campaign panicked after the \"Access Hollywood\" tape was leaked. Hicks, who was part of the former president's inner circle, also testified that Trump knew about the hush money for Daniels, which likely proved critical to his conviction.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump should be facing trial in Georgia. He was caught on a recorded conference call in early January 2021 pressuring Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to \"find 11,780 votes,\" or the extra one needed to win the state. Raffensperger is a staunch Republican who voted for Trump. But that didn't stop Trump from threatening him.\n\nIt's hard to forget the impassioned plea of Gabriel Sterling, another top Georgia election official, who had also voted for Trump. His forceful rebuke noted Trump had \"the rights to go to the courts. What you don't have the ability to do -- and you need to step up and say this -- is stop inspiring people to commit potential acts of violence. Someone's going to get hurt, someone's going to get shot, someone's going to get killed. And it's not right.\"\n\nOther pro-Trump Republicans have revealed the pressure they faced to overturn the 2020 election results in their states. Among them are Russell \"Rusty\" Bowers, then the House speaker in Arizona, and Andrew Hitt, former chairman of the Wisconsin Republican Party, who admitted on national television he had posed as a fake elector for Trump. Some faced severe harassment; Sterling spoke out after he discovered a Georgia elections worker was getting death threats.\n\nIf it hadn't been for the testimony of Trump staffers and lawyers, our country still would know little about his refusal to do anything to stop the Capitol attack. Some of the former president's close aides resigned in protest, but others only described Trump's actions reluctantly, under subpoena, when called before the Jan. 6 congressional committee.\n\nAll that seems forgotten. Republican politicians have embraced Trump's aggrieved view of himself as victim, persecuted by President Biden and a Democratic cabal, that's entirely divorced from the past. No one is willing to answer why all the so-called \"corrupt\" and \"rigged\" criminal cases grew out of accusations from Trump supporters and members of his own party.\n\nRepublicans desperate to defend Trump could learn something about courage and integrity from their fellow party members, who upheld their duty and did not shirk from the truth.", "source": {"uri": "baltimoresun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Baltimore Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "steven_p_grossman@baltimoresun.com", "name": "Steven P.

Part of that strategy is to hammer Democrats on abortion and to frame the opposite party as being too \"radical,\" one lawmaker told the Washington Examiner.\n\nDemocrats have historically dominated the conversation surrounding abortion, often framing Republicans as restricting personal freedoms. That message has been used to motivate voter turnout, most recently evidenced in the 2022 midterm elections, in which Democrats managed to fend off a predicted \"red wave\" by targeting Republicans over the reversal of Roe v. Wade.\n\nNow, Trump is urging lawmakers to go on the offensive and reframe the overturning of Roe as a win for states' rights and the Republican Party.\n\n\"[Trump] said make sure that you exercise your own conscience to talk about it, share your conviction, and do that in a way that makes sense to people. And I think he made a good point,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) told reporters. \"The states are handling the issue right now, and that's where he's comfortable keeping it. We've made the point that before you can have political consensus on a difficult issue, you have to have cultural consensus. And right now, we just don't have the numbers in Congress to do anything on the federal level.\"\n\nTrump's advice on abortion comes on the same day the Supreme Court dismissed a challenge to the common abortion drug mifepristone, ruling that the pill may continue to be prescribed online and shipped by mail. The case responds to a lawsuit by the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, a group of religious doctors who oppose abortion, to reverse the Food and Drug Administration's 2000 approval of the drug.\n\nTrump also touched on other policy matters, such as immigration, foreign aid, and taxes, according to lawmakers who attended the meeting. However, many described the visit as a pep talk to urge unity within the party as the 2024 election cycle ramps up.\n\n\"He used the term 'saving the country,'\" said Rep. August Pfluger (R-TX), who also confirmed Trump said abortion decisions should be left to the states. \"This is important to save the country, and he outlined the issues that he thought were part of that: the border crisis, the attack on domestic-produced, American-made energy, [and] inflation. Those were a couple of the key topics.\"\n\nAnother lawmaker in attendance said Trump stressed that abortion should be a state-level issue while advising that it shouldn't be seen as walking away from convictions but just being smart about how to talk about a topic that is divisive in the country.\n\nTrump's message comes as party leaders say they want to work in \"close coordination\" with a possible Trump administration in the future that will keep the party united on all fronts -- something Johnson said has cost the party in the past.\n\n\"We lost a few steps, frankly ... because the plan was not fully prepared and the implementation lagged a little bit,\" Johnson said of Republicans' loss of the House majority in 2018. \"We're not going to make that mistake again.\"\n\nTrump urged lawmakers to remain unified, a special message as House Republicans have experienced a tumultuous year in the majority that has been marked by intraparty tension and public feuding.\n\nThe former president repeatedly praised Johnson's performance as speaker, even telling Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) to \"be nice\" to him -- a playful jab at her effort to oust Johnson from the speakership last month.\n\nLawmakers who attended the meeting said they felt confident in Trump's ability to lead the party to victory in November and lauded his strategy to grow the GOP majority.\n\n\"He's very good at pointing out what's wrong with this country,\" Rep. Tim Burchett (R-TN) said. \"But he's even better about pointing out what we need to do to fix it.\"\n\nOthers acknowledged that while Trump's presence will be beneficial to Republicans running in November, they can't solely rely on the former president to grow the majority.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\n\"He's not going to carry the load for us. We can't just stop working as individuals,\" Rep. Kevin Hern (R-OK) told reporters. \"Every member of Congress that I know is working hard to make sure that we keep the majority and grow the majority.\"\n\nThe planned visit comes as Trump prepares to make the rounds with GOP lawmakers in Washington, D.C., this week, including a meeting with Republican senators later Thursday afternoon. The former president will meet with Johnson again in Mar-a-Lago on Monday, along with National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Richard Hudson (R-NC).", "source": {"uri": "washingtonexaminer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Washington Examiner"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cami_mondeaux@washingtonexaminer.com", "name": "Cami Mondeaux", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Abortion"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "2024 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_v._Wade", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Roe v.

Pardoned just a month later, Nixon would spend the rest of his years in quiet retirement, always tainted by Watergate.\n\nThirty years ago, a special counsel was appointed to review President Bill Clinton's involvement in the failed Whitewater real estate project; scandals for Clinton snowballed from there, as Paula Jones and Monica Lewinsky came into the public eye for their alleged affairs with the President. Clinton remained defiant and successfully withstood a Senate impeachment trial. He went on to set up a multi-billion-dollar charitable foundation, and former First Lady Hillary Clinton went on to become a U.S. Senator, Secretary of State, and the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nIn the current era, Donald Trump, a Democrat until 2009, burst onto the political scene in 2015 as a dark horse and quickly eliminated his Republican primary competitors, clinching the 2016 GOP nomination despite bombastic rhetoric where he mocked the handicapped, weathered the emergence of previous wildly inappropriate remarks about women, and made many other provocative statements that either delighted or horrified voters. He won the election handily with 304 electoral votes but lost the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes.\n\nOn May 30, 2024, former President Trump was convicted by a Manhattan jury of 34 charges to illegally influence the 2016 election by paying $130,000 in hush money to silence a porn actress who said they had sex.\n\nThere is nothing in the Constitution preventing a convicted felon from running for President. The legacies of Nixon and Clinton and hyperpolarization of politics have made voters increasingly numb to Presidents behaving badly.\n\nAs with all things Trump, the Manhattan verdict is generating a lot of emotion on both sides. No one is denying the hush money payment was made, particularly as former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen was charged in 2018 for making the payment for the campaign, reached a plea deal, and served time.\n\nAt this point, days after the verdict, several things seem obvious. First, Trump will not see prison time for some time, if at all. While it is technically on the table, Trump has no prior offenses, and the judge already opted to merely fine Trump for his inappropriate behavior during the trial, where regular citizens acting similarly would have been jailed. And of course, this verdict will be tied up for years in appeals. It's even possible the appeals process could outlive the defendant.\n\nSecond, the verdict will have a minimal impact on the election. As I wrote last week, the Americans who will decide the 2024 election - those voting in swing states - appear to be voting with their wallets, not over policy or ethics.\n\nThe verdict has become the GOP's newest litmus test, and that is a shame. Former Maryland governor Larry Hogan, now running for the Senate, posted on X about \"respect for the rule of law.\" A Trump campaign staffer responded, \"You just ended your campaign.\"\n\nWith nothing else to offer voters but Trump - no real platform or issues - the Republican Party is hamstringing itself yet again when it comes to gaining more GOP registrants or new Congressional seats. The Republican House had the opportunity to orchestrate a win with the GOP Senate on border security earlier this year; instead they opted to leave it to Trump.\n\nIn the meantime, the White House is expected to issue this week an executive order effectively sealing the border to asylum seekers when daily border traffic reaches 2,500 (basically meaning immediately). The Trump gamble for key legislation isn't a winner for GOP legislators (it may not be a winner for President Biden who still has abysmal approval ratings over the economy and immigration).\n\nFinally, the New York verdict all but guarantees across-the-board legal retaliation from Republicans. The GOP coined the term \"lawfare\" and it will be willing to wage it in return, beginning with Donald Trump in a second term in the White House.\n\nI am not a lawyer, and I am not going to spend column space parsing whether the Manhattan district attorney was correct in determining that pursuing the felony prosecution was appropriate. I will instead note that Alvin Bragg campaigned for his job on the assertion that he was the right attorney to prosecute Donald Trump.\n\nThe Stormy Daniels case, while seedy and beneath the dignity of the Presidency, pales in significance to the Federal case in Florida alleging that Trump used classified government documents as personal trophies, the Georgia case charging Trump and 14 co-defendants with trying to overturn the 2020 election (4 co-defendants have pled guilty), and the second Federal case also charging Trump with trying to overturn the 2020 election (augmented by evidence turned over to the Department of Justice from the Congressional January 6 hearings). These cases directly challenge Trump's fitness for office.\n\nLike many Americans, I wish to see Donald Trump held accountable for his actions. It's just not clear to me that the hush money verdict comes anywhere close to addressing the breathtaking liberties Trump has taken with the American system of government.\n\nMerritt Hamilton Allen is a PR executive and former Navy officer.

According to media reports, in the upper chamber President Trump even spoke warmly with Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and the 16 Wall Street DeceptiCons who are insistent upon his permanent removal from politics.\n\n(Politico) - \"Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and former President Donald Trump set aside their years-long cold war during a private meeting with Republicans Thursday, a gathering McConnell described as \"really positive.\" (more)\n\nNot surprisingly, Senator Rand Paul refused to endorse President Trump, preferring to talk positively about Robert Kennedy Jr so far.\n\nFactually, regardless of what any of them say, the Brutus delegation within the Senate will sharpening their scorpion tails quietly and wait for the most vulnerable opportunity to strike. All sixteen DeceptiCons, soon to be led in 2025 by Senator John Thune, will sting viciously and simultaneously. This is the one political constant in an ever-changing universe.\n\n[...] Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) said Trump's message was \"all positive\" when talking to the conference and centered on keeping Republicans unified headed into the fall elections. Tuberville sat next to Trump antagonist Romney (R-Utah) but said the former president didn't take aim at the senators who have not endorsed him -- nor did they criticize him.\n\n\"I haven't seen that Republican group as strongly united on all of those policy issues in a long, long time,\" Rounds said.

Dan Newhouse (R-Wash.) and David Valadao (R-Calif.). Trump seemed to be referring to Valadao, who had skipped the meeting.

John Barrasso (R-WY), a strong Trump ally, and fellow senators.\n\nThe meetings will focus on policies, such as closing President Joe Biden's open borders, the Trump campaign told the Times.\n\nTrump has about a two-in-three chance of completing the greatest political comeback in modern American politics, an Economist model forecasted onWednesday, which is strong news for the former president, who maintained his lead in swing states over Biden after being convicted in a Manhattan courthouse.", "source": {"uri": "breitbart.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Breitbart"}, "authors": [{"uri": "wendell_huseb\u00f8@breitbart.com", "name": "Wendell Huseb\u00f8", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C.", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington, D.C."}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Murkowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lisa Murkowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Collins", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Susan Collins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_McConnell", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mitch McConnell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitt_Romney", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mitt Romney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The New York Times"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Barrasso", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Barrasso"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Politics of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Economist"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare_and_Conflict", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Warfare and Conflict", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Conferences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Conferences", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 88}], "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/susan-collins-mitt-romney-lisa-murkowski-2-getty-ap.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9641178", "eventUri": "eng-9641178", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 123, "relevance": 1}

One sign visible from one protester read: \"No one is above the law.\" Some protesters implored Republicans entering the meeting to not \"drink the Kool-Aid\".\n\nTrump, the presumptive GOP 2024 presidential nominee, was found guilty last month of 34 counts of document falsification relating to hush money paid to an adult film star, Stormy Daniels, shortly before his 2016 election victory.\n\nHe has since corralled the Republicans into pushing a narrative line that the conviction is a result of the Department of Justice (DoJ) being weaponised against him by Joe Biden - even though the DoJ has no jurisdiction over the New York state court in which he was tried.\n\nThursday's visit comes a day after his Republican allies secured a significant victory in a House of Representatives vote to hold the attorney general, Merrick Garland, in contempt of Congress. Garland is being held in contempt for refusing to turn over recordings of an interview Biden gave to a special prosecutor, Robert Hur, appointed to investigate the president's illegal retention of classified documents.\n\nThe meeting was billed in advance as forward looking, with Trump supposedly focused on his agenda for a future presidency.\n\nThis was expected to feature pledges against cuts to social security and Medicare in what is seen as a boon to older voters, as well as a promise to make permanent his multitrillion-dollar tax cuts of 2017, which are due to expire next year.\n\nHe is also expected to amplify his plans for a crackdown on migrants trying to cross the US southern border and flag up plans for a U-turn away from the Biden administration's foreign policy priorities, which have included aid to Ukraine in its fight against Russia's invasion, per Politico.\n\nBut a focus on the legal cases against him is likely to be given equal - or perhaps greater - priority.\n\nThis could, according to Politico, include urging greater efforts to defund the office of special prosecutor Jack Smith. Smith was notably appointed by the DoJ to investigate Trump's role in the January 6 insurrection and the removal of classified documents from his presidency to his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida.\n\nCongressional Republicans are also preparing, at Trump's urging, legislation that would move state state cases against him, including the New York conviction, and a separate charge of attempted election interference in Georgia to federal courts.\n\nTrump apparently signified his desire for congressional support in an expletive-laden phone call with Mike Johnson, the House speaker, after his 31 May conviction.\n\nJohnson, who initially opposed an attempt by the far-right congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene to defund Smith's office, has now backtracked and held talks with the House judiciary chairman, Jim Jordan, about how to target it through the congressional appropriations system.\n\n\"That country certainly sees what's going on, and they don't want Fani Willis and Alvin Bragg [the district attorneys in the Georgia and New York cases respectively] and these kinds of folks to be able to continue to use grant dollars for targeting people in a political lawfare type of way,\" Jordan, a vocal Trump backer, told Politico.\n\nSome GOP members have expressed scepticism about the efforts on behalf of Trump.\n\n\"We accuse Democrats of weaponising the Justice system. That's exactly what we'd be doing,\" one unnamed congressman, apparently granted anonymity for fear of reprisals from the former president's Make America Great Again (Maga) allies, told the outlet.\n\nIn another development underscoring Trump's vicelike grip on the congressional party, five GOP senators, led by JD Vance of Ohio, reportedly in the running to be the ex-president's running mate, will announce a plan to subject lower level Biden administration nominees to confirmation votes - a move designed to use up senate floor-time - in protest against the hush money conviction.\n\nSuch appointments, including federal judges, US attorney and sub-cabinet level appointments, are normally approved without a vote.\n\nThursday's meeting was to be attended by senate minority leader Mitch McConnell, who has not met Trump since December 2020 after criticising him over the January 6 attack but who has endorsed his 2024 candidacy.\n\nThree prominent Republican senators known for their hostility to Trump will be absent; Mitt Romney of Utah, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.", "source": {"uri": "uk.news.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news",

Read it now.\n\nHouse Republicans sang \"Happy Birthday\" to Donald Trump to kick off their meeting Friday morning. What followed was a winding, hour-long discussion that saw the 78-year-old presumptive GOP nominee take shots at a king swing state city and possibly suggest a plan to eliminate personal income tax.\n\nIt was the first face-to-face meeting between Trump and Hill Republicans since the Jan. 6 riots, and began a day of gatherings meant to showcase his status as the party's leader.\n\nAs he presided at the Capitol Hill Club, the former president touched on the recent turmoil within the House GOP, jokingly telling Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga. to be \"nice\" to Speaker Mike Johnson, whom she tried and failed to topple earlier this year. \"It got a good laugh,\" said Nebraska Rep. Don Bacon.\n\nTrump also reportedly called Milwaukee, the site of the upcoming Republican National Convention, a \"horrible city.\" As the comment quickly spread across the internet, some Republicans suggested it had been taken out of context, though they seemed to disagree on what, exactly, the context had been. Various members suggested it was a remark about elections, crime, or simply insisted he'd never said it at all.\n\nRegardless, the Biden re-election campaign quickly assailed the comment. \"Milwaukee ... deserves better than a convicted felon, racist, and wannabe dictator who hates us and our values,\" Wisconsin Democratic Coordinated Campaign Manager Garren Randolph said in a statement.\n\nOn policy, Trump brought up a recent proposal to eliminate taxes on tips, per House Republicans in the room. But he also appeared to float replacing the personal income tax with tariffs, according to Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky.\n\nIf so, it was a retro idea: Import duties were the main source of federal revenue until the income tax was established in the early 20th century. Trump reportedly suggested during the meeting he was a \"big fan\" of former President William McKinley, a Republican known for his support of tariffs -- though there appeared to be some uncertainty about Trump's message.\n\n\"He talked about how we did our taxes up until World War One. It was all tariffs,\" Bacon told Semafor. \"So he mentioned that but...I don't know if he was suggesting we go back to that.\" He added Trump broadly talked about imposing tariffs as a tool to protect domestic industry.", "source": {"uri": "semafor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "semafor.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riot", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Riot"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_tax", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Income tax"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_state", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Swing state"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Bacon_(microbiologist)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Don Bacon (microbiologist)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Taylor_Greene", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Marjorie Taylor Greene"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2020_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2020 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Joe Biden"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Tariff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_National_Convention", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Republican National Convention"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebraska", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Nebraska"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Massie", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Thomas Massie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_McKinley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "William McKinley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "World War I"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Racism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax_Negotiation_and_Representation", "label": "dmoz/Business/Accounting/Tax Negotiation and Representation", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "label": "dmoz/Society/Activism/Strategies", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Personal_Finance/Tax_Preparation", "label": "dmoz/Home/Personal Finance/Tax Preparation", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://img.semafor.com/23d0ff411ad80b62fe7f5ca665dea398eb0e007f-1280x854.png?rect=0,91,1280,672&w=1200&h=630&q=75&auto=format", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9641178", "eventUri": "eng-9641178", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-06", "textStart": 460, "textEnd": 466}], "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 117, "relevance": 1}

We have to have a plan, and it has to be very carefully executed.'\n\nJohnson said that he will be meeting with Trump at Mar-a-Lago on Monday.\n\nBiden campaign manager says president will hold Trump accountable on abortion during upcoming debate\n\nThe Biden campaign plans to use the debate to contrast President Biden with Donald Trump on abortion - one of the biggest issues of the 2024 election and one that has galvanized Democrats.\n\nDuring a press call following the Supreme Court decision on the abortion pill, Biden campaign manager Julie Ch\u00e1vez Rodr\u00edguez warned Trump is coming for all Americans' freedoms.\n\n'We're going to be reminding Americans of all that's at stake for reproductive freedom, not just today, but on the debate stage, and every single day leading up to the election.'\n\nRodriguez declined to get ahead of the president's strategy but suggested it would be a major focus of the president.\n\n'We're going to continue to make clear, and what the president will make clear on the debate stage is the clear choice in front of voters and the clear contrast of, you know, someone like Donald Trump... versus President Biden who has a strong record of, you know putting forward and using the authority that he could to be able to protect medication abortion, access to contraception and access to women's health care.'\n\nHer comments come after the Supreme Court upheld access to the abortion pill but left the door open for future cases.\n\n'This case brought on by Donald Trump's allies was only one tactic in a broader, relentless targeted strategy to strip away access to reproductive freedom everywhere in this country,' Ch\u00e1vez Rodr\u00edguez said.\n\n'If Trump regains power in November, Trump's allies will be ready to deploy their plans to ban abortion access nationwide without the help of Congress or the courts.'\n\nKamala Harris tweets piercing response to Supreme Court's abortion pill ruling: 'Let's be clear who is responsible for overturning Roe' White House bashes Republicans' 'dangerous agenda' in statement on Supreme Court abortion pill decision\n\nPresident Joe Biden targeted Republicans and their 'extreme and dangerous' agenda in a statement on the Supreme Court abortion pill decision.\n\nToday's decision does not change the fact that the fight for reproductive freedom continues. It does not change the fact that the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade two years ago, and women lost a fundamental freedom. It does not change the fact that the right for a woman to get the treatment she needs is imperiled if not impossible in many states.\n\nIt does mean that mifepristone, or medication abortion, remains available and approved. Women can continue to access this medication - approved by the FDA as safe and effective more than 20 years ago.\n\nBut let's be clear: attacks on medication abortion are part of Republican elected officials' extreme and dangerous agenda to ban abortion nationwide. Since the overturning of Roe v. Wade, Republican elected officials have imposed extreme abortion bans in 21 states, some of which include zero exceptions for rape or incest.\n\nWomen are being turned away from emergency rooms, or forced to go to court to plead for care that their doctor recommended or to travel hundreds of miles for care. Doctors and nurses are being threatened with jail time, including life in prison, for providing the health care they have been trained to provide. And contraception and IVF are under attack.\n\nThe stakes could not be higher for women across America. Vice President Harris and I stand with the vast majority of Americans who support a woman's right to make deeply personal health care decisions.\n\nWe will continue to fight to ensure that women in every state get the health care they need and we will continue to call on Congress to restore the protections of Roe v. Wade in federal law -- that is our commitment.\n\nTrump campaigns 'bulls**t' reporting that he trashed 'horrible city' Milwaukee where 2024 GOP Convention is being held\n\n'Milwaukee, where we are having our convention, is a horrible city,' Trump reportedly told GOP House lawmakers Thursday.\n\nBut the Trump campaign quickly condemned any reporting he said that.\n\n'In other words, BULLS**T!' campaign operative Jason Miller wrote on X.\n\nThe Republican National convention begins in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on July 15. Trump is expected to be officially nominated as the GOP presidential candidate during the week of events.\n\nHe is also set to have a big campaign rally in Wisconsin next week.\n\nHowever, Rep. Bryan Steil, R-Wis., said he was 'in the room' and insisted Trump 'did not say this.'\n\n'There's no better place than Wisconsin in July,' he added on X.\n\nHouse leaders address abortion access after Supreme Court decision on mifepristone\n\nHouse Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries celebrated the Supreme Court leaving access to the abortion pill available, but he warned the fight is not over.\n\n'Today's decision is a victory for reproductive freedom, but this case should never have been heard,' he said in a statement.\n\n'Extreme MAGA Republican attempts to undermine the FDA - an independent scientific body - are unconscionable and unacceptable,' he continued.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson said after coming out of a meeting with Donald Trump that abortion was brought up during the meeting with House Republicans.\n\nHe said the ex-president claimed he was comfortable with the issue remaining in the states.\n\nJohnson pointed out even if lawmakers wanted to take action, Republicans in Congress simply do not have the numbers to pass legislation.\n\nTrump departs Capitol Hill Club after fiery meeting with Republicans Supreme Court ruling was written by conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh\n\nWriting the unanimous 9-0 decision conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh said that even though the plaintiffs do not prescribe or use mifepristone, they want the FDA to make it harder for other doctors to prescribe it and women to receive it.\n\nUnder Article III of the Constitution, a plaintiff's desire to make a drug less available for others does not establish standing to sue.\n\nNancy Pelosi's furious daughter hits back at Donald Trump's claims he would have been a 'great' match with her mom but she was too old\n\nNancy Pelosi's daughter avidly denied Donald Trump's account that one of the former speaker's daughters had told him he and her mom would have been 'great' together in another life.\n\n'Nancy Pelosi's daughter is a whacko, her daughter told me if things were different Nancy and I would be perfect together, there's an age difference though,' the former president said in a meeting with House Republicans on Thursday, according to Punchbowl's retelling.\n\nMultiple members confirmed to DailyMail.com that Trump had told the story of her daughter mentioning Pelosi and Trump would be 'great' together.\n\nSupreme Court rejects effort to trademark phrase 'Trump too small' on T-shirts\n\nIn another decision Thursday, the Supreme Court blocked an effort by an activist to trademark 'Trump too small' phrase used on T-shirts.\n\nThe term comes from a 2016 presidential debate in which Trump's hand size came up as a topic of discussion.\n\nRead more about the case here:\n\nMatt Gaetz says Trump is 'trashing' Ukraine aid, speaking about need for tax breaks in meeting with Republicans Trump shouts out Rep.

Admiring Something He Sought To Burn Down'", "body": "MSNBC host Nicolle Wallace compared former President Trump's Thursday Capitol Hill visit to an \"arsonist going and admiring something he sought to burn down\" during an interview with Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California.\n\nTrump convened Thursday morning with House Republicans at the Capitol Hill Club to discuss politics and strategy ahead of the presidential election, according to lawmakers in the room who spoke with the Daily Caller. Wallace on \"Deadline: White House\" made the comparison in reference to the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, with Schiff describing it as him visiting the \"scene of the crime\" and suggesting the former president inflicted \"additional trauma\" on Capitol police.\n\n\"Some of the law enforcement officials who protected the Capitol, the Democratic and Republican members who work inside of it, have become well known to our viewers, people like Harry Dunn ... I imagine some that we don't know as well were there today when Donald Trump was there. We likened it to an arsonist going and admiring something he sought to burn down. Do you have any sense of how law enforcement felt about Trump being in the building after inciting the insurrection on January 6th?\" Wallace asked.\n\n\"I can only imagine it is additional trauma given what they went through to protect this institution. And not just the fact he came back to the scene of the crime, but that these senators and house members who fled, whom these police officers so bravely defended, that they are rushing back to the person who put them all in danger that day,\" Schiff answered. \"That has to be, I think, the most disheartening. And these are law enforcement officers that went through one horror on January 6th and been through a different kind of horror ever since in how their service that day has been denigrated, how people have attempted to create a completely false narrative about that day.\"\n\nSchiff during a Thursday hearing repeated the word \"guilty\" 34 times in a row in reference to former Trump, who a Manhattan jury convicted on 34 felony counts of falsification of business records. Afterward, he accused Republicans of \"giving up their political souls.\"\n\nHouse Republicans greeted Trump by singing him Happy Birthday as he turns 78 years old on Friday and gifted him the game ball from the Republicans' 31-11 victory in Wednesday's Congressional Baseball Game before he spoke, the Caller reported. Trump mentioned during the meeting that he intends to do 100 tele town halls to help House candidates, describing these events as a \"secret weapon,\" according to a source familiar in the room.", "source": {"uri": "dailycallernewsfoundation.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "dailycallernewsfoundation.org"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Schiff", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Adam Schiff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Wallace", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "George Wallace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Law enforcement"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arson", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Arson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline_Hollywood", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deadline Hollywood"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill_Club", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill Club"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Caller", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Daily Caller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolle_Wallace", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Nicolle Wallace"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Capitol Hill"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSNBC", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "MSNBC"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "White House"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol_Police", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol Police"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Baseball_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Congressional Baseball Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law_Enforcement", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Law Enforcement", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "label": "dmoz/Society/Politics/Humor", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 98}], "image": null, "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9641178", "eventUri": "eng-9641178", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-01-06", "textStart": 519, "textEnd": 525, "freq": 3}], "sentiment": 0.1058823529411765, "wgt": 110, "relevance": 1}

The Wall Street Journal ran an editorial in 2015 headlined \"Trump and the Goodfellas,\" criticizing his history of working with and continuing to praise mobsters. When Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort was sentenced in 2017, the Journal scolded his \"poor judgment for hiring the notorious Beltway operator\" who committed a \"financial and lobbying scam, which is exactly what Mr. Trump risked in hiring a swamp denizen.\"\n\nAnd, while it has taken some time, subsequent events have vindicated the original concerns about Trump's sleazy ways. A huge number of his associates have been convicted of crimes, as has Trump himself.\n\nBut as Trump took hold of the GOP, his Republican critics had to either swallow their criticisms of his crookedness (the Journal itself spiked a second editorial on Trump's mob ties after he won the nomination) or leave the party. The new Republican view is that the reason Trump is facing a slew of criminal investigations and so many of his associates have gone to prison is that the criminal justice system is biased against Republicans.\n\nMatthew Hennessey, an editor at the Journal opinion page, has a column painting Trump and his associates as victims of Democratic \"lawfare.\" Hennessey's argument is that the sheer length of the Trump-world rap sheet is proof the legal system is meting out disparate treatment against Mr. Trump.\n\nHere is Hennessey's thesis:\n\nJustice is supposed to be blind. The legal jihad against anyone who ever did political business with Donald Trump has many wondering whether that's still true. The list of Trump associates targeted by Justice Department special counsel investigations and Democratic prosecutors around the country is astonishingly long. It's total lawfare.\n\nThe first example Hennessey cites for this disparity is that Robert Mueller brought charges against Roger Stone, Paul Manafort, Rick Gates, and Michael Flynn, but that \"anyone at the FBI who actually did meddle in the 2016 election\" was \"never prosecuted.\"\n\nThis does sound kind of unfair until you consider three points. First, Robert Mueller is a Republican, and while Trump prefers to handle the fact that many Republicans find him unfit for office and a criminal by defining them as Democrats, it does not make it so.\n\nSecond, there absolutely was a special-counsel investigation into the FBI interfering in the 2016 election. Trump demanded, and received, a yearslong probe by John Durham, a famed prosecutor, who tried extremely hard to prove the theory that the FBI plotted against Trump. The trouble is that the theory failed to produce any convictions. Its only charges melted in court.\n\nRepublicans spent most of the time Durham was at work rubbing their hands gleefully in anticipation of the gigantic scandal he was going to uncover. Now they sadly remember Durham's face-plant as more proof that somehow there was a real conspiracy against Trump that was \"never prosecuted.\"\n\nAnd third, the fact that numerous Trump associates were found to have committed crimes is easily explained by the hypothesis once raised by the Journal: that Trump is a huge crook.\n\n\"You can read the lamentably long list of Trump-world legal woes as evidence that no one is above the law, which is the view of most Democrats,\" Hennessey argues, \"Or you can read it the way half of Americans and 83% of Republicans do -- as clear evidence that a politicized justice system went after Mr. Trump and his associates because of who they are.\"\n\nNone of this would have happened under President Ted Cruz or President Ron DeSantis. That was a big reason the Journal wanted those guys to be the nominee!\n\nOf course Trump's various goons are being convicted of crimes at much higher rates than the Democrats. The \"lamentably long list of Trump-world legal woes\" is basically what you'd expect if you handed the most powerful office in the world to a mobbed-up professional swindler.", "source": {"uri": "nymag.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NYMag"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jonathan_chait@nymag.com", "name": "Jonathan Chait", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Manafort", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Paul Manafort"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Democratic Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_2016_presidential_campaign", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawfare", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lawfare"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_Street_Journal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Wall Street Journal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lobbying", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Lobbying"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Federal Bureau of Investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_counsel", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Special counsel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "2016 United States presidential election"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Flynn", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Flynn"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mueller", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Robert Mueller"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_investigation", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Criminal investigation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Stone", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Roger Stone"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Criminal justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States Department of Justice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Gates_(political_consultant)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rick Gates (political consultant)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_DeSantis", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ron DeSantis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Cruz", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ted Cruz"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Conspiracy theory"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecutor", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Prosecutor"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Social_Sciences/Criminology", "label": "dmoz/Science/Social Sciences/Criminology", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Gay,_Lesbian,_and_Bisexual/Politics", "label": "dmoz/Society/Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual/Politics", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Research", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/1f1/130/6d8fb9f760aca2b368ccb75d49388ad432-trump-populism.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9641178", "eventUri": "eng-9641178", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1137254901960785, "wgt": 108, "relevance": 1}

Johnson was one of a slew of House Republicans who made the pilgrimage to Manhattan to lambast the trial on Trump's behalf, and the newly reported phone call likely set the tone for Johnsons' public statements in the aftermath of the verdict.\n\nThe House Speaker told Fox News shortly after the conviction that he believed \"the Supreme Court should step in\" on the matter of Trump's criminal verdict. \"I think that the justices on the court -- I know many of them personally -- I think they are deeply concerned about that, as we are. So I think they'll set this straight,\" Johnson said. \"This will be overturned, guys, there's no question about it, it's just going to take some time to do it.\"\n\nAs previously reported by Rolling Stone, Trump has lobbied House Republicans to pass a law that would effectively shield presidents -- both current and former -- from non-federal prosecutions. Last year, Rep. Russell Fry (R-S.C.) introduced the \"No More Political Prosecutions Act of 2023,\" a law that would allow presidents and vice presidents to move state or civil cases against them to federal court. Johnson is one of the primary co-sponsors of the bill.\n\n\"I think it's common sense that you can't have the president sitting in the Oval Office worried about whether some lawyer or some local DA somewhere is going to go after him,\" the speaker told Politico in May.\n\nTrump will visit the Capitol on Thursday to talk to Republican lawmakers about his plans for a second term in office. It will be Trump's first time in Congress since the Jan. 6 insurrection, and Johnson was asked on Wednesday if he plans to speak with the former president about not fomenting another attack and committing to respecting the peaceful transfer of power. \"Of course, he respects that,\" Johnson replied, \"and we all do.\"", "source": {"uri": "rollingstone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Rolling Stone"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nikki_mccann_ramirez@rollingstone.com", "name": "Nikki McCann Ramirez", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Speaker of the United States House of Representatives"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Republican Party (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politico", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Politico"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felony", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Felony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Johnson_(Louisiana_politician)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mike Johnson (Louisiana politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Manhattan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Fry_(politician)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russell Fry (politician)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaceful_transition_of_power", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Peaceful transition of power"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_law_(common_law)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Civil law (common law)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oval_Office", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Oval Office"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Federal judiciary of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Capitol", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Capitol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Vice President of the United States"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_attorney", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "District attorney"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Lawyer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "United States Congress"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rolling Stone"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal_Information", "label": "dmoz/Society/Law/Legal Information", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime_and_Justice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Crime and Justice", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Law", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Housing", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Politics", "label": "news/Politics", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Donald-Trump-1.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9641178", "eventUri": "eng-9641178", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-31", "textStart": 341, "textEnd": 347}, {"amb": false, "date": "-01-06", "textStart": 2290, "textEnd": 2296}], "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 108, "relevance": 1}

Brandon Aiyuk has expressed frustration with the 49ers and is currently holding out of training camp. Brandon Aiyuk's close relationship with Commanders' quarterback, Jayden Daniels, may be a factor in his desire to join the team.\n\nSan Francisco 49ers wide receiver Brandon Aiyuk is at it again, creating more speculation that he may not play with San Francisco this season.\n\nAiyuk posted a screenshot of himself watching the Washington Commanders' practice on TikTok. Certainly not toning down the buzz around the star wide receiver that he could be traded to the Commanders due to contract negotiation talks not going smoothly with him and the 49ers.\n\nRelated 49ers, Brandon Aiyuk 'No Closer to a Deal' After Meeting\n\nThe team and wide receiver are still looking to agree on an extension, but they remain far apart in talks.\n\nAiyuk's Frustration With 49ers Brandon Aiyuk has been outspoken about his frustration with the franchise\n\nAiyuk just recently spoke on The Pivot Podcast about the difficulties he and the 49ers have had in coming to an agreement on his value. Aiyuk speculated that if he were not to play for San Francisco this season, he would likely play for the Commanders or Pittsburgh Steelers:\n\nProbably a Niner uniform. If not a Niners uniform, probably a Washington Commanders uniform. If not a Washington Commanders uniform, probably a Steelers uniform.\n\nAiyuk held out of 49ers mandatory minicamp and is expected to continue the action into training camp. Unfortunately for 49ers fans, it doesn't look like the player and team are any closer to reaching a deal, according to NFL Network's Mike Garafolo:\n\nFor Aiyuk and the 49ers, they had conversations recently. They are no closer to a deal, from my understanding, but they are also no closer to a trade request. That's never been something that he has explored in this case. Besides, he's got to get back to work sometime before training camp to see if they can get something done.\n\nAiyuk has a very close relationship with quarterback Jayden Daniels, who was with Aiyuk during The Pivot podcast. The pair played together in 2019 at Arizona State, when Aiyuk was a senior and Daniels was a freshman, and in the screenshot Aiyuk posted to TikTok, Daniels is taking snaps with the Commanders' offense, further fueling rumors of a potential team-up.\n\nAiyuk posted many other photos to his TikTok, including one that showed that he is only the third 49er wide receiver in 49ers franchise history to have five or more receiving touchdowns in 4+ straight seasons. The other two joining him on that list are Jerry Rice and Terrell Owens.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Stat: Brandon Aiyuk was the most efficient receiver in football in 2023, finishing 2nd in yards per reception (17.9), 3rd in success rate (70.5), and 2nd in yards per target (12.8). He was also top 15 in catch percentage (71.4), passer rating when targeted (124.0), and drop percentage (1.9).\n\nAs we draw closer to training camp and preseason, there seems to be something new every week, at times every day, regarding the disputes between the 49ers and Aiyuk. At this time, it seems as though Aiyuk will play for the 49ers without a new deal in 2024, though a trade can never be ruled out if the wideout goes too far with his social media antics.\n\nSource: Brandon Aiyuk\n\nAll stats courtesy of Pro Football Reference and all contract information courtesy of Spotrac unless stated otherwise.\n\nRelated Brandon Aiyuk Reveals Two Teams He'd Play For if He Leaves San Fran\n\nBrandon Aiyuk has named his preferred landing spots if he is traded from the San Francisco 49ers.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Commanders", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington Commanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Aiyuk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Aiyuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayden_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayden Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Network", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NFL Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Rice", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Rice"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrell_Owens", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terrell Owens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_State_Sun_Devils_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona State Sun Devils football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro-Football-Reference.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro-Football-Reference.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passer_rating", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Passer rating"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freshman", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Freshman"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/mixcollage-24-jun-2024-03-56-pm-3698.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713634", "eventUri": "eng-9713634", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.03529411764705881, "wgt": 239, "relevance": 1}

He's also listed the Pittsburgh Steelers as another possible option.\n\nAiyuk continued to push the Commanders' narrative this weekend by posting a clip of a Washington practice on TikTok.\n\n\"If not a Niners uniform probably a Washington Commanders uniform,\" Aiyuk recenlty said on \"The Pivot\" podcast when discussing his future. \"If not a Washington Commanders uniform, probably Steelers uniform.\"\n\nWith Daniels looking on, Aiyuk talked about the possibility of playing with Daniels in Washington if he and the 49ers part ways. Aiyuk is currently slated to play under his fifth-year option this season, but he has made it clear that he wants a contract extension. Aiyuk's asking price is reportedly the thing that is holding up a possible extension with the 49ers, who have said all along that they want to keep Aiyuk.\n\n\"Shit, there's a quarterback right there,\" Aiyuk said while looking in Daniels' direction. \"I'm thinking about what I can do with him. I'm thinking about, if the Niners don't want me to come back to play with them, I'm thinking about what I can do. I know what I can do.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time that Aiyuk has been linked with Daniels and the Commanders. Last week, Aiyuk told Daniels that the 49ers \"don't want me back.\" Aiyuk has also made other comments recently about the 49ers not wanting him. He recently responded to a report that stated that the 49ers and Commanders had had discussions regarding a possible trade involving Aiyuk prior to April's NFL Draft that never gained serious traction.\n\n\"But I thought the Niners was never tryna trade me?\" Aiyuk wrote on Instagram in regards the report.\n\nAiyuk has also been linked to the Steelers, who reportedly did engage in trade talks with the 49ers during the draft about acquiring either Aiyuk or fellow wideout Deebo Samuel. While they do have George Pickens, the Steelers are in need of another top-tier wideout after trading former Pro Bowler Diontae Johnson to Carolina earlier this offseason.\n\nAiyuk did have a meeting on Monday with the 49ers that reportedly went well (via NFL Media), well enough that the 49ers don't have any plans to trade Aiyuk, the team's leading receiver the past two seasons. But the fact remains that no extension has been agreed to.\n\nThe two sides were reportedly close to getting a deal done earlier this offseason, but that was before the receiver market skyrocketed after Justin Jefferson, A.J. Brown, Amon-Ra St. Brown, Jaylen Waddle, DeVonta Smith and Nico Collins each signed hefty new extensions.\n\nGiven what has recently transpired, it's likely that Aiyuk wants an extension that is similar to the ones his peers recently signed, which would pay him somewhere in the ballpark of $30 million annually. Aiyuk, who is currently slated to make $14.124 million this season under his fifth-year option, has a projected market value of $26.5 million annually, according to Spotrac.\n\nBrandon Aiyuk SF * WR * #11 TAR105REC75REC YDs1342REC TD7FL1 View Profile\n\nAt this point, it appears that Aiyuk and the 49ers are entrenched in a standstill. Either the two sides will find a middle ground, one side will decide give in, or a breakup will occur, either in the form of a yearlong holdout or a trade.\n\nGiven his recent comments, it's clear that Aiyuk wants to either re-sign with the 49ers, play alongside Daniels in D.C., or resume his career with the Steelers in Pittsburgh.

The last conversations between both parties had reportedly gone well, but Aiyuk continues to hint at a potential trade target on social media.\n\nAiyuk initially showcased a conversation between him and the Washington Commanders' quarterback Jayden Daniels, which showcased the 49ers receiver stating, \"They don't want me back, man.\" Though this conversation sparked plenty of rumors, Aiyuk continued to reveal that he would love to play for the NFC East team.\n\nWhen asked where he could see himself playing in the future, Aiyuk stated on \"The Pivot Podcast\", \"Probably a Niner uniform. If not a Niners uniform, probably a Washington Commanders uniform. If not a Washington Commanders uniform, probably a Steelers uniform.\"\n\nNow, Aiyuk has given his biggest clue yet that he would love to suit up for the Commanders.\n\nA screenshot was taken from a post by Aiyuk, showcasing him watching film from the Commanders. This could easily just be him having a fascination with the team and friend Daniels, but the continued linking between the 49ers receiver and Commanders is starting to get a bit more believable.\n\nAs stated, Aiyuk set up a meeting with the 49ers in hopes that both parties could come to some sort of consensus on a deal. Whether that deal were to happen before the start of the 2024 season or later, common ground would need to be found.\n\nReports indicated that the conversations between Aiyuk and the 49ers brass had gone well, but there continues to be evidence hinting that a potential trade could happen.\n\nThe talks between Aiyuk and the 49ers might have also helped in giving the team more information about what the receiver is looking for, contract-wise. Mike Florio of Pro Football Talk indicated the organization offered Aiyuk a contract in the $26 million per year range, which would have placed him in the top 10 of highest-paid receivers.\n\nThis deal was nowhere near what Aiyuk wanted, as he rejected the offer. The 49ers are likely not wanting to pay him $30 million per year, but maybe the Commanders would. The team and Aiyuk could be at an impasse, and San Francisco might now be exploring an option where they just get some quality draft picks for the four-year veteran.\n\nThis is just speculation, but Aiyuk continues to fuel the flames of rumors that he will be in a Commanders uniform sooner rather than later.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_brizuela@newsweek.com", "name": "James Brizuela", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Commanders", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington Commanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Aiyuk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Aiyuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayden_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayden Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFC_East", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NFC East"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Bay Area"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Florio", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Florio"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2424023/san-francisco-49ers-wr-brandon-aiyuk.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=07819b873173f0024796e72c70c91108", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713634", "eventUri": "eng-9713634", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2, "wgt": 226, "relevance": 1}

If the 49ers trade him, Washington makes sense as a destination, but the Commanders would probably rather see where they are next offseason before trading away valuable draft commodity.", "source": {"uri": "commanderswire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Commanders Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "bryan_manning@commanderswire.usatoday.com", "name": "Bryan Manning", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Aiyuk", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Aiyuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Commanders", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Commanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayden_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayden Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "CBS Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Bears_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brown Bears football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jahan_Dotson", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jahan Dotson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyami_Brown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dyami Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_McLaurin", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Terry McLaurin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courtland_Sutton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Courtland Sutton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamison_Crowder", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamison Crowder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Broncos", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver Broncos"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "label": "dmoz/Society/Military/Veterans", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 67}], "image": "https://commanderswire.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/42/2024/03/USATSI_21628660.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713634", "eventUri": "eng-9713634", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 221, "relevance": 1}

He later walked back that statement in an appearance on 'The Pivot'.\n\nOn that same podcast, he conceded to taking negotiations and the 49ers' offers to him 'personal'.\n\nAiyuk has since met with 49ers general manager John Lynch and head coach Kyle Shanahan to air his grievances. It was reported the meeting went well but, with no reports of progress in talks, the 2020 first-round pick was back on TikTok on Sunday.\n\nThis time his post featured him watching tape of Daniels practicing with the Commanders, who drafted Aiyuk's former Arizona State teammate second overall in this year's draft.\n\nAiyuk's close friendship with Daniels has led to talk, predominantly confined to the world of social media, about a potential trade to Washington for the wide receiver.\n\nESPN's Adam Schefter said last month that the 49ers and Commanders did engage in some talks about Aiyuk around the draft. However, Washington decided not to do the deal.\n\nAiyuk also talked up the possibility of playing with Daniels during his appearance on 'The Pivot'.\n\n\"I'm thinking about what I can do with him,\" said Aiyuk. \"I'm thinking about, if the Niners don't want me to come back to play with them, I'm thinking about what I can do. I know what I can do.\"\n\nAiyuk had 1,192 yards receiving in his final season at Arizona State in 2019 with Daniels at quarterback. Still, the odds of him reuniting with Daniels remain slim. The 49ers will not countenance an Aiyuk trade without receiving significant assets that could influence their 2024 fortunes. Once the first round of the draft passed, the chances of them trading their leading receiver rapidly diminished.\n\nStill, Aiyuk's willingness to keep stirring the pot indicates the 49ers have a lot of work to do to get a deal done.

Aiyuk is currently set to play out the year with a $14.1 million salary, which is a huge leap over the $3.9 million he made last season.

While the meeting was described as \"good\", no real progress was made either. Though it should be noted that the 49ers receiver has never requested a trade, a new controversy has emerged after Aiyuk's social media post.\n\nThe screen shows Aiyuk watching, perhaps studying film of the Washington Commanders' offense. Of course, this may just be him showing some love and respect for his former Arizona State teammate Jayden Daniels.\n\nStill, it's a bit of an odd frame to share. Is he hinting at a trade coming soon? Or is he just toying with everyone, knowing a message like this could spur tons of activity, like this article you're reading right now.\n\nPerhaps Aiyuk's just trolling us all. Football players love to have fun with social media. He could be just sitting back laughing at everyone, enjoying the chaos he just set off.\n\nFor all we know, the 49ers will agree to an extension with their dynamic route-runner in the next few weeks and this whole charade will be forgotten.

The 26-year-old wide receiver continues to hint at a desired reunion with Jayden Daniels on the Washington Commanders.\n\nHowever, he is still under contract with his current team.\n\nAiyuk is entering his fifth season with the 49ers and will play 2024 on a rookie option that is standard for first round picks. He will make approximately $14 million. That number is far less than most other pass-catchers coming off of back-to-back 1,000-yard+ seasons but San Francisco is unwilling to meet his demands on what would be a rather large contract extension.\n\nAs a result of the discrepancy, Aiyuk is caught somewhere in the unknown. Nobody really knows what is going on with the former No. 25 overall draft pick.\n\nThe general consensus is that Aiyuk would like to be traded to a team that will pay him and his activity on social media appears to back up that request. Two recent posts on TikTok also seem to declare his desired destination. Their exact messaging was left open for interpretation.\n\nAiyuk told Daniels over the phone that the 49ers don't want him back, which seems to imply that they aren't going to pay him beyond this upcoming season. His caption said that he was \"crying for real.\"\n\nFast forward to this past weekend. Aiyuk posted a series of photos set to music as an update on life.\n\nOne such image has created a lot of chatter. He was watching film of the Commanders. Daniels, drafted No. 2 overall, is at quarterback.\n\nAiyuk caught 65 passes for 1,192 yards and eight touchdowns from Daniels as a senior at Arizona State. The former clearly wants to run it back with the latter.\n\nBrandon Aiyuk's infatuation with Jayden Daniels is presumably infuriating for both sides.\n\nOn one end, John Lynch and the front office in San Francisco are stuck with two brutal options. They can allow Aiyuk to play out his contract while frustrated and run the risk of losing him as a free agent. They could also try to trade him, but Aiyuk's public disgruntlement tanks their leverage and potential ROI.\n\nOn the other end, Aiyuk is watching practice film of Washington. Assuming that the tape was shared with him by Daniels, he put his friend on blast by sharing the unauthorized access to social media. The Commanders can't love that their rookie quarterback is slinging film to his friends on other teams -- in the same conference. That is not typically allowed.\n\nEverything going on with Aiyuk is rather confusing.

Mandatory Credit: Lucas Peltier-USA TODAY Sports.\n\nThe Brandon Aiyuk saga with the 49ers is turning into one of the NFL's hottest off-season dramas. From openly questioning his future with the team to dropping hints about suiting up for the Steelers or Commanders, Aiyuk's keeping fans on their toes with every twist and turn. Now, Aiyuk has stirred the pot once again with a TikTok post that has got everyone talking.\n\nThe picture shows the 49ers WR watching Washington Commanders practice tapes, and it didn't take long for it to blow up on social media. A DC sports fan shared a screenshot on X and racked up over 250,000 views, sparking a flurry of fan reactions.\n\nSome fans are calling Aiyuk out as a \"drama queen,\" telling him to cut the antics and just make the move to Washington if that's what he wants. One fan didn't mince words: \"Bigger drama queen than Deebo. Go have fun competing for last place in the NFC.\"\n\nOthers are questioning Aiyuk for potentially putting Daniels in hot water by showing everyone he is watching Commanders' practice tapes:\n\nThis latest move is seen as another nod towards Aiyuk potentially joining forces with his close friend Jayden Daniels on the Commanders next season. It's also fueling speculation that contract talks with the 49ers are not exactly going smoothly.\n\nAnd with all this drama unfolding, Aiyuk's future with the 49ers is looking murky at best. Even if they manage to hammer out a deal, the fans wonder if the 49ers' front office would still be keen on keeping him around after all this hullabaloo. However, ESPN's Adam Schefter thinks differently.\n\nWhile every fan has started believing that they have seen the last of Aiyuk in a 49ers uniform, the ESPN analyst painted a different picture for Aiyuk's future during his appearance on the \"Rothman and Ice\" podcast.\n\nSchefter believes the real question isn't about Aiyuk's 2024 season with the San Fransisco 49ers, but rather what happens after that.\n\n\"I would expect that he's in a Niner's uniform. I don't expect they're trading him...Whether they can get a contract worked out or not, that's a different issue.\"\n\nSchefter's opinion certainly makes sense as Aiyuk is still under contract, and he was a key piece in San Francisco's Super Bowl run last season. Why would the 49ers ship him off for future draft picks when they're focusing on winning the Super Bowl next season?\n\nThis whole situation might have put a dent in team chemistry, even if it's just a small one. The pressure would be on Aiyuk for 2024. If he doesn't deliver, other teams might subside the trade talks or would not wish to offer him Justin Jefferson money. And if he does end up getting traded, he would need to prove himself, wherever he lands, to justify the move.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "yagya_bhargava@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Yagya Bhargava", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Aiyuk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Aiyuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Commanders", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Commanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_LVIII", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl LVIII"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegiant_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Allegiant Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_coordinator", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Defensive coordinator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Valley", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas Valley"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayden_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jayden Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Schefter", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adam Schefter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Football Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Jefferson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Justin Jefferson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 70}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2024/06/0d0dde53-fi.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713634", "eventUri": "eng-9713634", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 210, "relevance": 1}

In fact, they should look at addition by subtraction and trade away in-demand players that may not be needed in the locker room. Let's take a look at three potential San Francisco trade options entering 2024 training camp.\n\nBrandon Aiyuk has been on the trade block all offseason\n\nAiyuk is one of the biggest names available on the trade market, and smoke has been billowing for months around potential deals to send the disgruntled receiver out of San Francisco. Ever since Aiyuk and the 49ers' front office reached an impasse in contract negotiations, it has appeared to be more of a matter of when and where the wide receiver would be dealt rather than if he would be traded at all.\n\nThe star wideout would be a welcome fit on almost any team, and he has the potential to elevate any receiving corps in the league. It was rumored that the 49ers had reached a deal with the Pittsburgh Steelers to send Aiyuk to the Steel City during the 2024 NFL Draft. Whatever the reasons may be, that rumored deal fell through at the last second and Aiyuk would still be on the 49ers' roster if the season were to begin.\n\nDiscontent can spread like wildfire and destroy a locker room. Which is why the 49ers are better off coming to an understanding with their star, rebuilding the relationship and keeping Aiyuk around for the long term or dealing him prior to training camp. The worst thing would be for the Niners to do nothing and just go into the season with question marks.\n\nThe question that remains to be answered is what Aiyuk will command on the trade market and how committed the 49ers are to sticking with their demands. There's little doubt that if they eased up on their price to deal the star, a deal could be made within the next 48 hours. However, Aiyuk is a prized asset and it's understandable that the 49ers want to obtain maximum value in any deal involving their star.\n\n49ers must consider moving one of their running backs\n\nThe 49ers have a surplus of running backs, and they will likely need to trade at least one of them in order to round out their roster. Elijah Mitchell is the most likely candidate to be traded as he features the best balance of being a proven player who will command a reasonable return while also not being essential to the team's future success.\n\nThanks to the addition of Christian McCaffrey, Mitchell has been relegated to a secondary role, but he's capable of being so much more than that. Additionally, McCaffrey is an all-around player who can dominate in the run game and the passing game, while also being a capable blocker. This reduces the value of second-string backs for the 49ers offense.\n\nWhen Mitchell's contract is up, he may value himself much higher than the 49ers. In addition to creating discontent in the locker room similar to the situation with Aiyuk, this could also lead to the Niners losing a capable player for no return.\n\nThe team would be better off preemptively addressing this situation and avoiding it altogether by having an honest conversation with Mitchell. Then, both parties can decide how to proceed, culminating in a potential trade if the team, the player and his agent all decide that is the best course of action.\n\nIt would also have a secondary benefit of showing others around the league that San Francisco values its players and does right by them. This may seem like a small thing, but it could be the difference between the 49ers landing a future free agent or missing out.\n\nDeebo Samuel could be moved instead of Aiyuk\n\nAnother player who the 49ers could consider dealing would be star receiver Deebo Samuel. It's likely they will deal Aiyuk first given that there is already discontent in the relationship between Aiyuk and the team, and that Samuel provides a level of versatility that Aiyuk doesn't.\n\nHowever, the possibility can't be discounted of the team deciding to build around Aiyuk, in which case they would likely trade Samuel. Aiyuk may have more talent as a pure receiver, but Samuel is an elite blocker and motion receiver who can take handoffs and create a big run.\n\nHe particularly excels on jet sweeps, which can drive a defensive coordinator crazy and put immense stress on defensive integrity.

They have young studs at wideout in Terry McLaurin and Jahan Dotson, but adding Aiyuk would given them the consistent threat at the position the team has missed in recent years.\n\nWhereas McLaurin is a game-breaking speedster, Aiyuk can thrive in the short-to-intermediate game, taking a six-yard out for a big gain. In 2023, he averaged over 17 yards per reception, had 28 receptions over 20 yards, and amassed 382 YAC.\n\nFor all of the attention paid to all-world tight end George Kittle and fellow wideout Deebo Samuel, Aiyuk was equally as important to that team's offense a season ago.\n\nWith that said, the last thing the defending NFC champs should want right now is even a respectfully disgruntled wide out in the locker room. If the team knows it is not going to sign him to an deserved extension, rather than letting hard feelings fester, trade him and get something in return rather than letting Aiyuk walk next offseason for nothing.\n\nThe Commanders are a team that could use an upgrade at the position and making matters more intriguing for the organization is Aiyuk's history with Daniels. They were teammates in 2019 at Arizona State, where they hooked up for eight of the quarterback's 17 passing touchdowns.\n\nThere is proven chemistry, Aiyuk clearly sees something promising about the squad to have both mentioned them by name in his interview with Clark and Co. and posted a picture of their practice film on his social media.\n\nWhile the 49ers front office, led by general manager John Lynch, has made several excellent decisions while building an almost-dynasty, this one has the potential to be clear mistake. Trade Aiyuk, reap the rewards, and both teams can move on.\n\nOr, sign him to an extension and get a jump on things before feelings are hurt beyond repair.", "source": {"uri": "bleacherreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleacher Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "erik_beaston@bleacherreport.com", "name": "Erik Beaston", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_LVIII", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl LVIII"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Aiyuk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Aiyuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channing_Crowder", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Channing Crowder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Clark_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Clark (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Taylor_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fred Taylor (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFC_Championship_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NFC Championship Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jahan_Dotson", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jahan Dotson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayden_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jayden Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_McLaurin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terry McLaurin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Quinn_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dan Quinn (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Kittle", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Kittle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Schefter", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adam Schefter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisman_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heisman Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deebo_Samuel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deebo Samuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lynch_(American_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "John Lynch (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_State_Sun_Devils_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona State Sun Devils football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Football Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://media.bleacherreport.com/image/upload/c_fill,g_faces,w_3800,h_2000,q_95/v1720437429/shfuvyejkw2bsrzn9dta.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713634", "eventUri": "eng-9713634", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.04313725490196085, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

Mandatory Credit: Kelley L Cox-USA TODAY Sports / Kelley L Cox-USA TODAY Sports\n\nIs it really possible that 2024 will be Brandon Aiyuk's final season on the 49ers?\n\nHe says he wants to stay with the 49ers and they say they want to keep him for the rest of his career, but they're still far apart in contract negotiations according to reports. The 49ers have offered roughly $26 million per season while Brandon Aiyuk seems to want closer to $30 million per season. And so they're in a standoff.\n\nAiyuk wants $30 million per season because the Lions recently gave Amon-Ra St. Brown a four-year, $120 million extension and Aiyuk arguably is better than him. But the 49ers don't have to give Aiyuk all that money because he's under contract for one more year plus they can franchise tag him after that.\n\nIt's possible the two sides never will compromise, Aiyuk will play out the final year of his rookie deal and then the 49ers will franchise tag him and trade him next offseason. It's also possible they'll agree to a deal by the end of the month.\n\nIf the 49ers have offered $26 million per season and Aiyuk wants $30 million annually on average, it seems reasonable that the two sides could compromise at $28 million per season. Then they simply would have to figure out how much money to guarantee. If the 49ers were to guarantee roughly $50 million of the extension, I'm guessing Aiyuk would agree to it considering St. Brown got less than $35 million guaranteed.\n\nAs of now, it seems likely Aiyuk will sign his extension in the next few weeks.

Reviewing 3 potential Brandon Aiyuk trade scenarios", "body": "Before you start yelling at me, let me clearly state that I don't believe Brandon Aiyuk gets traded. However, that doesn't stop other analysts from firing up their trade machine trying to come up with trade proposals for Aiyuk.\n\nCody Benjamin of CBS Sports came up with three proposals for Aiyuk that include Washington.\n\nLet's review all three proposals and vote on them, shall we?\n\nAiyuk by himself is probably worth a touch more than a first-rounder; the Philadelphia Eagles, for example, sent a first- and third-rounder to the Tennessee Titans for A.J. Brown in 2022, and unlike Brown at the time, Aiyuk is coming off a career year. The Brown deal occurred during the draft, however, and the Commanders aren't in dire need of a splashy upgrade out wide, with Terry McLaurin already in tow. Couple that with the 49ers owning more leverage than Aiyuk in contract talks, and securing a Day 1 pick via trade might actually be considered a major San Francisco victory this late in the offseason. Seeing as Washington is just kicking off a new regime, the Commanders could end up owning an early or mid-first-rounder in 2025, enhancing the appeal of their pick.\n\nVerdict:\n\nIf Aiyuk wasn't dealt during the draft for a first-round pick, then this deal would be even far more unlikely. With the 49ers holding Aiyuk's fifth-year option, the smart move would be to let Aiyuk play on the option and then deal him on draft day in 2025 for a first-rounder. Knocking down the offense for a future first-round pick is a blow to the 49ers' Super Bowl chances. The answer is NO.\n\nProposal 2:\n\nAiyuk to Washington for Dyami Brown, 2025 second-round pick, and 2025 fourth-round pick\n\nHere are Benjamin's thoughts:\n\nIn this scenario, the 49ers don't net a coveted first-rounder, but they secure what figures to be a relatively high Day 2 selection, plus a fourth-rounder that'd give them a grand total of six picks in the first four rounds of the 2025 draft. Brown isn't really a needle-mover after three underwhelming NFL seasons, but the former North Carolina prospect has specific traits (blocking aggression, deep speed) that could translate quickly to Kyle Shanahan's offense, providing rotational depth behind Deebo Samuel, Jauan Jennings, and rookie first-rounder Ricky Pearsall.\n\nVerdict:\n\nBrown has 29 total receptions in his career. Brown's ability to stretch the field is intriguing, but Jacob Cowing should get a look before taking on a reclamation project in Brown. The second-round pick is interesting to help the 49ers load the roster more, but ultimately this is a no as well. Brown would fall into a rotation with the other receivers and could find himself in the doghouse quicker than he could say \"Hey coach.\" I'll stick with Aiyuk at his price point since I know what I'm getting from him and do not have to bank on what a draft pick \"might be.\"\n\nDenver gets Jamison Crowder and Washington's 2025 third-rounder\n\nWashington gets Aiyuk\n\nSan Francisco gets Courtland Sutton and Washington's 2025 second-rounder\n\nHere are Benjamin's thoughts:\n\nLet's get funky, eh? Denver is in a bit of a contract bind of its own, with Sutton contemplating a training camp holdout as he seeks a pay raise entering Year 7. While Sean Payton may not prefer to part with his club's most accomplished wideout, he could also use more resources for the long-term build around rookie quarterback Bo Nix. Crowder is aging, but his reliability as a possession target would probably appeal to Payton's eye for efficiency. San Francisco, meanwhile, would essentially be renting a proven downfield starter in Sutton while also recouping a second-rounder by shipping Aiyuk to Washington.\n\nVerdict:\n\nThis is easily the most intriguing of the three proposals. Sutton, 28, is an established receiver in the NFL, but coming off a down year with Russell Wilson throwing him the ball. On top of that, Sutton wants to get paid, just like Aiyuk does, but most likely won't reach Aiyuk's dollar amount. Sutton would be a plug-and-play receiver while recouping a second-round pick, but if the 49ers are having an issue in negotiations with Aiyuk, would they jump at the chance to pay Sutton long-term or use him as a rental? The answer again is No.\n\nThis proposal feels like Benjamin comparing negotiation situations with Sutton and Aiyuk. Sutton is a fine player, but the team would be taking a step back with the idea they will need to pay Sutton too. For that, just pay Aiyuk.\n\nUltimately, the 49ers aren't in a rush to deal Aiyuk. The team holds the leverage with the fifth-year option and can revisit any trade talk next offseason before the draft if Aiyuk doesn't sign long-term. A similar situation could be Cincinnati and Tee Higgins, but I still predict the 49ers and Aiyuk find the middle ground and get an extension done shortly.\n\nStill, it's fun to discuss these proposals that aren't likely to happen. Can we please fast-forward to the extension being finalized and training camp?", "source": {"uri": "ninersnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Niners Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "jason_aponte@ninersnation.com", "name": "Jason Aponte", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Bears_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brown Bears football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Aiyuk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Aiyuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_McLaurin", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Terry McLaurin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Titans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tennessee Titans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_Eagles", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia Eagles"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyami_Brown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dyami Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jauan_Jennings", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jauan Jennings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deebo_Samuel", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deebo Samuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Reception (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans_Saints", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans Saints"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo_Nix", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bo Nix"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee_Higgins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tee Higgins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courtland_Sutton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Courtland Sutton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamison_Crowder", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jamison Crowder"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Payton", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Sean Payton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Wilson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Russell Wilson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 95}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XU6LNmZ7_jJucDSYYJ4muiT5vHA=/0x0:5069x2535/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25525055/2009170916.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713634", "eventUri": "eng-9713634", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

Excitement is sure to skyrocket with the season nearing, but all eyes will be on the contract situation with All-Pro receiver Brandon Aiyuk.\n\nWill a resolution be found by then? Or will this stalemate continue to linger? The last two months has essentially been a circus with Aiyuk using social media to increase his leverage. It started with \"likes\" and then video posts. Most recently he posted a screenshot to TikTok of practice film from the Washington Commanders, which is his attempt to fuel the trade rumors of him going there.\n\nIan Rapoport of NFL Network recently spoke on the situation saying Aiyuk has done a \"great job\" getting everyone to talk about him and his contract. But his main point to everything was that time is of the essence for the 49ers and Aiyuk with training camp nearing.\n\n\"What is facts though is that Brandon Aiyuk, who for sure deserves a contract extension, does not have one yet,\" said Rapoport. \"And really, it makes you wonder as well.. is he going to step on the field without a new deal? This market has defined itself very well and the fact that he doesn't have a deal done,, the clock is ticking on him.\"\n\nA month ago when Aiyuk was starting to intensify the attention drawn to himself, the reaction was that there was no concern.

Aiyuk is seeking a contract extension to make him one of the NFL's highest-paid wide receivers. However, progress in negotiations appears to be stalled, with both sides reportedly at a stalemate.\n\nMaiocco recently joined Marc Adams and Anthony Robertson on \"The Red and Bold Show\" to discuss the Aiyuk situation, emphasizing that an agreement is far from guaranteed.\n\nIf Aiyuk and the 49ers can't reach an agreement, the wide receiver might have to play on the team-exercised fifth-year option, which will pay him $14.124 million. The two sides would then likely reassess the situation next year.\n\n\"When you're at a certain spot in your roster building, if you have a good player -- and it doesn't even necessarily have to be at a premium position -- come up for a new contract, you pay him,\" Maiocco stated. \"If you like him, you pay him.\"\n\nThe 49ers are in a unique situation, though. Maiocco reminds fans that the 49ers have paid market value for star players in each of the past four seasons, including wide receiver Deebo Samuel in 2022. The team also restructured running back Christian McCaffrey's contract this offseason.\n\nAdditionally, the 49ers extended wide receiver Jauan Jennings' contract and used a first-round draft pick to add Ricky Pearsall. All of this comes while knowing that quarterback Brock Purdy will become the team's highest-paid player next year, consuming a significant portion of the salary cap.\n\n\"At some point, if your roster is full of really good players, you can't continue to pay market value,\" Maiocco continued. \"It just doesn't work.\"\n\nSigning Aiyuk to a massive contract extension likely signals Samuel's departure after the upcoming season. It's unlikely the 49ers can afford to pay top-tier money to two wideouts while also paying top-tier quarterback money.\n\n\"So at some point, behind the scenes, [EVP of football operations] Paraag Marathe is running the numbers and saying, 'Okay, here's the scenario. We can keep Brandon Aiyuk, but it might mean that, a year from now, [CB] Deommodore Lenoir, [CB] Charvarius Ward, [LB] Dre Greenlaw, [G] Aaron Banks, those guys are gone,'\" Maiocco remarked.\n\nThis has lowered Maiocco's confidence that a deal will get done.\n\n\"This year, I can see where they have to make a decision, and I think it's a logical and reasonable decision that they could make that, 'Hey, instead of re-signing Aiyuk for this number, let's re-sign these guys, multiple guys, and let Aiyuk walk now,'\" Maiocco noted.\n\nMaiocco went as far as to state that he puts the odds of the 49ers signing Aiyuk to an extension at around 50/50. However, he is confident that Aiyuk will remain in the Bay Area in 2024, whether on the fifth-year option or a negotiated deal.\n\n\"And then, what I would see is the 49ers would then, again, if they don't get this multi-year extension done with him, they would franchise him at the end of the season and probably trade him at that point,\" Maiocco concluded.", "source": {"uri": "49erswebzone.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "49ers Webzone"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_bonilla@49erswebzone.com", "name": "David Bonilla", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Aiyuk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Aiyuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBC_Sports_Bay_Area", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBC Sports Bay Area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brock_Purdy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brock Purdy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jauan_Jennings", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jauan Jennings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deebo_Samuel", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deebo Samuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salary_cap", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Salary cap"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerback", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cornerback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Banks_(American_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Aaron Banks (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deommodore_Lenoir", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Deommodore Lenoir"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dre_Greenlaw", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dre Greenlaw"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charvarius_Ward", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charvarius Ward"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Bay Area"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebacker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Linebacker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://static.49erswebzone.com/v/mRIVnt/content/media/article/cdc4ff7f7b3b5ebfda889d28b4c4138a.jpg?social=true", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713634", "eventUri": "eng-9713634", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1607843137254903, "wgt": 191, "relevance": 1}

One NFL insider shed some light on the situation recently.\n\nNFL insider Ian Rapaport recently talked about Brandon Aiyuk and his connection with Commanders QB Jayden Daniels on NFL Network.\n\nRapaport tried to make a distinction between which parts of the story are offseason fluff and which parts are facts.\n\n\"First of all, it's not like Brandon Aiyuk is getting practice film of the Commanders,\" Rapaport begins. \"Brandon Aiyuk, who is an awesome player, has done a great job of getting everybody talking during a slow time [of the NFL calendar.]... All of these things are happening in a dead time in the NFL so we're talking about it a lot.\"\n\nRapaport is right to point out the fact that simply talking about a possible trade does not mean it will happen. This just happens to be a long-lingering story during a time when media outlets are starved for football news.\n\n\"What is facts, though,\" Rapaport continued, \"is that Brandon Aiyuk, who for sure deserves a huge contract extension, does not have one yet. It really makes you wonder as well: is he going to step on the field without a new deal?\"\n\n\"This market has defined itself very well,\" Rapaport concluded. \"The fact that he does not have a deal done [means] the clock is ticking on him.\"\n\nWe hope that San Francisco can agree to terms with Aiyuk and keep him in the Bay Area for the rest of his NFL career.\n\n49ers' Brandon Aiyuk teases Jayden Daniels reunion with Washington Commanders\n\nOne of the main sources of fuel for Aiyuk's trade rumors are his relationship with Commanders rookie QB Jayden Daniels.\n\nThe pair are close friends who played together at Arizona State University for one season. Washington has a need for a playmaking wide receiver, so many have connected the dots that the Commanders could trade for Aiyuk.\n\nAiyuk once again teased that possibility during an appearance on The Pivot Podcast.\n\n\"I feel like I'm in the right spot with the right quarterback right now,\" Aiyuk said to Ryan Clark, \"but we're not on the right terms so...\"\n\nClark also asked Aiyuk a smart question about his relationship with Daniels. It led to a revealing answer.\n\n\"When you're FaceTiming JD (Jayden Daniels) or you're talking about him being your friend, I know you've never demanded a trade but if a trade happens, and that place happens to be Washington, how great would it be to reunite with someone you're not only close to on the field perspective but in your personal life, like Jayden who is also that talented,\" Clark asked.\n\nAiyuk responded by seemingly setting a timeline in which a decision could be made on whether or not he'll finally budge and request a trade out of San Francisco.\n\n\"I have one more meeting set up with the 49ers we'll see how it goes, if it doesn't go in a direction in which we are hoping for it to go then it would be great to link up with a great friend of mine, a brother, great person, teammate, and player that I feel could take my game to the next level.\"\n\n49ers fans are hoping that this situation can resolve itself ASAP.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ben_strauss@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Ben Strauss", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Aiyuk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Aiyuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayden_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jayden Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Commanders", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Washington Commanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_Network", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NFL Network"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Clark_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Ryan Clark (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Bay Area"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Arizona State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Brokerages", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Brokerages", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day_Trading", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Day Trading", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities_and_Futures", "label": "dmoz/Business/Investing/Commodities and Futures", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "label": "dmoz/Arts/Music/Trading", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Business_Services/Barter", "label": "dmoz/Business/Business Services/Barter", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Brandon-Aiyuks-viral-Jayden-Daniels-moment-gets-clarification.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713634", "eventUri": "eng-9713634", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 190, "relevance": 1}

So much so, NFL insider Ian Rapoport questioned if the wide receiver will even step on the field until he gets a new deal.\n\nRecently, Aiyuk stoked the Jayden Daniels and playing for the Commanders fire. He posted a screenshot of him watching Commanders' practice film on TikTok, whatever that means.\n\nRapoport quickly debunked that situation, but did wonder if Aiyuk will continue to hold out.\n\n\"First of all, it's not like Brandon Aiyuk is getting practice film of the Commanders,\" Rapoport said. \"First of all you can't do that, second, it's not happening. It sounds more likely here (he was) FaceTiming with Jayden Daniels, practice film came, took a little screenshot, boom posted it and there's your storyline.\n\n\"Look Brandon Aiyuk was an awesome player, has done a great job of getting everybody talking during the very slow time, getting everyone to know whether or not it's you know, do the 49ers really want him back, what his feelings, whether or not he believes the Commanders would be a team potentially trying to get to come and get him now that they have his good friend a starting quarterback.\"\n\nRapoport said Aiyuk's lack of a deal during an NFL dead period certainly brings it to the forefront. That's when you consider the other deals done with other big name wideouts.\n\n\"All of these things are kind of happening in the dead time and up so we're talking about a lot,\" Rapoport said. \"What is facts though, is that Brandon Aiyuk for sure deserves a huge contract extension, does not have one yet. And it really makes you wonder as well. Is he going to step on the field without a new deal? This market has defined itself very well. The fact that he does not have a deal is done, the clock is ticking on him as well. Another intriguing receiver awaiting a payday.\"\n\nAs a former first-round pick, Aiyuk had a fifth-year option on his rookie deal, which the 49ers opted to exercise instead of working out a long-term deal last year. Now, he's slated to play for $14.124 million this season, well below market value.\n\nOver the course of four years, Aiyuk has 269 catches, 3,931 yards, 25 touchdowns and 14.6 yards per catch. He set a career-high 1,342 yards last season, helping the 49ers reach the Super Bowl.The Commanders and the Pittsburgh Steelers are seemingly trade options, at least in Aiyuk's mind.

Once they lost in the Super Bowl, the first signs of his contract displeasure started to show up. His friends and family were posting cryptic messages on social media about Aiyuk leaving the team, and there have been various notable events since then that suggest a move for Aiyuk is possible. That all culminated in Aiyuk himself saying that he wants to play for the 49ers, but he would be comfortable playing elsewhere. He specifically named the Washington Commanders and the Pittsburgh Steelers as possibilities.\n\nBet Arizona released odds in the middle of last week for Aiyuk's eventual landing spot. If you are holding out hope for a late offseason trade for Aiyuk to the Steelers, these odds throw a bit of cold water on the idea. Currently, they have him at -345, with a 76.5-percent implied probability to stay in San Francisco. The Steelers and Commanders are tied for the second-highest odds, but they are quite low at +1250 (7.4-percent chance).\n\nOn one hand, the Steelers could surely use another starting wide receiver on the outside opposite George Pickens. It's one of the few glaring weaknesses on the roster. In an otherwise rebuilt offense, it could be the thing that prevents them from living up to their potential. Russell Wilson is under a one-year contract and there is no certainty surrounding his future with the team.\n\nOn the other hand, the draft capital that will be required to pry him away from the 49ers would be significant, and the Steelers would have to turn around and pay him his asking price, which reports indicate is $30 million average annual value and probably a hefty guarantee structure on top of it. That would be a franchise-defining move for the next few years, but who would be throwing Aiyuk the ball beyond 2024?\n\nIt seems silly to go all in on 2024 without the future of the quarterback position figured out. And are we so sure that Pickens can't be just as good as Aiyuk? If he is, then you probably can't afford to retain Pickens past his rookie contract. If they did, that would mean at least $50 to $55 million tied up in the receiver position without a clear quarterback plan in place.\n\nOmar Khan has done things a little differently from Kevin Colbert as the Steelers' general manager, so I am not going to say a move like this is impossible. I think the 7.4-percent chance that Bet Arizona gave is about right. The 49ers can maximize their Super Bowl window for 2024 by keeping him and deal with the salary cap consequences next year, likely moving on from either Aiyuk or Samuel.\n\nRelated Items:Bet Arizona, Brandon Aiyuk, Pittsburgh Steelers, San Francisco 49ers, Washington Commanders Recommended for you Ranking The Rooms: AFC North Specialists Analyst Outlines Three Positions Steelers Still Must Improve Joe Burrow Offers High Praise To T.J.

The 2020 first-round pick is entering the final year of his rookie deal, and there's no indicator that the two sides are close to reaching an agreement on an extension.\n\nAiyuk himself has also posted several cryptic messages on social media, leading fans to believe he's hinting at an inevitable trade out of San Francisco.\n\nBleacher Report's Kristopher Knox proposed a mammoth three-team trade that has the 49ers sending Brandon Aiyuk to the New England Patriots.\n\nIn Knox's proposal, the Pats would send star pass rusher Matthew Judon to the Atlanta Falcons, while San Fran would receive Mike Hughes from Atlanta, their 2025 third-round pick and New England's 2025 first-round pick:\n\n\"This trade would strengthen Atlanta's chances of making a run in the NFC South and net the 49ers a solid return for Aiyuk. The Patriots, meanwhile, would get a No. 1-caliber receiver to aid the development of rookie quarterback Drake Maye. With $43.3 million in cap space available, New England could afford to give Aiyuk the long-term extension he is seeking.\"\n\nThe Patriots haven't had a player hit 1,000 yards receiving in a season since 2019, when Julian Edelman hit the feat. Pass-catcher has been a weakness for a while, so New England could definitely use a playmaker like Aiyuk.\n\nAlso Read: Everyone Seems To Think 49ers Superstar WR Brandon Aiyuk Just Hinted At Where He's About To Get Traded In Latest Cryptic Post\n\nAtlanta also hasn't had a player hit double-digit sacks in a season since 2016 (Vic Beasley). Judon has posted 32 sacks in 38 games with the Patriots, so he would fill a pressing need in Knox's proposal.\n\nThe 49ers will open their 2024 season with a Monday night contest against a familiar foe, Aaron Rodgers, and his New York Jets.\n\nBrandon Aiyuk Is Coming Off A Career Year\n\nWhether the contract comes from the 49ers or somebody else, Aiyuk has set himself up for a massive payday

Pro Football Focus listed one move each AFC team should make before training camp, and for the Steelers, it was trading for Aiyuk.\n\n\"Brandon Aiyuk's contract situation is looming large in San Francisco. The former first-round pick will play out 2024 on his fifth-year option and is due to be a free agent at the end of the season. While the 49ers would like to have him back, we've yet to see a long-term deal play out. And when it does, it'll likely be for big money -- money the 49ers may not be able to afford. That could open the door for a receiver-needy team like the Steelers to make a move,\" Thomas Valentine wrote.\n\nEven if a contract doesn't get done this offseason, Aiyuk could still play out his fifth-year option and sign a long-term extension after the season. If that is the case, then the 49ers could look to move on from Deebo Samuel, but that's a discussion for 2025.\n\nGiven Pittsburgh's need at receiver and the fact that Aiyuk said he could see himself playing for the Steelers in 2024, it's natural to pair the two sides together. But it would break precedent for the Steelers to trade for Aiyuk and give him a contract that could be the highest on the team. They'd also have to give up draft assets to make a trade work. Breaking precedent isn't necessarily the reason why a trade won't happen, but there's seemingly been less and less traction on a potential deal over the last few weeks.\n\nAiyuk may be unhappy with his contract situation, but the 49ers are Super Bowl contenders and aren't just going to trade him for a weak return. Aiyuk also hasn't formally requested a trade, and the two sides reportedly held a productive meeting in recent weeks.\n\nThere's no doubt that trading for Aiyuk would elevate Pittsburgh's offense, and it would give the Steelers another top receiver opposite George Pickens. The passing attack would be significantly upgraded, and the Steelers would become a lot more dangerous, but there are a lot of variables, with the main one being the rising wide receiver market, that makes a trade feel unlikely at this point.\n\nYou can never say never, and maybe once training camp rolls around talks pick up or Aiyuk demands a trade. But right now, trading for Aiyuk just doesn't seem like something that will happen for the Steelers.\n\nRelated Items:Brandon Aiyuk, George Pickens, PFF, Thomas Valentine Recommended for you Oddsmakers Heavily Favor Brandon Aiyuk Staying With 49ers, Steelers Among Most Likely If Moved Carson Beck Named Player To Watch For Steelers In 2025 Draft Fittipaldo On George Pickens: 'I'm Not Convinced That He's Viewed Around The League As A No. 1 Receiver'", "source": {"uri": "steelersdepot.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Steelers Depot"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joe_clark@steelersdepot.com", "name": "Joe Clark", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Aiyuk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Aiyuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Football_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Football Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Football_Focus", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pro Football Focus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_Steelers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh Steelers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deebo_Samuel", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deebo Samuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Pittsburgh"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carson_Beck", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Carson Beck"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Pickens", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "George Pickens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek_Reduction", "label": "dmoz/Society/Work/Workweek Reduction", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://steelersdepot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/StockBrandonAiyuk2.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713634", "eventUri": "eng-9713634", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

Mandatory Credit: Lucas Peltier-USA TODAY Sports / Lucas Peltier-USA TODAY Sports\n\nBrandon Aiyuk is many things for the 49ers. He's an All Pro, an elite route runner, an excellent blocker, a vicious competitor and a tone-setter on the field. But he's not a captain.\n\nLast season, the 49ers' captains were Deebo Samuel, Brock Purdy, Trent Williams, George Kittle, Arik Armstead and Fred Warner. Nick Bosa lost his status as a captain because he held out of mandatory minicamp, training camp and preseason.\n\nThat's why Aiyuk most likely will not become a captain for the first time this year. He wants to be one of the highest-paid and highest-regarded players on the team, and to achieve that goal he's holding out for a contract extension, just like Bosa did last year. Aiyuk wants the 49ers to acknowledge his importance.\n\nAnd the 49ers have done just the opposite. They've shown Aiyuk just how replaceable they feel he is. That's why they drafted wide receiver Ricky Pearsall in Round 1.\n\nNo player who skips the offseason training programs can be a captain. Because a captain is a player who leads by example on and off the field and always puts the team first. Right now, Aiyuk is putting himself first while Samuel actually practices and leads.\n\nI'm guessing the 49ers' captains this season will be Samuel, Purdy, Williams, Kittle, Bosa and Warner. Those are the six players on the roster that the 49ers feel are the cornerstones of the team and the locker room. Aiyuk is an excellent player, but he'll have to continue to mature before he's part of that select group of leaders.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Aiyuk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Aiyuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_LVIII", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl LVIII"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegiant_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Allegiant Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_Valley", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Las Vegas Valley"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brock_Purdy", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brock Purdy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Warner_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fred Warner (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deebo_Samuel", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Deebo Samuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arik_Armstead", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arik Armstead"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Kittle", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "George Kittle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trent Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Bosa", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Nick Bosa"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Flying_Discs/Ultimate_Frisbee", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Flying Discs/Ultimate Frisbee", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Airsoft", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_7618,h_4285,x_0,y_440/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/all_49ers/01j27nt2kbttffafqvwt.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713634", "eventUri": "eng-9713634", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

In addition, being like us, won't they often learn life's lessons the hard way, through their own mistakes?\n\nAiyuk is a very talented wide receiver for the San Francisco 49ers. Aiyuk is entering his fifth year, and he wants more money. His on-the-field accomplishments reveal he will receive a new contract with a hefty pay raise.\n\nDaniels and Aiyuk became friends when both were playing at Arizona State. Aiyuk was then drafted by the 49ers in the first round (25 overall) of the 2020 NFL draft. Daniels transferred to LSU and, of course, was drafted second overall by the Commanders in April's draft.\n\nAiyuk's public statements in recent weeks about wanting his big pay raise are understandable to some degree. But what is not permissible is his posting a photo of the Commanders' recent workout.\n\nDaniels and Aiyuk have stated they are good friends. However, we often err when we wrongly think friendships are entirely different than other relationships. In fact, they are like other relationships in the sense all relationships NEED boundaries. If you don't set up boundaries, there are enough people out there (even those you consider your friends) who will walk all over you.\n\nAs Rick \"Doc\" Walker and Denton Day discussed Monday on the \"Kevin Sheehan Show,\" Aiyuk was using Daniels. Aiyuk was playing Daniels. Aiyuk is the alpha of that relationship.\n\nWhen you consider a friend your equal, you respect them. You afford them dignity. Boundaries are set and not to be crossed.\n\nEach of us needs to learn this, and often the hard way. Rather than destroy Daniels now for his immaturity in giving such access to Aiyuk, this is an opportunity for Daniels. Daniels could now set healthy boundaries that will actually help both he and Aiyuk respect each other.\n\nAs author Henry Cloud wrote in his book, \"Boundaries: When to Say Yes, How to Say No, to Take Control of Your Life.\"\n\nBoundaries are a \"litmus test\" for the quality of our relationships. Those people in our lives who can respect our boundaries will love our wills, our opinions, our separateness. Those who can't respect our boundaries are telling us that they don't love our nos. They only love our yeses, our compliance. \"I only like it when you do what I want.", "source": {"uri": "commanderswire.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Commanders Wire"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ivan_lambert@commanderswire.usatoday.com", "name": "Ivan Lambert", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Aiyuk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Aiyuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jayden_Daniels", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jayden Daniels"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_State_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Arizona State University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSU_Tigers_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LSU Tigers football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_\"Doc\"_Walker", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rick \"Doc\" Walker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Sheehan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kevin Sheehan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denton,_Texas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denton, Texas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denton, Texas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "label": "dmoz/Society/Advice", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "label": "dmoz/Society/Relationships/Romance", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 68}], "image": "https://commanderswire.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/42/2024/05/2152377672.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713634", "eventUri": "eng-9713634", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 183, "relevance": 1}

Mandatory Credit: Kelley L Cox-USA TODAY Sports / Kelley L Cox-USA TODAY Sports\n\nOn March 30, the 49ers signed Lions restricted free agent tight end Brock Wright to a three-year, $12 million offer sheet, which the Lions ultimately matched. So they kept Wright. But the 49ers made him more expensive for Detroit.\n\nA month later, the Lions returned the favor to the 49ers.\n\nOn April 24, roughly a week before the NFL Draft, just around the time the 49ers and Brandon Aiyuk were getting close to an agreement on a contract extension, the Lions signed wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown to a four-year, $120 million extension. And just like that, Aiyuk's price skyrocketed. Thank you, Detroit.\n\nThe 49ers hoped they could sign Aiyuk for $26 million per season, but now he thinks he's worth $30 million per season because that's what the Lions are paying St. Brown, who's not better than Aiyuk. So if the 49ers can't reach an agreement with Aiyuk, you can blame the Lions for that. They're on the verge of breaking up their main rival in the NFC.\n\nNow the 49ers have to decide if Aiyuk is worth $30 million per season to them the way St. Brown is worth $30 million per season to the Lions. And the 49ers probably will cave and give Aiyuk all that money because they can't afford to get worse and let the Lions pass them as the top team in the NFC this year.\n\nFrom the Lions' perspective, they would love the 49ers to trade Aiyuk for 2025 draft picks. Nothing would make Detroit happier. So the 49ers are stuck.

The two sides don't appear close to a long-term contract agreement, however, and Aiyuk continues to tease a potential relocation, this time by sharing footage of himself reviewing Washington Commanders practice film.\n\nAiyuk, remember, specifically identified the Commanders as a preferred landing spot in the event he and San Francisco can't come to terms on a new deal. While the former first-round draft pick is technically under contract with the 49ers through 2024, and the team has reportedly been resistant to trade inquiries, it's not out of the question the club could look to auction the pass catcher if negotiations continue to stall.\n\nIn that case, here are three potential trade proposals the Commanders could make:\n\nAiyuk by himself is probably worth a touch more than a first-rounder; the Philadelphia Eagles, for example, sent a first- and third-rounder to the Tennessee Titans for A.J. Brown in 2022, and unlike Brown at the time, Aiyuk is coming off a career year. The Brown deal occurred during the draft, however, and the Commanders aren't in dire need of a splashy upgrade out wide, with Terry McLaurin already in tow. Couple that with the 49ers owning more leverage than Aiyuk in contract talks, and securing a Day 1 pick via trade might actually be considered a major San Francisco victory this late in the offseason. Seeing as Washington is just kicking off a new regime, the Commanders could end up owning an early or mid-first-rounder in 2025, enhancing the appeal of their pick.\n\nIn this scenario, the 49ers don't net a coveted first-rounder, but they secure what figures to be a relatively high Day 2 selection, plus a fourth-rounder that'd give them a grand total of six picks in the first four rounds of the 2025 draft. Brown isn't really a needle-mover after three underwhelming NFL seasons, but the former North Carolina prospect has specific traits (blocking aggression, deep speed) that could translate quickly to Kyle Shanahan's offense, providing rotational depth behind Deebo Samuel, Jauan Jennings and rookie first-rounder Ricky Pearsall.\n\nLet's get funky, eh? Denver is in a bit of a contract bind of its own, with Sutton contemplating a training-camp holdout as he seeks a pay raise entering Year 7. While Sean Payton may not prefer to part with his club's most accomplished wideout, he could also use more resources for the long-term build around rookie quarterback Bo Nix. Crowder is aging, but his reliability as a possession target would probably appeal to Payton's eye for efficiency.

The two sides don't appear close to a long-term contract agreement, however, and Aiyuk continues to tease a potential relocation, this time by sharing footage of himself reviewing Washington Commanders practice film.\n\nAiyuk, remember, specifically identified the Commanders as a preferred landing spot in the event he and San Francisco can't come to terms on a new deal. While the former first-round draft pick is technically under contract with the 49ers through 2024, and the team has reportedly been resistant to trade inquiries, it's not out of the question the club could look to auction the pass catcher if negotiations continue to stall.\n\nIn that case, here are three potential trade proposals the Commanders could make:\n\nProposal No. 1Commanders get: WR Brandon Aiyuk49ers get: 2025 first-round pick\n\nAiyuk by himself is probably worth a touch more than a first-rounder; the Philadelphia Eagles, for example, sent a first- and third-rounder to the Tennessee Titans for A.J. Brown in 2022, and unlike Brown at the time, Aiyuk is coming off a career year. The Brown deal occurred during the draft, however, and the Commanders aren't in dire need of a splashy upgrade out wide, with Terry McLaurin already in tow. Couple that with the 49ers owning more leverage than Aiyuk in contract talks, and securing a Day 1 pick via trade might actually be considered a major San Francisco victory this late in the offseason. Seeing as Washington is just kicking off a new regime, the Commanders could end up owning an early or mid-first-rounder in 2025, enhancing the appeal of their pick.\n\nProposal No. 2Commanders get: WR Brandon Aiyuk49ers get: WR Dyami Brown, 2025 second-round pick, 2025 fourth-round pick\n\nIn this scenario, the 49ers don't net a coveted first-rounder, but they secure what figures to be a relatively high Day 2 selection, plus a fourth-rounder that'd give them a grand total of six picks in the first four rounds of the 2025 draft. Brown isn't really a needle-mover after three underwhelming NFL seasons, but the former North Carolina prospect has specific traits (blocking aggression, deep speed) that could translate quickly to Kyle Shanahan's offense, providing rotational depth behind Deebo Samuel, Jauan Jennings and rookie first-rounder Ricky Pearsall.\n\nProposal No. 3Broncos get: WR Jamison Crowder (Washington), 2025 third-round pick (Washington)Commanders get: WR Brandon Aiyuk (San Francisco)49ers get: WR Courtland Sutton (Denver), 2025 second-round pick (Washington)\n\nLet's get funky, eh? Denver is in a bit of a contract bind of its own, with Sutton contemplating a training-camp holdout as he seeks a pay raise entering Year 7. While Sean Payton may not prefer to part with his club's most accomplished wideout, he could also use more resources for the long-term build around rookie quarterback Bo Nix. Crowder is aging, but his reliability as a possession target would probably appeal to Payton's eye for efficiency. San Francisco, meanwhile, would essentially be renting a proven downfield starter in Sutton while also recouping a second-rounder by shipping Aiyuk to Washington.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cody_benjamin@cbssports.com", "name": "Cody Benjamin", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Bears_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Brown Bears football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Commanders", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Washington Commanders"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Aiyuk", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Aiyuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "All-Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyami_Brown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dyami Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_McLaurin", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Terry McLaurin"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._J._Brown", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "A.

Washington State Vs Arizona State 2019 /\n\nBrandon Aiyuk has been going on a tear in the past few weeks. He began this new tirade by going on the Pivot Podcast, which he asked to be on, to talk about his contact negotiations.\n\nAiyuk utilized this as a way to clear the air, and to use it as a tool for leverage in his negotiations. Aiyuk came into this interview with Jayden Daniels, which was immediately brought up by Ryan Clark, one of the hosts on the Pivot. He asked about the FaceTime call he posted on TikTok where he said \"They don't want me.\" Aiyuk clarified that they didn't say that, but instead said they were too far apart on their numbers and were unsure if a deal would come. He adds that it's most likely negotiating tactics to try to lower his asking price which he has refused.\n\nAiyuk also shed some light on the offered contract being leaked, likely by the Niners, and stated that it left him feeling disrespected and frustrated but knows that it's a \"dirty game.\" So with feeling disrespected by his team, why has he not demanded a trade? There seems to be two reasons.\n\nThe first reason is somewhat obvious, he's aware that he's in an awesome situation with this team. He stated, \"I feel like I'm in the right place with the right QB.\" If Aiyuk wants to win a Super Bowl, this team gives him his best chance. So why leave now when he could leave at the end of his contract, and take advantage of the opportunity in front of him?\n\nThe second reason is a lot more speculative, but I believe it's because of the fun he's having on his social media run. He made it very clear on the podcast that he is having fun and enjoys seeing his name being talked about by every big news company (I'll throw myself into the mix, because why not). He's the first player that I've ever see use social media in such a way to make his side clear and throw shade at the big organization. Is he loving being the first to do it? Is he loving his name being talked about? Does he love to see the impact he will have on future contract negotiations? Maybe it's one of those or all of them.\n\nThat podcast was enlightening to some fans to see him communicate about his frustrations in more long form content, rather than a small 15 second TikTok. It was a good way to see the entire story for him. And just when you thought it might end there, he posted another TikTok.\n\nThis one is the most interesting by far. This film he was watching isn't something he could just find on his own, it's training camp footage only accesible by the team. So with that, the only assumption that should be made is that his BFF Jayden Daniels sent it to him. It's a clear post to stir the pot more, but will it work? If I'm the 49ers and I see that, I'm making sure that if he does get traded it isn't to Washington. With everything he's done to make the Niners look bad, why would they let him go to the team he wants? Instead they would send him to the team that gives them the best offer.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how the next few weeks go, and especially interesting to see if he even plays this season.

Samuel must become the team's most explosive playmaker and provide relief in the run game for McCaffrey. With Aiyuk's departure, Deebo would see increased opportunities in the red zone to maintain the 49ers' offensive efficiency.\n\nThere have been many conversations about Brandon Aiyuk trade rumors, but there haven't been many discussions on how the San Francisco 49ers offense will be impacted if he is indeed traded. If Aiyuk is on the move, Deebo Samuel will be forced to step up his game.\n\nWhile Aiyuk wants to remain with the 49ers, there has been no progress in contract talks even after the team and player met recently. There's still a chance that Aiyuk could remain in San Francisco long-term, but at this point, they have to be realistic, and the 49ers should be prepared for what the offense could look like without him in 2025.\n\nDeebo Samuel's Career Statistics\n\nYear\n\nReceptions\n\nReceiving Yards\n\nRushes\n\nRush Yards\n\nTotal TDs\n\n2019\n\n57\n\n802\n\n14\n\n159\n\n6\n\n2020\n\n33\n\n391\n\n8\n\n26\n\n1\n\n2021\n\n77\n\n1,405\n\n59\n\n365\n\n14\n\n2022\n\n56\n\n632\n\n42\n\n232\n\n5\n\n2023\n\n60\n\n892\n\n37\n\n225\n\n12\n\nThe 49ers have plenty of talent on offense outside Aiyuk and Samuel, including George Kittle, Christian McCaffrey, and recently drafted wide receiver, Ricky Pearsall.\n\nPearsall will eventually fit in with the rest of the offense, but until then, Samuel needs to play at a top-five level in a scenario where Aiyuk is traded. Deebo has been productive throughout his career, but the 49ers absolutely need him to replicate his success in 2021 if his WR buddy does in fact kick rocks.\n\nRelated Top 5 Trade Destinations for 49ers WR Brandon Aiyuk\n\nBrandon Aiyuk has not officially requested a trade, but there is trouble in paradise. Here are 5 teams that could look to deal for the WR.\n\nReplacing Aiyuk's Explosiveness 49ers' could use a return to the 2021 version of himself from Deebo\n\nBack in 2021, Samuel was the explosive playmaker in the 49ers offense. Now, the torch has been passed to Aiyuk. Deebo was more effective as a pass catcher in 2023 as opposed to 2022, but Aiyuk still led the team in yards-per-reception, with 17.9 YPC, which was actually food for second in the entire league.\n\nBoth players have averaged 14.6 YPC throughout their career in San Francisco, though Deebo has been slightly less consistent over the years.\n\nIf Aiyuk were traded, it would be mandatory for Deebo to become the team's most explosive playmaker. Whether it be in the passing game or the run game, the 49ers would need Samuel to be the big play threat at all times.\n\nGIVEMESPORT Key Stat: Despite Deebo Samuel being viewed as the big-play guy, Brandon Aiyuk has eclipsed him in 20+ yard receptions in 2020 (10 to 8), in 2022 (17-7), and 2023 (28-15). Samuel did finish 3rd in the NFL in that category in his big 2021 campaign, with 24.\n\nBrock Purdy helped lead a ridiculously explosive 49ers offense in 2023 that was characterized by big plays. If Aiyuk is gone, Deebo needs to create more chunk plays to help keep the offense's explosive nature to them.\n\nProvide Relief In Run Game To McCaffrey 49ers'need to be able to run the ball more with Deebo, as McCaffrey's workload decreases\n\nWhat makes Samuel unique is his ability to run the football, which he may need to do more as McCaffrey's workload is expected to decrease. However, throughout the last three seasons, Deebo's usage in the run game has consistently decreased.\n\nSamuel Carries 2021-2023\n\nYear\n\nCarries\n\n2021\n\n59\n\n2022\n\n42\n\n2023\n\n37\n\nThere were reports that Samuel didn't want to be treated like a hybrid RB/WR in 2022, according to Bleacher Report, a far cry from his happiness with naming himself a \"wide-back\" during his epic 2021 campaign, which may be why his usage has decreased in the last two seasons.\n\nIf Aiyuk is gone and Kyle Shanahan is looking to reduce McCaffrey's workload, then Samuel has to take more snaps at the running back position. When Deebo is in the backfield, it gives the 49ers offense a dimension that most NFL offenses don't have.\n\nIncreased Usage In Red Zone Deebo would need additional opportunities in the red zone\n\nIt's surprising that, as versatile as Samuel is as an offensive weapon, he only has two seasons in his five-year NFL career with 10+ total touchdowns. Aiyuk has never been an ultra-productive red zone wide receiver, but his departure would leave approximately seven or eight vacant touchdowns a season. As a veteran wide receiver, Deebo makes the most sense of the 49ers skill players to eat up those vacated targets.\n\nSamuel is already a much more popular option in the red zone for Purdy, as the versatile bruiser had 17 red zone targets to lead the team in 2023, compared to Aiyuk's nine. Screens, swing passes, crossing routes, and any other plays where Samuel can get the ball early and use his vision and strength to bowl his way to pay dirt make him the perfect weapon inside the 20.\n\nThere's a clear difference in how Aiyuk is used in the red zone versus Samuel. Aiyuk is an elite route runner that can find the soft spots in coverage to provide Purdy with an open receiver. Samuel relies much more on creativity within the offense, either in the run game or near the line of scrimmage as a pass catcher, leveraging his yards-after-catch abilities.\n\nEven if Aiyuk isn't traded, this is probably an aspect of the red zone offense that Shanahan should tap into more. But if Aiyuk is gone, Deebo needs to be their guy outside of McCaffrey, especially in the red zone.\n\nAn Aiyuk departure would require every 49ers skill player to step up, but especially Deebo. If Deebo could perform at the level he did in 2021, then the 49ers offense would be in good shape despite losing an All-Pro wide receiver.\n\nAll stats are courtesy of Pro Football Reference.\n\nRelated 5 Trades 49ers Should Consider If They Don't Extend Brock Purdy\n\nIf the 49ers don't extend Brock Purdy, they need to consider these alternatives instead.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Aiyuk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Aiyuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deebo_Samuel", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Deebo Samuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reception_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Reception (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_zone_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Red zone (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_McCaffrey", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Christian McCaffrey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Kittle", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "George Kittle"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_(gridiron_football)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rush (gridiron football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catcher", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Catcher"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brock_Purdy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brock Purdy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Shanahan", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Shanahan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro-Football-Reference.com", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pro-Football-Reference.com"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleacher_Report", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bleacher Report"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-Pro", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "All-Pro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_scrimmage", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Line of scrimmage"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/mixcollage-08-jul-2024-10-03-pm-2380.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713634", "eventUri": "eng-9713634", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1529411764705881, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

Mandatory Credit: Cary Edmondson-USA TODAY Sports / Cary Edmondson-USA TODAY Sports\n\nBrandon Aiyuk is coming off the first Pro Bowl season of his career. Can he replicate it, or is he on the verge of a down season?\n\nAiyuk certainly is an outstanding wide receiver and one of the best route runners in the NFL as well as an exceptional blocker. But last season may have been an outlier for Aiyuk. He averaged a whopping 17.9 yards per catch, which nearly led the entire NFL. A very impressive statistic. But the previous season, he averaged just 13.0 yards per catch. And the season before that, he averaged 14.8 yards per catch.\n\nSo it's likely Aiyuk will have a statistical regression this season. He probably won't catch more than 75 passes because the 49ers run the ball so much, and he probably will average fewer than 17.9 yards per catch.\n\nIn addition, he skipped OTAs and minicamp and might skip training camp and preseason too unless the 49ers extend his contract soon. And if he misses an entire offseason, it seems highly unlikely that he will replicate his career-best performance from last season when he missed zero offseason practices.\n\nThat's why the 49ers would be wise to wait before giving Aiyuk an extension. Make him prove that 2023 wasn't an aberration. Make him show that he can be a Pro Bowler even without a full offseason. Before if he misses the Pro Bowl, he'll be seen as a one-hit wonder and his price tag will go down.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Aiyuk", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brandon Aiyuk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_receiver", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Wide receiver"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cary,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cary, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cary, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi's_Stadium", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Levi's Stadium"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fumble", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fumble"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Seahawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Seattle Seahawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Clara,_California", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Santa Clara, California"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Santa Clara, California"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pro Bowl"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 74}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4488,h_2524,x_0,y_168/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/all_49ers/01j2f379ykpk28xj674d.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713634", "eventUri": "eng-9713634", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2010-12-", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 6}], "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

The latest comes from Cody Benjamin of CBS Sports, who sends Brown, along with second and fourth-round picks in next year's draft to the San Francisco 49ers for Aiyuk.\n\nBenjamin believes this deal could entice the 49ers for two reasons: \"In this scenario, the 49ers don't net a coveted first-rounder, but they secure what figures to be a relatively high Day 2 selection, plus a fourth-rounder that'd give them a grand total of six picks in the first four rounds of the 2025 draft. Brown isn't really a needle-mover after three underwhelming NFL seasons, but the former North Carolina prospect has specific traits (blocking aggression, deep speed) that could translate quickly to Kyle Shanahan's offense, providing rotational depth behind Deebo Samuel, Jauan Jennings and rookie first-rounder Ricky Pearsall.\"\n\nThose are good enough reasons to recommend the Niners taking a chance on Brown. The incentive for the Commanders is obvious. Namely, to land a two-time 1,000-yard receiver who knows Daniels well from their days at Arizona State in 2019.\n\nAiyuk is keeping the trade buzz at fever pitch, with his latest contribution to post an image of Daniels at Commanders minicamp on his TikTok account, per the dc sports guy.\n\nGeneral manager Adam Peters and head coach Dan Quinn would need to decide if Aiyuk's established credentials and apparent desire to play in Washington are worth foregoing Brown's potential and precious draft capital.\n\nBrown has hardly lived up to the billing as a third-round pick in the 2021 NFL draft. Instead, he's merely flashed glimpses of becoming the big-play, vertical threat the Commanders need.\n\nHis raw, straight-line speed has never been in question, but Brown has had trouble completing catches. The problem showed up at key moments last season, like when Brown let this touchdown get away against the Chicago Bears in Week 5, per Mark Tyler of SB Nation's Hogs Haven.\n\nDespite these costly drops, Brown still has upside for the Commanders. Especially after the arrival of Daniels.\n\nThe latter won the Heisman Trophy largely thanks to awesome arm strength that allowed him to take the top off of defenses at will for LSU. Brown's 16.4 yards per reception career average makes him an ideal deep target for Daniels.\n\nBrown could finally unlock his potential in an offense set to be run by new coordinator Kliff Kingsbury. His is a system based on 'Air Raid' principles designed to stretch the field through the air, so Brown could be an asset.\n\nIt's worth the Commanders finding out, rather than using the 24-year-old to explore a trade for Aiyuk the franchise has already declined.\n\nAlthough the buzz about Washington trading for Aiyuk continues, the chances of a deal actually happening appear remote. Particularly since the Commanders have already explored the option, but ultimately \"decided not to do that deal,\" according to ESPN's Adam Schefter (h/t George Carmi of Full Press NFL).\n\nThat hasn't stopped the proliferation of trade proposals involving Aiyuk and the Commanders. The player has also done his bit to keep the rumor mill churning by not being shy about talking up a potential move to Washington.\n\nAiyuk-related trade chatter isn't waning, but so far at least, the Commanders aren't listening to the talk. Instead, Peters, Quinn and Kingsbury appear content to roll into the season with the current supporting cast around Daniels.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "james_dudko@heavy.com", "name": "James Dudko", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_University", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Brown University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jauan_Jennings", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jauan Jennings"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deebo_Samuel", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Deebo Samuel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS_Sports", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "CBS Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "TikTok"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Quinn_(American_football)", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dan Quinn (American football)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_State_Sun_Devils_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arizona State Sun Devils football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Schefter", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adam Schefter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Washington (state)"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Tyler_(footballer)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark Tyler (footballer)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kliff_Kingsbury", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kliff Kingsbury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bears", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bears"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spread_offense", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Spread offense"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSU_Tigers_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LSU Tigers football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SB_Nation", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "SB Nation"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisman_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Heisman Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies_and_Alternative_Science/Earth_Lights", "label": "dmoz/Science/Anomalies and Alternative Science/Earth Lights", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-1791820728-e1720472178376.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713634", "eventUri": "eng-9713634", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2705882352941176, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

The soon-to-be 34-year-old may not be an ideal starter at this point, but it's hard to envision a better candidate if San Francisco is in the market for a reliable depth piece during camp or the regular season.\"", "source": {"uri": "ninersnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Niners Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "yinon_raviv@ninersnation.com", "name": "Yinon Raviv", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraternities_and_sororities", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fraternities and sororities"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon,_Mississippi", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brandon, Mississippi"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brandon, Mississippi"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pass_deflected", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pass deflected"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay_Area", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco Bay Area"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "San Francisco"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Humor/Useless Pages", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming_Out", "label": "dmoz/Society/Transgendered/Coming Out", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free_Services", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Free Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 51}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7zjgMu2vYqr9Ugj3JnhwETr7yJw=/0x9:3930x1974/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25522846/1829756496.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9713634", "eventUri": "eng-9713634", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

John Breech may or may not be cleaning up fireworks from the weekend, so you've got me, Cody Benjamin, to deliver all the latest from around the NFL, right here in the Pick Six newsletter.\n\nBe sure to subscribe right here, to ensure you never miss a daily dose of NFL updates. And keep on reading for everything from proposed blockbuster trades to stunning off-field news from the weekend:\n\n1. Vikings rookie Khyree Jackson killed in car crash\n\nTragic news struck the NFL on Fourth of July Weekend, with Khyree Jackson, 24, among three victims of a fatal accident that occurred in Upper Marlboro, Maryland, overnight Saturday. A fourth-round draft pick out of Oregon this April, Jackson was pronounced dead at the scene alongside two former high school teammates. Maryland State Police believe Jackson's vehicle was struck by another car at high speed, and that alcohol may have contributed to the other driver's actions.\n\n\"I am absolutely crushed by this news,\" Vikings coach Kevin O'Connell said in a team statement. \"Khyree brought a contagious energy to our facility and our team. His confidence and engaging personality immediately drew his teammates to him. In our short time together, it was evident Khyree was going to develop into a tremendous professional football player, but what was more impressive was his desire to become the best person he could be for his family and those around him. I am at a loss for words. My heart goes out to Khyree's family, friends, teammates and coaches.\"\n\n2. Brandon Aiyuk trade proposals: Three-way deal?\n\nThe San Francisco 49ers want to keep the All-Pro wide receiver, and Aiyuk prefers to stay put. Yet both sides have failed to strike a long-term contract agreement, and Aiyuk continues to tease a potential trade, this time sharing footage of himself reviewing Washington Commanders practice film. It got us thinking: What could Washington actually offer San Francisco to pry Aiyuk from the Bay Area? We've got three proposed deals, including this splashy three-way possibility:\n\nBroncos get: WR Jamison Crowder (Washington), 2025 third-round pick (Washington)Commanders get: WR Brandon Aiyuk (San Francisco)49ers get: WR Courtland Sutton (Denver), 2025 second-round pick (Washington)\n\nLet's get funky, eh? Denver is in a bit of a contract bind of its own, with Sutton contemplating a training-camp holdout as he seeks a pay raise entering Year 7. While Sean Payton may not prefer to part with his club's most accomplished wideout, he could also use more resources for the long-term build around rookie quarterback Bo Nix. Crowder is aging, but his reliability as a possession target would probably appeal to Payton's eye for efficiency. San Francisco, meanwhile, would essentially be renting a proven downfield starter in Sutton while also recouping a second-rounder by shipping Aiyuk to Washington.\n\n3. Every NFL franchise's best team of Super Bowl era\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs are the contemporary standard for championship contenders. Resident NFL historian Bryan DeArdo has combed through the record books, however, to identify the best individual team of all 32 franchises during the Super Bowl era. As for the Chiefs, DeArdo likes the 2019 version -- only the second season with Patrick Mahomes as a full-time starter -- as the best to represent K.C. in recent memory:\n\nAfter a 7-4 start, the 2019 Chiefs won their final nine games, including a 31-20 win over the 49ers in Super Bowl LIV. Patrick Mahomes, the league's MVP the previous season, became the first player in league history to win a league and Super Bowl MVP before his 25th birthday. Mahomes was a major reason for their first championship in 50 years, but the Chiefs were hardly a one-man show. Along with Mahomes, the Chiefs' 2019 roster featured five other Pro Bowlers in receiver Tyreek Hill, tight end Travis Kelce (97 catches, 1,229 yards), defensive linemen Chris Jones and Frank Clark, and safety Tyrann Mathieu.\n\n4. Dak Prescott injury update: Cowboys QB hints at status\n\nPlenty of ink has been spilled about Prescott's contract situation, with the Pro Bowl quarterback entering the final year of his current deal, but now we've got news on Dak's health: After recently suffering a foot sprain that required a walking boot, per ESPN, Prescott has seemingly downplayed the injury by sharing a photo of himself walking without the boot. Initial reports described the signal-caller's ailment as \"minor,\" and Prescott is still expected to be a full participant when the Cowboys open training camp later this month.\n\n5. NFL's top 20 linebackers: Fred Warner still up top\n\nLinebackers don't get nearly as much attention as they once did, but the premier off-ball starters can still be difference-makers in today's NFL, as evidenced, for example, by Roquan Smith's move to the Baltimore Ravens. Which names deserve the most attention going into 2024? Jordan Dajani has ranked the top 20 at the position, and he's got a familiar face atop the pecking order: San Francisco 49ers star Fred Warner.\n\nLast year, the versatile defender became the only player over the last 25 seasons to record 125 tackles, four interceptions and four forced fumbles in a season. In all, Warner recorded 132 combined tackles, 2.5 sacks, a career-high 11 passes defensed, four interceptions and four forced fumbles in 2023, which earned him his third first-team All-Pro nod, and third Pro Bowl appearance as well. His coverage ability gives the already-talented 49ers defense some flexibility, and he's proven to be a playmaker at virtually every level of the field.\n\n6. Rookies to watch: Brock Bowers could be instant star\n\nThe Las Vegas Raiders surprised some fans by using a first-round pick on tight end Brock Bowers this April. Don't be surprised if Bowers is an immediate weapon, however. Or at least that's what draft analyst Chris Trapasso says in his forecast of rookie tight ends for the 2024 campaign:\n\nBowers has incredible burst, route-running chops, hands and thunderous yards-after-catch capabilities to prove himself as a three-level winner for whoever's throwing him the football as a rookie -- Aidan O'Connell or Garner Minshew. And because of his deceptive power coupled with ferocious athleticism, Bowers is a mismatch for essentially every type of defender.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Mandatory Credit: Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports / Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports\n\nDeebo Samuel still is a good player, but he hasn't lived up to the contract extension he signed with the 49ers two years ago.\n\nWhen he signed the extension, he was coming off a Pro Bowl season and a first-team All Pro selection. At the time, the 49ers thought Samuel would have many more Pro Bowl seasons, but he hasn't.\n\nFive seasons into Samuel's career, he still has been to the Pro Bowl just one time. And now he has taken a backseat to Brandon Aiyuk who has become the unquestioned no. 1 wide receiver on the team. Samuel is a second banana.\n\nThat could change this year, though.\n\nThe current first banana, Aiyuk, is unhappy with the 49ers. Sure, they're offering him more than Samuel makes, but even that's not enough to satisfy Aiyuk. So he's holding out and it's unclear when he will return.\n\nMeanwhile, Samuel was the only veteran captain who participated in OTAs and minicamp. He was the leader. He set the example of how to practice for the younger players.\n\nAnd now Samuel seems to be in the best shape he has been in since 2021 when he was an All Pro. That season, he was motivated because he was eligible for a contract extension at the end of it. And when Samuel is motivated, he's one of the most unstoppable players in the NFL. Defensive backs simply don't want to tackle him. They all make business decisions when he has the ball.\n\nThe issue with Samuel has been maintaining his drive. He hasn't been nearly as driven as Aiyuk the past two years.

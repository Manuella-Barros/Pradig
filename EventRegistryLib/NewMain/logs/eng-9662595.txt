Redick was offered the job by Lakers executive Rob Pelinka on Thursday and will now be tasked with assembling his staff with experienced minds across the NBA.\n\nWhile he may not have prior coaching experience, Redick was long rumored to be in the running for the Lakers' coaching vacancy after they fired Darvin Ham because of his long playing career and his relationship with superstar LeBron James. The two started their Mind the Game podcast earlier this year, leading many to believe that Redick was James' top choice to become the Lakers new head coach.\n\nHowever, there have been numerous reports suggesting that James has had zero involvement in the team's coaching search. His agent, Rich Paul of Klutch Sports, has also echoed similar remarks. Now that the Lakers have hired Redick, the noise that he was LeBron's first choice will only grow.\n\nPrior to retiring in 2021 after 15 NBA seasons with six different organizations, Redick was one of the first active players to get involved with the media side of basketball through a series of podcasts for different networks. In 2020, he co-founded ThreeFourTwo Productions and began The Old Man and the Three podcast. Just this past year, Redick served as an on-air sports analyst for ESPN and has been a part of the company's main broadcasting crew, including at the 2024 NBA Finals.\n\nWhile it appeared as if Redick was the favorite to land the job at first, the Lakers had turned their attention to UConn Men's Basketball head coach Dan Hurley in recent weeks. The Lakers met with Hurley in person last week and offered him a six-year, $70 million contract. Ultimately, Hurley decided to return to Connecticut in an attempt to win his third straight national championship with the Huskies.\n\nRedick, 39, will now be tasked with not only guiding the Lakers to championship status right away, but he will also be responsible for the development of this team after James is ready to retire.\n\nJJ Redick's fit with Lakers\n\nLike many younger coaches entering the league, Redick has an extensive analytical background. Aside from seeing the game from a different perspective due to his playing career, Redick's analysis on ESPN and in his podcasts is always filled with breakdowns of certain players' strengths and weaknesses. Much like Joe Mazzulla of the Boston Celtics, Redick approaches the game with the mindset of increasing the odds of success.\n\nHowever, this is Redick's first time being a head coach.\n\nIt is certainly a surprise to see the Lakers want to pursue another first-year head coach, especially after things did not pan out with Ham over his two years in Los Angeles. Then again, Redick can relate to a locker room a lot more than an older coach due to the respect he still commands around the league. His basketball IQ is also a lot higher than others.\n\nBefore we had Stephen Curry and others running off screens as a three-point shooter, JJ Redick was making a living off of this during his playing career. He simply had a knack for finding open spots on the court, and Redick was always held in high regard due to his understanding of how he would see plays develop before they even happened.\n\nThe Lakers will value his creativity as their head coach, and they will also count on Redick's work ethic. His competitiveness and drive to know everything that there is to know about the subject at hand make him a very intriguing head coach entering the NBA.\n\nHiring a head coach in the NBA is not easy. The Lakers have had to deal with this firsthand on multiple occasions over the last decade, which is why they believe Redick can be their long-term answer.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "brett_siegel@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Brett Siegel", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Hurley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dan Hurley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rich Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pelinka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rob Pelinka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Wojnarowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adrian Wojnarowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Connecticut", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Connecticut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UConn_Huskies", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "UConn Huskies"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Los-Angeles-hires-JJ-Redick-James-Borrego-after-Dan-Hurley-fiasco-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662595", "eventUri": "eng-9662595", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.02745098039215677, "wgt": 228, "relevance": 1}

ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported the news on Thursday, saying it'll be a four-year deal.\n\nWojnarowski wrote, \"JJ Redick has agreed on a four-year contract to become the next coach of the Los Angeles Lakers. Rob Pelinka offered the job this morning and Redick's started working on a staff to surround himself with experience...Pelinka became sold on Redick's ability to connect with players and his basketball IQ and believes surrounding him with an elite coaching staff will help to shorten the learning curve into his first coaching job, sources said.\"\n\nThis concludes a wild coaching search for Los Angeles that began at the beginning of May when the team fired Darvin Ham after just two seasons at the helm. Ham led the Lakers to back-to-back playoff appearances, but both ended in losses to the Denver Nuggets. After a first-round loss to Denver this year, L.A. decided to find a new coach.\n\nRedick was a name consistently at the forefront of rumors. He and Lakers star LeBron James recently started a podcast titled Mind the Game, where they discuss basketball and even broke down some recent Lakers moments. It's not yet known if the podcast will continue now that Redick is James' boss.\n\nAnother top-reported candidate was University of Connecticut head coach Dan Hurley. The Lakers reportedly offered Hurley a six-year, $70 million deal, but he turned it down to remain at UConn. He did make it known that a higher offer could have swayed him to take the job, though.\n\nRead more: Dan Hurley Says Lakers' Financial Offer Did Not Entice Him to Leave UConn\n\nAside from Redick and Hurley, there was James Borrego, a longtime veteran head coach. Most recently, there were rumblings about the Lakers potentially talking to Monty Williams, who was fired on Wednesday by the Detroit Pistons.\n\nIn the end, though, the answer was Redick, and he'll now be the 29th head coach in Los Angeles Lakers history.\n\nRedick has no coaching experience at any level. He's played basketball his entire life, though, and attended Duke University, where he was the National College Player of the Year in 2006. Redick was drafted in the first round of the 2006 NBA Draft and spent 15 seasons in the league with the Orlando Magic, Milwaukee Bucks, Los Angeles Clippers, Philadelphia 76ers, New Orleans Pelicans, and Dallas Mavericks. His broadcasting career began in 2021, and he quickly emerged as one of the best young broadcasting talents at ESPN.\n\nAfter less than three years, though, and fresh off calling the NBA Finals, Redick will be moving back to the basketball world to be the head coach of one of the most storied franchises in the league's rich history.\n\nRedick will have less than a week to get settled and prepare for the 2024 NBA Draft, which begins on Wednesday, June 26. The Lakers have the No. 17 pick in the first round on Wednesday, and the No. 55 pick in the second round on Thursday.", "source": {"uri": "newsweek.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Newsweek"}, "authors": [{"uri": "noah_camras@newsweek.com", "name": "Noah Camras", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Darvin Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Hurley", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dan Hurley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Connecticut", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Connecticut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Denver"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monty Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Pistons", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Pistons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans_Pelicans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans Pelicans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_University", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Duke University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_Magic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orlando Magic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2413890/jj-redick.webp?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=7388c145e9cae20541f8af171894beab", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662595", "eventUri": "eng-9662595", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-26", "textStart": 2980, "textEnd": 2987}], "sentiment": -0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 225, "relevance": 1}

Redick next up to coach Lakers", "body": "After 1 1/2 months of searching, including a couple of twists, the Lakers have found their new head coach -- a former player-turned-broadcaster who doesn't have any previous head coaching experience.\n\nThe Lakers will hire JJ Redick as their new head coach on Thursday. ESPN reported that Redick agreed to a four-year deal.\n\nThe 39-year-old former Duke star, a 2006 lottery pick for the Magic who played here for seven seasons and 15 overall in the NBA, will be franchise's seventh head coach in 13 years and 29th overall.\n\nWith the hiring of Redick, the Lakers are hoping to accomplish two things: build off the last two seasons when they made the playoffs, including the 2023 Western Conference finals, in what's expected to be the final couple of seasons of the LeBron James-Anthony Davis era; and have a coach in place who's a proven program-builder with a strong track record of player development.\n\nESPN reported last week that Redick had the opportunity to \"move him to the forefront\" of the Lakers' coaching search with a strong interview performance on Saturday.\n\nAnd now the Lakers have their new coach.\n\nThe Lakers' hiring of Redick came after the organization's failed pursuit of UConn men's coach Dan Hurley, who turned down a six-year, $70 million offer and returned to the Huskies. Redick was considered the frontrunner for the Lakers' job before their pursuit of Hurley became public.\n\nThe Lakers hoped to hire a coach before the June 26-27 draft. Redick met with Lakers VP and GM Rob Pelinka last month at the draft combine in Chicago before the more formal and thorough interview with Pelinka and Lakers governor Jeanie Buss last weekend.\n\nRedick was a color commentator for ABC's broadcast of the NBA Finals between the Celtics and the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nRedick, who has coached at the youth level, retired in 2021 and doesn't have any professional or college coaching experience.\n\nBut he has interviewed for multiple head-coaching vacancies recently: the Raptors' last offseason, which went to Darko Rajakovi\u0107, and the Hornets this spring, with Boston lead assistant Charles Lee set to take charge.\n\nRedick became an analyst/broadcaster for ESPN immediately after retirement and has hosted podcasts since 2016, including, \"The Old Man and the Three\" which is part of the ThreeFourTwo Productions company he co-founded.\n\nNotably, Redick has also been co-hosting a podcast, \"Mind the Game,\" with James since March.\n\nEven with the messaging being that the Lakers had long-term goals with this coaching hire, Redick will face immediate pressure to win. Former coach Darvin Ham lasted just two seasons despite leading the Lakers to the playoffs each time: a conference finals appearance last year and a first-round exit against the Nuggets.\n\nRedick will inherit a roster that could resemble the one that went 47-35 in 2023-24. Seven players have guaranteed deals for 2024-25, not including big man Christian Wood, who's reportedly already has exercised his player option for next season. James, D'Angelo Russell, Jaxson Hayes and Cam Reddish also have a June 29 deadline for their player options.", "source": {"uri": "orlandosentinel.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Orlando

He joined ESPN's lead commentary team earlier this year.\n\nESPN first reported the decision.\n\nBefore Redick finished broadcasting the NBA Finals, he met with the Lakers last weekend and apparently did well enough to end the franchise's lengthy coaching search. Less than two weeks after UConn coach Danny Hurley turned down the Lakers' ardent advances, Redick has accepted the job in a remarkable three-year journey from the court to the broadcast booth to the Lakers' bench.\n\nRedick replaces Darvin Ham, who was fired May 3 despite leading the Lakers to two playoff berths and a Western Conference finals appearance in 2023.\n\nRedick began recording a regular podcast with James two months ago, and their \"Mind the Game\" collaboration is already wildly popular, with listeners often emerging impressed by the duo's basketball acumen and high-level discussion of tactics and motivation.\n\nNow these two minds will be working together for the Lakers, with Redick leading a roster headlined by James, who is six months younger than Redick.\n\nEverything is contingent on James deciding to return to play with Anthony Davis and the Lakers, of course. James, who will enter his 22nd NBA season this fall, could decline his $51.4 million contract option this month to become a free agent.\n\nBut hiring Redick seems to be another calculated move by the Lakers to maximize their chances of keeping the 20-time All-Star and the driving force behind their 2020 championship team.\n\nRedick's coaching experience is limited to his children's youth teams, but he has been around the game his entire life. He is the leading scorer in the history of Duke, where he played four seasons under Mike Krzyzewski.", "source": {"uri": "omaha.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Omaha.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@omaha.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Darvin Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Hurley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dan Hurley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Connecticut", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "University of Connecticut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Big Ten Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Blue_Devils_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Duke Blue Devils men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Associated Press"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Krzyzewski", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Krzyzewski"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/omaha.com/content/tncms/custom/image/9595a7a2-2379-11e7-b3c5-13eacc36a918.jpg?resize=600%2C315", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662595", "eventUri": "eng-9662595", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-03", "textStart": 1270, "textEnd": 1275}], "sentiment": 0.07450980392156858, "wgt": 220, "relevance": 1}

He joined ESPN\u00b4s lead commentary team earlier this year.\n\nESPN first reported the decision.\n\nBefore Redick finished broadcasting the NBA Finals, he met with the Lakers last weekend and apparently did well enough to end the franchise\u00b4s lengthy coaching search. Less than two weeks after UConn coach Danny Hurley turned down the Lakers\u00b4 ardent advances, Redick has accepted the job in a remarkable three-year journey from the court to the broadcast booth to the Lakers\u00b4 bench.\n\nJ.J. Redick arrives for Game 4 of the NBA basketball finals between the Dallas Mavericks and the Boston Celtics, Friday, June 14, 2024, in Dallas. (AP Photo/Sam Hodde)\n\nRedick replaces Darvin Ham, who was fired May 3 despite leading the Lakers to two playoff berths and a Western Conference finals appearance in 2023.\n\nRedick began recording a regular podcast with James two months ago, and their \"Mind the Game\" collaboration is already wildly popular, with listeners often emerging impressed by the duo\u00b4s basketball acumen and high-level discussion of tactics and motivation.\n\nNow these two minds will be working together for the Lakers, with Redick leading a roster headlined by James, who is six months younger than Redick.\n\nEverything is contingent on James deciding to return to play with Anthony Davis and the Lakers, of course. James, who will enter his 22nd NBA season this fall, could decline his $51.4 million contract option this month to become a free agent.\n\nBut hiring Redick seems to be another calculated move by the Lakers to maximize their chances of keeping the 20-time All-Star and the driving force behind their 2020 championship team.\n\nRedick\u00b4s coaching experience is limited to his children\u00b4s youth teams, but he has been around the game his entire life. He is the leading scorer in the history of Duke, where he played four seasons under Mike Krzyzewski.\n\nAnd though Redick is an unorthodox choice, his unlikely ascent is not without some precedent in Lakers lore and recent NBA history.\n\nPat Riley was a broadcaster for the Lakers in November 1979 when Paul Westhead took over as their head coach after Jack McKinney nearly died in a bicycle accident. Westhead hired Riley as an assistant without coaching experience, and Riley became the Lakers\u00b4 head coach in late 1981 after Westhead clashed with Magic Johnson.\n\nRiley promptly led the Lakers to four championships in the 1980s to begin his incredible career as a coach and executive.\n\nAnd then there\u00b4s Steve Kerr, the former shooting guard and Phoenix Suns executive who had never coached before he took over at Golden State in 2014. Kerr has led Stephen Curry\u00b4s Warriors to four championships and six NBA Finals appearances in the past decade.\n\nRedick\u00b4s arrival ends another unusual offseason coaching search for owner Jeanie Buss, general manager Rob Pelinka and the Lakers, who are hiring their eighth head coach since Phil Jackson\u00b4s final departure in 2011, and their fourth since James arrived as a free agent in 2018.\n\nLos Angeles needed six weeks to settle on Ham in the summer of 2022, but the longtime assistant coach was dismissed after the Lakers lost to defending champion Denver in the first round of the Western Conference playoffs.\n\nHam led the Lakers to two winning seasons and a victory in the inaugural In-Season Tournament last year, but many fans and observers - and, clearly, the Lakers\u00b4 front office - were not impressed by his leadership or preparation.\n\nDavis memorably said during the playoffs that the Lakers \"have stretches where we don\u00b4t know what we\u00b4re doing on both ends of the floor.\"\n\nThe Lakers hired Ham after firing Frank Vogel, who had been fired exactly 18 months after he won a title in the Florida bubble. Vogel replaced Luke Walton after another long coaching search in which the Lakers were widely reported to have wanted Tyronn Lue, only for a deal to fall apart over issues with money and control.\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA", "source": {"uri": "dailymail.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily Mail Online"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

While being a second option is never ideal, Redick was said to understand and accept the Lakers' pursuit of Hurley, still following through with his interview this past weekend.\n\nThe Lakers haven't had the option of putting pen to paper on a Redick hire until now with him making it clear that his focus was on calling the NBA Finals for ESPN.\n\nNow that the series between the Boston Celtics and Dallas Mavericks is over though, things should pick up quickly in negotiations between him and the Lakers. In fact, Jay Williams may have spilled the beans on ESPN's 'Get Up' on Tuesday morning that Redick will be L.A.'s next head coach:\n\nThis shouldn't come as a huge surprise as Redick is the only candidate to interview with the Lakers since they were rejected by Hurley.\n\nOthers like James Borrego and Sam Cassell have been in the mix, but it has been Redick's job to lose all along and it now appears that L.A.'s search is over.\n\nThe Lakers are taking a gamble here by hiring Redick, who has never coached before at any level other than his young children's youth games. He, of course, has a great relationship with Lakers star LeBron James though with them starting a podcast together earlier this year, which should help him earn the respect a head coach needs from his players.\n\nL.A. is in the business of winning championships, especially now that the Celtics have passed them by winning their 18th, so the pressure will be on Redick from the jump to help them achieve that goal.\n\nOne person who recently went to bat for JJ Redick in the Lakers' coaching search is Jason Kidd, the current head coach of the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nKidd is familiar with Redick and also knows the Lakers organization well, and he believes it would be a solid match for both sides.

Redick is signing a four-year deal worth in the neighborhood of $8 million per season with the Lakers, according to sources briefed on the deal.\n\nUnlike Hurley who had won back-to-back National Championships with UConn and is considered the best head coach in college basketball, Redick is a first-timer with zero coaching experience, which means he'd likely get a deal on the lower end.\n\nHowever, with the Detroit Pistons parting ways with head coach Monty Williams on Wednesday, some believed that Redick could try to leverage his situation with the Lakers if he became a leading candidate for the struggling franchise, which he seemed to become on Thursday morning.\n\nEven though the Pistons may have played a role, Redick ultimately took the job he was rumored to be a frontrunner for all along, which means the Lakers brass can now focus on filling out his coaching staff and the upcoming 2024 NBA Draft as well as trying to convince superstar forward LeBron James to stay long-term.\n\nSome potential members of JJ Redick's staff on the Lakers have already emerged as it was reported that they will target Scott Brooks, Rajon Rondo and Jared Dudley, among others.\n\nConsidering Redick has never coached before at any level, it will be important for the Lakers to surround him with experience on his bench. Brooks is a former head coach and would fit that bill, but it will be interesting to see who else the Lakers target in the coming weeks.", "source": {"uri": "lakersnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lakers Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_ward@lakersnation.com", "name": "Ryan Ward", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UConn_Huskies_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "UConn Huskies men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Darvin Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Pistons", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Pistons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "College basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monty Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Dudley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jared Dudley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajon_Rondo", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rajon Rondo"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Brooks", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Scott Brooks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://s22928.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/JJ-Redick-1.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662595", "eventUri": "eng-9662595", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2941176470588236, "wgt": 218, "relevance": 1}

Redick's Basketball IQ and ability to connect with players highly impressed, according to the report. The report also notes that the Lakers will look to surround him with an elite coaching staff to help Redick adjust to the role, which will be his first coaching job.\n\nRedick was heavily speculated to be the favorite for the job from the time the Lakers fired Darvin Ham. That all changed when the news broke that the Lakers were pursuing Hurley. Redick became the favorite again following Hurley's rejection of the deal. Redick's podcast with LeBron James heavily fueled this speculation.\n\nThis is a great hire. Redick is clearly a basketball genius and will bring a new twist to the Lakers that may take time for the league to catch up to. His good relationship with LeBron will of course help him in this role, too.\n\nThe question becomes if his smarts will translate to the court and his leadership or if his lack of coaching experience will be the prevailing factor as Redick leads the team.\n\nRedick will look to return the Lakers to the top of the league with the team's superstar tandem of LeBron James and Anthony Davis.", "source": {"uri": "dailycaller.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Daily Caller"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "College basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pelinka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rob Pelinka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Darvin Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monty Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Pistons", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Pistons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Training", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Basketball", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Sports/Basketball", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1377148251-scaled-e1718912316593.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662595", "eventUri": "eng-9662595", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.01960784313725483, "wgt": 217, "relevance": 1}

During the bubble season in 2020, Redick's first foray into broadcasting was with his own production company called ThreeFourTwo Productions. The company's first content was a podcast hosted by Redick called \"The Old Man and the Three.\"\n\nAfter retiring from the NBA following the 2021 season, Redick was hired as an analyst by ESPN and made his debut on November 3, 2021, as a studio analyst for the network's coverage of a game between the Brooklyn Nets and Atlanta Hawks.\n\nRedick's rise was prominent. Inside the corridors of ESPN, his voice became synonymous with sharp analysis and insightful commentary. None of that came as a surprise for those like myself, who followed his playing career.\n\nRedick learned the game from Hall of Fame head coach Mike Krzyzewski at Duke where he was a two-time All-American and the 2006 National College Player of the Year.\n\nThe Orlando Magic drafted him that same year and he quickly helped lead them to the 2009 NBA Finals, where they lost to the Lakers in five games.\n\nRedick came to Los Angeles in 2013 with the Clippers where he played five seasons for the team, helping them reach the playoffs in all five. It was in the arena formerly known as Staples Center where we quickly learned that Redick's basketball IQ was off the charts and that one day he would be destined for more than just the broadcasting booth.\n\nToday, just three short years after his retirement, that potential has been realized as the Lakers have named him the 27 head coach in franchise history.\n\nRedick is considered a player's coach, and many inside the Lakers' organization have compared him to a young Pat Riley.\n\nAs a player, Redick's career was defined by his precision and understanding of the game. Something that's on fully display in his new podcast with his now star player, LeBron James. The Podcast, launched during the postseason is called \"Mind the Game,\" and it's co-produced by Redick and James' respective production companies.\n\nMany believed it was those conversations with LeBron on the podcast that put Redick on the Lakers' radar. On the show, the two break down the X's and O's of the game and discuss late-game strategies and defensive positioning. Redick and James will now bring that same meticulous approach to the Lakers' sidelines during the upcoming season.\n\nRedick was a sharpshooter throughout his career and is expected to emphasize 3-point shooting, pace and space as he tries to rejuvenate the Lakers' offense.\n\nRedick interviewed with the Lakers over the weekend and was hired just a few days later. His hiring comes less than a week before the 2024 NBA Draft.\n\nRedick will have to learn on the job as fast as possible. His first move will be to hire a staff, hopefully with some veteran head coaches as assistants. Redick knows all too well, the pressure that comes with the high-profile position as the Lakers head coach.\n\nWith stars like James and Anthony Davis on the roster, Redick will look to make the Lakers a championship contender both this season and into the future. In order to do so, he will need to foster a winning culture and understand the dynamics and roles with the star-studded lineup.\n\nLakers fans, known for their passion and high expectations, have greeted the news with a mix of excitement and curiosity. Social media is abuzz with reactions, with many optimistic about what Redick can bring to the team. His reputation as a hardworking, knowledgeable basketball mind has fans hopeful that he can lead the Lakers back to championship contention.\n\nHowever, those same fans were ecstatic at the prospect of two-time NCAA national championship head coach Dan Hurley from Connecticut taking the job. But, Hurley turned down the Lakers' offer to remain at UConn and chase a third straight title.\n\nRedick may not have been the team's first choice, but in his new role, the future looks bright. His blend of modern basketball philosophy and deep respect for the game's traditions positions him as an ideal leader for a team looking to reclaim its glory. With training camp around the corner, all eyes will be on Redick as he begins to shape the next era of Lakers basketball.\n\nThe journey from commentator to coach is complete. JJ Redick is ready to write the next chapter in Lakers history, and if his past is any indication, it's going to be a thrilling ride.", "source": {"uri": "nbclosangeles.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "NBC Southern California"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Hawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Hawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Wojnarowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adrian Wojnarowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Nets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn Nets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto.com_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Crypto.com Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Riley", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pat Riley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Blue_Devils_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Duke Blue Devils men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_Magic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orlando Magic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-America", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "All-America"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Krzyzewski", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Krzyzewski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Hurley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dan Hurley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Connecticut", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "University of Connecticut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2024/06/GettyImages-1850856358.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662595", "eventUri": "eng-9662595", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1450980392156862, "wgt": 216, "relevance": 1}

He joined ESPN's lead commentary team earlier this year.\n\nESPN first reported the decision.\n\nBefore Redick finished broadcasting the NBA Finals, he met with the Lakers last weekend and apparently did well enough to end the franchise's lengthy coaching search. Less than two weeks after UConn coach Danny Hurley turned down the Lakers' ardent advances, Redick has accepted the job in a remarkable three-year journey from the court to the broadcast booth to the Lakers' bench.\n\nRedick replaces Darvin Ham, who was fired May 3 despite leading the Lakers to two playoff berths and a Western Conference finals appearance in 2023.\n\nRedick began recording a regular podcast with James two months ago, and their \"Mind the Game\" collaboration is already wildly popular, with listeners often emerging impressed by the duo's basketball acumen and high-level discussion of tactics and motivation.\n\nNow these two minds will be working together for the Lakers, with Redick leading a roster headlined by James, who is six months younger than Redick.\n\nEverything is contingent on James deciding to return to play with Anthony Davis and the Lakers, of course. James, who will enter his 22nd NBA season this fall, could decline his $51.4 million contract option this month to become a free agent.\n\nBut hiring Redick seems to be another calculated move by the Lakers to maximize their chances of keeping the 20-time All-Star and the driving force behind their 2020 championship team.\n\nRedick's coaching experience is limited to his children's youth teams, but he has been around the game his entire life. He is the leading scorer in the history of Duke, where he played four seasons under Mike Krzyzewski.\n\nAnd though Redick is an unorthodox choice, his unlikely ascent is not without some precedent in Lakers lore and recent NBA history.\n\nPat Riley was a broadcaster for the Lakers in November 1979 when Paul Westhead took over as their head coach after Jack McKinney nearly died in a bicycle accident. Westhead hired Riley as an assistant without coaching experience, and Riley became the Lakers' head coach in late 1981 after Westhead clashed with Magic Johnson.\n\nRiley promptly led the Lakers to four championships in the 1980s to begin his incredible career as a coach and executive.\n\nAnd then there's Steve Kerr, the former shooting guard and Phoenix Suns executive who had never coached before he took over at Golden State in 2014. Kerr has led Stephen Curry's Warriors to four championships and six NBA Finals appearances in the past decade.\n\nRedick's arrival ends another unusual offseason coaching search for owner Jeanie Buss, general manager Rob Pelinka and the Lakers, who are hiring their eighth head coach since Phil Jackson's final departure in 2011, and their fourth since James arrived as a free agent in 2018.\n\nLos Angeles needed six weeks to settle on Ham in the summer of 2022, but the longtime assistant coach was dismissed after the Lakers lost to defending champion Denver in the first round of the Western Conference playoffs.\n\nHam led the Lakers to two winning seasons and a victory in the inaugural In-Season Tournament last year, but many fans and observers -- and, clearly, the Lakers' front office -- were not impressed by his leadership or preparation.\n\nDavis memorably said during the playoffs that the Lakers \"have stretches where we don't know what we're doing on both ends of the floor.\"\n\nThe Lakers hired Ham after firing Frank Vogel, who had been fired exactly 18 months after he won a title in the Florida bubble. Vogel replaced Luke Walton after another long coaching search in which the Lakers were widely reported to have wanted Tyronn Lue, only for a deal to fall apart over issues with money and control.",

The job reportedly was offered to Redick on Thursday.\n\nThe Lakers hiring Redick ends a saga that had gone on weeks concerning the team's head coach vacancy.\n\nThe Lakers fired Darvin Ham in early May after being dissatisfied with the way their season ended.

The team interviewed a few other candidates and had a flirtation with Dan Hurley, but they finally settled in on Redick. The 39-year-old Redick last played in the NBA in 2021. He has served as a commentator on ESPN since then and was an analyst during the NBA Finals this year.

The Los Angeles Lakers' reported plan to offer a massive contract to UConn coach Dan Hurley is the latest twist in the monthlong race to replace Darvin Ham. According to a person with knowledge of the lengthy search, the Lakers have strongly considered J.J. Redick, the former player and current ESPN analyst. (AP Photo/Phelan M. Ebenhack, File)\n\nThe person spoke on condition of anonymity Thursday because the Lakers hadn't yet publicly announced the decision to hire the former guard for his first coaching job.\n\nThe 39-year-old Redick is an extraordinary choice by the Lakers, who hired a 15-year veteran with absolutely no coaching experience to lead a franchise with 17 NBA titles, one of the biggest brand names in world sports -- and LeBron James, the top scorer in league history.\n\nRedick was a proficient outside shooter for six teams before his retirement in September 2021, when he moved into a career in broadcasting and podcasting. He joined ESPN's lead commentary team earlier this year.\n\nESPN first reported the decision.\n\nBefore Redick finished broadcasting the NBA Finals, he met with the Lakers last weekend and apparently did well enough to end the franchise's lengthy coaching search. Less than two weeks after UConn coach Danny Hurley turned down the Lakers' ardent advances, Redick has accepted the job in a remarkable three-year journey from the court to the broadcast booth to the Lakers' bench.\n\nRedick replaces Darvin Ham, who was fired May 3 despite leading the Lakers to two playoff berths and a Western Conference finals appearance in 2023.\n\nRedick began recording a regular podcast with James two months ago, and their \"Mind the Game\" collaboration is already wildly popular, with listeners often emerging impressed by the duo's basketball acumen and high-level discussion of tactics and motivation.\n\nNow these two minds will be working together for the Lakers, with Redick leading a roster headlined by James, who is six months younger than Redick.\n\nEverything is contingent on James deciding to return to play with Anthony Davis and the Lakers, of course. James, who will enter his 22nd NBA season this fall, could decline his $51.4 million contract option this month to become a free agent.\n\nBut hiring Redick seems to be another calculated move by the Lakers to maximize their chances of keeping the 20-time All-Star and the driving force behind their 2020 championship team.\n\nRedick's coaching experience is limited to his children's youth teams, but he has been around the game his entire life. He is the leading scorer in the history of Duke, where he played four seasons under Mike Krzyzewski.\n\nAnd though Redick is an unorthodox choice, his unlikely ascent is not without some precedent in Lakers lore and recent NBA history.\n\nPat Riley was a broadcaster for the Lakers in November 1979 when Paul Westhead took over as their head coach after Jack McKinney nearly died in a bicycle accident. Westhead hired Riley as an assistant without coaching experience, and Riley became the Lakers' head coach in late 1981 after Westhead clashed with Magic Johnson.\n\nRiley promptly led the Lakers to four championships in the 1980s to begin his incredible career as a coach and executive.\n\nAnd then there's Steve Kerr, the former shooting guard and Phoenix Suns executive who had never coached before he took over at Golden State in 2014. Kerr has led Stephen Curry's Warriors to four championships and six NBA Finals appearances in the past decade.\n\nRedick's arrival ends another unusual offseason coaching search for owner Jeanie Buss, general manager Rob Pelinka and the Lakers, who are hiring their eighth head coach since Phil Jackson's final departure in 2011, and their fourth since James arrived as a free agent in 2018.\n\nLos Angeles needed six weeks to settle on Ham in the summer of 2022, but the longtime assistant coach was dismissed after the Lakers lost to defending champion Denver in the first round of the Western Conference playoffs.\n\nHam led the Lakers to two winning seasons and a victory in the inaugural In-Season Tournament last year, but many fans and observers -- and, clearly, the Lakers' front office -- were not impressed by his leadership or preparation.\n\nDavis memorably said during the playoffs that the Lakers \"have stretches where we don't know what we're doing on both ends of the floor.\"\n\nThe Lakers hired Ham after firing Frank Vogel, who had been fired exactly 18 months after he won a title in the Florida bubble. Vogel replaced Luke Walton after another long coaching search in which the Lakers were widely reported to have wanted Tyronn Lue, only for a deal to fall apart over issues with money and control.\n\nFacebookTwitterPinterestLinkedin", "source": {"uri": "wccbcharlotte.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WCCB Charlotte's CW"}, "authors": [{"uri": "caryn_little@wccbcharlotte.com", "name":

However, the Lakers pursued UConn coach Dan Hurley earlier in June. But Hurley turned down their reported offer of six years, $70 million on June 10, opting to remain in Connecticut and pursue the chance of a three-peat with the Huskies.\n\nRedick became the favorite for the Lakers' job again after Hurley turned them down. Redick was scheduled to have his first formal interview with Los Angeles on Saturday, ESPN previously reported. Redick previously met with Lakers general manager Rob Pelinka at the NBA Draft Combine in May, according to ESPN.\n\nThis will mark the first coaching gig for Redick at either the professional or collegiate level. He played in the NBA for 15 seasons (2006-21), with most fans knowing him for his strong 3-point shooting. After launching a podcast during his playing career, Redick quickly rose up the broadcast ranks. He joined ESPN's lead broadcasting crew during the 2023-24 season, calling the NBA Finals for the network.\n\nDespite his inexperience as a coach, Redick has also been viewed as an emerging talent in the coaching world. He was reportedly a finalist for the Charlotte Hornets' coaching gig earlier this offseason and has interviewed for other head-coaching jobs.\n\nMembers of Los Angeles' organization became \"infatuated\" with Redick during the process, The Athletic reported earlier in June. The Lakers have reportedly consulted former Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski, who coached Redick in college, throughout the process.\n\nRedick also has a clear connection to the Lakers' organization, having hosted a podcast, \"Mind the Game,\" with LeBron James since March. The show discusses the state of basketball along with breaking down the X's and O's. James' future in L.A. is uncertain, however, as he can opt out of his contract and become a free agent this offseason.\n\nEven though James is linked to Redick, he hasn't been involved in the Lakers' coaching search, The Athletic reported in May. However, Hurley shared on \"The Herd\" that James reached out to him during his discussions with the team.\n\nBeyond Hurley and Redick, former Hornets head coach and current New Orleans Pelicans associate coach James Borrego was reportedly been the other main candidate in the Lakers' search.\n\nFollowing a first-round playoff exit to the Denver Nuggets, the team fired Ham after two seasons at the helm. It marked the second straight year that the Nuggets ended the Lakers' season, but last year L.A. reached the Western Conference finals.\n\nWith their head coach secured, the Lakers' focus turns to the roster. If James remains in Los Angeles, the Lakers would likely be in playoff contention again.

However, he's demonstrated a deep knowledge of the NBA game as a studio and game analyst for ESPN during the past three seasons, in addition to the insight offered on his podcasts \"The Old Man and the Three\" and \"Mind the Game,\" which he hosts with LeBron James.\n\nDespite Redick's name being in the mix early in the search, UConn coach Dan Hurley emerged as a top candidate, ultimately turning down a six-year, $70-million deal to become the Lakers' next head coach.\n\nThe presumption had been that Redick had an inside track to the Lakers job because of his podcast partnership with James. Yet the Lakers star reportedly wasn't involved in the team's coaching search, believing that the organization needed to make a decision that could be significant beyond the two or three more seasons that James intends to play.\n\nTeam officials were reportedly extremely impressed with Redick after interviewing him, envisioning what he could be as a coach rather than what he's already accomplished, according to The Athletic.\n\nWhoever dropped Riley's name in discussing Redick surely knew what was being invoked. Riley established his coaching legend with the Lakers, winning four NBA championships during the \"Showtime\" era. He won another three as a coach, then executive with the Miami Heat, with James winning his first two NBA titles under Riley's chosen successor, Erik Spoelstra.\n\nSomeone else who may have influenced the choice of Redick was his coach at Duke, Mike Krzyzewski. The winningest coach in men's college basketball history, who was offered the Lakers' head coach job himself in 2004, was an unofficial consultant during the team's search process, according to The Athletic.\n\nThe Lakers weren't the only team to consider Redick as a head coach. He interviewed with the Charlotte Hornets in April and reportedly talked to the Toronto Raptors for their opening last year.\n\nCredibility with players shouldn't be an issue for Redick after a 15-year career in the NBA that included stints with the Orlando Magic, Los Angeles Clippers, Philadelphia 76ers, New Orleans Pelicans, Milwaukee Bucks and Dallas Mavericks. He was the Magic's first-round pick (No. 11 overall) in the 2006 NBA Draft after a four-year career at Duke. As an NBA player, Redick averaged 12.5 points per game and shot 42% on three-pointers.\n\nRedick replaces Darvin Ham, who was fired after two seasons.

They've only offered the job to Dan Hurley and then the Lakers pivoted back to JJ Redick, who what Rob Pelinka had at the Combine was kind of a 9-minute, get to know you, not digging real deep but just talking. And then they brought him to L.A. last weekend and he went through the more formal interview process. Redick has talked with Rob Pelinka since then, I know Pelinka has talked with another candidate or two since Redick's interview this week. But what is really left for the Lakers and JJ Redick at this point is for the Lakers to make an offer, which they haven't quite done yet.\"\n\nWojnarowski added that having a coach in place by the June 27 draft isn't a requirement although it is a goal of the Lakers':\n\n\"Yes and no, Scott. It's not quite like the NFL where you have to have your coach in place for the draft where you're gonna draft players built on that coach's system. Detroit probably won't have a coach by the draft, but it is important, it is the Lakers' goal. And listen, they are focused right now on JJ Redick. JJ Redick is a different hire than Dan Hurley would have been, I think JJ Redick certainly knows the NBA better than Dan Hurley. Dan Hurley knows how to coach a team, build a coaching staff, all the things that go into head coaching that even at the college level translate. So I think for JJ Redick and the Lakers, what does a Redick coaching staff look like? All of those are certainly important elements you want to have in place if you're going to bring him in. But right now, JJ Redick is at the forefront of this and again, really all that is left for L.A. to do is to offer the job to JJ Redick, that hasn't quite happened yet.\"\n\nIt's unclear why the Lakers haven't yet offered the position to Redick and if they are still considering other candidates. It could have to do with still contemplating how many years and how much money to offer, or someone in the organization could be getting second thoughts about the idea of hiring someone that has never coached.\n\nRedick wasn't the Lakers' first choice, after all, with them offering the job to Hurley and him turning them down.\n\nIf the Lakers don't make an offer to JJ Redick soon, he may consider other options with him already being linked to the Detroit Pistons, who fired their head coach Monty Williams on Wednesday morning.", "source": {"uri": "lakersnation.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lakers Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "daniel_starkand@lakersnation.com", "name": "Daniel Starkand", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pelinka", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Rob Pelinka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Wojnarowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adrian Wojnarowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SportsCenter", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "SportsCenter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Monty Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Pistons", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Pistons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 89}], "image": "https://s22928.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/JJ-Redick.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662595", "eventUri": "eng-9662595", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-27", "textStart": 1184, "textEnd": 1191}], "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 213, "relevance": 1}

He joined ESPN's lead commentary team earlier this year.\n\nESPN first reported the decision.\n\nBefore Redick finished broadcasting the NBA Finals, he met with the Lakers last weekend and apparently did well enough to end the franchise's lengthy coaching search. Less than two weeks after UConn coach Danny Hurley turned down the Lakers' ardent advances, Redick has accepted the job in a remarkable three-year journey from the court to the broadcast booth to the Lakers' bench.\n\nRedick replaces Darvin Ham, who was fired May 3 despite leading the Lakers to two playoff berths and a Western Conference finals appearance in 2023.\n\nRedick began recording a regular podcast with James two months ago, and their \"Mind the Game\" collaboration is already wildly popular, with listeners often emerging impressed by the duo's basketball acumen and high-level discussion of tactics and motivation.\n\nNow these two minds will be working together for the Lakers, with Redick leading a roster headlined by James, who is six months younger than Redick.\n\nEverything is contingent on James deciding to return to play with Anthony Davis and the Lakers, of course. James, who will enter his 22nd NBA season this fall, could decline his $51.4 million contract option this month to become a free agent.\n\nBut hiring Redick seems to be another calculated move by the Lakers to maximize their chances of keeping the 20-time All-Star and the driving force behind their 2020 championship team.\n\nRedick's coaching experience is limited to his children's youth teams, but he has been around the game his entire life. He is the leading scorer in the history of Duke, where he played four seasons under Mike Krzyzewski.\n\nAnd though Redick is an unorthodox choice, his unlikely ascent is not without some precedent in Lakers lore and recent NBA history.\n\nPat Riley was a broadcaster for the Lakers in November 1979 when Paul Westhead took over as their head coach after Jack McKinney nearly died in a bicycle accident. Westhead hired Riley as an assistant without coaching experience, and Riley became the Lakers' head coach in late 1981 after Westhead clashed with Magic Johnson.\n\nRiley promptly led the Lakers to four championships in the 1980s to begin his incredible career as a coach and executive.\n\nAnd then there's Steve Kerr, the former shooting guard and Phoenix Suns executive who had never coached before he took over at Golden State in 2014. Kerr has led Stephen Curry's Warriors to four championships and six NBA Finals appearances in the past decade.\n\nRedick's arrival ends another unusual offseason coaching search for owner Jeanie Buss, general manager Rob Pelinka and the Lakers, who are hiring their eighth head coach since Phil Jackson's final departure in 2011, and their fourth since James arrived as a free agent in 2018.\n\nLos Angeles needed six weeks to settle on Ham in the summer of 2022, but the longtime assistant coach was dismissed after the Lakers lost to defending champion Denver in the first round of the Western Conference playoffs.\n\nHam led the Lakers to two winning seasons and a victory in the inaugural In-Season Tournament last year, but many fans and observers - and, clearly, the Lakers' front office - were not impressed by his leadership or preparation.\n\nDavis memorably said during the playoffs that the Lakers \"have stretches where we don't know what we're doing on both ends of the floor.\"\n\nThe Lakers hired Ham after firing Frank Vogel, who had been fired exactly 18 months after he won a title in the Florida bubble. Vogel replaced Luke Walton after another long coaching search in which the Lakers were widely reported to have wanted Tyronn Lue, only for a deal to fall apart over issues with money and control.",

The main reason he hasn't been hired yet by the team is that he was calling the NBA Finals for ESPN and didn't want to have any distractions within his responsibilities.\n\nHowever, with the NBA Finals now over, Redick still hasn't been hired. It's strange, but the Lakers are notorious for slow-playing things over the years.\n\nBut what if part of the holdup is that another team was trying to steal Redick from Los Angeles? According to Vincent Goodwill of Yahoo Sports, the Detroit Pistons have an interest in Redick and a freshly opened head coaching position.\n\n\"James Borrego could be a name to watch, league sources told Yahoo Sports, as well as ESPN analyst JJ Redick. Redick is currently a prime candidate for the Lakers job, so it isn't known how much traction Detroit could actually gain.\"\n\nWhile many have speculated that the Lakers' job was Redick's to lose, he may turn his attention elsewhere. The pressure of coaching the Pistons is far less than the Lakers and he would get to be closer to the East Coast.\n\nHowever, there's still a high chance that Redick will be named the head coach of the Lakers unless he flat-out turns the job down.

That series ended on Monday, but the Lakers still don't have a head coach in place with the NBA Draft creeping up.\n\nIf it is not Redick then the other name that has been in the mix for the Lakers is James Borrego, although he is also the frontrunner for the Cleveland Cavaliers and now could be an option for the Detroit Pistons after they parted ways with Monty Williams. He is not alone in that as Vincent Goodwill of Yahoo Sports is also reporting that Redick is a name to watch for the Pistons:\n\nJames Borrego could be a name to watch, league sources told Yahoo Sports, as well as ESPN analyst JJ Redick. Redick is currently a prime candidate for the Lakers job, so it isn't known how much traction Detroit could actually gain.\n\nIt's hard to imagine Redick passing up the Lakers and his friend LeBron James to coach the Pistons, who had the worst record in the league last season. But there certainly would be less pressure in Detroit for Redick so maybe he considers it, especially since he has never coached before at any level. He would be given time to develop the Pistons' young players as opposed to needing to win right away in L.A.\n\nAfter already getting turned down by Dan Hurley, the Lakers also losing out on Redick would be a disaster for the Lakers front office in their coaching search. It will be interesting to see if the Pistons getting in the mix gives the Lakers more urgency to close the deal with Redick, or if L.A. will continue to be methodical in its search before coming to a decision.\n\nOne name who could potentially come up for the Lakers is Monty Williams, who was let go by the Pistons after just one season.

On paper, it is one of the more surprising hires in recent NBA history. Redick has no coaching experience at the professional or collegiate level. He has never worked in a front office. While he had a lengthy and successful NBA playing career, he wasn't a point guard like most no-experience hires.\n\nNo, Redick has been appointed to the highest-pressure coaching job in the entire sport based on 15 years as a 3-point marksman, eight years as a podcaster, and three as a television analyst. We're years away from knowing whether or not that unconventional background will lead to his success or failure as a head coach, but the hire is going to have immediate ramifications for several key figures around the Lakers and around the league. So let's take a look at the aftershocks here. Who are the winners and losers of the Redick hire?\n\nWinner: JJ Redick\n\nLet's start with the obvious: for all of the problems that come with coaching the Lakers (and believe me, we're going to cover several of them), you still, you know, get to coach the Lakers. The pressure that comes with this job is there for a reason. The entire basketball world is watching you. The entire player pool wants to play for you, and you usually have access to more talent than the rest of the league. Even now, at a relative down point in team history, leading the Lakers means deploying LeBron James and Anthony Davis.\n\nThat's an incredible opportunity for any coach. It's downright remarkable for a coach with no experience. Redick had interviewed for other head-coaching jobs in the past. He was never going to have the sort of win-now opportunity in Charlotte or Toronto that James and Davis give him right now. He was never going to have the sort of platform that comes with this job either. If Redick has won with the Hornets or Raptors, he'd just be any other winning coach. Win with the Lakers and suddenly a level of fame (and, despite their relative frugality, salary) that isn't available with the rest of the league is suddenly on the table. This is a high-risk job, but it's a high-reward job as well. If Redick weren't prepared for the former he wouldn't have taken the job. The latter is ultimately why he took it.\n\nLoser: JJ Redick\n\nWhen the Lakers were looking for a coach in 2022, Redick himself pointed out why this job isn't necessarily desirable on ESPN's Get Up. \"Until they start building their team like every other team in the NBA does, in the modern NBA, I don't think this is a good job.\"\n\nFor better or, lately, for worse, the Lakers do not operate like a normal NBA team. They simultaneously have one of the smallest front offices in basketball in terms of manpower devoted to things like scouting and analytics and one of the largest front offices in basketball in terms of how many power brokers seemingly have a hand on the wheel when it comes to major basketball decisions. Rob Pelinka is nominally in charge. Linda Rambis is a longtime advisor of Jeanie Buss with more power than her \"executive director of special projects\" title suggests. Kurt Rambis holds a similarly vague and influential position within the franchise. Magic Johnson grumbled about how involved President of Business Operations Tim Harris was in basketball operations during his time as team president. Younger Buss siblings Joey and Jesse have gained renown in the G-League and scouting departments, respectively. When a major decision is made in this franchise, nobody quite knows who made it.\n\nAnd lately, most of those major decisions have been wrong. The 2020 Lakers built a championship roster by surrounding James and Davis with 3-and-D wings. They have spent the four years since dismantling that concept. They've thrown asset after asset after asset into the \"find a point guard that can ease LeBron's ball-handling burden\" wishing well and never found one. They've never found a long-term center that can shoot well enough to take pressure off of Davis, either. Wings have been few and far between. At times, it seems that the only principle guiding Lakers moves is fame. They add stars. They add former stars. They add highly drafted busts that we once believed would be stars. Sometimes it works. More often, it doesn't. It's pretty hard to win a championship when acquisitions are just so heavily on points per game.\n\nThe Lakers have had six head coaches since Phil Jackson retired in 2011. Redick will be No. 7. If this brain trust doesn't improve, it won't be long before someone else is No. 8. The Lakers fired Frank Vogel two years after a championship. They fired Darvin Ham one year after reaching the Western Conference finals. If things go wrong in Los Angeles, and recent history suggests they probably will, this front office has proven perfectly willing to use a coach as a blame shield before. And without a traditional coaching background to fall back on, failure in Los Angeles might doom Redick's promising career before it really starts. Redick said it himself: for the Lakers to do a good job, they need to start acting like every other team. They have never, at any point in their history, shown any willingness to do so.\n\nWinner: LeBron James\n\nThis is a two-pronged victory for James. We'll start with the obvious: assuming James re-signs with the Lakers, he will now be playing for his (former???) podcast co-host in Redick. Obviously, it's unclear just how deep the relationship between these two go. Redick and James never played together in the NBA. The Mind the Game podcast launched only in March. It's not as though the Lakers hired Dwyane Wade as their coach. The two are professional. They are at least friendly. We don't know quite how friendly, but the suits James fine.\n\nHe obviously wouldn't have agreed to do a podcast with Redick if he hadn't endorsed him as a basketball thinker. While understanding basketball tactics and being able to implement them within the structure of a professional team are two different things, it's hard to imagine James vehemently disagreeing with Redick on strategic matters. They are going to be broadly aligned on the ways that the Lakers need to play in order to win. That sort of buy-in is never a guarantee where James is concerned. From that perspective, this is an obvious victory.\n\nBut James has successfully managed to keep his distance during the search. Rich Paul told Bleacher Report's Chris Haynes that James \"is not involved\" in the search to replace Ham. Virtually all of the reporting has echoed that sentiment, and it's just smart PR from his perspective. Does the Redick hire work? James was an early adopter, just like he was for, say, Malik Monk or Migos. But if it doesn't? James can argue that his hands are clean. That means quite a bit given his Machiavellian reputation. When the Russell Westbrook trade blew up a few years ago, James drew an inordinate amount of blame for its failure. This time, he's done enough to ensure to protect himself this time around. It's a win-win for an all-time great.\n\nLoser: Anthony Davis\n\nIn that same interview with Haynes, Paul said that, in his opinion, \"the Lakers' focus should probably be more so on Anthony Davis than LeBron at this point.\" Well, according to Marc Stein, Redick probably wasn't the preferred choice of Davis. That would have been James Borrego, who overlapped briefly with Davis in New Orleans more than a decade ago.\n\nIs there a reason for that aside from that preexisting relationship? It's hard to say. Redick's coaching philosophy is still such a work in progress that it wouldn't be fair to suggest that he will or won't be able to maximize Davis. Borrego never had a big man like him when he was coaching the Hornets. Notably, though, Redick did not vote for Davis as an All-Defense player last season. That's not a great start to their coexistence considering how hard Davis has lobbied for Defensive Player of the Year in the past.\n\nWinner: Broadcasters everywhere\n\nESPN's Brian Windhorst made a notable point about the unusual nature of Redick's candidacy on a recent Get Up appearance. \"Frankly, his interviews have been in those podcasts with LeBron James,\" Windhorst said. \"They've extensively broken down the Lakers' offense, extensively broken down what they do. It's been out there for the whole world to hear, including from the Lakers' front office.\"\n\nObviously, Redick didn't get the job entirely on the basis of those podcasts, but there's a broader point here. Redick successfully used his platform at ESPN to jump from no coaching experience to the single highest-profile coaching job in the entire sport. Is that going to be a model moving forward?\n\nWell, Redick isn't the first broadcaster to jump into coaching. Steve Kerr did it in 2014, though he had also worked in the front office for the Phoenix Suns. Others have tried, with TNT's Kenny Smith notably interviewing for several jobs. But Redick is unique in the combination of his lack of experience and his immediate success, at least as a candidate. Not every broadcaster can emulate Redick's rise. Success in media does ultimately come down to personality to some extent. But the broad strokes are replicable. Owners aren't as entrenched in the day-to-day goings on around the league. They are likely to have stronger opinions about television analysts than anonymous assistant coaches.\n\nThat may not be enough to get jobs in itself, but it's a foot in the door. If other analysts can use the platform that studio shows and game broadcasts give them to show off the creativity and likability that Redick did, they are going to be presented with coaching opportunities as well. If nothing else, they'll be able to use those coaching opportunities to leverage higher broadcasting salaries. Redick's hiring is, therefore, a win for the entire industry.\n\nLoser: Rob Pelinka\n\nPelinka has now overseen three head-coaching searches. Two of them have been pretty publicly messy. The Lakers offered the job to Ty Lue in 2019. He turned it down because they only offered him a three-year deal and wanted input on his staff. This time around, Redick got the job only after Dan Hurley said no. The Lakers were widely ridiculed for their low-ball offer. Now, Pelinka has landed on Redick. In a perfect world, he's found a gem and Redick can be the coach for the foreseeable future.\n\nBut it's one thing to stick your neck out for Frank Vogel, a head coach that has won elsewhere, or Darvin Ham, a well-respected assistant. This hire, given Redick's background, was a significant risk. If it doesn't pay off, well, let's just say it's not exactly common for general managers to get to hire a fourth head coach. James has so aggressively and preemptively attempted to shield himself from blame on this hire that if it does fail, there just isn't going to be anyone else for Pelinka to use as an excuse.\n\nDoes that mean he's on the hot seat? Not necessarily. It's frankly impossible to know where the Lakers are concerned. Somehow, Vogel was the scapegoat for a trade Pelinka made and James endorsed when the Westbrook deal cost him his job. Pelinka's status as the closest ally to Kobe Bryant has, thus far, made him practically bulletproof within the organization. If he ever does lose ground, we might not even know. That confusing Lakers power structure might be able to take his power without taking his title.\n\nBut the pressure is on now. James is about to turn 40. Davis is firmly in his 30s. The sheen from the 2020 title has worn off. If this hire doesn't work, it's entirely possible that the Lakers are headed for a very dark half-decade or more. If such a down period comes, it seems almost impossible to imagine that the Lakers make it through that time without making any meaningful front-office changes. You don't just get to keep firing coaches forever.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sam_quinn@cbssports.com", "name": "Sam Quinn",

Redick", "body": "After the Los Angeles Lakers failed to agree to a deal with UConn's Dan Hurley, the attention has shifted back to JJ Redick.\n\nThe former NBA guard and current ESPN analyst is once again the front-runner for the Lakers' head coaching job, but nothing has officially been confirmed.\n\nAs the Lakers continue to prolong their decision, another NBA team with a head coaching opening could make a move to bring Redick in.\n\nAccording to Yahoo Sports' Vincent Goodwill, Redick is now also a name to watch in the Detroit Pistons' search for a new head coach.\n\nThe Pistons parted ways with Monty Williams just one year after making him the highest-paid coach in NBA history, and Redick has ties to some other members of the organization.\n\nHe worked with fellow Duke alum Trajan Langdon - now the Pistons' top executive - in New Orleans during his time with the Pelicans. Goodwill says Redick is also well liked by Detroit's vice chairman Arn Tellem.\n\nChoosing between the Pistons and Lakers jobs may not be as simple as some think. Detroit has been near the bottom of the league for years, but the team has promising young talent like Cade Cunningham and Jaden Ivey to work with.\n\nThe Lakers are likely to have both LeBron James and Anthony Davis on the roster next season, but the expectations and media scrutiny that comes with the job may be more than Redick wants to deal with.\n\nThe Pistons have also shown a willingness to spend on coaches, as they did last year with Williams. Williams is still owed around $65 million in his contract buyout, but it's more of a commitment than any Lakers coach has received since Phil Jackson.\n\nWe'll see which team Redick chooses, and if he'll trade in the analyst's headset for a spot on the sideline in Detroit or LA next season.\n\nRelated: Brian Windhorst Knows What Is JJ Redick's 'Real' Interview With Lakers", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "kameron_duncan@postandcourier.com", "name": "Kameron Duncan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Pistons", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Pistons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajan_Langdon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trajan Langdon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monty Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arn_Tellem", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Arn Tellem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Blue_Devils_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Duke Blue Devils men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans_Pelicans", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans Pelicans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaden_Ivey", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaden Ivey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cade_Cunningham", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cade Cunningham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phil Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/e4/4e4b951e-a1ac-52d7-bc82-62f15dd4a8a2/6674778b21b1f.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C85&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662595", "eventUri": "eng-9662595", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

He was a pioneer in the podcasting space, one of the first active players to be a host, before continuing with a production and podcast company in retirement.\n\nOne of Redick's podcasts, \"Mind the Game,\" is co-hosted by Lakers star LeBron James.\n\nRedick is the 29th head coach for the franchise and the seventh hired since Phil Jackson left the Lakers in 2011.\n\nRedick, Hurley and James Borrego were the only candidates to have in-person interviews, though Lakers general manager Rob Pelinka spoke with other candidates earlier in the process.\n\nThe Lakers zeroed in on Redick at the NBA draft combine, according to people with knowledge of the search not authorized to discuss it publicly.\n\nAfter Hurley declined the job days following meetings with the Lakers, the search quickly re-centered on Redick, the former Duke star meeting with the team between Games 4 and 5 of the NBA Finals, a series he's calling for ABC/ESPN.\n\nThe Lakers are expected to add a former head coach to Redick's staff as a lead assistant to offset his lack of experience, people with knowledge of staff recruitment who were not authorized to discuss it publicly told The Times.\n\nRedick replaces Darvin Ham, whom the team fired after two seasons as the head coach. Despite two playoff berths, Ham's standing within the Lakers' locker room suffered. The team looked for a \"grinder,\" people with knowledge of the search said, who could give the team more of a strategic edge.\n\nThe Lakers also suffered from a lack of in-game adjustments. There are concerns, though, that any first-time head coach, particularly one with no coaching experience, will struggle with that part of the job.\n\nThe coaching hire is the first step in an offseason during which the team is facing crucial roster decisions, particularly with James.\n\nJames is expected to opt out of his current contract. Although the sense is he'll re-sign with the Lakers, he will be an unrestricted free agent if he declines his player option.\n\nThe team has a first-round pick in the draft, and by league rules could trade that and up to two more future first-round picks, but the Lakers will have limited options in free agency. That leaves potential trades as the primary pathway for improvement.\n\nRedick, a star at Duke, played 15 seasons in the NBA, including four with the Clippers.", "source": {"uri": "latimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Los Angeles Times"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Hurley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dan Hurley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Borrego", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "James Borrego"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pelinka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rob Pelinka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phil Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Darvin Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Blue_Devils_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Duke Blue Devils men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c604ad8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6566x3693+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb9%2F37%2F5ad0722748c1b284a341acf211e5%2Fknicks-magic-basketball-57177.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662595", "eventUri": "eng-9662595", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-06-10", "textStart": 402, "textEnd": 409}], "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 209, "relevance": 1}

Despite having no coaching experience, Redick's basketball intelligence - which is often seen during his appearances on ESPN broadcasts - along with his tactical concepts of the modern game obviously drew the attention of the franchise's brass. It also doesn't hurt that he has a good relationship with Lakers star LeBron James, whom he hosts a podcast with.\n\nThe move comes shortly after University of Connecticut head coach Dan Hurley rejected the Lakers' offer to become their next head coach. The offer was for six years and $70 million.\n\nRedick will be tasked with getting the Lakers back on a championship path after a disappointing season that saw the team eliminated in the first round by the Denver Nuggets for the second straight season. During the previous year, Los Angeles was swept out of the Western Conference Finals by the Nuggets.\n\nHowever, it will be no easy task as the Lakers have failed to sustain success in recent years. Not only will Redick be the fourth head coach in James' tenure since joining Los Angeles in 2018, they've either failed to advance past the first round or have missed the playoffs in four of his six seasons with the Lakers. Furthermore, they are now on their seventh head coach in the past 12 years since Phil Jackson's retirement at the conclusion of the 2010-11 season.\n\nThe move comes a little over a month after Los Angeles dismissed Darvin Ham as head coach after just two seasons. Ham had compiled a 90-74 record during his two seasons with the Lakers. However, his \"in-game adjustments helped widen the disconnect caused by some of the lineup decisions that players questioned,\" according to Dan Woike of The Los Angeles Times. Furthermore, it was reported that James bristled at the idea of Ham's minutes restriction for him at the beginning of the season. That plan was quickly scrapped after the beginning of the season.\n\nWhile Redick has no coaching experience, he's not the first head coach to be hired with a lack of resume. Jason Kidd coached the Brooklyn Nets to a conference semfinals playoff appearance during his first season with the Brooklyn Nets in 2013-14. Meanwhile, Larry Bird coached the Indiana Pacers to within a game of the NBA Finals in 1997-98.\n\nIn other words, while Redick will be entering as a rookie head coach, he'll be doing so in an environment with higher expectations than anywhere else. Considering both James - 39 years old - and Anthony Davis - 31 years old - are running out of time as a duo, the expectation will be to win a championship immediately.

Redick will be the seventh head coach the Lakers have employed since Phil Jackson stepped away in 2011.\n\nRedick signed a four-year contract with the Lakers, according to ESPN. None of the Lakers' previous six head coaches lasted longer than three years.\n\nRedick appeared in 91 games across two seasons in New Orleans. He signed a two-year, $25 million contract with the Pelicans in 2019.\n\nIn November 2020, Redick requested a trade and sought to go to a team in the Northeast part of the country to live closer to his family. The Pelicans traded Redick to the Dallas Mavericks shortly before the 2021 trade deadline. Redick sounded off on New Orleans' front office -- specifically, executive vice president David Griffin -- on his podcast.\n\n\"I don't think you're going to get honesty from that front office, just objectively speaking,\" Redick said.\n\nRedick appeared in 13 games with the Mavericks before retiring in September 2021.\n\nThe NBA podcast Redick launched, The Old Man and the Three, was a success. It has more than 1 million YouTube subscribers. Redick also quickly climbed the ranks at ESPN. Earlier this month, he was part of the three-person team that called the NBA Finals.\n\nRedick's decision to get into coaching means he will leave his media career behind. The Lakers went 47-35 last season and were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the Denver Nuggets. Redick will guide a roster featuring LeBron James, who turns 40 years old in December, in his rookie season as a head coach. The Lakers' roster, of course, also includes former Pelicans big man Anthony Davis.\n\nThe Pelicans traded Davis to the Lakers in 2019.

He still went forth with the interview process and continued to impress the Lakers brass along the way.\n\nRedick's relationship with LeBron James and known basketball IQ were known positives for the Lakers and it appears they have pegged him as their next head coach, according to Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN:\n\nRedick has never coached at any level so this is an obvious gamble for the Lakers, who are now on their seventh full-time head coach since Phil Jackson retired in 2011.\n\nThe hope is that Redick will have a similar impact to when Pat Riley took over in the 1980s, using his bright basketball mind, competitiveness and media savvy to transform the Lakers back into championship contenders.\n\nNow that the Lakers have a head coach in place, the focus will shift towards putting a staff together, the upcoming NBA Draft and then free agency. The Lakers have a lot of tough decisions to make and will likely consult with Redick to see what his vision is for filling out the roster.\n\nWith Redick being the choice though, all parties involved likely feel confident that they will be able to re-sign James, which will be their first order of offseason business.\n\nWith JJ Redick being the frontrunner from the beginning, he wasted no time trying to put his staff together as Rajon Rondo and Scott Brooks already emerged as potential targets.\n\nKnowing Redick is going to be a head coach for the first time, the Lakers will likely look to surround him with a lot of experience on his staff.

The Lakers were considered a given to sign JJ, but the latest word on the street suggests that the Pistons could swoop in with an offer that disrupts their plans.\n\n\"James Borrego could be a name to watch, league sources told Yahoo Sports, as well as ESPN analyst JJ Redick,\" wrote Vincent Goodwill. \"Redick is currently a prime candidate for the Lakers job, so it isn't known how much traction Detroit could actually gain.\"\n\nThe Pistons are fresh off the firing of their former coach, Monty Williams, who was brought in just last summer and given a historic contract worth six years, $78.5 million. But after leading the Pistons to an abysmal 14-68 record, which included an NBA record 28-game losing streak, experts began to question if he even wanted the job at all.\n\nWhen the team's new President, Trajan Langdon, was given full control this summer he had the ultimate green light to make this call and he chose to move from Williams after just one season to try his own choice for the position. So far, the list of candidates is pretty short but both of the Lakers' top choices (James Borrego and JJ Redick) are people they will consider for the job.\n\nNobody knows what Redick is looking for in his first head coaching gig but one has to imagine that he'd sooner link up with LeBron James and the Lakers than hitch his wagon to the Detroit Pistons, who are headed nowhere in the Eastern Conference.\n\nThen again, being coach of the Pistons comes with a lot less pressure than the Lakers, and JJ might just thrive in an environment where he has full control over what happens on the court and behind the scenes.\n\nStephen A. Smith Says The Lakers Should Pursue Monty Williams\n\nThe Lakers are still reeling over being rejected by UConn coach Dan Hurley and he was clearly among their top choices for the job. But with him off the board now, and still no clear choice in sight, the Lakers are starting to feel some major pressure to push this process along.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Redick has once again emerged as the top candidate for the Lakers but there are reports that he may not want to deal with the Lakers' drama. If so, they may want to heed Stephen A. Smith's advice and bring in 52-year-old Monty Williams for an interview.\n\n\"I know we've been talking a lot about JJ [Redick]. With Monty Williams available, that is a situation the Los Angeles Lakers should look at,\" said Stephen A. \"I'm rooting for [Jeanie Buss] to find the right person for the job.\"\n\nThe Lakers have cycled through coaches at an alarming rate and it's no wonder why the front office is desperate to find one that sticks. In what could be the last stretch of LeBron's career, they need someone who can get results right away while also building toward the future.\n\nWilliams, who coached for the Suns and Pistons, doesn't have the best track record right now but there was a time when he was leading a veteran group in the Finals. If he can tap into that for the Lakers, he could make a huge difference for them.\n\nOf course, with just a few weeks to go before free agency, the Lakers are on the clock to get it together and if they begin next month without a man in the locker room it will make it much harder to bring any new players to the Lakers.\n\nRelated: Stephen A.

Irwin tweeted today the news that many have expected since UConn basketball head coach Dan Hurley turned down Los Angeles in favor of returning to Storrs.\n\n\"Hearing it's done,\" Irwin wrote. \"JJ Redick is the next coach of the Lakers. About to go live to talk about it.\"\n\nRedick had been a part of ESPN's broadcast team for the NBA Finals, which The Athletic's Jovan Buha had said could have slowed down the Lakers' hiring process. But with the Boston Celtics defeating the Dallas Mavericks last night to end the series and thus the season, Redick is apparently clear of media responsibilities now.\n\nJJ Redick spent 15 years playing in the NBA, most notably with the Los Angeles Clippers and Philadelphia 76ers, before retiring in 2021. Even before his retirement, Redick became one of the first active players to host a podcast, which he parlayed into even greater success in the past few years.\n\nWhile deciding to leave the game behind, Redick stayed connected to the NBA via his popular podcasting ventures, as well as a media personality with ESPN. Initially an occasional guest on 'First Take and a secondary color commentator on ESPN's NBA broadcasts, Redick ascended to a seat on ESPN's top broadcasting team during the 2023-24 season after Doc Rivers, who coached Redick during his time with the Clippers, left his broadcasting gig to return to coaching with the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nRedick ended up calling his first NBA Finals as a result of Rivers' departure, but during the postseason, Redick's name surfaced as a potential head coaching candidate for two jobs: the Charlotte Hornets' and the Los Angeles Lakers'. A Duke graduate, Redick was reportedly one of the finalists for the Hornets' vacant head coaching position before Boston Celtics assistant Charles Lee was hired.\n\nThat left the Lakers, who coincidentally have LeBron James under contract. James and Redick started hosting a podcast together, 'Mind the Game,' earlier this season, which led some to believe James had done so in a calculated attempt to undermine then-Lakers head coach Darvin Ham.\n\nAfter the Lakers were bounced from the playoffs by the Denver Nuggets in the first round of the postseason, Ham and his entire staff were fired. Reported top candidates to replace Ham included Mike Budenholzer, James Borrego, Kenny Atkinson, and Redick, the latter of whom has no relevant coaching experience.\n\nWhile Redick remained at or near the top of the Lakers' reported list, UConn basketball coach Dan Hurley suddenly shot to the forefront in recent weeks. While seemingly not being discussed as a candidate for more than a month, Hurley was reportedly offered a $70 million contract by the Lakers, which would have made him one of the top five highest-paid coaches in the NBA.\n\nHurley turned the Lakers down, however, so now the Lakers are seemingly primed to hire Redick and give him his first crack at coaching.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "preston_byers@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Preston Byers", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UConn_Huskies_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UConn Huskies men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Hurley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dan Hurley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doc_Rivers", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Doc Rivers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Darvin Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_commentator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Color commentator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Budenholzer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Budenholzer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Blue_Devils_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Duke Blue Devils men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Hornets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte Hornets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/JJ-Redick-to-Lakers-is-done-after-NBA-Finals-conclusion.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662595", "eventUri": "eng-9662595", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3176470588235294, "wgt": 206, "relevance": 1}

They found their man in former NBA shooting guard and ESPN analyst JJ Redick.\n\nThe Lakers had a newsworthy flirtation with UConn coach Dan Hurley, but it seems as though their guy may have been JJ Redick all along.\n\nThe Lakers were seriously linked to JJ Redick in Early June, as The Athletic's Shams Charania reported that he was the front-runner for the job back on June 6.\n\nBut, the search quickly turned to the two-time defending champion Dan Hurley, who ultimately turned them down to stay at UConn and chase a three-peat. Apparently, that moved the search back to Redick, though names like James Borrego were also mentioned.\n\nJJ Redick and Lakers forward LeBron James, who could theoretically leave this offseason by opting out and signing elsewhere in free agency, started a podcast called Mind The Game. Given the close relationship between JJ Redick and LeBron James, is this the coach they wanted all along? After all, if LeBron left in free agency, the Lakers would be drawing dead.\n\nRedick is certainly an out-of-the-box hire. He has no coaching experience and has been working in media since his fifteen-season NBA career finished up in 2021. The former Duke star definitely has great basketball acumen. But, is this the right hire to risk the future of the Lakers on, given that they're pretty mortgaged out for the future and they're in win-now mode.\n\nThe case study for this working out is Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr. Kerr didn't have any coaching experience when he took the Warriors job prior to the 2014-2015 season, reeling off three titles in four years and winning another one in 2022. But, Kerr had worked in high-ranking front office roles with the Phoenix Suns, experience that Redick does not have.\n\nThe Lakers are betting that the experience doesn't matter.

Williams, a former Duke star like Redick, may have tipped the Lakers' hand Tuesday when he called Redick the Lakers' coach.\n\n\"You have the Los Angeles Lakers that are trying to figure it out with JJ Redick, a first-time head coach, we wish him all the best of luck with LeBron James in his twilight years,\" Williams said.\n\nWhile Redick also has that Duke connection with Langdon, the Pistons

He joined ESPN's lead commentary team earlier this year.\n\nESPN first reported the decision.\n\nBefore Redick finished broadcasting the NBA Finals, he met with the Lakers last weekend and apparently did well enough to end the franchise's lengthy coaching search. Less than two weeks after UConn coach Danny Hurley turned down the Lakers' ardent advances, Redick has accepted the job in a remarkable three-year journey from the court to the broadcast booth to the Lakers' bench.\n\nRedick replaces Darvin Ham, who was fired May 3 despite leading the Lakers to two playoff berths and a Western Conference finals appearance in 2023.\n\nRedick began recording a regular podcast with James two months ago, and their \"Mind the Game\" collaboration is already wildly popular, with listeners often emerging impressed by the duo's basketball acumen and high-level discussion of tactics and motivation.\n\nNow these two minds will be working together for the Lakers, with Redick leading a roster headlined by James, who is six months younger than Redick.\n\nEverything is contingent on James deciding to return to play with Anthony Davis and the Lakers, of course. James, who will enter his 22nd NBA season this fall, could decline his $51.4 million contract option this month to become a free agent.\n\nBut hiring Redick seems to be another calculated move by the Lakers to maximize their chances of keeping the 20-time All-Star and the driving force behind their 2020 championship team.\n\nRedick's coaching experience is limited to his children's youth teams, but he has been around the game his entire life. He is the leading scorer in the history of Duke, where he played four seasons under Mike Krzyzewski.\n\nAnd though Redick is an unorthodox choice, his unlikely ascent is not without some precedent in Lakers lore and recent NBA history.\n\nPat Riley was a broadcaster for the Lakers in November 1979 when Paul Westhead took over as their head coach after Jack McKinney nearly died in a bicycle accident. Westhead hired Riley as an assistant without coaching experience, and Riley became the Lakers' head coach in late 1981 after Westhead clashed with Magic Johnson.\n\nRiley promptly led the Lakers to four championships in the 1980s to begin his incredible career as a coach and executive.\n\nAnd then there's Steve Kerr, the former shooting guard and Phoenix Suns executive who had never coached before he took over at Golden State in 2014. Kerr has led Stephen Curry's Warriors to four championships and six NBA Finals appearances in the past decade.\n\nRedick's arrival ends another unusual offseason coaching search for owner Jeanie Buss, general manager Rob Pelinka and the Lakers, who are hiring their eighth head coach since Phil Jackson's final departure in 2011, and their fourth since James arrived as a free agent in 2018.\n\nLos Angeles needed six weeks to settle on Ham in the summer of 2022, but the longtime assistant coach was dismissed after the Lakers lost to defending champion Denver in the first round of the Western Conference playoffs.\n\nHam led the Lakers to two winning seasons and a victory in the inaugural In-Season Tournament last year, but many fans and observers -- and, clearly, the Lakers' front office -- were not impressed by his leadership or preparation.\n\nDavis memorably said during the playoffs that the Lakers \"have stretches where we don't know what we're doing on both ends of the floor.\"\n\nThe Lakers hired Ham after firing Frank Vogel, who had been fired exactly 18 months after he won a title in the Florida bubble. Vogel replaced Luke Walton after another long coaching search in which the Lakers were widely reported to have wanted Tyronn Lue, only for a deal to fall apart over issues with money and control.",

After his 15-year playing career, Redick became an NBA analyst for ESPN and flexed his knowledge of the game through his \"The Old Man and the Three\" and \"Mind the Game\" podcasts, the latter co-hosted by his star player James.\n\nIs Redick the right person for the Lakers head coaching job? The Sporting News grades the hire below.\n\nMORE: Will Lakers select Bronny James with No. 17 overall pick?\n\nRedick was rumored to be the Lakers' primary head coaching target from the get-go and they got their guy.\n\nLos Angeles reportedly believes Redick has \"Pat Riley-like\" potential, expecting the 39-year-old to lead the franchise for the foreseeable future, according to The Athletic's Shams Charania and Jovan Buha.\n\nWith the present and future in mind, hiring Redick makes a lot of sense for the Lakers.\n\nLet's start with the former. The biggest decision of Los Angeles' offseason belongs to franchise cornerstone James, who faces a $51.4 million player option with the potential to become an unrestricted free agent. Even if all signs point to James staying with the Lakers, hiring his friend and podcast co-host will likely help put pen to paper on a new deal faster.\n\nJames has clearly developed a personal relationship and high respect for Redick as a basketball mind. It's safe to assume Los Angeles would not have moved forward on Redick as a candidate if he wasn't approved by James in some fashion.\n\nConcerns about a first-year head coach with no previous NBA coaching experience are valid. Leading a team, managing personalities, navigating a rotation and creating gameplans are much different than talking about those things on television or a podcast.\n\nThat will be one of Redick's toughest tests, but Los Angeles will have to hope his experience as a player makes that a seamless transition.\n\nMORE: Breaking down Phoenix's chances of landing LeBron James\n\nAs for the future, Redick has a thorough understanding of today's NBA and the direction the league is headed. Listen to one of his shows or his live analysis, and it is evident that he is as plugged in as anyone on the offensive and defensive strategies utilized and the strengths and weaknesses of the personnel around the league.\n\nHis adaptive mind can help push the Lakers organization forward beyond the days of the James-Davis superstar duo in the same way we're seeing from respected young coaches around the NBA like the Celtics' Joe Mazzulla and the Thunder's Mark Daigneault.\n\nRedick's most significant challenge will be managing the insurmountable pressure that comes with being the Lakers and LeBron's head coach. There is no bigger spotlight in the league, and given James' ticking retirement timeline, the expectations will be title-or-bust.\n\nSteve Nash -- a two-time MVP and all-time great floor general -- had a similar experience and learned the hard way as a first-time head coach for three future Hall of Famers in Brooklyn. Anything short of a championship or NBA Finals appearance could be enough to lose your job.\n\nThat said, the Lakers must feel Redick is ready for this step and this is the type of home-run swing hire that could change a franchise.\n\nLos Angeles believes it has landed the candidate that can stop its coaching carousel, going through seven different leaders in the last 13 years since Phil Jackson retired in 2011.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sporting_News", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Sporting News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronny_James", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Bronny James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Wojnarowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adrian Wojnarowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Mazzulla", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Mazzulla"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phil Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Nash", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Nash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Most_Valuable_Player_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Most Valuable Player Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 27}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://library.sportingnews.com/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-05/nba-plain--edeebc27-bb1b-46d9-8cc1-8188d926b98d.jpeg?itok=JBEeENd0", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662595", "eventUri": "eng-9662595", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1294117647058823, "wgt": 202, "relevance": 1}

The news of Redick's appointment came via Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN.\n\nRedick, who was floated early on as a frontrunner, had to get through the NBA Finals as a lead analyst in the booth, and in that time the Lakers took a detour chasing UConn head coach Dan Hurley, ultimately getting turned down by the back-to-back national champion. That sent the Lakers back to the drawing board, and Redick returned to the front of the line and, with the Celtics finishing off their Finals win on Monday night, Redick was finally clear to ink a deal to officially become the Lakers head coach.\n\nThis is a unique decision by the Lakers, as Redick does not have any head coaching experience. A retired NBA player, Redick decided to go into the world of media after his playing days came to an end, whether that meant podcasting, appearances as a pundit on ESPN, or his appointment to the network's top broadcast booth alongside Mike Breen and Doris Burke after Doc Rivers left to join the Milwaukee Bucks during this past season.\n\nPerhaps most notably, Redick co-hosts the \"Mind the Game\" podcast with Lakers star LeBron James.

Inside rookie coach's 'Pat Riley-like' potential, relationship with LeBron James", "body": "JJ Redick is headed to Los Angeles to become the next head coach of the Lakers, per ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski.\n\nThat statement would have been a shocking surprise at the start of the 2023-24 season but rumors started to heat up as soon as Los Angeles fired Darvin Ham after its first-round playoff exit.\n\nRedick has no previous NBA coaching experience but has established himself as one of the smartest minds in basketball over the last few years. In addition to his 15-year NBA playing career, he built up his resume and flexed his knowledge through his \"The Old Man and the Three\" podcast, his job as an analyst for ESPN and, recently, his \"Mind the Game\" podcast with Lakers star LeBron James.\n\nAs the leader of the Lakers, the spotlight will be as bright as can be. Is Redick ready for the job as a first-time head coach?\n\nDespite having no previous NBA coaching experience, the Lakers felt Redick was the right person for the job.\n\nThere were plenty of assumptions that James played a role in Los Angeles hiring his friend and podcast co-host. His agent, Klutch Sports CEO Rich Paul, denied those rumors on May 24.\n\n\"LeBron is not involved. ... This is a Lakers decision,\" Paul told Bleacher Report's Chris Haynes in an exclusive interview.\n\n\"JJ is a friend. We respect JJ. I know LeBron and JJ have the podcast. ... But just because they have a podcast -- the Lakers have to make a decision for now and later. And whatever that decision is, that'll be an organizational decision. It's as simple as that.\"\n\nThe Lakers are trusting Redick's basketball knowledge and ability to manage personalities, leading a roster with superstars like James (assuming he opts into his player option or re-signs in Los Angeles) and Anthony Davis.\n\nOne report went as far as to say the Lakers believe Redick, 39, has \"Pat Riley-like\" potential.\n\n\"The Lakers are infatuated with Redick's potential, according to league sources, viewing him as a Pat Riley-like coaching prospect who could both help the franchise in the short term and lead it for years,\" The Athletic's Shams Charania and Jovan Buha wrote on May 21 before the hiring became official.\n\nComparing a rookie head coach with no previous experience to one of the greatest basketball minds in the history of the sport is a bold claim, only adding to the pressure Redick will already face leading the league's most popular franchise.\n\nThis is Los Angeles' second-consecutive rookie head coaching hire, although Ham did have 11 years of experience as an assistant coach in the NBA.\n\nBorn on June 24, 1984, Redick is currently 39 years old. He will be 40 by the time he coaches his first NBA game.\n\nPending other offseason hires, Redick is the sixth-youngest head coach in the NBA.\n\nCeltics head coach Joe Mazzulla (35 years old), Jazz head coach Will Hardy (36), Thunder head coach Mark Daigneault (39), Grizzlies head coach Taylor Jenkins (39) and Hornets head coach Charles Lee (39) are the five younger than Redick.\n\nFollowing a legendary college career at Duke where Redick earned one National Player of the Year award, two ACC Player of the Year awards and two All-American honors, he was taken by the Magic with the No. 11 overall pick in the 2006 NBA Draft.\n\nRedick played for six different teams throughout his solid 15-year NBA career. He spent the first six-and-a-half seasons with the Magic before being traded to the Bucks. After finishing the season in Milwaukee, Redick was traded to the Clippers where he spent the next four years of his career.\n\nRedick bounced around at the end of his career, playing two seasons for the 76ers, one-and-a-half seasons with the Pelicans and a half-season with the Mavericks.\n\nRedick averaged 12.8 points, 2.0 rebounds and 2.0 assists per game over his 15-year career. His best seasons came from 2013-20, where he had a seven-year stretch of averaging at least 15.0 points per game.\n\nRedick led the entire NBA in 3-point percentage in 2015-16 with the Clippers, posting 16.3 points and 2.7 3-pointers per game at a 47.5 percent clip. His highest point-per-game average was 18.1 with the 76ers in 2018-19.\n\nRedick's 41.5 career 3-point percentage is good for 18th-best in NBA history. That is higher than known snipers like Klay Thompson (41.3 percent) and Ray Allen (40.0 percent).\n\nRedick earned $117.91 million in NBA contracts over 15 seasons, per Basketball-Reference.",

So, the first step in ensuring that the LeBron James and Anthony Davis-led squad gets back up on their feet is getting a head coach. JJ Redick still remains the frontrunner for the position. It was rumored that a deal would be done after the NBA Finals. What happened? Well, Shams Charania is one of the only few names who might be able to give a reliable answer.\n\nThe Lakers still do not have a head coach. Dan Hurley was the closest they had to getting a deal done. The legendary head honcho chose to stay with the UConn Huskies. So, they have reverted back to trying to conduct advanced stages of interviews and meeting with other candidates. James Borrego and Micah Nori were big names in the mix but it has always been JJ Redick who is the reported frontrunner for the position. Since no deal has been done a day after the NBA Finals, the Lakers faithful got a bit worried.\n\nShams Charania of The Athletic noted that there should be no stress coming fans, via The Pat McAfee Show.\n\nThere isn't an agreement as far as I know between the Lakers and JJ Redick right now. JJ Redick went in to LA on Saturday and had in-person meetings for multiple hours with the Lakers brass... I'm told that his meetings on Saturday were very impressive. All the characteristics you see in JJ Redick that you could have envisioned, those all shine there. Of course, we don't know exactly what kind of coach he's going to be until he's in that seat, when you deal with adversity.\n\nA deal looms for JJ Redick and the Lakers after the NBA Finals, no later\n\nWith a deal not yet done due to the frontrunner's NBA Finals work, a new deadline has been set. The Lakers are reportedly trying to get the contract and hire ironed out before draft night. Obviously, they will need the head honcho to screen these prospects as well as determine their probable fit with the LeBron James and Anthony Davis-led squad.\n\nHis status, as a front-runner to be the Lakers head coach, has not changed since those days. I think what the Lakers are doing now is taking the next few days after the NBA Finals. Now that JJ Redick is done with his finals duties... they do want to have their head coach by the draft. The draft is next week. The last thing you want to do is be going on a coaching hire on draft week.\n\nA lot of pressure is riding on this position. It is not only the time constraint of the hire but also one of trying to tie their franchise titles back up with the Celtics because Anthony Davis and LeBron James' times with the Lakers are not getting longer.

Redick, who turns 40 next week, formally interviewed for the job over the weekend and has been on the team's radar for some time.\n\nA 15-year NBA veteran, Redick was reported to be the Lakers' top candidate by league insider Shams Charania two weeks ago. That was before the organization's well-chronicled dalliance with UConn head coach Dan Hurley.\n\nUltimately, Hurley turned down LA's reported six-year, $70 million offer to remain in Storrs, where he's won the last two national championships. His decision put Redick back in play, and now it seems LeBron James' podcasting partner will be running the show for the Lakers in 2024-25.\n\nRedick has never been a head coach before, outside of leading his son's youth team, but his basketball knowledge is well-respected and the team has had the opportunity to gauge his readiness by listening to his \"Mind The Game\" podcast with James, ESPN's Brian Windhorst said recently.\n\n\"Anytime you hire a first-time head coach, you're admitting you're going to go through a learning curve,\" Windhorst said, via Awful Announcing. \"Obviously the Lakers have done a lot of research. And frankly, his interviews have been in those podcasts with LeBron James. They've extensively broken down the Lakers' offense, extensively broken down what they do. It's been out there for the whole world to hear, including from the Lakers' front office.\"\n\nWith the Lakers, Redick will have the opportunity to coach James, assuming he is able to agree to a long-term deal with the franchise after opting out of his current one, which most people in the know expect him to do.\n\nHe also might be coaching James' son, Bronny, who has been linked extensively to the purple and gold leading up to this month's NBA Draft.\n\nLos Angeles finished 47-35 in the regular season this year, a four-game improvement on 2022-23, but was eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the Denver Nuggets after reaching the Western Conference Finals the year before.\n\nThe failure led to the dismissal of Darvin Ham, who spent two years as the Lakers' head coach after replacing Frank Vogel.", "source": {"uri": "postandcourier.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Post and Courier"}, "authors": [{"uri": "matt_hladik@postandcourier.com", "name": "Matt Hladik", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Hurley", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Dan Hurley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UConn_Huskies_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "UConn Huskies men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men's_basketball_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Windhorst", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Brian Windhorst"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Darvin Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Vogel", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Frank Vogel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 94}], "image": "https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/90/9906c6c4-efb7-56b0-8e5b-204972bbb134/6671ccaa72e10.image.jpg?crop=1200%2C630%2C0%2C85&resize=438%2C230&order=crop%2Cresize", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662595", "eventUri": "eng-9662595", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 199, "relevance": 1}

The Lakers offered UConn head coach Dan Hurley a six-year contract last weekend but Hurley opted to stay put at the collegiate level. Celtics assistant Sam Cassell was among numerous candidates to be interviewed for the Lakers position but Redick ends up with the gig in his first coaching position after a 15 year career.\n\nRedick started a podcast with Lakers star LeBron James this past season and his relationship with the All-Star was likely a big factor in the decision. James has a player option with the Lakers this offseason and is widely expected to stay in LA, especially after this hire.\n\nRedick has a tall task to return the Lakers to prominence in the Western Conference after an underwhelming first round exit to the Nuggets this year. The team lacks cap room and has limited means to upgrade its supporting cast around an aging James and Anthony Davis after finishing as the No. 6 seed in the Western Conference last year. The team is expected to be active on the trade market entering the start of free agency.\n\nRedick will need to assemble a coaching staff so it will be worth watching whether any Celtics assistants will end up in Los Angeles.

Redick, a 15-year NBA veteran who played for the Orlando Magic, Milwaukee Bucks, Los Angeles Clippers, Philadelphia 76ers, New Orleans Pelicans and Dallas Mavericks, was most recently in a TV analyst role with ESPN. He has never coached at the professional nor amateur level\n\nWhile successful on the court, Redick's rise to prominence has largely come through the media as he hosted a podcast during his playing career. Since retiring, he has worked as a critically acclaimed broadcaster for ESPN. Now, Redick takes one of the highest-profile gigs in the coaching profession for his first job.\n\nRedick's hiring comes at the end of a tumultuous search for the Lakers. While he was one of the first names linked to Los Angeles as a candidate, the search took more than a month in total and included a lengthy courtship of UConn coach Dan Hurley. A six-year, $70 million offer wasn't enough to sway Hurley to the pros, so the Lakers instead turned back to a candidate who was in the mix from the start.\n\nWhile it is rare for NBA teams to hire head coaches without prior coaching experience, it is not unprecedented. Most recently, the Brooklyn Nets hired Steve Nash in 2020. He had not previously worked on a full-time coaching staff, though he had done developmental work for the Golden State Warriors. The New York Knicks hired Derek Fisher immediately following his retirement as a player in 2014, and the Nets did the same for Jason Kidd in 2013.\n\nThe most successful hire of this style has been Steve Kerr, who took over the Golden State Warriors job in 2014 and has since led teh franchise to four championships. Kerr, however, had worked in the front office for the Phoenix Suns before entering the coaching world.\n\nThough he lacks experience, Redick has been on the candidate list of NBA teams since at least last summer. He interviewed with the Toronto Raptors following the 2023 season and was a finalist for the Charlotte Hornets job this offseason before it went to Boston Celtics assistant Charles Lee. Current Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla attempted to lure Redick to his coaching staff as an assistant over a round of golf last offseason, but he was rebuffed.\n\nIn Los Angeles, Redick figures to have at least one valuable ally in his new team's best player. Though LeBron James reportedly stayed out of the Lakers' hiring process, he does have a relationship with Redick through the podcast they have co-hosted since March, \"Mind the Game.\" Buy-in from the locker room was surely an important factor in this hire for the Lakers, as reports indicated that former coach Darvin Ham had lost the support of his players throughout last season.\n\nStill, the Lakers represent an extremely difficult job for a coach with no experience. Expectations are high for a team that won the 2020 championship and reached the 2023 Western Conference finals. Los Angeles' best player, James, turns 40 this season. Fellow superstar Anthony Davis is coming off of an excellent, durable campaign, but prior to the 2023-24 season, he had missed an average of over 28 games per year since joining the Lakers.\n\nL.A. has reportedly been targeting star additions this offseason with Donovan Mitchell at the top of their wishlist. With only three first-round picks to trade, though, it's unclear whether the Lakers will be able to put together a strong enough package to land such a difference-making player. They could potentially use those picks to target role players instead, but the team will have luxury tax concerns next season assuming that starting point guard D'Angelo Russell is retained or replaced with a player of a similar price.\n\nWhile winning now is obviously a priority, The Athletic's Jovan Buha said during the search that the Lakers \"want a coach that can be their version of an Erik Spoelstra, their version of a Steve Kerr.\" That's referring to a coach who can become a long-term fixture for the organization.\n\nHistorically speaking, the Lakers have struggled to find such a coach. Redick will be the franchise's seventh full-time coach since Phil Jackson retired in 2011. If a star cannot be found this offseason, it is unclear who will lead the next generation of Lakers on the court after the 39-year-old James and 31-year-old Davis age out of stardom.\n\nRedick and the Rob Pelinka-led front office will need to answer that question over time. For now, the focus is on maximizing the end of LeBron's legendary career. The Lakers have taken a sizable risk by entrusting these years to a newcomer to the coaching world, but given the interest Redick had generated over the past few years, the reward may well be worth it.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sam_quinn@cbssports.com", "name": "Sam Quinn", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}],

Redick is signing a four-year deal worth in the neighborhood of $8 million per season with the Lakers, according to sources briefed on the deal.\n\nBehind the scenes, the Lakers had been zeroing in on the 39-year-old Redick for the past four weeks, infatuated with his potential to be a coach for the present and future, beyond just the next couple seasons of LeBron James' legendary career.\n\nRedick had first interviewed with vice president of basketball operations and general manager Rob Pelinka for the Lakers' head coaching job for about two hours during the week of May 13 at the NBA Draft Combine in Chicago. Redick then entered the Lakers facility on June 15 to meet again with Pelinka, as well as owners Jeanie, Joey and Jesse Buss, the remaining key stakeholders in the organization.\n\nMultiple sources with direct knowledge of the meeting described Redick as \"impressive\" during his visit to Los Angeles, diving deep into his offensive and defensive philosophies and displaying his passion for the sport that foreshadowed a willingness to submit himself to the countless working hours for the modern head coach.\n\nHe explained his decision-making process when it comes to strategy, how the analysis and empirical evidence would always guide his choices rather than preconceived notions or outdated beliefs. Redick described a system molded around this roster, focusing on elevating Anthony Davis' involvement, particularly late in games, and alleviating the constant ballhandling duties on James by utilizing him more off the ball. Keeping James, who turns 40 in December, fresh down the stretch of the regular season and into the playoffs will be critical.\n\nFor these Lakers, Redick's ability to access his stars in James and Davis could be seamless due to the stature he may bring as a respected former player, but how he unlocks the remainder of the roster and coaches top-down remains crucial to the job. Austin Reaves will surely be part of strong three-man attacks for the Lakers under Redick, who'll be thrust into developing players such as Rui Hachimura, Max Christie and whomever the franchise drafts.\n\nDuring his meetings with Pelinka and his visit with Lakers ownership, Redick showed promise, team sources said. But as with any first-time head coach, the true tests will come during the adversity of training camp and the season, the management of player relationships and the control of the locker room.\n\nRedick has had a meteoric media rise since retiring from his playing career in 2021, running his podcast network, starting the \"Mind the Game\" show with James and serving as a color commentator during the NBA Finals all while simultaneously chasing a head coaching job. Redick interviewed for the Toronto Raptors' top coaching job in 2023 and the Charlotte Hornets this year. He has never coached professionally - his only coaching experience to this point was with his son's youth basketball team.\n\nSources briefed on Redick's mindset say he badly wants to make the jump to NBA head coach and embrace the challenges the chair brings as he believes it is the natural transition of his basketball life.\n\nAs Redick watched these NBA playoffs, both as a commentator and viewer, he envisioned how he would utilize a potential James/Davis-led roster. Just a few years after ending his playing career, Redick has his next basketball challenge.\n\nThe Lakers underwent some turbulence in their coaching search. Much of the process consisted of Pelinka meeting with candidates by himself off-site or virtually, not within Lakers headquarters. After his conversation with Redick, Pelinka met with Pelicans associate head coach James Borrego in Los Angeles on May 20. Several candidates - Boston's Sam Cassell, Minnesota's Micah Nori, Denver's David Adelman and Miami's Chris Quinn - conducted virtual meetings. On May 29, Borrego became the first candidate to enter the Lakers' facility to meet again with Pelinka and ownership.\n\nIn the days before and after Borrego's second in-person visit, some Lakers stakeholders believed the focus of the head-coaching search centered on Redick. Given the lack of a championship experience-driven hire after Mike Budenholzer went to the Suns and the Clippers kept Ty Lue long-term on a five-year contract extension, sources say Redick's chances grew for the Lakers, a high-ceiling candidate tasked to balance winning and development and allowed to coach through early mistakes.\n\nThen, seemingly out of nowhere, came Dan Hurley. On June 6, ESPN reported that the coach of the back-to-back national champion UConn Huskies was the \"target\" of the Lakers' search. Beyond Jeanie Buss and Pelinka, the pursuit was kept tight-lipped within the organization.\n\nOnly Pelinka and Jeanie Buss met with Hurley when he and his wife, Andrea, came to the Lakers facility on June 7.\n\nHurley was flown out to Los Angeles and offered a six-year, $70 million contract, according to sources briefed on the matter. He returned home to Connecticut to mull his decision while the basketball world waited.\n\nOn June 10, he announced he was staying with the Huskies. Hurley's new contract with UConn is expected to make him the highest-paid coach in college basketball - six years and upwards of $50 million, sources said.\n\nEven though the Lakers moved quickly to offer Hurley a contract that would have made him one of the highest-paid coaches in the league, several people inside the Lakers organization and externally wondered about the true overall genuineness of the pursuit and whether the franchise had been used by Hurley to get more money to stay at Connecticut. The Hurley situation was seen by one source with direct involvement in the search as a Hail Mary attempt.\n\nThis much is clear, though: When it came to the Lakers' ultimate decision-maker, Jeanie Buss, sources said she was highly motivated to make Hurley their next coach and was genuinely disappointed when the attempt fell short.\n\nHurley himself told Dan Le Batard, as he made the media rounds, that the Lakers' interest started on June 5. He denied needing the leverage to get a raise at UConn on \"The Dan Le Batard Show with Stugotz\" when asked about it, then later said the school's name, image and likeness collective and his staffing payments still needed to be increased going into the Lakers' process.\n\nJust like that, Hurley was out of the picture almost as quickly as he'd entered it.\n\nThe Lakers' brass regrouped on June 11, the day after Hurley's announcement, and finally went all in on their top choice in Redick, according to team and league sources. After meeting with the Lakers on June 15, Redick spoke on the phone with Davis on Monday, a critical relationship in the years to come, sources briefed on the situation said.\n\nThe decision to choose Redick came as the Lakers, led by Pelinka, prioritized Davis' voice in the process and ensured that he understood the shared vision. There were other key players who were supportive of the hiring, sources said.\n\nLos Angeles is confident that Redick will be the long-term coaching solution that has eluded the franchise for over a decade. Since Phil Jackson's departure in the summer of 2011, the Lakers have now had seven different head coaches (eight if counting Bernie Bickerstaff's five-game interim tenure in 2013). Winning hasn't always equated to job security in Los Angeles: Frank Vogel won a championship in 2020 and was fired two years later. Ham made the Western Conference finals in 2023 and was gone one season later.\n\nBut the 39-year-old Redick checks many of the boxes on the Lakers' extensive checklist for their next coach. He's drawn internal comparisons to a young Pat Riley as a coaching prospect who jumped from playing to the broadcast booth to the coaching chair. Los Angeles is confident he can be their version of Erik Spoelstra or Steve Kerr - a culture-setter who can grow with the franchise for over a decade. There have been far more former-player, first-time head coaches who failed to meet expectations than those who succeeded, though, with the most recent examples including Steve Nash (Brooklyn), Derek Fisher (Knicks), Jason Kidd (Brooklyn) and Ham.\n\nAssistant coaching candidates for Redick's staff will include former head coach and recent Trail Blazers assistant Scott Brooks, former Lakers guard Rajon Rondo, ex-Laker and current Dallas Mavericks assistant Jared Dudley and Cassell, according to league sources.\n\nThe timing of Redick's hire is notable, as he will join Los Angeles' roster-planning ahead of the NBA Draft on June 26-27 - the first day the Lakers can trade their three tradeable picks (2024, 2029 and 2031). It also puts a leader in place ahead of James' looming free agency. The 39-year-old superstar must decide whether to exercise his $51.4 million player option for the 2024-25 season by June 29. The Lakers are open to any contract structure that will keep James in Los Angeles, league sources told The Athletic.\n\nJames' decision, and how the Lakers reshape their roster around him and Davis, will ultimately determine Los Angeles' direction next season. But Redick's arrival is a significant bet on an unproven coach -- one the team is confident can bridge the gap into the next era of Lakers basketball.", "source": {"uri": "nytimes.com", "dataType":

That included UConn's Dan Hurley turning down the gig earlier in June.\n\nWith the 2024 NBA Draft less than a week away, general manager Rob Pelinka and Co. knew that they had to make a hire.\n\nThroughout pretty much the entire process, former NBA player JJ Redick has been bandied about as a possibility.\n\nAbout that?\n\nESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported on Thursday that the Lakers have signed Redick to a four-year contract to become their new head coach.\n\nWhile the move is not necessarily too surprising given Los Angeles' interest, Redick has absolutely no experience as a coach at any level. It's certainly a risk for the once-proud Lakers organization to take. Woj explained the reasoning behind this hiring.\n\n\"Pelinka became sold on Redick's ability to connect with players and his basketball IQ and believes surrounding him with an elite coaching staff will help to shorten the learning curve into his first coaching job, sources said.\"\n\nRelated: Updated Los Angeles Lakers news and rumors\n\nThis hiring comes at an important time for the Lakers. LeBron James is slated to opt out of his contract and could potentially hit NBA free agency.\n\nLos Angeles is coming off a down 2023-24 season that saw the team fall to the Denver Nuggets in the first round of the NBA Playoffs.

The 39-year-old has been working as one of ESPN's lead NBA analysts, and he co-hosts a podcast with Lakers star LeBron James.\n\nThe Lakers tried to lure Dan Hurley away from Connecticut but the

that Redick was considered the favorite to land the Lakers job despite his inexperience.\n\nRedick recently interviewed for the Lakers position, following interviews with Charlotte Hornets assistant James Borrego, Boston Celtics assistant Sam Cassell and Denver Nuggets assistant David Adelman, according to ESPN.\n\nRedick's proximity to James (they co-host the 'Mind the Game' podcast) appeared to put him in good position for the job, although Charania reported that the four-time MVP was uninvolved in the hiring process.\n\nOf course, James' own future in LA is somewhat clouded.\n\nHe's under

week's NBA Draft and is expected to go in the second round.\n\nRedick's resume is certainly on the lighter side among NBA coaches, although that doesn't necessarily spell doom for the Lakers

It's one of the weirder coaching searches in recent memory as JJ Redick has seemed like the favorite to land the job since the day before Ham was let go.\n\nFor most of the last two months it has seemed like a formality that Redick and the Lakers were waiting for the NBA Finals to end before they would make it official, but the Boston Celtics' championship has come and gone and we're still waiting.\n\nThe weirdest part about this is that the longer it drags out, the more opportunities ESPN has to undermine Redick's chances of getting the job. At least that's how it feels right now. ESPN has kind of treated Redick like he's not one of their most high-profile personalities over the last few weeks. He's not ESPN's JJ Redick, the guy who was calling the NBA Finals alongside Mike Breen and Doris Burke. He's the abstract idea of JJ Redick, a podcaster and retired NBA player.\n\nAt any point over the last couple months one of ESPN's many writers could have simply asked Redick what was going on, but instead they treated him like he wasn't there on their airwaves every few nights, while they waited for him to bail like Doc Rivers did in 2004 or again earlier this year. It's almost like they were thinking about him like Schr\u00f6dinger's podcaster. As long as they don't ask him what he's doing, he's not leaving.\n\nIn the meantime the network is doing whatever it can to keep him from leaving. Or at least that's how it seems. Led by Stephen A. Smith, there seems to be a push from within ESPN to torpedo Redick's chances at getting the Lakers job. On First Take last week Smith reported that Black coaches from around the league had reached out to say that they didn't like Redick's podcast with LeBron James because it hurt Darvin Ham.\n\nRedick and James launched the podcast near the end of the NBA's regular season, with Brian Windhorst saying earlier this month that they basically served as interviews for the Lakers as the two broke down basketball to its finest details.\n\nGet Up discussed whether Redick had undermined Ham on Monday morning, ahead of Redick calling Game 5 on ESPN on ABC. Mike Greenberg used more comments from Smith as the jumping-off point for the conversation before Jay Williams defended the timing of the podcast.\n\n\"This wasn't just put in place to undermine Darvin Ham,\" Williams said. \"LeBron James, when you talk basketball to him, it sounds very different when you have those barbershop conversations. And there's a reason why the podcast is doing well. There's also a reason why RedBird Capital deployed a lot of money into SpringHill and now they're trying to deploy it into JJ Redick's platform.\"\n\nWilliams, who seemed to tip off an impending Redick-Lakers announcement on Tuesday morning, is obviously well-versed in this topic, even if it does feel like an incredibly casual explanation for the motivations of an investment capital firm for a sports morning show.\n\nAnyway, improprieties aren't the only reason ESPN has presented as a case for Redick to not get hired away by the Lakers this week. As soon as Monty Williams was fired by the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday, Smith was putting his name out there as a potential candidate for the Lakers job.\n\nThen on Thursday morning, Udonis Haslem, the vice president of basketball development for the Miami Heat, said \"Hell yes\" the Lakers should hire Monty Williams as their next head coach.\n\n\"You have to do your due diligence,\" Haslem explained. \"This is your job to bring in the best coach and the best fit for your team. We question, can JJ control the locker room? We understand he has a great basketball mind. We understand he has a great future. Can he control the locker room? A divided locker room is a doomed locker room. We understand Monty Williams has the respect of the guys around the NBA.\"\n\nHaslem also pointed out that Williams might not want to coach since he's due such a large amount of money from the Pistons to not coach. Still, when was the last time a coach led a team to the worst record in any league and upon termination it was immediately assumed he would be a great fit for the most high-profile job available? Is it not incredibly weird to think of someone fired by two teams in 13 months as the top candidate on the market?\n\nCombine these segments with the fact that the Lakers randomly tried to hire Dan Hurley a week ago and the fact that the Lakers have gone nearly two full months without a coach and it's hard to tell what the heck is going on.\n\nDo the Lakers know? Does ESPN? The longer we go with nothing happening, it's hard to tell if anyone really does. If Redick does, he's not telling. In fact, it seems likely he's saving it for a podcast, which seems more like the move of a podcaster than a basketball coach.\n\nThis article was originally published on www.si.com as ESPN Analysts Are Not Helping JJ Redick's Chances of Coaching Lakers.", "source": {"uri": "myrtlebeachonline.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MyrtleBeachOnline"}, "authors": [{"uri": "stephen_douglas@myrtlebeachonline.com", "name": "Stephen Douglas", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Darvin Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_A._Smith", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stephen A.

That's a lot to ask that brother to do.\"\n\nStephen A. also went as far to suggest another candidate for the Lakers job during Wednesday's episode of First Take.\n\nThe Detroit Pistons fired head coach Monty Williams after one season, and Stephen A. thinks the Lakers should consider him.\n\n\"I know we've been talking a lot about JJ Redick, but Monty Williams is available,\" Stephen A. said.\n\n\"That is a situation that the Los Angeles Lakers should look at. I would definitely say that as well.\n\n\"They should look at it...I think Monty Williams definitely should be a candidate for that job.\"\n\nWilliams is not a bad head coach despite being fired from two positions in the last two years.\n\nHe likely should have never been fired by the Phoenix Suns after the 2022/23 season, and then was thrust into a dumpster fire with the Pistons this past season.\n\nRegardless of who the Lakers choose, a decision should be coming up about their next head coach soon.", "source": {"uri": "the-sun.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The US Sun"}, "authors": [{"uri": "david_scott@the-sun.com", "name": "David Scott", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_A._Smith", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stephen A.

He really is going to be the next coach of the Los Angeles Lakers, the most celebrated team in the NBA.

He has already started putting together a coaching staff after meeting with Lakers GM Rob Pelinka on Thursday morning.\n\n\"Pelinka became sold on Redick's ability to connect with players and his basketball IQ and believes surrounding him with an elite coaching staff will help to shorten the learning curve into his first coaching job, sources said,\" Wojnarowski wrote.\n\nThe move follows Los Angeles' failed pursuit of UConn coach Dan Hurley -- and some will tell you Redick was the Lakers' guy all along. But they at least wanted to try Hurley first.\n\nRedick, 39, comes to the job with no prior head-coaching experience, though he did just recently retire as a player. He also hosts a podcast with Lakers star LeBron James, which will now presumably come to an end (though James may find a new co-host).\n\nInterestingly, one NBA executive told Hoops Wire that Hurley used Wojnarowski and the Lakers as leverage to get more money from UConn.\n\nThe exec said Hurley \"was never going to leave UConn\" and that he used his relationship with Wojnarowski and the \"Lakers name\" to get an increase in his salary from Connecticut. That opened the door for Redick.\n\nNew Orleans Pelicans assistant James Borrego was believed to be another top candidate in LA.

Los Angeles parted ways with former head coach Darvin Ham after its first-round exit to the Nuggets and Redick's name started to bubble up shortly after.\n\nEven though Redick has no previous NBA coaching experience, he has done a fantastic job marketing his basketball knowledge. Following his 15-year career as an NBA player, Redick projected his love for the game through his \"The Old Man and the Three\" podcast and his job as an analyst for ESPN.\n\nMore recently, Redick piqued the interest of the NBA world when he started a new podcast, \"Mind the Game,\" co-hosted with Lakers star LeBron James. James has been in the media spotlight since before he entered the NBA as a teenager, but he never had his own podcast.\n\nWith Los Angeles hiring Redick, James' decision to start a show with his future head coach retroactively raised some eyebrows.\n\nMORE: Inside Lakers' turbulent coaching history\n\nRedick and James don't have an extensive documented history as friends prior to the \"Mind the Game\" podcast, but from the first episode, it was evident they had chemistry. The two basketball minds sip wine and talk in-depth about the game they love.\n\n\"I want to be clear here. This is a basketball show. This is a show with the intention and purpose to celebrate the game, promote the game, explain the game,\" Redick said in the introduction to the show.\n\n\"LeBron and I are two people who, I would call us 'obsessed' with the game of basketball, with this sport that has given so much to us.\"\n\nThe podcast, which is produced by LeBron and Maverick Carter's athlete empowerment brand \"Uninterrupted,\" has produced nine episodes so far on a near-weekly basis.\n\nThe Redick-Lakers head coaching rumors started to pop up before the seventh episode. James' agent, Klutch Sports CEO Rich Paul, made a statement that his client and the show had nothing to do with Redick's potential hiring.\n\n\"LeBron is not involved. ... This is a Lakers decision,\" Paul told Bleacher Report's Chris Haynes in an exclusive interview on May 24.\n\n\"JJ is a friend. We respect JJ. I know LeBron and JJ have the podcast. ... But just because they have a podcast -- the Lakers have to make a decision for now and later. And whatever that decision is, that'll be an organizational decision. It's as simple as that.\"\n\nMORE: Is JJ Redick the right person for Lakers head coaching job?\n\nJames and Redick had plenty of overlap as opponents in the NBA, but the two were never teammates. They faced off 30 times in the regular season and had two playoff series against each other throughout their careers.\n\nJames owns a 19-11 record in the regular season against his new head coach. He averaged 27.2 points, 8.4 rebounds and 8.0 assists in those games.\n\nRedick averaged 13.2 points, 2.2 rebounds and 2.1 assists against James' teams.\n\nRedick's Magic defeated James' Cavaliers in six games in the 2009 Eastern Conference Finals, but Redick only played in one game as a third-year player. James got revenge in the first round of the 2013 NBA Playoffs when his Heat swept Redick's Bucks.\n\nNow, the former opponents and podcast co-hosts will join forces in Los Angeles as star player and coach.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Darvin Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rich Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleacher_Report", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Bleacher Report"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Games/Video_Games/Browser_Based", "label": "dmoz/Games/Video Games/Browser Based", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 29}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Board_Games/Developers_and_Publishers", "label": "dmoz/Games/Board Games/Developers and Publishers", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://ng-sportingnews.com/s3/files/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-06/nba-canada--e09c157c-7463-4b43-bc40-e2dc0be134c6.jpeg?itok=0cb7YRIE", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662595", "eventUri": "eng-9662595", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-24", "textStart": 2164, "textEnd": 2170}], "sentiment": 0.2784313725490195, "wgt": 195, "relevance": 1}

He also has familiarity with LeBron James from their \"Mind the Game\" podcast. But what does his coaching philosophy entail?\n\nRedick has explained his thoughts on the game in great depth throughout numerous podcasts with James. That offers valuable insight on how he will coach the Lakers.\n\nRedick was even grilled on his thoughts on the value of 3-point shooting during the duo's sixth podcast episode.\n\nHere's what we know about Redick's preferred style of play, and how it will change the Lakers going forward.\n\nMORE: Is JJ Redick the right person for Lakers head coaching job?\n\nRedick was a 3-point specialist, so the value of shooting certainly isn't lost on him.\n\n\"I believe math should play into it,\" Redick told James during the \"Mind the Game\" podcast.\n\n\"If you're going against a team that is going to shoot 40 to 45 3s, and you're going to shoot 25 to 30, you better f -- ing nail all of your advantages. Otherwise, you're just not going to win. It's based on the math.\"\n\nThe Lakers were 28th in 3-point attempts this season. Expect that to go up substantially behind Redick.\n\nPart of the reason for that low ranking was that Darvin Ham couldn't get the buy-in from players on his roster. He tried to get James and Anthony Davis to shoot more 3s, even urging Davis to shoot six 3s per game. That never came close to happening.\n\nThe Lakers did have a great offense after the All-Star break despite not shooting a ton of 3s, so perhaps there shouldn't be wholesale changes to the offense. Redick admitted that there is no one-size-fits-all approach, stating that \"you have to have the personnel to do all these things.\"\n\nRedick has seen the advancement of analytics firsthand given how its importance began to skyrocket at the start of his playing career, back when he was a rookie in Orlando.\n\n\"The first time I heard any of this analytic stuff was the very first meeting with Stan Van Gundy,\" Redick said.\n\n\"He comes in and he breaks down, 'This is what a free throw is worth. This is what a layup is worth. This is what a 3 is worth. And specifically, this is what a corner 3 is worth.' We're not going to have Tony Allen spotting up at 15 feet and shooting three of those because that's not an efficient shot.\"\n\nThe Lakers were the No. 2 team in the league in shooting at the rim, per Cleaning the Glass. Layups are still analytically the best shots in the game. Where Los Angeles could clean up its shot profile is from the midrange, where it was middle-of-the-pack, and in taking more corner 3s, where it ranked 21st in the league. Expect Redick to cut out some of those long 2 attempts.\n\nRedick's view may conflict with James, who has told Redick that \"there's a time and place for analytics to get the f -- out.\"\n\nMORE: Inside Lakers' turbulent coaching history\n\nRedick has described his two favorite plays as inverted pick-and-rolls and split cuts in his \"Mind the Game\" podcast.\n\nSplit cuts are when a player gets the ball thrown into the post and the player who makes the entry pass will immediately screen away for the next-closest player. It's been made famous by the Warriors with Draymond Green, Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson.\n\nThe Lakers haven't used a ton of elbow splits in their offense, but they have tried it from time to time with James and Davis. That could be incorporated a lot more, allowing those two to work as passing hubs out of the elbows and hit teammates cutting to the basket. The beautiful motion from Steve Kerr's offense could travel down south to Los Angeles.\n\nInverted pick-and-rolls are when a guard or wing sets a screen for a big man. The Lakers already do a lot of this with James getting a screen set by a guard to create a mismatch. That should continue, and we might even see Lakers centers getting a chance to run that action as well.\n\nRedick is a huge proponent of fouling when up 3 and sending an opponent to the line rather than allowing them to shoot a game-tying 3-pointer.\n\n\"I am fouling up 3 every single time. Every single time,\" Redick has said.\n\nJames has also said that he prefers to foul up 3, \"but it has to be on the downward dribble.\"\n\nBoth noted that a team has to practice that scenario.

Although we're only a week away from the 2024 NBA Draft, the Lakers seem to be in no rush to hire a head coach.\n\nWhile the potential appointment of JJ Redick as the next head coach of the Lakers is a topic of interest, the NBA community was jolted on Wednesday by the unexpected news that the Detroit Pistons fired their head coach, Monty Williams.\n\nWilliams is one of the more accomplished and highest-paid coaches in the league, and after one season in Detroit, he was relieved of his duties. That now raises the question of whether the Lakers will pursue the 52-year-old coach. It's unclear if they will or not, but ESPN TV personality Stephen A. Smith believes Williams should be a candidate for the Lakers head coach position.\n\n\"I know we've been talking a lot about JJ Redick, but with Monty Williams available, that is a situation the Los Angeles Lakers should look at. I would definitely say that they should look at it,\" Smith said. \"I think Monty Williams should definitely be a candidate for the job.\"\n\nOn paper, Williams is the best candidate currently available on the coaching cycle. His track record as a coach speaks for itself, and if the Lakers pull the trigger, they would get a veteran, experienced coach who has been there and done that with multiple teams in the league. His proven success could be just what the Lakers need to turn their fortunes around.\n\nAs a head coach, Williams has a record of 381-404 (.485) and has reached the postseason five times in 10 seasons.

Mandatory Credit: Peter Casey-USA TODAY Sports / Peter Casey-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers parted ways with Darvin Ham nearly seven weeks ago and they still haven't hired his replacment. It's one of the weirder coaching searches in recent memory as JJ Redick has seemed like the favorite to land the job since the day before Ham was let go.\n\nFor most of the last two months it has seemed like a formality that Redick and the Lakers were waiting for the NBA Finals to end before they would make it official, but the Boston Celtics' championship has come and gone and we're still waiting.\n\nThe weirdest part about this is that the longer it drags out, the more opportunities ESPN has to undermine Redick's chances of getting the job. At least that's how it feels right now. ESPN has kind of treated Redick like he's not one of their most high-profile personalities over the last few weeks. He's not ESPN's JJ Redick, the guy who was calling the NBA Finals alongside Mike Breen and Doris Burke. He's the abstract idea of JJ Redick, a podcaster and retired NBA player.\n\nAt any point over the last couple months one of ESPN's many writers could have simply asked Redick what was going on, but instead they treated him like he wasn't there on their airwaves every few nights, while they waited for him to bail like Doc Rivers did in 2004 or again earlier this year. It's almost like they were thinking about him like Schr\u00c3\u00b6dinger's podcaster. As long as they don't ask him what he's doing, he's not leaving.\n\nIn the meantime the network is doing whatever it can to keep him from leaving. Or at least that's how it seems. Led by Stephen A. Smith, there seems to be a push from within ESPN to torpedo Redick's chances at getting the Lakers job. On First Take last week Smith reported that Black coaches from around the league had reached out to say that they didn't like Redick's podcast with LeBron James because it hurt Darvin Ham.\n\nRedick and James launched the podcast near the end of the NBA's regular season, with Brian Windhorst saying earlier this month that they basically served as interviews for the Lakers as the two broke down basketball to its finest details.\n\nGet Up discussed whether Redick had undermined Ham on Monday morning, ahead of Redick calling Game 5 on ESPN on ABC. Mike Greenberg used more comments from Smith as the jumping-off point for the conversation before Jay Williams defended the timing of the podcast.\n\n\"This wasn't just put in place to undermine Darvin Ham,\" Williams said. \"LeBron James, when you talk basketball to him, it sounds very different when you have those barbershop conversations. And there's a reason why the podcast is doing well. There's also a reason why RedBird Capital deployed a lot of money into SpringHill and now they're trying to deploy it into JJ Redick's platform.\"\n\nWilliams, who seemed to tip off an impending Redick-Lakers announcement on Tuesday morning, is obviously well-versed in this topic, even if it does feel like an incredibly casual explanation for the motivations of an investment capital firm for a sports morning show.\n\nAnyway, improprieties aren't the only reason ESPN has presented as a case for Redick to not get hired away by the Lakers this week. As soon as Monty Williams was fired by the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday, Smith was putting his name out there as a potential candidate for the Lakers job.\n\nThen on Thursday morning, Udonis Haslem, the vice president of basketball development for the Miami Heat, said \"Hell yes\" the Lakers should hire Monty Williams as their next head coach.\n\n\"You have to do your due diligence,\" Haslem explained. \"This is your job to bring in the best coach and the best fit for your team. We question, can JJ control the locker room? We understand he has a great basketball mind. We understand he has a great future. Can he control the locker room? A divided locker room is a doomed locker room. We understand Monty Williams has the respect of the guys around the NBA.\"\n\nHaslem also pointed out that Williams might not want to coach since he's due such a large amount of money from the Pistons to not coach. Still, when was the last time a coach led a team to the worst record in any league and upon termination it was immediately assumed he would be a great fit for the most high-profile job available? Is it not incredibly weird to think of someone fired by two teams in 13 months as the top candidate on the market?\n\nCombine these segments with the fact that the Lakers randomly tried to hire Dan Hurley a week ago and the fact that the Lakers have gone nearly two full months without a coach and it's hard to tell what the heck is going on.\n\nDo the Lakers know? Does ESPN? The longer we go with nothing happening, it's hard to tell if anyone really does. If Redick does, he's not telling. In fact, it seems likely he's saving it for a podcast, which seems more like the move of a podcaster than a basketball coach.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Darvin Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_A._Smith", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stephen A.

ESPN first reported the news.\n\nThe Lakers and Redick previously met last weekend to discuss the position, team and league sources said. Redick was considered the front-runner in league circles for most of the coaching search, which was ongoing since Los Angeles fired Darvin Ham in May after two seasons.\n\nRedick's status as the front-runner for the job briefly changed when Connecticut coach Dan Hurley and the Lakers expressed mutual interest before Hurley interviewed in Los Angeles. He rejected the Lakers' six-year, $70 million offer last week, according to team and league sources.\n\nThe Lakers' brass then regrouped and circled back to candidates, including Redick, according to team and league sources. The ESPN commentator and podcaster previously met with vice president of basketball operations and general manager Rob Pelinka for nearly two hours the week of May 13 at the NBA Draft Combine in Chicago.\n\nRedick worked on the broadcast for the NBA Finals, which ended Monday when the Boston Celtics defeated the Dallas Mavericks in Game 5.\n\nNew Orleans Pelicans associate head coach James Borrego was the other central candidate over the past few weeks. Borrego met with Pelinka in Los Angeles on May 20 for over two hours. He also met with Lakers stakeholders at the team's practice facility on May 29. Anthony Davis and Borrego, who overlapped briefly in New Orleans, re-established their rapport recently. Yahoo previously reported that Borrego was also advancing in the head-coaching search with the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nThe Lakers were high on Redick's potential and viewed the 15-year NBA veteran as a Pat Riley-like coaching prospect, according to league sources. Redick checked many of the boxes for the Lakers as they searched for their next coach.\n\nRedick has yet to coach above the youth level. He's the most forward-facing of the candidates given his high-profile playing career, run as a media personality and his recent \"Mind the Game\" podcast with LeBron James. Nevertheless, James made it known he was staying out of the team's coaching search, according to people involved in the matter.\n\nThe coaching hire is pivotal as Los Angeles hopes to retain James, who must decide whether to exercise his $51.4 million player option for the 2024-25 season by June 29. The Lakers are open to any contract structure that will keep James in Los Angeles, league sources said.\n\nRedick spent 15 seasons in the NBA with six teams, most notably the Orlando Magic and LA Clippers. A renowned shooter, he posted a career average of 12.8 points per game with 41.5 percent 3-point shooting, 44.7 percent from the field and 89.2 percent from the free-throw line.", "source": {"uri":

Smith endorses Monty Williams for Lakers job amid JJ Redick rumors", "body": "Ever since Dan Hurley turned down the Los Angeles Lakers to stay as the head coach of the UConn basketball program, it seemed inevitable that JJ Redick would be the choice to fill the role, but with the Detroit Pistons moving on from Monty Williams on Wednesday, that opens up another option for the Lakers, and ESPN's Stephen A. Smith advocated for the franchise exploring that option on First Take.\n\n\"I know we've been talking a lot about JJ Redick, but with Monty Williams available, that is a situation that the Los Angeles Lakers should look at,\" Stephen A. Smith said on First Take. \"So I would definitely say that as well. They should at it. Obviously Jeanie Buss, you know how much I love Jeanie Buss. I'm rooting for her to find the right person for the job. Respect Rob Pelinka what he's going to do. And yes I respect Kurt Rambis too. I was joking around about him earlier, but I respect him too. So listen, they're all going to be a part of the process and we'll see what happens, and I think Monty Williams definitely should be a candidate for that job.\"\n\nAfter Dan Hurley turned the Lakers down, it seemed like it would be between JJ Redick and James Borrego, the New Orleans Pelicans assistant coach who is also in the running for the Cleveland Cavaliers job. Now, Williams enters the conversation as an intriguing candidate. It will be interesting to see when this coaching search wraps up for the Lakers.\n\nWith Williams now available after being let go by the Pistons, it will be interesting to see if the Lakers do express any interest in him as their next head coach. Williams has $65 million left on his deal with the Pistons, despite being dismissed. Due to that, Williams does not necessarily have to rush to take a job. However, taking the Lakers head coaching job and coaching a team with more established players like LeBron James (likely), Anthony Davis and others, could be a situation that suits him more. The Lakers are a draw in themselves as well, despite Hurley turning them down.\n\nHurley, by all accounts, nearly accepted the Lakers job, and it was a hard decision for him. Given the amount of money it took for Williams to take the Pistons job, it might take a significant offer from the Lakers to land his services as well.\n\nHowever, if the Lakers do show interest in Williams, it could be the best opportunity that he would have in the foreseeable future, given how bad the one year in Detroit went.\n\nRegardless, it will be worth monitoring what happens with the Lakers' search and if Williams' name emerges in the next few days.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ryan_bologna@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Ryan Bologna", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monty Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeanie_Buss", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Jeanie Buss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_A._Smith", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Stephen A.

But it does have some key young building blocks in the likes of Cade Cunningham, Jaden Ivey, Ausar Thompson and Jalen Duren.\n\nFor Los Angeles, there are seemingly a ton of question marks. LeBron James will opt out of his contract this summer. While he's likely to return, how much power would a new head coach be giving up to King James?\n\nThe pressure is also going to be much more real in Los Angeles than Detroit. That could be a determining factor for a candidate in Redick who has zero coaching experience.", "source": {"uri": "sportsnaut.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sportsnaut.com"}, "authors": [{"uri": "vincent_frank@sportsnaut.com", "name": "Vincent Frank", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pelinka", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rob Pelinka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Darvin Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Pistons", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Pistons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Connecticut", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Connecticut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajan_Langdon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trajan Langdon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monty Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Blue_Devils_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Duke Blue Devils men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klay_Thompson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Klay Thompson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaden_Ivey", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jaden Ivey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jalen_Duren", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jalen Duren"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cade_Cunningham", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cade Cunningham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Blue_Devils", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Duke Blue Devils"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durham,_North_Carolina", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Durham, North Carolina"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Durham, North Carolina"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Religious_and_Inspirational", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Religious and Inspirational", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Religion_and_Spirituality/Spiritual_Beings", "label": "dmoz/Society/Religion and Spirituality/Spiritual Beings", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://sportsnaut.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/JJ-Redick-Los-Angeles-Lakers-15885797.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662595", "eventUri": "eng-9662595", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.02745098039215688, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

Redick agrees to a 4-year contract, starting to build the coaching staff. He is a close friend of LeBron James, and Redick faces intense scrutiny as a first-time coach in Hollywood.\n\nThe L.A. Lakers fired coach Darvin Ham after failing to make it back to the NBA Finals, which they won in the NBA's Orlando Bubble in 2020. As the biggest team in the league, speculation ran wild regarding who they would consider to lead LeBron James and Company, with names like James Borrego, Dan Hurley, and JJ Redickall among the named candidates.\n\nAmid the NBA's coaching carousel, it looked like Redick, who was previously considered a frontrunner for the Lakers' job, would be included in other head coaching searches. At the end of the day, the initial reports that Redick was on the Lakers' radar seem to be true, as it has been reported that he is taking over the coaching duties in LA.\n\nRedick hosts the \"Mind the Game\" podcast with James and appears to be a close friend of the King, and he will be a first-time head coach. With all the pressures that come with coaching in Hollywood, expect every move Redick makes to be heavily scrutinized.\n\nRelated Lakers' Austin Reaves Trolls Pistons With Response to Plea From Fan\n\nAustin Reaves has no plans of joining the Detroit Pistons' rebuild", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Darvin Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Borrego", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "James Borrego"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_Reaves", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Austin Reaves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Pistons", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Pistons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 34}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 36}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/mixcollage-20-jun-2024-03-07-pm-9433.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662595", "eventUri": "eng-9662595", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.223529411764706, "wgt": 193, "relevance": 1}

He joined ESPN's lead commentary team earlier this year.\n\nESPN first reported the decision.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Less than two weeks after UConn coach Danny Hurley turned down the Lakers' ardent advances, Redick has accepted the job in a remarkable three-year journey from the court to the broadcast booth to the Lakers' bench.\n\nRedick replaces Darvin Ham, who was fired May 3 despite leading the Lakers to two playoff berths and a Western Conference finals appearance in 2023.\n\nRedick began recording a regular podcast with James two months ago, and their \"Mind the Game\" collaboration is already wildly popular, with listeners often emerging impressed by the duo's basketball acumen and high-level discussion of tactics and motivation.\n\nNow these two minds will be working together for the Lakers, with Redick leading a roster headlined by James, who is six months younger than Redick.\n\nEverything is contingent on James deciding to return to play with Anthony Davis and the Lakers, of course. James, who will enter his 22nd NBA season this fall, could decline his $51.4 million contract option this month to become a free agent.\n\nBut hiring Redick seems to be another calculated move by the Lakers to maximize their chances of keeping the 20-time All-Star and the driving force behind their 2020 championship team.\n\nRedick's coaching experience is limited to his children's youth teams, but he has been around the game his entire life. He is the leading scorer in the history of Duke, where he played four seasons under Mike Krzyzewski.\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news

They have been interviewing candidates for the last month plus but still haven't settled on anyone.\n\nFormer NBA guard JJ Redick has been the frontrunner for the position but to this point, no offer has been made to him. There have been those who question the fit between the two sides, including some of Redick's colleagues at ESPN.\n\nFormer NBA center Udonis Haslem appeared on ESPN's morning show Get Up and seemed to be pushing Redick toward taking the open Detroit Pistons job over the Lakers one. He mentioned a conversation he had with Redick recently.\n\n\"I actually told JJ to his face, listen, problem you're going to deal with is most NBA players nowadays worry is the things they can't control. And now you're going to walk into a locker room of guys that are going to worry about the things they can't control. What's going on in the podcast? What's going on behind the scenes in conversations with LeBron? These are the things you're going to have deal with when you walk in there. Don't worry about that, go to Detroit, trim the fat.\"\n\nWhile it may be a little strange at first for Redick to enter the Lakers locker room if he does get the job, the front office will have likely vetted everything. They know how this all may look from the outside so they will want to get ahead of it early on.\n\nWhile the Pistons job would be much less pressure for a first-time head coach, Redick has never shied away from a challenge.

Less than two weeks after UConn coach Danny Hurley turned down the Lakers' ardent advances, Redick has accepted the job in a remarkable three-year journey from the court to the broadcast booth to the Lakers' bench.\n\nRedick replaces Darvin Ham, who was fired May 3 despite leading the Lakers to two playoff berths and a Western Conference finals appearance in 2023.\n\nRedick began recording a regular podcast with James two months ago, and their \"Mind the Game\" collaboration is already wildly popular, with listeners often emerging impressed by the duo's basketball acumen and high-level discussion of tactics and motivation.\n\nNow these two minds will be working together for the Lakers, with Redick leading a roster headlined by James, who is six months younger than Redick.\n\nEverything is contingent on James deciding to return to play with Anthony Davis and the Lakers, of course. James, who will enter his 22nd NBA season this fall, could decline his $51.4 million contract option this month to become a free agent.\n\nBut hiring Redick seems to be another calculated move by the Lakers to maximize their chances of keeping the 20-time All-Star and the driving force behind their 2020 championship team.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nRedick's coaching experience is limited to his children's youth teams, but he has been around the game his entire life. He is the leading scorer in the history of Duke, where he played four seasons under Mike Krzyzewski.\n\nAnd though Redick is an unorthodox choice, his unlikely ascent is not without some precedent in Lakers lore and recent NBA history.\n\nPat Riley was a broadcaster for the Lakers in November 1979 when Paul Westhead took over as their head coach after Jack McKinney nearly died in a bicycle accident. Westhead hired Riley as an assistant without coaching experience, and Riley became the Lakers' head coach in late 1981 after Westhead clashed with Magic Johnson.\n\nRiley promptly led the Lakers to four championships in the 1980s to begin his incredible career as a coach and executive.\n\nAnd then there's Steve Kerr, the former shooting guard and Phoenix Suns executive who had never coached before he took over at Golden State in 2014. Kerr has led Stephen Curry's Warriors to four championships and six NBA Finals appearances in the past decade.\n\nRedick's arrival ends another unusual offseason coaching search for owner Jeanie Buss, general manager Rob Pelinka and the Lakers, who are hiring their eighth head coach since Phil Jackson's final departure in 2011, and their fourth since James arrived as a free agent in 2018.\n\nLos Angeles needed six weeks to settle on Ham in the summer of 2022, but the longtime assistant coach was dismissed after the Lakers lost to defending champion Denver in the first round of the Western Conference playoffs.\n\nHam led the Lakers to two winning seasons and a victory in the inaugural In-Season Tournament last year, but many fans and observers -- and, clearly, the Lakers' front office -- were not impressed by his leadership or preparation.\n\nDavis memorably said during the playoffs that the Lakers \"have stretches where we don't know what we're doing on both ends of the floor.\"\n\nThe Lakers hired Ham after firing Frank Vogel, who had been fired exactly 18 months after he won a title in the Florida bubble. Vogel replaced Luke Walton after another long coaching search in which the Lakers were widely reported to have wanted Tyronn Lue, only for a deal to fall apart over issues with money and control.\n\nAP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

He said Redick accepted the job Thursday morning and has started working to build his coaching staff.\n\nRedick, an ESPN NBA analyst who played 15 years in the league, met with Lakers vice president and general manager Rob Pelinka and owner Jeanie Buss during the weekend and conversations on the vacancy continued throughout the week, sources said.\n\nPelinka offered Redick the job on Thursday morning, sources said.\n\nPelinka became sold on Redick's ability to connect with players and his basketball IQ and believes surrounding him with an elite coaching staff will help to shorten his learning curve into his first coaching job, sources said.\n\nRedick is not the Lakers' first choice. The team was initially turned down by UConn head coach Dan Hurley, who coincidentally is the brother of another former Duke basketball icon, Bobby Hurley.\n\nRedick moved into the forefront of the search after the Lakers were rebuffed by Hurley. The Lakers offered Hurley a six-year, $70 million contract that he turned down early last week, ESPN sources said.\n\nAs Pelinka did with Hurley, he still wants a teaching coach and staff who will prioritize the development of young players such as Max Christie, Austin Reaves, and Rui Hachimura and can design a creative approach to featuring Anthony Davis on both ends of the floor, sources said.\n\nRedick has never coached a professional basketball team. Since retiring from the NBA, Redick has had an extremely successful media career.

But so far, all signs are pointing towards ESPN's JJ Redick landing the job. This would be a gamble for the Lakers as Redick has yet to coach above the youth level up to this point.\n\nHowever, it could also pay off for L.A. as Redick has been in the media field for several years, displaying his basketball knowledge, notably with his \"Mind the Game\" podcast featuring LeBron James, who could become someone he coaches next season.\n\nFormer Los Angeles Lakers championship guard Derek Fisher knows the position that Redick is in. He went straight from playing to being the head coach of the New York Knicks a few years back. With that being the case, Fisher believes the work Redick has done in the media can actually benefit him as he goes into coaching, via Broderick Turner of the L.A. Times:\n\n\"If JJ does get the job, JJ has been out of the game for a few years and had an opportunity to be around guys in other settings,\" said Derek Fisher, the Crespi High coach who won five NBA titles with the Lakers before he became a first-time coach with the New York Knicks in 2014.\n\nFisher went on to add that hosting a podcast with James will help ease the pressure of being a first-time head coach:\n\n\"Like, he has a podcast with LeBron. That didn't necessarily exist when I was making that transition. But it's a good example of how different that is for even a guy that may not have previous experience coaching. It's really the relationships with players that drive your success to a large degree anyway. So, if you're in a position where you have that to lean on, it does help cushion the experience part. That's something that the collection of individuals on the staff can help offset the lack of coaching experience.\"\n\nDespite that, coaching the Lakers presents a tall task as L.A. needs to win right away and cannot afford to waste time trying to get Redick acclimated. So should he ultimately get this position, one can hope that his experience in media will pay dividends in the long run.\n\nAfter striking out on a pursuit for UConn's head coach Dan Hurley, the Lakers circled back to JJ Redick as a backup option.

He joined ESPN's lead commentary team earlier this year.\n\nESPN first reported the decision.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Less than two weeks after UConn coach Danny Hurley turned down the Lakers' ardent advances, Redick has accepted the job in a remarkable three-year journey from the court to the broadcast booth to the Lakers' bench.\n\nRedick replaces Darvin Ham, who was fired May 3 despite leading the Lakers to two playoff berths and a Western Conference finals appearance in 2023.\n\nRedick began recording a regular podcast with James two months ago, and their \"Mind the Game\" collaboration is already wildly popular, with listeners often emerging impressed by the duo's basketball acumen and high-level discussion of tactics and motivation.\n\nNow these two minds will be working together for the Lakers, with Redick leading a roster headlined by James, who is six months younger than Redick.\n\nEverything is contingent on James deciding to return to play with Anthony Davis and the Lakers, of course. James, who will enter his 22nd NBA season this fall, could decline his $51.4 million contract option this month to become a free agent.\n\nBut hiring Redick seems to be another calculated move by the Lakers to maximize their chances of keeping the 20-time All-Star and the driving force behind their 2020 championship team.\n\nRedick's coaching experience is limited to his children's youth teams, but he has been around the game his entire life. He is the leading scorer in the history of Duke, where he played four seasons under Mike Krzyzewski.\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and

Credits: USA TODAY Sports\n\nIt's time for another twist in the tale of the Los Angeles Lakers head coach hunt. While JJ Redick has been the frontrunner for the HC position for a while, Udonis Haslem made a different suggestion for the franchise. On Get Up, following up on the Pistons' head coach's recent firing, the Heat legend said that he is vouching for Monty Williams to take up the job in LA.\n\nWhen asked for his opinion on whether the Lakers should hire the 52-year-old, he said,\n\n\"My last answer was hell no, my answer this time is hell yes. You have to do your due diligence. This is your job, to bring the best coach and the best fit for your team.\"\n\nThe Heat legend also expressed his doubts over Redick's ability to control the team. He said that there's no questioning Redick's knowledge of the game, but when it comes to controlling the locker room, he has no experience.\n\nHaslem said, \"Can he control the locker room? A divided locker room is a doomed locker room.\" As for Williams, the three-time NBA champion believes that he will have the respect of the players because he has been coaching for almost two decades.\n\nHowever, he had one of the worst seasons with the Pistons. The Detroit franchise finished the season with the worst record across the two conferences, 14-68. Besides, there is yet to receive word on whether the Lakers are interested in Williams to take up the role. Additionally, Shams Charania is still backing Redick for the position.\n\nWhile Haslem believes that an experienced coach like Williams will be best suited for the Lakers at this time, Shams Charania has a different perspective on it. The Lakers are looking to turn things around for their franchise and for that, they will be willing to do anything.\n\nIn that equation, hiring Redick might be the best decision because their superstar, LeBron James, is leaning towards having his friend as his coach.\n\nEven though there is no confirmation or denial from either side, Charania thinks that it's almost certain that Redick will be the one who will join the Lakers.

Redick's connections to Detroit's front office and Duke University make him a potential candidate for the Pistons' head coaching vacancy. The Pistons are seeking a coach to guide them back to the postseason after the unexpected firing of Monty Williams, emphasizing the need for the right hiring decision.\n\nJJ Redick has kept himself busy in the few years since retiring from the NBA following the 2020-21 season. After an NBA career spanning 15 seasons with six different teams, the former three-point specialist has spent his time as an analyst for ESPN, along with hosting his own podcast, \"The Old Man and the Three\", and more recently starting the highly-successful \"Mind the Game\" podcast with LeBron James.\n\nDespite taking on a post-playing career that still puts himself in the basketball spotlight, Redick has seemingly been looking to find his way back onto an NBA team - as a head coach. Considering Redick's rapport with James, the 39-year-old has been an obvious and oft-mentioned candidate for the Los Angeles Lakers' head coaching vacancy.\n\nWhile he has been connected to the Lakers in recent weeks, Los Angeles has yet to officially make the hire, and now the hopeful player-turned-coach is reportedly being viewed by other teams - including the Detroit Pistons.\n\n\"James Borrego could be a name to watch, league sources told Yahoo Sports, as well as ESPN analyst JJ Redick . Redick is currently a prime candidate for the Lakers job, so it isn't known how much traction Detroit could actually gain.\" -Vincent Goodwill, Yahoo Sports\n\nThe Pistons somewhat surprisingly parted ways with veteran head coach Monty Williams just one year into a lucrative six-year, $78.5 million contract that brought him to Detroit last summer. Williams' confusing roster decisions and reported disagreements within the organization led to a firing that resulted in the team's owner, Tom Gores, biting the bullet on the $65 million still owed to the 52-year-old.\n\nNow, the seemingly directionless Pistons again are on the search for the coach who can lead the franchise back to the postseason alongside the team's star, Cade Cunningham.\n\nDetroit Needs a Leader in the Locker Room Redick would need to connect with the young Pistons better than his predecessor\n\nRetired from the league for less than four years, Redick knows the ins and outs of the modern NBA, and therefore what it takes to win in an era dominated by spacing and versatility.\n\nAs a first-time head coach, it's difficult to truly evaluate how Redick would perform leading an inexperienced Detroit roster, especially when compared to the age and talent he would be working with in Los Angeles. Considering his relative youth and established playing career, Redick should be viewed as a players' coach, a trait the Pistons may need from their next candidate.\n\nDetroit Pistons Past Coaches\n\nCategory\n\nStan Van Gundy\n\nDwane Casey\n\nMonty Williams\n\nSeasons\n\n4\n\n5\n\n1\n\nOverall Record\n\n152-176\n\n121-263\n\n14-68\n\nBest Finish\n\n44-38\n\n23-59\n\n14-68\n\nRedick also has a connection to Detroit's recently hired President of Basketball Operations, Trajan Langdon. The pair both played college ball at Duke University - albeit at different times. Langdon also acquired Redick in a trade while he was the GM of the New Orleans Pelicans, providing some context for the latter's reported connection to the Pistons.\n\nWhile the signs are still pointing to Redick ending up with the Lakers, the Pistons are reasonably doing their due diligence after firing their head coach nearly two months after their season's end. Detroit will have a number of options to search through, including former Charlotte Hornets' coach James Borrego and a handful of qualified assistant coaches. After ending the franchise's last head coaching deal half a decade early, the Pistons cannot afford to mess up their next one.\n\nRelated Draymond Green Congratulates Celtics After Finals Victory\n\nGolden State's vocal leader praised Boston's star-studded roster for getting the job done.", "source": {"uri": "givemesport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "GiveMeSport"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monty Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Pistons", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Pistons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_University", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Duke University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cade_Cunningham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cade Cunningham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Borrego", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "James Borrego"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajan_Langdon", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trajan Langdon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Van_Gundy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stan Van Gundy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwane_Casey", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dwane Casey"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Hornets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte Hornets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draymond_Green", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draymond Green"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans_Pelicans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans Pelicans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "College football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://static0.givemesportimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/mixcollage-20-jun-2024-01-38-am-9901.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662595", "eventUri": "eng-9662595", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1764705882352942, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

Why JJ Redick should launch his coaching career in Detroit and avoid the L.A. circus - CBSSports.com", "body": "USATSI\n\nJJ Redick hasn't publicly commented on the state of the Los Angeles Lakers as he has interviewed for their head-coaching job. During the search that led up to the hire of Darvin Ham in 2022, though, he had plenty to say. \"Until they start building their team like every other team in the NBA does, in the modern NBA, I don't think this is a good job,\" he said on a 2022 appearance on ESPN's Get Up.\n\nThe roster that the Lakers have built since then is much closer to league standard than it was in 2022. Russell Westbrook is gone. There's more shooting even if there isn't enough of it. Every position is addressed at least somewhat. On paper, the Lakers at least somewhat resemble a normal NBA team. The Detroit Pistons do not. Their two best players, Cade Cunningham and Jaden Ivey, are both point guards. The fringes of the roster were populated largely by draft busts from other teams like Kevin Knox, James Wiseman and Marvin Bagley. None of their players ranked in the top 90 in the NBA in made 3-pointers. They had too many centers and no true wings.\n\nThere is a world in which the right coach could take over the Lakers and lead them to 50 wins with the right tweaks. That isn't happening for the Pistons, at least not yet. They are still relatively early into a rebuild that isn't far away from getting expensive. Cunningham is eligible for a rookie extension this offseason. Ivey and Jalen Duren will be eligible next summer. There are going to have to be hard decisions about who stays and who goes here. At the very least, the Pistons need a reshuffle to diversify the skill sets of their core players. At most, they may eventually need to acknowledge that Cunningham is the only cornerstone piece they have and re-evaluate their attachment to anyone else. If Redick's goal is to win right now, the Lakers are a better bet for him.\n\nIt should therefore come as no surprise, then, to hear that, at least for the moment, the basketball world seems to expect Redick to land in Los Angeles, not Detroit. \" Redick is currently a prime candidate for the Lakers job, so it isn't known how much traction Detroit could actually gain,\" Yahoo's Vincent Goodwill reported. If Redick is at the finish line with the Lakers, he may not even hear the Pistons out.\n\nBut there are meaningful connections here. Pistons vice chairman Arn Tellem was once Redick's agent. President of basketball operations Trajan Langdon worked in the Pelicans front office that signed Redick as a free agent in 2019. Both are Duke alums known for their 3-point shot. He may not have hosted a podcast with any current members of the Pistons organization, but there's a viable infrastructure waiting for him in Detroit if he wants to pursue it. Even if he does, there's no guarantee he'd get the job. This isn't exactly a binary choice. He's spent weeks pitching himself to one team. The other is only one day into searching for its own coach. But if the Pistons are seriously interested, it's a job Redick should pursue. Detroit is a better fit for him than Los Angeles.\n\nConcerns over Detroit's roster are valid. The Pistons are a fixer-upper. It's going to take time for them to get it right. Time is something the Lakers don't have. LeBron James is about to turn 40, after all, and Anthony Davis is 31 with an extensive injury history. They are a Play-In team whose trajectory in a loaded Western Conference is pointing down. They could try to trade as many as three first-round picks and three first-round swaps this offseason to change that, but even that would be a relatively short-term play given how old their two other stars currently are. Maybe there's an aggressive one- or two-year title push to be made here, but would that be worthwhile if it cost the Lakers control of their next handful of drafts?\n\nThe short answer is probably no, but where exactly does that leave Redick? The roster doesn't have time, but the Lakers rarely afford it to their head coaches anyway. Whoever they hire to replace Ham will be their seventh full-time head coach since Phil Jackson retired in 2011. They fired Frank Vogel two years after a championship and Ham one year after reaching the Western Conference finals. If the Lakers go all-in to win now, they entrust their immediate fate to a coach with no experience. If they don't, they likely continue on their more gradual decline toward the bottom of the West. Given the relatively brief tenures most Laker coaches can expect, neither situation sounds ideal for Redick.\n\nAnd then of course, there is the subtext of that 2022 quote about the Lakers job. The Lakers roster might look a bit more like what most teams are fielding two years later, but the path they took to build it was anything but. Redick called on them to act like teams do in the modern NBA back in 2022. There is nothing modern about the family business structure this organization still takes.\n\nThe Lakers simultaneously have a front office that is too big and too small. They aren't exactly known for employing a deep support staff or investing in scouting or analytics at the level that other teams do. What they do have is too many cooks in the kitchen. Rob Pelinka nominally controls all basketball decisions. At various points over the past several years, reports have either stated or hinted at influence from a variety of other sources, some more qualified than others. It's never quite clear if a Lakers decision is being made by Pelinka or Kurt Rambis. Or Linda Rambis. Or Tim Harris. Joey and Jesse Buss have developed a strong resume over the last few years and have earned voices as well.\n\nTaking the Laker job means playing the Game of Thrones. Navigating palace intrigue shouldn't be such an important part of a first-time coach's job. The ideal team structure for any coach, much less one without experience, is a wealthy but hands-off owner that defers to a strong, singular head of basketball operations who in turn entrusts on-court matters fully to the coach. The Lakers thing Redick needs is for Kurt Rambis to push him for more DeAndre Jordan and Dwight Howard minutes.\n\nThis front office outlasted Luke Walton. It hired and fired both Vogel and Ham. If nothing else, the Laker front office has a penchant for self-preservation. They have the advantage of Laker ties Redick lacks. If push comes to shove, would Jeanie Buss back him over Kobe Bryant's former agent Pelinka, or a member of the Showtime Lakers in Rambis? History has thus far indicated that the answer is no.\n\nIn Los Angeles, coaches have been disposable. The front office's inner circle has not been. That's how Frank Vogel winds up getting scapegoated for a trade that Pelinka made and James endorsed. Vogel had a championship ring to his name when he lost his job. It's hard to imagine that Redick will if this thing goes south after a few years. Without a strong resume as an assistant, prospective future employers only have the Lakers' tenure to judge him off of. If it goes badly enough, that might be enough to kill a promising coaching career before it really starts.\n\nMaybe Redick can handle all of the extra nonsense that comes with coaching the Lakers. Maybe he can't. It's too early to tell. But if he can find a team that operates a bit more like everybody else does, well, that's probably a path worth considering.\n\nIronically, that really hasn't been the Pistons lately. They've been just as guilty as the Lakers of having too many cooks in the kitchen. Tellem seemingly has influence over basketball matters. Former general manager Troy Weaver was theoretically the shot-caller. Monty Williams surely negotiated some measure of front office say when he convinced the Pistons to give him a historic contract. Job security in Detroit is fair to question as well. Williams just got fired after one year, though in fairness, Dwane Casey and Stan Van Gundy reigned for nine combined years before him.\n\nBut that decision highlights two key advantages the Pistons offer over the Lakers. The first is financial. The Lakers, by all rights, should be able to spend far more on coaches than the Pistons do. Yet when the Lakers pursued Dan Hurley, they offered him a six-year, $78.5 million pact that was worth less than what Detroit paid Williams. Now, the Pistons are paying Williams to go away. That's a rare financial commitment, but it's one Tom Gores can afford to make. Forbes estimates that he has a $9.1 billion net worth. The finances of the Laker owners are far more complicated. The Buss family does not have another major source of wealth. Their money comes primarily from the Lakers, and six siblings each own a share of a stake once held by Dr. Jerry Buss. The Lakers bring in a ton of revenue. They're willing to reinvest it in high-profile ways, like paying the luxury tax and adding stars. But they've never really flexed their financial muscle in the subtler ways that tend to lead to sustained winning. Gores can do that, and he's proving it now.\n\nMore importantly, Gores has done what the Lakers practically never have. The first step in solving any problem is admitting that there is one. Gores just fired his head coach and general manager because the way the Pistons operated was fundamentally unsound. Now, he's empowered a new head of basketball operations, hoping to fix that. Just as it's too early to draw any reasonable conclusions about Redick, it is about Langdon as well. But at least the Pistons seemed to understand that change was needed.\n\nThe Lakers have not, and it's pretty concerning when you consider how the past decade or so has played out. They had the worst record in the NBA in the five years between Bryant tearing his Achilles and James moving out West. They won a single championship largely because James chose to play for them, a decision that was probably based on far more than his belief in the team's on-court prospects, and they have proceeded to mismanage their roster completely in the four years since. At no point has there been substantive reporting suggesting that any key member of the front office that traded for Westbrook or kept hiring the wrong coaches or offered Dennis Schroder $84 million mere months before he signed for less than 10% of them has been in any real danger. The Lakers have never really acknowledged just how far behind the times they really are.\n\nThe rosters matter here, but only to a point. One offers the chance to win for a year or two before things likely get worse. The other demands a year or two of losing before things probably get better. Ultimately that's a matter of preference. Some coaches are genuinely better fits for one than the other. A coach with no experience is probably better suited to the \"lose now, win later\" path just because that early losing is an opportunity to learn on the job, but again, there are arguments on both sides.\n\nBut the most important part of building the sort of sustained winner Redick surely wants is stability, and the Laker circus just doesn't offer much of it. There are suitable ringleaders for it out there, coaches with enough seasoning to know what to expect out of it. One day, that might be Redick. For now, he's better off starting his coaching career in a more typical environment. That might mean Detroit now or it might mean another team later. It might cost him a few early wins, but it's the best move for his coaching future.", "source": {"uri": "cbssports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBS Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri":

He joined ESPN's lead commentary team earlier this year.\n\nESPN first reported the decision.\n\nPeople are also reading...

At Bloomington's Mobile Pride Parade, a celebration of joy and acceptance Aaron Rossi accused of defrauding state of Illinois during COVID-19 pandemic State: Murder defendant fought Bloomington man over a gun before fatal shooting\n\nBefore Redick finished broadcasting the NBA Finals, he met with the Lakers last weekend and apparently did well enough to end the franchise's lengthy coaching search. Less than two weeks after UConn coach Danny Hurley turned down the Lakers' ardent advances, Redick has accepted the job in a remarkable three-year journey from the court to the broadcast booth to the Lakers' bench.\n\nRedick replaces Darvin Ham, who was fired May 3 despite leading the Lakers to two playoff berths and a Western Conference finals appearance in 2023.\n\nRedick began recording a regular podcast with James two months ago, and their \"Mind the Game\" collaboration is already wildly popular, with listeners often emerging impressed by the duo's basketball acumen and high-level discussion of tactics and motivation.\n\nNow these two minds will be working together for the Lakers, with Redick leading a roster headlined by James, who is six months younger than Redick.\n\nEverything is contingent on James deciding to return to play with Anthony Davis and the Lakers, of course. James, who will enter his 22nd NBA season this fall, could decline his $51.4 million contract option this month to become a free agent.\n\nBut hiring Redick seems to be another calculated move by the Lakers to maximize their chances of keeping the 20-time All-Star and the driving force behind their 2020 championship team.\n\nRedick's coaching experience is limited to his children's youth teams, but he has been around the game his entire life. He is the leading scorer in the history of Duke, where he played four seasons under Mike Krzyzewski.\n\nLove 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nBe the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your

His name surfaced as a candidate after the dismissal of former head coach Darvin Ham.

Redick will replace Darvin Ham after two seasons.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Pistons called it quits with Monty Williams after just one season.

The former sharpshooter has many years of playing experience, after he started as an 11th overall pick on the Orlando Magic in 2006. Since his Magic stint, Redick played for the Milwaukee Bucks, LA Clippers, Philadelphia 76ers, New Orleans Pelicans, and Dallas Mavericks.\n\nAfter his 2021 stint with the Mavs, Redick called it a career. For the last few seasons, he served as an analyst. His knowledge for the game attracted many teams, including the Lakers.\n\nThe Pistons' list of candidates has yet to be revealed, as they are still early in the process of searching for Williams' replacement. One report suggested that former Charlotte Hornets head coach James Borrego could be in the mix.\n\nBorrego was also a candidate in the Lakers' search, and remains a top prospect for the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nDetroit's hunt for a new head coach for the second-straight summer will begin quickly, as Pistons owner Tome Gores noted on Wednesday.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Pistons", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Pistons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "American Airlines Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Dallas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Darvin Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monty Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Borrego", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "James Borrego"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Hornets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte Hornets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans_Pelicans", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans Pelicans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_Magic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orlando Magic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2824,h_1588,x_0,y_138/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/all_pistons/01j0vhaz72zjdqzxqqze.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662595", "eventUri": "eng-9662595", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2012-04-", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 6}], "sentiment": 0.1843137254901961, "wgt": 182, "relevance": 1}

Redick is their eighth coach in the 13 years since Phil Jackson retired and the fourth coach in six years with James.\n\nWhat makes anyone think Redick's tenure will renounce that sordid history?\n\nAbsolutely nothing.\n\nFor one, he's not the Lakers' first choice, and every player in that locker room will know that.\n\nRemember, Rob Pelinka romanced Redick early in the search, but then suddenly changed direction and threw $70 million at Connecticut mastermind Dan Hurley. When Hurley surprisingly threw it back, the Lakers were back to square one, which was already populated by Redick, so, what the heck, boom, done. Really?\n\nNo other serious candidates? No James Borrego? No Sam Cassell? The Clippers just made a great assistant hire and you're immediately thinking, wait, no Jeff Van Gundy?\n\nThe players know the landscape. The players understand the options. The players can sense vulnerability, and few coaches have ever walked into a situation with more naked vulnerability than Redick, who, outside of LeBron, will probably be greeted with odd smiles and an unspoken question.\n\nWho are you again?\n\nRedick is an assertively brainy former Duke star who had a decent 15-year career as a three-point specialist for six different teams, including the Clippers.\n\nBut that doesn't mean he can walk right to the front of an NBA bench with no coaching or management experience.\n\nYou say Steve Kerr did it? No, when Kerr was hired as a rookie coach by the Golden State Warriors he had spent the previous three years as general manager of the Phoenix Suns.\n\nRedick has recently been an outstanding television analyst, working the NBA Finals for ESPN, brilliantly displaying his deep knowledge of the intricacies of the game, sounding very much like a coach.\n\nBut that doesn't mean those strategies can be sold to an unfamiliar bench, where sounding like a coach and actually leading like a coach are two entirely different things.\n\nYou say Pat Riley did it? No, he was a Lakers assistant coach for parts of three seasons -- including an NBA championship year -- before becoming a head coach.\n\nThe Lakers reportedly like Redick because he reminds them of Riley, right down to the fancy haircuts and tailored suits.\n\nYet by the time he took the job, Riley already had built up credibility with the entire organization after serving a variety of roles while contributing to a ring.\n\nRedick's incoming claim to credibility is, well, he's LeBron's buddy. Anything else? Anybody?\n\nAnd even this connection is frayed, as there are some in the league who believe that LeBron and Redick strangely began their podcast in March -- who begins an NBA podcast in the last month of the season? -- as a way to push Redick forward while pushing Darvin Ham out.\n\nPlayers will wonder. Players will question. And surely there will be players who will listen to Redick and ask, is that our coach talking or LeBron talking or Rich Paul talking? With LeBron and Redick essentially serving as co-coaches, it could mean the Lakers have no coach.\n\nThe idea that they need a coach who can maximize LeBron's final two seasons here is flawed because the maximizing has already occurred. What you saw last season is probably as good as it's going to get as long as LeBron is their leader and Anthony Davis is his sidekick.\n\nOccasional historic nights from LeBron, infrequent dominant nights from AD, everyone else kind of disappears and it's March and the Lakers are fighting to avoid play-in hell.\n\nBottom line, whoever coaches the Lakers for the next two seasons is not really going to matter. For all kinds of salary cap reasons, they probably can't improve their roster enough to improve their chances enough, no matter who is calling the plays.\n\nThat's why they needed a coach who can build a new program instead of just curating the final fall of an old program. They didn't need someone who was seemingly hired by LeBron, they needed someone to stand up to LeBron.\n\nSadly, that's not happening here, as the entirety of Redick's job description is to serve as the caretaker during the sundown of LeBron, much like Byron Scott was once hired to oversee the goodbye to Kobe Bryant.\n\nScott did his job perfectly, and lasted all of two years. This seems to be the situation here. Set the over-under on Redick's tenure at two seasons.\n\nBut, wait, Lakers fans, it gets worse.\n\nThe hiring of Redick, given his partnership with LeBron, seemingly ensures that the Lakers will take the eminently unqualified Bronny James with the 55th pick in next week's NBA draft.\n\nSomewhere Luke Walton is sighing, and Frank Vogel is scowling, and Darvin Ham is giggling.", "source": {"uri":

Just as talking heads were up in arms over the fact that the Los Angeles Lakers hadn't hired a head coach since missing out on Dan Hurley, a Woj Bomb told the wide world of basketball that JJ Redick was indeed hired as of Thursday.\n\nRedick was believed to be a leading candidate all along. Woj's chief rival Shams Charania had a bit of a scoop war with his former Yahoo! Sports colleague, even going as far to imply that Hurley entertaining the Lakers gig was a leverage play. Hurley denied that, but nevertheless, the Woj vs. Shams scoop-off was an entertaining subplot to the whole LA coaching search.\n\nWhat makes the news of Redick's hiring even funnier -- all jokes aside about his podcast with LeBron James and how that's the only reason he got he job, etc. -- was the timely story Carmelo Anthony shared about Team USA basketball.\n\nThe late, great Kobe Bryant is arguably the most beloved Laker of all-time. Certainly in the modern era, that's the case. Kobe was a legendary, psychotic competitor in the vein of Michael Jordan. Closest thing we've seen to MJ in terms of play style, brilliance on offense and defense, and so on. Anyway, mere hours before Redick was hired, the latest episode of Melo's own pod premiered, in which he spoke about how the Black Mamba loathed Redick:\n\nLegendary Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski gave his former Blue Devils star a chance to compete for a roster spot, but Redick didn't make the cut for the USA's gold medal-winning \"Redeem Team.\" Since Kobe was the primary catalyst for that crew, perhaps his feelings toward Redick played a minor part in the decision to not have him on the squad. I doubt it, though. That team was stupid-stacked, and Redick wasn't anywhere near the player he'd become in his prime, having just completed his second NBA season.\n\nWhile I can't confirm or deny either way based on real-time research, I don't think Kobe's resentment of Redick persisted through the years. In fact, the tragedy of Kobe's death in a helicopter crash was actually what sparked the idea to have a podcast with LeBron in the first place.\n\nBut yeah, just thought it was such a hilariously-timed drop by Melo, whose JJ-Kobe story is only bound to blow up even more now that Redick is taking the reins for the Purple and Gold.\n\nWhat a high-pressure situation Redick is stepping into as a first-time NBA head coach. Not that I doubt his basketball acumen, ability to get players to buy in, or his coaching chops despite his inexperience. It's just that the Lakers are at such a crossroads with LeBron entering his 22nd season, minimal cap room/draft capital to improve the roster, and the innate championship expectations that come with being at the helm in LA.\n\nSay what you will about how cakewalk-y the path was for the Boston Celtics to their latest NBA title, but they now have 18 banners to the Lakers' 17. That's all anyone affiliated with the Lakers is going to care about until they match Boston. Redick will need to somehow get that done in the next two to three years, or else he's likely looking for another job. Not that he has any shortage of options. It's just that, the degree of difficulty couldn't be much greater. Good luck to him. It'll be fascinating as hell to watch regardless.", "source": {"uri": "whiskeyriff.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Whiskey Riff"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Hurley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Dan Hurley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kobe"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kobe"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_national_baseball_team", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "United States national baseball team"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_journalism", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Sports journalism"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Blue_Devils_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Duke Blue Devils men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Blue_Devils", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Duke Blue Devils"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmelo_Anthony", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Carmelo Anthony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_Bryant", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kobe Bryant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_medal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Gold medal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Krzyzewski", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mike Krzyzewski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "United States"}, "location": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Boston"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 93}], "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.whiskeyriff.com/wp-content/uploads/Carmelo.jpg?fit=1200%2C666&ssl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662595", "eventUri": "eng-9662595", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2627450980392156, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

Although several insiders suggested that the Lakers were not expected to target Wiliams to fill their head coaching vacancy, two former NBA champions urged the Purple & Gold franchise to consider hiring Williams as the successor to Darvin Ham.\n\nSpeaking on ESPN's NBA Today on June 19, former Heat player Udonis Haslem advised the Lakers to hire Williams over rumored candidate JJ Redick.\n\n\"What I do know about Monty Williams is he has the respect of the NBA, he has the respect of the guys in the locker room,\" Haslem said. \"When you talk about the Lakers situation, we understand how great JJ's basketball mind is, we understand that the potential for JJ to be a coach is through the roof, but the question we have is: can he control the locker room? Can he quiet the noise? We understand that Monty Williams can control the locker room, he can quiet the noise.\"\n\n\"If you're the Lakers, you have to do your due diligence,\" Haslem continued. \"You at least have to take a look at it [hiring Williams]. That's your job to bring the best guy available to your organization and put your team in the best position to win.\"\n\nTo Haslem's point, as of June 20, Redick had no prior experience coaching at the collegiate or pro level and would be stepping into uncharted territory as Lakers coach.\n\nWarriors star Draymond Green also asked the Lakers to consider Williams, citing Anthony Davis' history of playing under Williams in a Pelicans uniform.\n\n\"Monty Williams is now on the free agent market, and I know that the Los Angeles Lakers have been -- I don't know what's going on, but I know something's going to happen fast,\" Green said on the \"Draymond Green Show\" on June 19. \"You got the draft [and] free agency coming up, and it's been quite a while [since Lakers' search began].\n\n\"I don't know what exactly is going on, but I know Anthony Davis loved Monty Williams when he played for him at New Orleans. Should the Lakers consider Monty Williams? I say, 'of course, you have to consider him.' 100 percent. Especially with that tie [between Davis and Williams]. You definitely gotta consider him.\"\n\nAs has been widely documented, Williams had the option of coaching the Lakers in 2019 but instead chose the Phoenix Suns.\n\nAccording to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, the Lakers would have considered Williams for the job had he become available a little earlier during their coaching search process. However, with the NBA Draft scheduled for June 26-27, the Rob Pelinka-led front office is racing against time to finalize Ham's successor.\n\nSpeaking on \"SportsCenter with SVP\" on June 19, Woj explained why Williams to the Lakers was no longer a feasible option.\n\n\"If Monty Williams had been available to the Lakers when they started this search, perhaps he might meld into this search process,\" Woj said. \"Monty Wiliams was blindsided with his dismissal [from Detroit].\"\n\nWoj added that, as of June 19, the Lakers had \"pivoted back\" to Redick as their No. 1 coaching option

Redick reportedly agreed to a four-year contract and was offered the job Thursday morning.\n\nSince the team fired Darvin Ham in early May, Redick had been considered a front-runner for the job given his ties to James and his basketball acumen, which has been on display since he joined ESPN as a color commentator in 2021. He quickly worked his way up to the broadcast team for the NBA Finals after Doc Rivers, who left the booth to coach the Bucks.\n\nJust 39, Redick is one of the youngest coaches in the NBA, but not younger than Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla, who just won the NBA title at age 35. Redick has no previous coaching experience and will face a steep learning curve. NBA teams have hired fresh coaches with mixed results, from the Steve Kerr Warriors dynasty to Steve Nash's struggles in Brooklyn. Rivers himself thrived when hired fresh out of the booth to coach the Magic in 1999.\n\nESPN reported Lakers GM Rob Pelinka believes Redick can adjust quicker than most novice coaches with the right staff around him. Redick takes over the organization a week ahead of the NBA draft, in which the Lakers have long been rumored to draft LeBron's oldest son, Bronny. Regardless, LeBron, who will turn 40 in December, is expected to opt out of his contract and become a free agent.\n\nRedick will be the Lakers' eighth coach since Phil Jackson retired in 2011.", "source": {"uri": "frontofficesports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Front Office Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "alex_schiffer@frontofficesports.com", "name": "Alex Schiffer", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston_Celtics", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Boston Celtics"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Darvin Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doc_Rivers", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doc Rivers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milwaukee_Bucks", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Milwaukee Bucks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_commentator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Color commentator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pelinka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rob Pelinka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Jackson", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phil Jackson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Nash", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Nash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Kerr", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Steve Kerr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 35}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 40}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://frontofficesports.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/jjred.jpg?quality=100", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662595", "eventUri": "eng-9662595", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 180, "relevance": 1}

The Lakers, one of the NBA's most historic franchises with 17 championships, parted ways with coach Darvin Ham after just two seasons in May following a first-round playoff exit.\n\nRedick has no previous coaching experience but spent 15 seasons in the league as a player from 2006-2021. The first seven years were spent with Orlando -- who selected him at No. 11 overall out of Duke -- before time with the Los Angeles Clippers, Philadelphia 76ers, New Orleans Pelicans, Milwaukee Bucks and Dallas Mavericks.

The Blue Devils' all-time leading scorer (2,769 points), he averaged 19.9 points per game over four seasons. Redick was named the national college player of the year in 2006 and was a two-time All-American, a two-time ACC Player of the Year and a two-time ACC tournament MVP.\n\nThe Lakers, despite having stars in LeBron James and Anthony Davis, have failed to reach expectations in recent seasons. They have only made it out of the first round of the playoffs one time since winning the NBA Finals in 2020.\n\nLos Angeles reportedly offered UConn coach Dan Hurley a six-year, $70 million deal last

Smith Says The Lakers Should Consider Monty Williams", "body": "Stephen A. Smith recently suggested on 'First Take' that the Los Angeles Lakers should consider Monty Williams for their head coaching position following his recent firing from the Detroit Pistons. Smith emphasized that Williams' availability could be a significant opportunity for the Lakers to improve their team dynamics and overall performance.\n\n\"I know we've been talking a lot about JJ Reddick, but with Monty Williams available, that is a situation that the Los Angeles Lakers should look at, okay? So I would definitely say that as well.\"\n\n\"They should look at it. Obviously, Jeannie Buss, you know how much I love Jeannie Buss I'm rooting for her to find the right person for the job. Respect Rob Polenko, what he's going to do, you know, and yes, I respect Kurt Rambis too.\"\n\n\"I was joking around about him earlier, but I respect him too. So listen, they're all going to be a part of the process and we'll see what happens. And, you know, I think Monty Williams definitely should be a candidate for that job.\"\n\nSmith pointed out that while there has been considerable discussion about JJ Redick being the next head coach for the Lakers, the team should also evaluate Monty Williams as a potential candidate.\n\nHe acknowledged the importance of Lakers' owner Jeanie Buss, General Manager Rob Pelinka, and Executive Kurt Rambis in the decision-making process and expressed his respect for their roles. Smith believes that Williams' experience and coaching abilities could be beneficial for the Lakers.\n\nMonty Williams has a notable coaching history, having won the NBA Coach of the Year award twice. He led the Phoenix Suns to the NBA Finals in 2021, demonstrating his capacity to build and guide a successful team. Despite his recent challenges with the Pistons, where he was unable to turn the team's fortunes around, his overall track record remains impressive.\n\nOn the other hand, the Lakers have shown a strong inclination towards hiring JJ Redick, a former NBA player with no prior head coaching experience. Redick's potential appointment represents a significant risk due to his lack of coaching background. However, the Lakers might be attracted to his fresh perspective and potential to bring new strategies to the team.\n\nThe Lakers' decision on their next head coach is critical for their future success. Hiring Monty Williams could provide the team with a seasoned coach who has a proven ability to lead and develop a competitive team.\n\nConversely, opting for Redick might bring a new approach, though it carries the uncertainty associated with a first-time coach. Ultimately, the Lakers must weigh the benefits of experience and stability against the potential for innovative change as they make their decision.\n\nThe Lakers Might Be Too Late To Approach Monty Williams\n\nThe Lakers may face a strategic error if they decide to pursue Monty Williams for their head coaching position. Lakers insider Anthony F. Irwin has strongly suggested that the team is on the verge of finalizing a deal with JJ Redick as their new head coach. Any deviation from this path could lead to complications.\n\nThe Lakers have already experienced a setback when Dan Hurley turned down their substantial $70 million offer. This rejection has likely put additional pressure on the team's decision-makers to secure a solid candidate swiftly. Introducing Monty Williams into the mix at this late stage could disrupt their plans and jeopardize the nearly confirmed hiring of Redick.\n\nPursuing Williams now may not only undermine their negotiations with Redick but could also reflect poorly on the organization's decision-making process. It might appear as if the Lakers are uncertain about their choices, which could erode confidence among the team's supporters and stakeholders.\n\nAdditionally, Monty Williams, who has a proven track record but was recently dismissed from the Detroit Pistons, may not be the immediate solution the Lakers need to stabilize their coaching situation.\n\nRedick, despite his lack of head coaching experience, brings a fresh perspective and potential innovative strategies to the table. The Lakers' apparent commitment to him suggests they are looking for a new direction and energy. Diverting their focus to Monty Williams at this point could complicate and prolong the hiring process, leaving the team in a state of uncertainty.\n\nWhile Monty Williams is an attractive candidate with a wealth of experience, the Lakers might be better served by sticking to their current plan and securing JJ Redick as their head coach. This approach would provide clarity and stability, allowing the team to move forward with confidence.\n\nThank you for being a valued reader of Fadeaway World.

Reports have immediately clarified the odds of Williams to the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers have assembled a dynamic list of candidates to become the next head coach of the franchise with a record 32 NBA Finals appearances. JJ Redick and James Borrego lead a pool of options that includes NCAA Champions and longtime assistant coaches.\n\nWith an unexpected development transpiring in the Eastern Conference, however, the Lakers have suddenly been presented with another name to consider.\n\nThe Detroit Pistons made waves on June 19 by firing head coach Monty Williams after just one season. Williams was the fourth-highest-paid coach in the NBA, and while Detroit finished the 2023-24 regular season at 14-68, most expected him to have the chance to turn the team around.\n\nWith Williams entering coaching free agency, the inevitable question has arisen of whether the Lakers should add him to the coaching search.\n\nUnfortunately for those advocating for the hire, Adrian Wojnarowski of ESPN reports that Williams may not want to coach again so soon.\n\nShams Charania of The Athletic also reported that Williams hasn't yet surfaced on the Lakers' radar as an alternative to heavy favorite JJ Redick.\n\nSome might be disappointed to hear this, but as Charania noted, Williams was blindsided and the Lakers haven't exactly had time to process his availability.\n\nWilliams was previously identified as a favorite for the Lakers job in 2019 before he instead took a head coaching job with the Phoenix Suns. He led Phoenix to the first NBA Finals appearance in franchise history in 2020-21, and guided it to a franchise-record 64 wins the following season.\n\nWilliams' subsequent stint with the Pistons was cut short after just one season, but he remains one of the most sought-after coaches in the Association.\n\nIn Los Angeles, Williams would have a chance to transition from a rebuilding team to a squad with two of the best players in the NBA. It would be a reunion, of sorts, as he previously coached Anthony Davis with the New Orleans Pelicans.\n\nTogether, Davis and Williams led New Orleans to the playoffs in 2014-15, thus ending a four-year postseason drought.\n\nWilliams would still be tasked with helping the Lakers build for the future, however, as Davis is 31 and LeBron James will turn 40 in December. Austin Reaves, 26, and Rui Hachimura, 26, are regarded as players the Lakers are keen on developing, as is 21-year-old restricted free agent Max Christie.\n\nIt's still possible that Williams will be hired as the coach to accomplish that challenging feat, but as it stands in the immediate aftermath of his firing in Detroit, the Lakers are staying the course.", "source": {"uri": "lakeshowlife.com",

James, who will enter his 22nd NBA season this fall, could decline his $51.4 million contract option this month to become a free agent.\n\nBut hiring Redick seems to be another calculated move by the Lakers to maximize their chances of keeping the 20-time All-Star and the driving force behind their 2020 championship team.\n\nRedick's coaching experience is limited to his children's youth teams, but he has been around the game his entire life. He is the leading scorer in the history of Duke, where he played four seasons under Mike Krzyzewski.\n\nAnd though Redick is an unorthodox choice, his unlikely ascent is not without some precedent in Lakers lore and recent NBA history.\n\nPat Riley was a broadcaster for the Lakers in November 1979 when Paul Westhead took over as their head coach after Jack McKinney nearly died in a bicycle accident. Westhead hired Riley as an assistant without coaching experience, and Riley became the Lakers' head coach in late 1981 after Westhead clashed with Magic Johnson.\n\nRiley promptly led the Lakers to four championships in the 1980s to begin his incredible career as a coach and executive.\n\nAnd then there's Steve Kerr, the former shooting guard and Phoenix Suns executive who had never coached before he took over at Golden State in 2014. Kerr has led Stephen Curry's Warriors to four championships and six NBA Finals appearances in the past decade.\n\nRedick's arrival ends another unusual offseason coaching search for owner Jeanie Buss, general manager Rob Pelinka and the Lakers, who are hiring their eighth head coach since Phil Jackson's final departure in 2011, and their fourth since James arrived as a free agent in 2018.\n\nLos Angeles needed six weeks to settle on Ham in the summer of 2022, but the longtime assistant coach was dismissed after the Lakers lost to defending champion Denver in the first round of the Western Conference playoffs.\n\nHam led the Lakers to two winning seasons and a victory in the inaugural In-Season Tournament last year, but many fans and observers -- and, clearly, the Lakers' front office -- were not impressed by his leadership or preparation.\n\nDavis memorably said during the playoffs that the Lakers \"have stretches where we don't know what we're doing on both ends of the floor.\n\nThe Lakers hired Ham after firing Frank Vogel, who had been fired exactly 18 months after he won a title in the Florida bubble. Vogel replaced Luke Walton after another long coaching search in which the Lakers were widely reported to have wanted Tyronn Lue, only for a deal to fall apart over issues with money and control.",

They made a brief run at Dan Hurley earlier this month, but he turned down their generous offer and decided to stay at the University of Connecticut.\n\nAll in all, the available head coaching candidates haven't been that attractive. There was a faint hope after the Lakers fired Darvin Ham that Tyronn Lue, who they wanted to hire back in 2019, may become available. But Lue instead agreed to a contract extension to remain with the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Detroit Pistons fired Monty Williams after just one season as their head coach. Williams may not be an elite coach, but he has plenty of experience, and as both an assistant and head coach, he has worked with stars such as Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, Joel Embiid, Devin Booker and Chris Paul.\n\nImmediately, some wondered if the Lakers should or would go after Williams. After all, he had also coached Anthony Davis during his time as the New Orleans Hornets/Pelicans' head coach.\n\nESPN personality Stephen A. Smith urged L.A. to consider him during an episode of \"First Take\" on Wednesday (h/t Lakers Daily).\n\nHowever, NBA insider Shams Charania said on \"The Pat McAfee Show\" that Williams doesn't appear to be a candidate for the Lakers' head coaching gig.\n\nThe Lakers apparently would prefer a head coach who is experienced, and they have reportedly been looking to prioritize Davis over LeBron James during this search. That would make it seem as if they should at least consider Williams as a candidate.\n\nJust three years ago, he did a terrific job with the Phoenix Suns, guiding them to the NBA's best record and an appearance in the NBA Finals. His Pistons had the league's worst record this year at 14-68, but most of that wasn't his fault, as they have arguably the worst roster in pro basketball.\n\nWilliams was a leading candidate for the Lakers' head coaching job in 2019 after Luke Walton left. But he instead decided to go to the Suns, leading to L.A. hiring Frank Vogel, who drove them to the world championship in just his first season on the job.", "source": {"uri": "sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monty Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyronn_Lue", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Tyronn Lue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Darvin Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Connecticut", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Connecticut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devin_Booker", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Devin Booker"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_A._Smith", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stephen A.

Redick will become the 29th head coach in Lakers history and will remain the shortest-tenured head coach in the NBA until the Detroit Pistons and Cleveland Cavaliers hire replacements for Monty Williams and J.B. Bickerstaff.\n\nThe truth is, tenure is not what it used to be. While Redick is a podcaster who has never coached at a level above youth basketball, he's not that far behind many of the current NBA head coaches when it comes to experience. Jordi Fernandez of the Brooklyn Nets an Charles Lee of the Charlotte Hornets are both making their head coaching debuts this season along with Redick. Brian Keefe of the Washington Wizards spent less than one full season as a head coach and Darko Rajakovic of the Toronto Raptors will be entering his second full season.\n\nIn fact, only five teams have coaches who were hired before the start of the pandemic. You've got Gregg Popovich who has been in charge of the Spurs since 1996 and Erik Spoelstra who took over in Miami in 2008. After that there's Steve Kerr who was hired in 2014 and Mike Malone who was hired in 2015. Taylor Jenkins, who went 27-55 last season, has been with the Memphis Grizzlies since 2019.\n\nThat's it. That's the list. Approximately five teams change coaches every single offseason. Fifteen teams have changed head coaches since May 2022. Redick will be the sixth Lakers head coach in the last decade and will be the ninth Lakers head coach to face the Miami Heat in the Erik Spoelstra era.\n\nThe point of all this? It seems unlikely that Redick lasts very long. LeBron James turns 40 this season. He seems like he wants to finish his career in LA, but he has a player option next summer. He could leave to fulfill his dream of playing with his son or just retire to focus on his podcasting.\n\nThe good news for Redick is that it should only take about three years to become one of the longest-tenured coaches in the NBA.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._Bickerstaff", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "J.

As soon as the news broke, people began speculating that the Los Angeles Lakers might want to chat with Williams.\n\nJJ Redick is viewed as the overwhelming favorite to be named the next head coach of the Lakers, but even his ESPN colleague Stephen A. Smith said L.A. \"should look at\" Williams.\n\nFollowing the Lakers' failed pursuit of Dan Hurley, it seemed like a foregone conclusion that Redick would get the job once he was done covering the NBA Finals for ESPN. Nothing has been announced, however, which leaves open the possibility that the Lakers could pivot (again) and reach out to Williams.\n\nWilliams has been a head coach the last five seasons and has 10 years of NBA head coach experience in total. He was also named NBA Coach of the Year just two years ago. Redick has zero NBA coaching experience.\n\nIt seems like the Lakers have been determined to explore all options, so it would hardly be a shock if Williams received consideration from them.", "source": {"uri": "larrybrownsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Larry Brown Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "steve_delvecchio@larrybrownsports.com", "name": "Steve DelVecchio", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monty Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Pistons", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Pistons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footprint_Center", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Footprint Center"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_Magic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orlando Magic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_A._Smith", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Stephen A.

The red chisel-tipped dry erase markers JJ Redick has been using for the Mind the Game podcast, his ode to NBA tacticalia with co-host LeBron James. The first four to nine minutes of every episode serve as a condensed lecture of sorts, wherein Redick explains basketball terminology and diagrams on a whiteboard, breaking down concepts and actions that will be referenced in his conversation with arguably the greatest to ever play the game.\n\nThe podcast's opening prologue is a meditation -- at least, that's what it looks like for Redick, who breaks things down as succinctly as he can. No music, no special effects, just his voice and a fixed camera shot capturing the marker in Redick's hand as it scrawls along. The chisel tip is a versatile tool. Unlike a fine tip marker that has a fixed point of contact, the chisel design allows for varying line thicknesses depending on which part of the tip graces the surface. Redick defaults to the sharp edge of the chisel, trained on precision, when diagramming. But if he's trying to express a lot of action in a small amount of real estate, he'll occasionally Varej\u00e3o the marker's tip, flipping to the broader side that allows for a thicker line. Though from his hand language, it's usually not intentional. He's just excited. (For those curious about the X's and O's of Redick's X's and O's, he draws an X with an initial downward stroke from northwest to southeast, then crosses it with an upward stroke from southwest to northeast, which ironically demonstrates unorthodox mechanics for a right-handed writer with one of the best shooting forms in NBA history. He draws an O counterclockwise -- very conventional.)\n\nIt's clear that this has become Redick's happy place, away from berating the lowness of hot-take culture on water-cooler debate shows, in a space that affords him more than the few seconds he has to offer a fragment of insight before clearing out for Mike Breen on a live-game broadcast. Think of Mind the Game's interludes as a sort of left-brain analog to The Joy of Painting introductions that list all the different colors of paint necessary to follow along, right on the screen. Mike Fratello may forever be the Czar of the Telestrator, but Redick has become the Bob Ross for the terminally basketball-pilled. But Redick's days as Podcaster General may be coming to an end -- at least I'd hope so, for the sake of his sleep schedule.\n\nJust three days after Redick called the Boston Celtics' championship-clinching Game 5 victory over the Dallas Mavericks, the news we were all expecting has been made official: Redick will be the new head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers after signing a four-year contract with the team on Thursday morning, according to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski. Mind the Game might as well have been a fever dream. This is a pivot away from video and toward one of the sloppiest, most spectacular NBA coaching regimes in recent history -- one that has already managed to serve as the backdrop to a petty proxy war among the league's two foremost rumormongers and cast a light on just how much the shadow dealings of newsbreakers and unnamed agents can shape both public opinion and leverage in negotiations.\n\nAs is par for the course in the Buss-Pelinka era, it was a long and winding road to get here. It started with a report from Lakers insider Anthony Irwin on May 18, with sources claiming the Lakers had \"zeroed in\" on Redick as their new head coach. Then came a report in early June from The Athletic's Shams Charania that Redick was the overwhelming front-runner for the job in the lead-up to the NBA Finals. Then we all went on a detour engaging in an entire Dan Hurley news cycle, before landing right where it all began. Irwin called it a done deal less than 24 hours after Game 5. Two days of silence, only to bring us back to what we already accepted in our hearts. Nothing easy, a prophet once said.\n\nRedick -- a 15-year NBA veteran, ESPN pundit-analyst, and groundbreaking sports podcaster -- will become a rookie head coach with no prior coaching experience, save for his role as the volunteer head coach of the fourth-grade boys team at Brooklyn Basketball Academy, where his 9-year-old son, Knox, plays. He had previously been interviewed for head coaching positions with the Charlotte Hornets and the Toronto Raptors, as well as for an assistant coach position on Joe Mazzulla's Boston Celtics -- and those are only the franchises that have made their interest public. \"Six to eight\" teams have contacted Redick with interest in him joining their coaching staff, Redick noted in an appearance on the Pablo Torre Finds Out podcast back in January.\n\nThere is a sense that Redick is chasing a familiar level of immersion that now eludes him. He has become a legitimate media sensation off the sheer breadth and relentlessness of his presence, talking about the NBA from every possible angle across multiple platforms, speaking a language of basketball that much of his audience is nowhere near as fluent in. Where Redick shows the most potential as a future coach is in his rare talent as a communicator: He can talk in the hoop idiom of players, coaches, the media, and analytics. And he's spent the past eight years developing the muscles required to bridge those divides with his ESPN presence and podcasts over the years with Yahoo!, Uninterrupted, The Ringer, Wondery, and his own production company, ThreeFourTwo. Educating the public is a noble crusade, but it's taxing -- especially when he knows there's an arena in which he can be understood completely. \"When you are in a locker room, a coaches meeting, when you're talking to front office people, the basketball intellect is different. The people that have lived it. A part of me, for sure, is like, I got to live that for 15 years, and I miss it,\" Redick told Torre. \"I really like all my jobs. There are parts of all my jobs that I love. The thing that I've found that I maybe love the most is the 15 minutes before a game that I call when we get to meet with each coach.\"\n\nMany have joked about Mind the Game being one long-ass job interview with LeBron, and there are probably a few grains of truth to that, even if James was indeed taking a hands-off approach to the Lakers' coaching search. From the front office perspective, the podcast offers visual assurances that have been rare over LeBron's six seasons with the team. We can't know how Redick would handle the pressure of an elimination game in a playoff series, but for the Lakers brass, it must be revelatory to see LeBron affirm someone's ability to break down the game to an atomic level, to see him consistently nod his head in agreement, and play a supporting role in backing the insight of another authority figure. Perhaps that changes in a relationship dynamic that is less peer-to-peer -- when LeBron actually has to live in a reality where he's taking orders from someone only six months older than him -- but there is a level of respect there that feels like a crucial first step. The Lakers, in ways subtle and not, bemoaned a lack of preparation and accountability from Darvin Ham this past season; given Redick's approach at every stage of his basketball career, it'd be more likely that overpreparation, inflexibility in play design, and inexperience in feeling out the flow of play would be reasons for doubt and worry.\n\nStill, my first reaction to the news was: Why? Not for the Lakers, but for the burgeoning media king. Redick has done incredibly well for himself in just about every respect in his post-playing career. In being precise, prepared, and focused in every endeavor he's taken on, he's changed his public perception completely. People kind of like JJ Redick now. That, in itself, is a miracle. He could spend the next two decades becoming a beloved media figure, emboldening the next generation of basketball media to further his vision of a greater literacy of the game. Instead, he's potentially opting for a new venture that will almost surely invite the kind of scrutiny and vitriol that plagued his college years at Duke. Why? Well, because Redick is a psycho. (His words, not mine, I swear.) It informs the longevity of his career and his occasionally condescending presence on TV and podcasts. The sheer amount of work he puts in affords him the right. \"I think a little crazy is fine,\" Redick told Torre in January. \"What has served me well in life is this balance of being even-keeled but also being a psycho. Sometimes that balance gets out of whack and I've dealt with some consequences because of that.\"\n\nThe very same magnetic pull that made Redick one of the most hated college basketball players of all time is what makes him an archetypal Lakers head coach to project onto -- both glory and downfall. That charisma is what fuels the hilariously premature comparisons to Pat Riley, who led the Lakers to a title as a 36-year-old rookie head coach and made four Finals appearances by the time he was 40. (Riley also had the luxury of fine-tuning his process over the course of three years as an NBA assistant, which Redick notably wouldn't have.)\n\nThe Lakers have had seven different head coaches since Phil Jackson's final departure in 2011; the average stint is 147 games, less than two seasons. No coach in that time has lasted longer than three seasons. It's a job that subsumes the nondescript and humbles the overconfident. You'd have to be a little psycho to take it. Ready or not, Redick was made for this, and all expectations and hyperbole that comes with it. The Lakers are gambling on an unproven talent -- with both sharp edges and broad upside -- in hopes of finding a leader for the long haul. The Celtics had Red Auerbach. The Lakers are staking their future on the Red Expo.", "source": {"uri": "theringer.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Ringer"}, "authors": [{"uri": "danny_chau@theringer.com", "name": "Danny

At the time, remember, the team had fired Luke Walton, were bringing in Anthony Davis to team up with LeBron James and appeared to be the dream job of anyone who might want to coach in the NBA.\n\nThe Lakers very confidently gave Ty Lue a lowball offer, of three years and $18 million, which he rejected and took more money from the Clippers. The Lakers also assumed their fallback option, Monty Williams, would be in place once Lue left. But the Lakers never formally offered a contract to Williams.\n\nSo he rejected L.A. before the Lakers had a chance to pitch him on a contract. Williams took the job as the Suns coach.\n\nIt's been as rocky a few years for Williams as it has been for the Lakers. Williams was fired by the Suns last year, got a record-setting six-year, $78.5 million deal from the Pistons last summer, and was fired one year into the contract on Wednesday.\n\nWilliams does not need to work again, not with more than $65 million still owed to him. But he could get back in the saddle and take over the Lakers team he rejected five years ago. Except it appears neither he nor the Lakers are interested in making another go of things.\n\nThat's the initial word from The Athletic insider Shams Charania, who appeared on the \"Pat McAfee Show\" and pretty much put the kibosh on the possibility of Williams heading to the Lakers.\n\n\"Monty Williams was definitely in play with the Lakers in 2019,\" Charania said. \"They went and hired Frank Vogel. It was really down to Ty Lue, they missed out on Ty Lue, they missed out Monty Williams. There has been interest there in the past, I have not heard -- this just happened with Monty Williams, there have been rumblings that this was possible ... I have not gotten the sense that Monty Williams is in the picture here. But listen, he is a two-time Coach of the Year.\"\n\nAnd Williams is probably not up for taking over a third team in three years, not after two bizarre and topsy-turvy seasons in Phoenix and Detroit.\n\nEven before the firing of Williams became official, one NBA source told Heavy Sports, \"The Lakers are not out there looking to widen their (coaching) search and besides, if anyone is due for a couple of years off, it is Monty Williams. He can afford it.\"\n\nIncreasingly, it looks as though JJ Redick is the primary Lakers candidate, and perhaps now that the Finals are over, his coronation is coming soon. He has gone through the formal interview process and is one of a small pool of remaining possibilities after the team's first choice -- Connecticut's Dan Hurley -- turned them down.\n\nRedick was an NBA player for 15 years. He has a wide gamut of NBA experience, having come into the league as a heralded and cocky lottery pick who was eventually flamed out and was humbled before he rebuilt his career as a top-tier 3-point shooter.\n\nRedick, though, has no coaching experience. He has made his name in his post-playing days with his popular podcast \"The Old Man and the 3,\" which he parlayed into a spot on the ABC/ESPN broadcasting team and another podcast, started in March, with Lakers star LeBron James.\n\nBut that's the breadth of his coaching experience. He has never before coached at any level, not in a head job nor as an assistant. Still, he is the favorite to find himself heading up the team in James' waning NBA years.\n\nThe Lakers, it seems, won't be in a rush to change course for Monty Williams.", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri": "sean_deveney@heavy.com", "name": "Sean Deveney", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monty Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Walton", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Luke Walton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Coach_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Coach of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Vogel", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Frank Vogel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_McAfee", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pat McAfee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Pistons", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Pistons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft_lottery", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft lottery"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "American Broadcasting Company"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Connecticut"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 92}], "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GettyImages-1875763525-e1718823173354.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662595", "eventUri": "eng-9662595", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1686274509803921, "wgt": 172, "relevance": 1}

Williams previously served as head coach of the New Orleans Pelicans and Phoenix Suns, the latter of whom he led to the NBA Finals in 2021 before he was very close to being the head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nBack in 2019, Williams was one of the top candidates the Lakers interviewed, but he would take the Suns job instead and the Lakers would ultimately land on Frank Vogel who led them to the 2020 NBA Championship. Now that Williams is again available, and the Lakers have a head coaching vacancy, it only makes sense that the two would be linked.\n\nBut as it currently stands, that is not the case. Shams Charania of The Athletic appeared on the Pat McAfee Show and said that right now Williams is not in the picture for the Lakers head coach position:\n\n\"Monty Williams was definitely in play with the Lakers in 2019. They went and hired Frank Vogel. It was really down to Ty Lue, they missed out on Ty Lue, they missed out on Monty Williams then they go hire Frank Vogel. There's been interest there in the past. I have not heard, obviously this has just happened with Monty Williams, there's been rumblings that this was possible because of the fact that Trajan Langdon got the autonomy to eat whatever money he needs to do for Monty Williams, it's $65 million. I have not gotten the sense yet that Monty Williams is in the picture here, but he is a two-time Coach of the Year.\"\n\nThe Lakers are deep within their head coach search, and it seems as if they are very close to making a decision, so delaying that even more by bringing in Williams if they feel they have their guy already doesn't make too much sense. Likewise, Williams is now owed $65 million from the Pistons so taking some time away could be the best move for him as he is set financially.\n\nThere is still plenty that can change and the Lakers could surprise some by pursuing Williams at the last second, but for the time being that doesn't look to be the case.\n\nThe favorite to be the next Lakers head coach remains former player and current ESPN analyst JJ Redick, who has no experience at any major level. Nothing has been announced, but Redick's ESPN colleague Jay Williams might have revealed that it is a done deal.\n\nOn a recent episode of 'Get Up,' Williams spoke as if Redick to the Lakers was finished, saying that the team was trying to figure things out with him as a 'first-time head coach' and adding that 'we wish him all the best of luck.' While surely unintentional, Williams may have made it known that the Lakers have made their decision on Redick as the team's next head coach.", "source": {"uri": "s22928.pcdn.co", "dataType": "news", "title": "Lakers Nation"}, "authors": [{"uri": "corey_hansford@s22928.pcdn.co", "name": "Corey Hansford", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monty Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Vogel", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Frank Vogel"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Pistons", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Pistons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans_Pelicans", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans Pelicans"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajan_Langdon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trajan Langdon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Williams_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jay Williams (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Coach_of_the_Year_Award", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Coach of the Year Award"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 25}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 98}], "image": "https://s22928.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Monty-Williams.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662595", "eventUri": "eng-9662595", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2078431372549019, "wgt": 171, "relevance": 1}

Sports reported on Wednesday that the ex-NBA guard Redick could now be a name to watch for the Detroit Pistons' head coaching job. Detroit just fired coach Monty Williams earlier in the day Wednesday, creating an interesting new vacancy.\n\nGoodwill notes that Redick has history with new Pistons lead executive Trajan Langdon. They both went to Duke University and were together on the New Orleans Pelicans from 2019-21 (when Redick was a player in New Orleans and Langdon was the team's general manager). Goodwill also says that Pistons vice chairman Arn Tellem is a known Redick fan.\n\nAll signs still point to Redick becoming the next coach of the Los Angeles Lakers. But the Pistons job suddenly opening up may give Redick something to really think about. While they were the worst team in the NBA this year, Detroit would bring significantly less scrutiny and far lower expectations for a first-time head coach such as Redick. The Lakers have also been known to cheap out on coaches before and didn't even offer that huge of a contract to Dan Hurley. Meanwhile, money doesn't seem to be an issue for the Pistons (whose owner Tom Gores just ate a massive sum to can Williams), so it is possible that Redick could command a more lucrative offer from Detroit.\n\nIf Redick pulls a shocker and ends up taking the Pistons job, it might not be the worst-case scenario for the Lakers either.

Mandatory Credit: Tim Fuller-USA TODAY Sports / Tim Fuller-USA TODAY Sports\n\nOn Wednesday morning, major news broke regarding the Detroit Pistons. One year after signing him to a historic contract, the organzation decided to part ways with Monty Williams.\n\nThe Pistons brought in Williams after a rather successful run with the Phoenix Suns. However, he was not able to create a similar kind of success in Detroit. Along with tying the longest losing streak ever (28), the Pistons had the NBA's worst record this season at 14-68.\n\nWeeks after dismissing general manager Troy Weaver, Detroit now has to fill a vacancy at head coach as well. In a recent story for Yahoo Sports, Vincent Goodwill mentioned a pair of names as possible candidates. Among those brought up was JJ Redick, who has some ties to new President of Basketball Operations Trajan Langdon.\n\nJames Borrego could be a name to watch, league sources told Yahoo Sports, as well as ESPN analyst JJ Redick. Redick is currently a prime candidate for the Lakers job, so it isn't known how much traction Detroit could actually gain.\n\nRedick and Langdon have the Duke connection, and they were in New Orleans when Redick signed there as a free agent before the pandemic-shortened 2019-20 season.\n\nOver the past month, Redick has been heavily connected to the Lakers job. However, a situation like Detroit might be better suited for him. With the Lakers, he'd be expected to turn them into a contender right away. That won't be the case with the Pistons. He'd have a chance to grow as a head coach around a young core that is still ways away from competing for titles.\n\nGiven that Redick also has close connections with LeBron James, Detroit might have their hands full trying to lure the longtime sharpshooter to Detroit.", "source": {"uri": "si.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sports Illustrated"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Pistons", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Pistons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Monty Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Yahoo Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Caesars_Arena", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Little Caesars Arena"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggie_Bullock", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Reggie Bullock"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia_76ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia 76ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Borrego", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "James Borrego"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajan_Langdon", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trajan Langdon"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Suns", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix Suns"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019\u201320_Oklahoma_City_Thunder_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2019\u201320 Oklahoma City Thunder season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Coronavirus"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Blue_Devils_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Duke Blue Devils men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Arts_and_Entertainment/Sports", "label": "dmoz/Business/Arts and Entertainment/Sports", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Youth_and_High_School", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Youth and High School", "wgt": 9}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 97}], "image": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3600,h_2025,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/ImagnImages/mmsport/all_pistons/01j0sqzb5rqgzztseh42.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662595", "eventUri": "eng-9662595", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2018-04-04", "textStart": 0, "textEnd": 11}], "sentiment": 0.192156862745098, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

They made a brief run at Dan Hurley earlier this month, but he turned down their generous offer and decided to stay at the University of Connecticut.\n\nAll in all, the available head coaching candidates haven't been that attractive. There was a faint hope after the Lakers fired Darvin Ham that Tyronn Lue, who they wanted to hire back in 2019, may become available. But Lue instead agreed to a contract extension to remain with the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Detroit Pistons fired Monty Williams after just one season as their head coach. Williams may not be an elite coach, but he has plenty of experience, and as both an assistant and head coach, he has worked with stars such as Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, Joel Embiid, Devin Booker and Chris Paul.\n\nImmediately, some wondered if the Lakers should or would go after Williams. After all, he had also coached Anthony Davis during his time as the New Orleans Hornets/Pelicans' head coach.\n\nESPN personality Stephen A. Smith urged L.A. to consider him during an episode of \"First Take\" on Wednesday (h/t Lakers Daily).\n\n\"I also wanna say this,\" Smith said in reaction to the news of the Pistons firing Williams. \"I know we've been talking a lot about J.J. Redick, but with Monty Williams available, that is a situation that the Los Angeles Lakers should look at, okay? So, I would definitely say that as well. They should look at it.\"\n\nHowever, NBA insider Shams Charania said on \"The Pat McAfee Show\" that Williams doesn't appear to be a candidate for the Lakers' head coaching gig.\n\n\"Monty Williams was definitely in play with the Lakers in 2019. They went and hired Frank Vogel. It was really down to Ty Lue, they missed out on Ty Lue, they missed out on Monty Williams then they go hire Frank Vogel. There's been interest there in the past. I have not heard, obviously this has just happened with Monty Williams, there's been rumblings that this was possible because of the fact that Trajan Langdon got the autonomy to eat whatever money he needs to do for Monty Williams, it's $65 million. I have not gotten the sense yet that Monty Williams is in the picture here, but he is a two-time Coach of the Year.\"\n\nThe Lakers apparently would prefer a head coach who is experienced, and they have reportedly been looking to prioritize Davis over LeBron James during this search. That would make it seem as if they should at least consider Williams as a candidate.\n\nJust three years ago, he did a terrific job with the Phoenix Suns, guiding them to the NBA's best record and an appearance in the NBA Finals. His Pistons had the league's worst record this year at 14-68, but most of that wasn't his fault, as they have arguably the worst roster in pro basketball.\n\nWilliams was a leading candidate for the Lakers' head coaching job in 2019 after Luke Walton left.

Redick is currently a prime candidate for the Lakers job, so it isn't known how much traction Detroit could actually gain.\"\n\nHe added that Redick and new team president Trajan Langdon \"have the Duke connection, and they were in New Orleans when Redick signed there as a free agent before the pandemic-shortened 2019-20 season.\"\n\nAdditionally, Detroit vice chairman Arn Tellem is also reportedly \"a fan\" of the former NBA shooting guard.\n\nRedick successfully transitioned from his playing days into the media with several well-regarded podcasts -- including a joint podcast with LeBron James, Mind the Game, which fueled speculation that perhaps Redick with James' coaching candidate of choice -- and his time at ESPN as an analyst and color commentator on the lead NBA broadcast team.\n\nHe doesn't bring any coaching experience to the table, however. Learning on the job with the Lakers is no easy task -- it's one of the highest-profile coaching gigs in professional sports.\n\nWith a younger team like the Pistons -- who are developing around young players like Cade Cunningham, Jaden Ivey, Jalen Duren and Ausar Thompson -- there's inherently less pressure.\n\nNobody expects the Pistons to be a playoff team next season. What is expected, however, is development and steady improvement.\n\nUnder Williams, the team was three games worse last year than they were in the 2022-23 campaign and suffered through an NBA-record 28-game losing streak, both disappointing developments that ultimately led to governor Tom Gores pulling the plug on both Williams and general manager Troy Weaver.\n\nWould Redick right the ship?

So the next step for Redick, per Woj, is to find a suitable staff to help Redick at his first stop as head coach.\n\nNow more than ever, the decisions that he and the organization make for his assistant coaches matter significantly. Based on the early reporting and speculating surrounding the search, here are some of the names linked as potential candidates.\n\n1 James Borrego\n\nJames Borrego, who is currently the associate head coach of the Pelicans and the former head coach of the Hornets, also has experience as an assistant with the Magic and Spurs. He was an assistant for Redick in Orlando during the 2012-13 campaign.\n\nHe was a serious candidate to replace Darvin Ham as head coach of the Lakers. During his time interviewing with Los Angeles, per Dan Woike, he reportedly had fans within the organization:\n\n\"I can say that James Borrego impressed a lot of people this week. I can also say that I think, should JJ Redick get the head coaching job, the Lakers will have significant interest in trying to lure James Borrego for a top assistant position.\"\n\nHe is also a potential option to take over as head coach of the Cavaliers, however, which he would likely accept if offered to him.\n\n2 Sam Cassell\n\nAs a player, Sam Cassell is a former NBA All-Star and three-time NBA Champion. Now an assistant coach, he is coming off win a championship on staff for Joe Mazzulla on the Celtics.\n\nCassell has also served as an assistant coach for the 76ers, Clippers, and Wizards and coached Redick on the Clippers from 2014 until 2017.\n\nHe could potentially get a promotion for Boston, though, with lead assistant Charles Lee now leaving the franchise to become head coach of the Hornets. Cassell is reportedly getting looks from Milwaukee under head coach Doc Rivers, per Stein.\n\n3 Jared Dudley\n\nJared Dudley is an assistant coach for the Dallas Mavericks, who just made an appearance in the NBA Finals.\n\nHe is a longtime former NBA player who played for the Lakers when they won a title in 2020 and became close with the two los Angeles stars during that time, per Marc Stein:\n\n\"As a Lakers player for the final two seasons of his career in 2019-20 and 2020-21, Dudley had strong relationships with both LeBron James and Anthony Davis.\"\n\nDudley and Redick were briefly teammates on the Clippers in 2013-14.\n\n4 Scott Brooks\n\nIf the Lakers are looking to hire someone who already has head coaching experience, Scott Brooks is one obvious candidate. Brooks was a head coach for the Thunder from 2008 until 2015 and then the Wizards from 2016 until 2021. He has since served as an assistant for the Trail Blazers.\n\n5 Rajon Rondo\n\nRajon Rondo, a four-time All-Star and a two-time NBA champion, had two stints playing with LeBron James in Los Angeles. He \"has also been under consideration\" for an assistant coaching position on the Lakers, per Woike.\n\nRondo's potential coaching future was mentioned on the first episode of the \"Mind the Game\" podcast with LeBron and Redick.\n\n6 Greg St. Jean\n\nAnother name to watch is former Mavericks and Suns assistant coach Greg St. Jean, per Woike:\n\n\"Former Lakers assistant coach Greg St. Jean, who worked in Dallas for Jason Kidd two seasons ago and with Frank Vogel in Phoenix last season, is another name commonly mentioned in staffing discussions.\"\n\nSt. Jean was previously a player development coach for the Lakers.\n\n7 Miles Simon\n\nMiles Simon is another name to keep an eye on during the search for assistant coaches.\n\nSimon, who worked for Frank Vogel as an assistant coach on the Suns last season, was previously the head coach for the Lakers' G League affiliate.

Redick as head coach", "body": "J.J. Redick, the former Duke star who made a living as a capable NBA shooting guard over 15 seasons, has agreed to a deal to become the new head coach for the Los Angeles Lakers, a person with knowledge of the hire told USA TODAY Sports on Thursday.\n\nThe person requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly until the Lakers made an official announcement.\n\nRedick, 39, has no coaching experience, joining a short list of former players who have moved into the coaching ranks without any prior experience. Jason Kidd moved from player to coach quickly, retiring as a player in June 2013 and taking the Nets job less than two weeks later. Steve Nash retired in 2014 and became the Nets' head coach in 2020, lasting just two-plus seasons.\n\nRedick's basketball acumen is well known, from his days as a player and then as an analyst for ESPN/ABC and on the Xs and Os-centric \"Mind the Game\" podcast with LeBron James.\n\nBut his absence of coaching experience - for the Lakers' franchise in particular - is a major part of the story.\n\nHe takes over a team that finished 47-35 this season and lost to the Denver Nuggets in the first round of the Western Conference playoffs. With LeBron James and Anthony Davis, the Lakers maintain championship aspirations.\n\nHow he fares will be watched with scrutiny. He brings knowledge and understanding of the modern game and player, and he has played for strong minds: Stan Van Gundy with Orlando, where he was drafted 11th in 2006; Doc Rivers with the Los Angeles Clippers; Brett Brown with Philadelphia.\n\nRedick replaces Darvin Ham, who the Lakers fired May 3 after two seasons, and becomes the 29th coach in franchise history.\n\nRedick averaged 12.8 points and shot 41.5% on 3-pointers in 15 seasons and averaged a career-high 18.1 points for Philadelphia in 2018-19. In 2015-16, he led the league in 3-point shooting percentage (47.5%).", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Blue_Devils_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Duke Blue Devils men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_guard", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Shooting guard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA_Today", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "USA Today"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Nash", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Steve Nash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Kidd", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jason Kidd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Darvin Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Van_Gundy", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stan Van Gundy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doc_Rivers", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Doc Rivers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Brown", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Brett Brown"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Ten Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Clippers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Clippers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Soccer/Coaching", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662595", "eventUri": "eng-9662595", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-03", "textStart": 1612, "textEnd": 1617}, {"amb": false, "date": "2013-06-", "textStart": 601, "textEnd": 610}], "sentiment": 0.06666666666666665, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

Why Lakers believe former NBA player has potential of legendary head coach", "body": "After plenty of rumors and speculation, JJ Redick has been tabbed as the next head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers, per ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski.\n\nRedick, 39, retired from the NBA in 2021 and becomes the Lakers leading voice after spending three seasons in the media as a podcaster and an analyst for ESPN's basketball coverage. And while the leap from the media into coaching isn't unprecedented, a leap of Redick's magnitude is quite rare.\n\nWith Redick set to lead one of the biggest franchises in professional sports, it's hard not to draw parallels to Pat Riley, who jumped from broadcasting to become one of the greatest coaches and executives in NBA history. Like Redick, Riley's coaching career began with the Lakers, but there are some fundamental differences in their paths.\n\nHere's how Redick's foray into coaching compares to and contrasts with Riley's.\n\nMORE: A complete timeline of LeBron James' head coaches\n\nWhile Riley's standing as one of the greatest coaches in professional sports makes him a lofty comparison, Redick's path into coaching is a great starting point.\n\nRedick is unique in that his time in the media space began before his playing career ended. In 2016, Redick launched a podcast before launching his own media company in 2020 -- over a year before announcing his retirement from the NBA.\n\nAfter retiring in 2021, Redick became an analyst for ESPN, appearing on studio shows before providing color commentary for games. After Doc Rivers' return to coaching in 2024, Redick was moved to ESPN's lead broadcast crew, placing him on the call for the 2024 NBA Finals.\n\nRedick goes from calling games in the NBA Finals to being tasked with leading LeBron James and Anthony Davis to the NBA Finals.\n\nRiley, the seventh overall pick in the 1967 NBA Draft, enjoyed a nine-year career before retiring in 1976. After a year away, Riley was hired as a broadcaster for the Lakers, with whom he spent five seasons as a player.\n\nAfter beginning the 1979-80 seasons in a broadcasting role, Riley was hired as an assistant coach with the Lakers as part of the fallout from a coaching shuffle that saw Paul Westhead promoted to head coach to take over for Jack McKinney, who nearly died in a bicycle accident.\n\nRiley would spend two full seasons as an assistant coach before Westhead was fired, prompting owner Jerry Buss to promote Riley to interim head coach after a bizarre dynamic with Jerry West, who did not want head coach duties.\n\nMORE: Did Lakers owner Jerry Buss really hire two head coaches?\n\nDespite taking over 11 games into the season, 36-year-old Riley led the Lakers to an NBA title in his first season as head coach. He would lead the franchise to three more titles in the decade before moving on to New York in 1991 and Miami in 1995.\n\nRiley led the Heat to their first-ever NBA title in 2006 and is entering his 30th season as an executive with the franchise.\n\nMORE: What LeBron James has said about his future as a Laker\n\nRedick and Riley played under Hall of Fame head coaches at blue blood universities: Duke's Mike Krzyzewski and Kentucky's Adolph Rupp. After fruitful college careers, both were first-round picks in the NBA Draft and enjoyed successful careers as complementary players alongside stars.\n\nIn addition to playing under legendary coaches in college and fortifying their knowledge of the game during their NBA careers, both Redick and Riley put their basketball IQ on full display while in the media before using their voice as head coaches.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Riley", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pat Riley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Wojnarowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adrian Wojnarowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Buss", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jerry Buss"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Westhead", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Paul Westhead"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doc_Rivers", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Doc Rivers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_commentator", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Color commentator"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_McKinney_(basketball)", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jack McKinney (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolph_Rupp", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Adolph Rupp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_West", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jerry West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New York (state)"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naismith_Memorial_Basketball_Hall_of_Fame", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Krzyzewski", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mike Krzyzewski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kentucky"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 33}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 26}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 42}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 56}], "image": "https://ng-sportingnews.com/s3/files/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-06/Pat%20Riley%20and%20JJ%20Redick%20060524.jpeg?itok=Nr-26Gmk", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662595", "eventUri": "eng-9662595", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2392156862745098, "wgt": 167, "relevance": 1}

With that in mind, former NBA star, Carmelo Anthony, shared a hilarious NSFW story about Redick's time playing with Kobe Bryant for Team USA.\n\nAlmost every NBA star who played in the early 2000s has a Kobe Bryant story. However, this one from Carmelo Anthony is excellent timing considering the ongoing JJ Redick-Lakers rumors. And based on this story, Bryant was not a fan of Redick thanks to Mike Krzyzewski hyping up the former Duke star.\n\nDuring a segment on the 7PM in Brooklyn podcast, Anthony claims that Bryant took Redick's praising \"personal.\" As a result, the Lakers legend made JJ Redick's life hell during Team USA practice.\n\n\"[Kobe] got tired of Coach K talking about JJ Redick [in Team USA tryouts]. Kob took it very, very personal... I'm like, 'Damn why you treating the young boy like that?' [He like], 'F*** that m***********.'\"\n\nThis is just another classic Kobe Bryant story. There's a reason he's considered one of the best players of all time. He carried a similar mentality Michael Jordan had on the court. The Lakers legend ended his career averaging 25.0 points, 5.2 rebounds, and 4.7 assists per game. Bryant also won five championships all with LA.\n\nThis is an important hiring decision for the Lakers. It's been a rough go for several years now as the franchise has essentially played musical chairs with different head coaches. But the front office has a chance to land someone who can lead the way for Los Angeles for years to come. But the franchise must also give that coaching candidate a chance to build a winning team.\n\nJJ Redick is very much still involved in Lakers head coaching rumors. However, a new candidate may have emerged after the Detroit Pistons shockingly fired Monty Williams. At the very least, Williams should be given a look before Los Angeles makes a final decision.\n\nWhen it comes down to it, LA needs someone who can coach superstar talent and handle the constant \"win-now\" pressure. Although Redick doesn't have any coaching experience, his smarts as a player should translate well as a coach. Meanwhile, Monty Williams has been a winning coach before and is considered a great coach despite being let go by the Pistons.\n\nIt'll be interesting to see what the Lakers ultimately decide to do. On top of needing a new head coach, the roster needs to improve all around as well. If Los Angeles can make the right moves this offseason they could be right back on top of the Western Conference. If not, it could set the franchise back another several years.", "source": {"uri": "clutchpoints.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ClutchPoints"}, "authors": [{"uri": "benedetto_vitale@clutchpoints.com", "name": "Benedetto Vitale", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmelo_Anthony", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Carmelo Anthony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe_Bryant", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kobe Bryant"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Krzyzewski", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mike Krzyzewski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Blue_Devils_men's_basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Duke Blue Devils men's basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Brooklyn"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Monty Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kobe"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kobe"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "Japan"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Pistons", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Pistons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Ten_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Big Ten Conference"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 21}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 30}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 91}], "image": "https://wp.clutchpoints.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Carmelo-Anthony-tells-NSFW-Kobe-Bryant-JJ-Redick-story-amid-coaching-sear.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662595", "eventUri": "eng-9662595", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2862745098039217, "wgt": 166, "relevance": 1}

In addition to the tricky dynamic of a coach and player regularly podcasting together, there are no known active NBA head coaches who double as a podcast host.\n\nThe last episode of \"Mind The Game\" -- an NBA Finals preview -- was published on Wednesday, June 5. On June 11, the podcast posted on its social media channels that it would not be publishing a new episode.\n\nBased on reporting on Redick's hire, he was going through his interview process while also calling the NBA Finals on ABC, likely leaving very little time to record a podcast with James.\n\nJames and Redick's approach to the podcast during the interview process could provide a glimpse of what is to come as Redick's meticulous approach to strategy and preparation could prevent him from fully focusing on his podcasting endeavors, including his podcast with James.\n\nMORE: Did JJ Redick and LeBron's podcast play a role in Lakers head coach hiring?\n\nRetired 21-year NBA veteran Udonis Haslem, who spent four years as James' teammate with the Heat, expressed concern about a potential Redick hire in Los Angeles, saying players may side-eye Redick's coaching because of his relationship with James.\n\nIf nothing else, the duo could elect to put a pause on the podcast to fully focus on the upcoming season, should James elect to remain with the Lakers.

But he rarely got a chance to strut his generally unheralded stuff on the big stage as the Bucks, Clippers and 76ers - his employers from 2013-19 - never made it out of the second round of the playoffs.\n\nEarlier this month, Redick finally got his shot at the bright lights. Only this time as a broadcaster.\n\nUnfortunately, it came in the role of Wyman - fully prepared to play off the greatness of Mike Breen, but relegated to the third seat as Doris Burke often got first crack at the analysis.\n\nSo what did we learn about Redick as the Celtics dominated the NBA Finals? Very little.\n\nWe learned he had become the most likely to ascend to the throne as Lakers head coach, only to disappear into rumor oblivion as Dan Hurley got the big bucks thrown his way.\n\nAlas, in a classic case of you can't always get what you want, the man who has taken Connecticut to the top of the college basketball world said no. That handed the mic back to Redick for a second chance at a first impression.\n\nInstead, we had to hear Burke explaining how Jayson Tatum was unselfishly doing all the little things ... while leading the Celtics in shot attempts, 3-point misses and turnovers.\n\nSo while we didn't really get to know Redick, what we did find out was there are some very qualified analysts out there who believe he'll be great as LeBron's new puppet.\n\nSteve Kerr, who made a similar transition from TV commentator to first-time head coach, believes Redick could follow in his championship footsteps ... if he hires the right assistant coaches.\n\nAnd Doc Rivers, who coached the Magic into the postseason in three of his first four seasons, thinks a sharp guy like Redick could easily tame the Lakers' wild horses with some bold new ideas, as Rivers did in Orlando.\n\nIs there any reason to believe Redick couldn't have the same level of early success as Ime Udoka enjoyed last season with the vastly improved Rockets and that Joe Mazzulla has had with the Celtics, Mark Daigneault with the Thunder and Chris Finch with the Timberwolves?\n\nOr that the Lakers would be foolish to head down Retread Row as the Suns (Frank Vogel), Pistons (Monty Williams, Dwane Casey), Kings (Alvin Gentry), Pelicans (Stan Van Gundy), Hawks (Nate McMillan), Bucks (Mike Budenholzer) and Wizards (Scott Brooks) have done - and quickly regretted - in recent years?\n\nHeck, the Lakers have been here before. They had a shot at Udoka, with no head-coaching experience, in 2019. Three years later, he coached the Celtics to the NBA Finals in his first season.\n\nInstead, they went with Vogel, who did the seemingly impossible - he directed a LeBron-led team to a 49-loss season within three years.\n\nDespite what you might not have heard on ABC, Redick checks almost every box. He's thrilled fans at Duke, complemented superstar partners in the NBA, and said all the right things to impress some of the harshest critics in the world - TV executives.\n\nAll the boxes except one ... head-coaching experience, for which Kerr has already recommended a solution.\n\nHe probably should have added: Just don't hire Keith Richards.", "source": {"uri": "deadspin.com", "dataType":

Redick is reportedly joining the Los Angeles Lakers as a first-time head coach on a four-year deal worth about $8 million annually. Apparently the lure of L.A. was enough for the 39-year-old to push pause on his podcasts.\n\nWho can blame him? It is a prestigious job. I will not pretend to know how quality a coach he will be.\n\nAs a basketball situation, the Lakers leave plenty to be desired. I am not saying James will sign elsewhere in July. Redick surely has some level of understanding that James will be sporting purple and gold when the NBA's 2024-25 campaign begins, but even then the rookie coach is assuming a combustible position.\n\nFor the second straight season, the Lakers required a play-in tournament victory to qualify for the playoffs, where they were worked by Nikola Joki\u0107's Denver Nuggets, most recently in the first round. Over the past three seasons, spanning coaches Frank Vogel and Darvin Ham, the Lakers are 123-123.\n\nThey are a good basketball team. Not a great team. And there is not a whole lot of room to get better.\n\nThis is the reality when your team is built on a 40-year-old foundation. As great as James still is -- he made the All-NBA third team this season -- there are limitations to the load he can carry, particularly on defense, and those limitations lower the team's ceiling. They just do. Prime LeBron James is not scrapping to make the playoffs, even in a loaded Western Conference. We all know this. We just do not say it out loud.\n\nThe Lakers still feature Anthony Davis, a monster on their 2020 NBA championship run. He is 31 years old and just enjoyed the healthiest season of his career, good for the All-NBA second team and All-Defensive first team. That is a premium building block, and Redick will hope his defensive anchor can stay healthy.\n\nThat anchor is still tied to more than $50 million for a 40-year-old. Again: I am not saying that James is weighing down the Lakers, but he is no longer elevating them into contention as their primary option.\n\nThe Lakers finally have some wiggle room to improve their roster. They have a number of mid-tier contracts, including Austin Reaves, along with a trio of first-round draft picks, that can get their foot in the door for the next available star. But who is that player? Trae Young? Zach LaVine? Brandon Ingram? Jimmy Butler or DeMar DeRozan, both of whom turn 35 years old over the summer? Anyone better -- Cleveland Cavaliers guard Donovan Mitchell, for example -- would cost more than the Lakers can offer.\n\nDo any of those names move the Lakers into serious contention? Not in a West that boasts Joki\u0107, Luka Don\u010di\u0107, Anthony Edwards and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. It does not matter how good a coach Redick is.\n\nA third star also severely restricts the Lakers' ability to build out the roster. They relied heavily on D'Angelo Russell, Rui Hachimura, Taurean Prince and Spencer Dinwiddie. After witnessing the depth of the Boston Celtics in the NBA Finals, does anyone feel good about the Lakers' lineup? Remember, some of them might need to be dealt for said third star, too, if not Reaves. Good luck rounding out the roster when your three stars are eating the entire salary cap and the cupboard of tradable assets has run dry.\n\nThis is what happens with LeBron-led teams. They rightfully exhaust every available option to build a champion around him, and the Lakers did -- four years ago. They are still paying for it. They cleared their cache of prospects, including Brandon Ingram and Josh Hart, and a handful of draft picks, including their 2025 first-round selection, to acquire Davis. It worked, but there is no rising talent to contribute on fixed salaries. Chasing Russell Westbrook also cost them their 2027 first-round pick, just to shed his salary.\n\nThis system has always been a short-term one. Once the well ran dry on the Cleveland Cavaliers, James bolted in 2010 and 2018. He did the same to the Miami Heat in 2014. It was his right. It also left those franchises in years-long rebuilding processes, which is where Redick will find himself if LeBron leaves.\n\nIf he stays, we might discover what trouble he could have run into by remaining in Cleveland or Miami. Next season, remarkably, will be James' seventh in Los Angeles. The short-term is even shorter-term, now that he will be 40 years old, and there are few avenues to improve. They are counting on Redick as one.\n\nAnd we know the expectations that come with these short-term windows. Ask Vogel, who won a championship in L.A. Seven of James' nine previous coaches have been fired. The other two? James tried to get Erik Spoelstra replaced, and he left Tyronn Lue in Cleveland. This is what Redick is walking into.\n\nThe checks will cash, though. But his podcast partnership with James may have an expiration date.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Mandatory Credit: Elaine Cromie, Detroit Free Press\n\nThe Detroit Pistons made the somewhat surprising decision to fire head coach Monty Williams on Wednesday, and the move could have a wide-reaching impact.\n\nShortly after the news surfaced that the Pistons have parted ways with Williams, a report claimed the team has strong interest in New Orleans Pelicans assistant coach James Borrego. However, a far more interesting candidate was viewed as the favorite to be named the next head coach in Detroit as of Thursday.\n\nAccording to odds from BetOnling.ag and several other sportsbooks, JJ Redick is the favorite to land the Pistons job at 4/1. Borrego is just behind him at 5/1.\n\nRedick has a history with new Pistons lead executive Trajan Langdon. The two went to Duke University and were together on the New Orleans Pelicans from 2019-21 (when Redick was a player in New Orleans and Langdon was the team's general manager). A report on Wednesday also claimed Pistons vice chairman Arn Tellem is a known Redick fan.\n\nThere has been talk for weeks that the Los Angeles Lakers plan to hire Reddick as their head coach. Following a failed pursuit of UConn's Dan Hurley, many have assumed it is only a matter of time before Reddick gets the job. Reddick had been working as an analyst for ESPN, but the NBA Finals are now offer and there has been no announcement from the Lakers.\n\nSome have wondered if the Lakers could pivot to a new candidate at this point in their search.

With Hurley out of the picture, Redick instantly became the front-runner, and reports began to surface Tuesday morning that an agreement was in place.\n\n[Inside Dan Hurley's decision to return to UConn]\n\nThe instantaneous thought from most has been this: With no previous coaching experience for Redick, who opted for a career in broadcasting following his retirement from the NBA in 2021, how can we properly judge him as a coach? Plus, the bigger question: Can a 39-year-old Redick handle LeBron James, Anthony Davis & Co., and will the current players respect a guy who they went up against not too long ago?\n\nIf there's anybody who can provide an in-depth perspective on that, it's Mike Krzyzewski. The Hall of Famer coached Redick for four years at Duke, and coached James during Team USA's gold medal runs at the 2008 and 2012 Summer Olympics.\n\n\"Make no mistake about it, he can coach,\" the 77-year-old Krzyzewski told FOX Sports in an exclusive Zoom interview from the office that he still occupies at Duke. \"He wants to win so badly, but he backs it up. JJ prepared as well as anybody that I ever coached.\"\n\nThe ironic layer to the entire situation is that Redick has just started a weekly podcast with James titled \"Mind the Game.\" How will Redick manage coaching someone who's currently his podcast co-host?\n\n\"LeBron and JJ are friends. It's not just about being friends though,\" Krzyzewski said. \"You have to be partners in this, and here's what I know: LeBron wants to win. JJ wants to win. It's a matter of them and the people they're with to work that out.\"\n\nRedick and James did not record a podcast last week, which added fuel to the notion that Redick would soon be named the Lakers' next head coach.\n\n*** *** ***\n\nKrzyzewski and his then assistant coach Chris Collins, who since leaving Duke in 2013 has led Northwestern to its only three NCAA Tournament appearances in program history, including back-to-back trips the past two years and a win this season, knew the moment they showed up to Redick's hometown of Roanoke, Virginia, that he was special.\n\nRedick was a Cave Spring High School product and 2002 McDonald's All-American Game MVP. But as much of a star as the eventual Duke all-time leading scorer was, Redick came from humble beginnings as the son of Jeanie and Ken, two avid potters, and one of five kids. He has two older twin sisters, Catie and Alyssa, who played basketball at Campbell University and gave him his nickname by repeating his original nickname of \"J.\" His younger brother David played football at Marshall, while his youngest sister Abigail played basketball at Virginia Tech and Drexel.\n\n\"His parents are first-class people,\" Collins, who maintains a strong friendship with Redick, told FOX Sports via phone interview. \"It's wild because when we went up to do the home visit, they lived in a house on a mountain and there weren't any street names. When they were describing to us how to get there, this was before GPS systems. They're like, 'when you see the big boulder, take a right and go three quarters of a mile, then there will be a road to your left.' So we were up in the mountains, and his parents are just awesome people.\n\n\"They have the five kids, a little gravel backyard where they had their basketball hoop, and it was cool to meet them because they were so genuine. They were very humble people from the start, and very into their faith -- very faithful people. You had a family of five kids and really great parents. He was brought up in such a great, loving home, so it was no mistake why he was the kind of guy he was.\"\n\nRedick came to Durham and wasted no time making an impact, averaging more than 15 points per game as a freshman and scoring 30 to lift Duke past NC State in the ACC Tournament Championship Game. It was after his sophomore season, though, following Duke's run to the national semifinal, that Redick took his game to another stratosphere.\n\n\"The big thing with him was after his sophomore year. He would tell you that was the turning point of his career,\" Collins said. \"He had a good sophomore year, and we went to the 2004 Final Four, but we lost to UConn in the semifinals. They had (Ben) Gordon and (Emeka) Okafor, and all of those guys. We had a great team with Luol Deng, Shelden Williams, JJ, and Chris Duhon was a senior. But we lost in the semifinals and JJ had a turnover late in the game.\n\n\"At the end of the season, he was struggling with a lot of things because he had played well, but there was a lot of pressure on him. That's when he became so detail-oriented with his workouts and with what he is now, with who he became as a pro and even with who he's become as a broadcaster. I see him with his preparation for his broadcasts and his podcasts. I think that summer following his sophomore year of college was the most pivotal moment of his career because he made an unbelievable commitment to being great in everything: nutrition, rest, his workouts, his attention to detail and more. That junior year, he went from being really good as a freshman and sophomore to being national player of the year quality as a junior and senior, and being the JJ Redick he became.\"\n\nWho Redick became was a two-time consensus first-team All-American, averaging 21.8 PPG as a junior to a whopping 26.8 PPG as a senior, shooting 52% from the floor and 42% from beyond the arc in his final season, all while serving as a captain in those last two campaigns and earning ACC Player of the Year honors in each of them.\n\n\"From the very beginning, he was special,\" said Mike Cragg, former senior associate athletics director at Duke and a man who spent more than three decades at the school. \"He came in special, but he also had to work hard for it to get to that outstanding level that he reached. At Duke, it takes a commitment to play for Coach K, and he embodied everything about it throughout his career as much as any Duke great. He played during an era as well where he was hated as much as any player we had. So, he had to overcome those personal vendettas of playing at Duke and being that guy. And he not only overcame it. He thrived in it.\"\n\n*** *** ***\n\nThe villainous reputation Redick had at Duke, and the way he handled it, is a great lens that shows his maturity at a young age. He did not let the negative noise or narratives surrounding him as the enemy to opposing fan bases get in the way of his success. That led to him being selected No. 11 overall by the Orlando Magic in the 2006 NBA Draft and playing 15 years in the league.\n\nIf there's anyone who knows how to get into Redick's head and fire him up, it's Collins, who was an assistant under Krzyzewski from 2000-2013 and is the son of four-time NBA All-Star and 2016 College Basketball Hall of Fame inductee Doug Collins. The Northwestern head coach recalled a moment from Redick that he said \"speaks to his toughness and who he is.\" It came in the ACC Championship Game against a tough, physical Boston College team coached by Al Skinner. Collins said the Eagles' players were being rough with Redick, trying to get into his head.\n\n\"For whatever reason, he was being a little whiny that day,\" Collins said.\n\nCollins convinced Coach K to take Redick out of the game -- a rarity -- then proceeded to try to make him angry on the bench.\n\n\"Under my breath, I was saying things and doing everything in my power to get him mad,\" Collins said. \"I remember the one thing that really struck him was I told him he was acting like a brat. And, I said: 'you look like a little brat out there.' He exploded on me. He turned at me and started yelling and cursing at me. I said, 'Coach, he's ready to go back in the game.'\"\n\nCollins said Redick went in and nailed three 3-pointers in 90 seconds, finished with 26 points and led Duke to the win.\n\n\"That was one of my all-time favorite stories about his competitiveness and drive, his ability,\" Collins said. \"I think that goes hand in hand with what I'm saying: I think he's going to be really good because his ability to relate to guys will translate.\"\n\nThat relatability with players is something that even a former North Carolina Tar Heel felt when he crossed paths with Redick in the league. In the midst of Redick's six total stops in the NBA, the shortest one came with the Milwaukee Bucks, when he was traded from Orlando ahead of the deadline and in a contract year. In Redick's brief stint, the Bucks were the No. 8 seed in the playoffs and were swept by the Miami Heat in the first round of the playoffs. But it was then Milwaukee rookie John Henson, a 6-foot-9 forward who won two ACC Defensive Player of the Year awards en route to being selected 14th overall in the draft by the Bucks, who was trying to find his way in his rookie season.\n\n\"He came with the Bucks for the last 30 games of the season, and from my standpoint as a rookie, JJ Redick was well into his career when I got into the NBA,\" said Henson, who ended up playing eight years in the league across Milwaukee, Cleveland and Detroit. \"JJ's day-to-day work ethic, demeanor, advice and knowledge was something that really stood out to me. We always used to laugh because he was one of the best shooters I had ever seen, and we had Mike Dunleavy Jr. as well. We always used to laugh and say, 'who's the better shooter?' We would watch, especially as a rookie, and Dunleavy and Redick would work out and make 30 in a row. The tipping scale was JJ's shots were always stationary and Dunleavy was always on the move, so we'd vote Dunleavy. But, that's just how good of a shooter those guys were, and I think that's what makes JJ special as well -- his routine, his consistency.\n\n\"During the playoffs, he got benched by [Scott] Skiles during a playoff series and he was sitting outside the hotel,\" Henson recalled. \"He said, 'Rook, come sit down.' So, I went and sat next to him. He said, 'Keep playing hard. Keep doing the right thing. This isn't necessarily a normal situation NBA-wise.' We had a lot of dysfunction ... but he sat me down and told me to keep my head high and to work hard, to not let it affect me. That advice went a long way for me in my career, and JJ doesn't even know that. I really appreciated that with that aspect, and I learned a lot from him by observing. He was such a leader by his actions, and the way he handled himself stood out to me. He shot before and after games, he was early to the training room every day, early to practice daily and he was just a high-level professional as a player. And he's a great dude. He can hang with the guys, but when it's time to buckle up, he's one of those guys you want to be in the trenches with.\"\n\n*** *** ***\n\nSo, how will Redick, who only ended his playing career four years ago, fit as an NBA head coach? Krzyzewski was pretty candid and even offered a challenge to his former star player.\n\n\"The thing that JJ will have to do as a head coach is to let other people use their talents, and not be a micromanager, but a leader who empowers the people around him,\" Krzyzewski said. \"Basically, to let the people around him do what coaches let JJ do when he was playing.\n\n\"He understands the game, he understands the guys playing the game - where you have empathy for every other player - and he understands people. He develops trusting relationships with people. When he says something, there's no BS. It's the truth. If a player trusts you, and you can tell him the truth the whole time, you're going to have a better player playing for you. He knows the game, he knows how to teach the game and he [will] know how to surround himself with complementary coaches. He's smart enough to know he's not going to do it alone, so you're going to have not just outstanding players, but outstanding assistants. He will build a culture that's conducive to winning and going for it on a day-to-day basis.\"\n\nRedick's competitive nature is even felt away from basketball. For instance, on the golf course, he has put time into his game and somehow found Collins' handicap. So, last week, Redick texted his former assistant coach at Duke because he finally matched his handicap and challenged him to play at the next available moment in their schedules.\n\n\"He wasn't asking how I was doing or about my family. No, he was letting me know that he and I had the same golf handicap,\" Collins said. \"So, I'd like that match to be streamed because big brother always comes out on top. Not many people can get in his head, but I've still got it.\"\n\nRedick has a certain charisma that drives his competitive nature and the investment he pours into relationship-building. In terms of his interests, he has become a big wine connoisseur, with Cragg telling FOX Sports that when he went to Redick's for dinner a couple of years ago, he was quick to bring out the glasses for tastings and share his passion with everybody at the table. (Sidenote: LeBron is also into wine.)\n\nOn the condition of anonymity, one current NBA assistant coach weighed in when asked what he thought of Redick being the head coach of the Lakers.\n\n\"I think he is extremely cerebral. He has a modern approach and eye for the game,\" the assistant said. \"I think he will be good from a game-planning and tactics standpoint, but I think the speed of the game as a coach is overwhelming at first. ... Timeouts, challenges, scheme changes, play calling, substitutions, late game management -- these are all things where you've got to have a strong staff around you to help cover your blind spots. He will also be surprised with the amount of decision-making outside of the games as well -- practice times, walk through versus shoot around, film versus no film?\"\n\nThere will be doubters surrounding Redick. Many people will question a guy who is so closely removed from playing suddenly coaching a man his age and one that he co-hosts a podcast with, LeBron James. And with the Lakers' recent track record of six coaches since Phil Jackson was out in 2011, and none having made it past Year 3, you can argue there could have been better opportunities for Redick, and that he shouldn't have rushed while he's very much enjoying his TV career.\n\nBut as Krzyzewski said, that doubt is never going to depart, and Redick's proven people wrong many times before.\n\n\"I don't say anything to the haters because what they say doesn't make a damn bit of difference,\" Krzyzewski said. \"To think any organization would hire a head coach for glamorous reasons is ridiculous. If we worry about what people say, we'd go nuts. We should only worry internally as competitors, and he's always only worried about himself. Look at the places he's gone as a result. I have no doubt this will be no different.\"", "source": {"uri": "foxsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Mandatory Credit: Peter Casey-USA TODAY Sports / Peter Casey-USA TODAY Sports\n\nA rival of Phoenix Suns are set to bring in a new head coach, according to ESPN insider Adrian Wojnarowski.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers and ESPN broadcaster JJ Redick have reportedly agreed on a four-year deal for him to take over the franchise this afternoon.\n\nRedick, 39, was an undisputed superstar at Duke in college, and enjoyed a fruitful NBA career from 2006-2021.\n\nIn the years since, he has built a following on social media as a podcaster and personality -

Smith Drops Bombshell Candidate For Los Angeles Lakers Head Coaching Vacancy", "body": "In a recent episode of the show \"First Take,\" host Stephen A. Smith suggested a new name for the head coaching position of the Los Angeles Lakers. Smith believes that Monty Williams should \"definitely\" be considered as a candidate for the Lakers' head coaching position. He also noted that despite the hype around JJ Redick, Williams could be a better candidate for the Lakers to consider.\n\n\"I know we've been talking a lot about JJ Reddick, but with Monty Williams available, that is a situation that the Los Angeles Lakers should look at, okay? So I would definitely say that as well. They should look at it.\" Smith said.\n\nSmith expressed his affection for Jeannie Buss, the Lakers owner, and showed his admiration for Rob Pelinka, the general manager, and Kurt Rambis, the basketball adviser. Smith suggested that all three Lakers officials should consider Williams a candidate for the head coaching position.\n\n\"Obviously, Jeannie Buss, you know how much I love Jeannie Buss. I'm rooting for her to find the right person for the job. Respect Rob Pelinka and what he's going to do, you know, and yes, I respect Kurt Rambis too. I was joking around about him earlier, but I respect him too. So listen, they're all going to be a part of the process, and we'll see what happens. And, you know, I think Monty Williams definitely should be a candidate for that job.\" Smith added.\n\nAfter being eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the Denver Nuggets, the Lakers decided to make some changes to improve the team. They started by firing all of the coaches, including head coach Darvin Ham. Following this action, the Lakers began searching for a potential candidate to lead the team in the next season. The first rumored candidate was Redick, possibly due to his podcast with star player LeBron James. The second speculated candidate was Dan Hurley, who later changed his mind and chose to stay with UConn.\n\nAlso Read: New Video Surfaces On Social Media Of Bronny James Working Out With Lakers", "source": {"uri": "totalprosports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Total Pro Sports"}, "authors": [{"uri": "afshan_khan@totalprosports.com", "name": "Afshan Khan", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monty Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_A._Smith", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Stephen A.

Green pointed out that with the NBA draft and free agency approaching, the Lakers need to make a quick decision regarding their head coach position.\n\n\"Monty Williams is now on the free agent market, and I know that the Los Angeles Lakers have been like, I don't know what's going on, but I know something's going to happen fast because you got the draft coming up, you got free agency coming up.\"\n\n\"I know Anthony Davis loved Monty Williams when he played for him at New Orleans. So you ask yourself, should the Lakers consider Monty Williams? And I say, of course, you got to consider him 100%, especially with that tie.\"\n\nGreen highlighted the strong connection between Anthony Davis and Monty Williams from their time together in New Orleans. Davis, who played under Williams when he was the head coach of the Pelicans, reportedly had a positive relationship with him. Green emphasized that this existing rapport could be beneficial for the Lakers, particularly in maximizing Davis's performance and overall team cohesion.\n\nThe suggestion to consider Williams for the Lakers' coaching role isn't new. Notably, Stephen A. Smith has also advocated for the Lakers to explore this option following Williams's departure from the Detroit Pistons. Smith argued that Williams's track record and experience make him a valuable candidate for any team looking to improve its performance.\n\nWilliams's coaching career includes a stint with the Phoenix Suns, where he led the team to the NBA Finals in 2021 and was named NBA Coach of the Year in 2022. Despite a challenging season with the Pistons, his overall coaching pedigree remains impressive. His ability to develop young talent and foster a winning culture could be exactly what the Lakers need to bounce back after a disappointing season.\n\nMoreover, the Lakers have been linked to other potential coaching candidates, including JJ Redick. However, the prospect of bringing in a seasoned coach like Williams could provide the stability and expertise required for a team with championship aspirations.\n\nGiven the urgency of the situation with the draft and free agency on the horizon, making a swift and strategic decision regarding their head coach is crucial for the Lakers.\n\nMonty Williams's availability presents a timely opportunity for the Lakers to secure a coach with a proven track record and a strong connection to one of their star players, Anthony Davis. As Green and Smith suggest, considering Williams could be a pivotal move in the Lakers' quest to return to championship contention.\n\nThank you for being a valued reader of Fadeaway World.

He's a great teammate, a savant on the court and savvy in his off-court business dealings. That doesn't mean he's perfect, though. Much like Michael Jordan, he's had a bad track record when it comes to influencing personnel moves.\n\nThat should be a giant red flag for the Lakers, who have gone down this road many times before during LeBron's six seasons with the team. They have already made one of their two big decisions in June, choosing JJ Redick to be their next head coach. They will also need to decide if they will select Bronny with either the 17th or 55th picks in the draft.\n\nJames' agent Rich Paul has insisted that his star client hasn't influenced the hire and never backed Redick as his preferred candidate. That doesn't pass the sniff test.\n\nFormer Laker Carmelo Anthony once called James the GM of the team, as did Kyrie Irving. Agents have grumbled that players can't get signed to the team without his approval. His former Cavs GM David Griffin once said that \"you're not doing your job if you don't talk to him about players.\"\n\nEvery star has some level of influence on front office decisions, and James is certainly included in that group. But if Rob Pelinka is giving him an oversized role in the decisions, then he's failing in his duty as a steward of the team. Redick may end up being a great coach for the team, and Bronny could be a nice role player. Those would be rare wins on a very spotty LeGM resume.\n\nMORE: Why LeBron James is called LeGM\n\nThe Lakers should learn from their past mistakes. Instead, it looks like history is doomed to repeat itself.\n\nListening to James on personnel decisions has taken the team from a championship roster in 2020 to where they are today. It was he who reportedly wanted the Lakers to trade for Russell Westbrook in 2021 instead of Buddy Hield. Westbrook's Lakers tenure was predictably disastrous. The spacing between the team's three stars was terrible, and James later complained about a lack of shooting on the roster that was mostly his doing.\n\nMORE: Why LeBron James deserves blame as 'Lakers GM' for Russell Westbrook trade\n\nHield would have provided that shooting had the Lakers gone with their gut. He's been one of the highest-volume 3-point shooters in the league and hit 40 percent of his 3s. More importantly, the Lakers would not have needed to trade Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and a first-round pick in order to get him. The asking price for Hield was reportedly Kyle Kuzma and Montrezl Harrell.\n\nJames would have compounded that Westbrook error even further if the Lakers had listened to him again. He was reportedly upset that the team didn't try to pivot off Westbrook and trade their 2027 first-round pick in order to acquire a clearly declining John Wall during the 2022 trade deadline.\n\nThat would have ended even worse than his Westbrook deal. Wall played only 34 games after that date and was quickly out of the league. Instead of pulling the trigger on Wall, the Lakers were able to somewhat salvage that situation, picking up D'Angelo Russell, Jarred Vanderbilt and Malik Beasley down the line and getting the depth pieces necessary to make a Western Conference Finals run.\n\nJames also has not been a particularly good evaluator of coaches. He once tried to get Erik Spoelstra fired in Miami. It's not easy coaching one of his teams -- Redick will be the 10th head coach of his career.\n\nMORE: Is JJ Redick the right person for Lakers head coaching job?\n\nRedick could be in an awkward situation because of his pre-existing relationship with James, according to a long-time veteran and former teammate of the Lakers star, Udonis Haslem.\n\n\"If it's JJ [Redick], it's going to be a cynical locker room,\" Haslem said on ESPN's NBA Today show. \"You're gonna see guys that are gonna say, 'Is coach gonna do a podcast after the game with LeBron?' You gonna have a cynical locker room of guys that are gonna side-eye everything JJ says 'cause they're gonna wonder, 'Is it JJ's message, or LeBron's message?'\"\n\nThe Lakers could further complicate matters by selecting Bronny James later this month in the draft. With apologies to Luis Scola, Patty Mills and Aaron Wiggins, the 55th pick hasn't typically produced rotation players. Using that pick on Bronny would be reasonable. But if the team trades for him or uses their No. 17 pick on him, then it would be nothing short of a disaster.\n\nStanding up to James isn't an easy task, but Pelinka and company get paid a lot of money to do that. They need to do their jobs, or the team needs to find someone else that will.\n\nJust don't ask LeBron for that next recommendation.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Westbrook", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Russell Westbrook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronny_James", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Bronny James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_Hield", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Buddy Hield"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Paul", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rich Paul"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmelo_Anthony", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Carmelo Anthony"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michael Jordan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrie_Irving", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kyrie Irving"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Kuzma", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kyle Kuzma"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pelinka", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Rob Pelinka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montrezl_Harrell", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Montrezl Harrell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentavious_Caldwell-Pope", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kentavious Caldwell-Pope"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D'Angelo_Russell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "D'Angelo Russell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udonis_Haslem", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Udonis Haslem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Spoelstra", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Erik Spoelstra"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wiggins", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Andrew Wiggins"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luis_Scola", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Luis Scola"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patty_Mills", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patty Mills"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Miami"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarred_Vanderbilt", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jarred Vanderbilt"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malik_Beasley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Malik Beasley"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paintball/Teams", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "label": "dmoz/Computers/Robotics/Competitions", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://library.sportingnews.com/styles/twitter_card_120x120/s3/2024-04/GettyImages-2139232995%20%281%29.jpg?itok=T0Ff4IAq", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662595", "eventUri": "eng-9662595", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.1372549019607843, "wgt": 154, "relevance": 1}

After their top target, Connecticut head coach Dan Hurley, turned down their massive six-year, $70 million offer, the Lakers have had to shift their focus to other candidates.\n\nNow, the candidate who's frequently popped up in rumors connected to the team has finally been confirmed as their new hire. Former Sixers guard and current ESPN NBA analyst JJ Redick has agreed to a four-year deal to become the Lakers' head coach, per ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski.\n\nRedick's always been a high-IQ player, and has demonstrated his impressive understanding of the game ever since he's gotten into podcasting and working as an analyst. Taking over as Lakers head coach without any previous assistant experience is obviously a massive gig for someone's very first coaching job, but it's clear how highly he's regarded around the NBA. It'll be interesting to see how he leads the team and what staff L.A. assembles around him.\n\nWhile this hire doesn't really affect the Sixers, it probably cools off the fun (albeit fairly unlikely) theory that LeBron James could potentially head elsewhere in free agency and maybe even land up in Philadelphia. LeBron obviously has a good relationship with Redick, someone he's friends with and they co-host their Mind the Game podcast together.\n\nThe most realistic major target for the Sixers this offseason remains Paul George, and our David Early has all the latest rumors rounded up right here.", "source": {"uri": "libertyballers.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Liberty Ballers"}, "authors": [{"uri": "tom_west@libertyballers.com", "name": "Tom West", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Hurley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dan Hurley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Wojnarowski", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Adrian Wojnarowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_George", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Paul George"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_agent", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Free agent"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Philadelphia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 24}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Bo_8l_8UNJ4-8Xrx6J-uLDh9wtU=/0x0:7090x3545/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25499565/1259096801.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662595", "eventUri": "eng-9662595", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3411764705882352, "wgt": 144, "relevance": 1}

Stephen Curry's honest admission about being LeBron James' teammate for the first time\n\nFor months, there has been speculation on which coach would be better suited to be at the helm of the Los Angeles Lakers. There had been quite a bit of controversy because LeBron James' podcast co-host J.J. Reddick has been mentioned as a potential option. There are many who still claim that James has power within the Lakers organization and that may or may not be true. But making accusations without any credible evidence is potentially damaging for the team. No matter what you think about this situation, there is no doubt that J.J. Reddick is definitely being considered for the job and we just got a new update that is worth sharing with everybody.\n\nIt all happened during of the the Pat McAfee shows, where Anthony Irwin dared to claim that the deal was done. If you wonder what deal he is talking about, it's the alleged hiring of J.J. Reddick as the Los Angeles Lakers coach. But the reality is not as easy as it seems because another insider who was there is The Athletic's Shams Charania. Irwin did mention this on McAfeee: \"I'm hearing it's done. J.J. Reddick is the next coach of the Lakers.\" That is a bold statement because if true, it will be one of the most important news of the year for the team. And it will also increase bullying on LeBron James.\n\nBut Shams Charania has a different take, he said: \"There's not an agreement as far as I know for JJ Redick as of right now. JJ Redick went to LA and had in person meetings with the Lakers' brass. Rob Pelinka and team's ownership. I'm told his meetings were very impressive. As far as where he stands in this process, I've said his status as the front-runner to be the next Lakers coach hasn't change. It hasn't changed now.\" We would love to get some confirmed information on this report because the information is currently all over the place.", "source": {"uri": "marca.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "MARCA"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Stephen Curry"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shams_Charania", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Shams Charania"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_McAfee", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pat McAfee"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pelinka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rob Pelinka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Religious_and_Inspirational", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Religious and Inspirational", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://phantom-marca.unidadeditorial.es/1562dd5a48e87a4db1403e763f749a4b/resize/1200/f/webp/assets/multimedia/imagenes/2024/06/20/17188384006902.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662595", "eventUri": "eng-9662595", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.04313725490196074, "wgt": 143, "relevance": 1}

Most recently, Redick served as an NBA analyst on ESPN, appearing on SportsCenter, Get Up, First Take and as a member of ESPN's NBA broadcast crew.\n\nRedick already has established chemistry with Lakers star LeBron James, as the two co-host the Mind the Game podcast that premiered in March. Across the eight episodes released, they discuss the state of the NBA and pick each other's basketball minds. The analysis they have given while breaking down plays may serve as a preview of the dynamic the two will have with Redick on the sidelines next season.\n\nOthers reportedly considered for the Lakers' job were Chris Quinn, James Borrego and Sam Cassell, all of whom have NBA coaching experience.\n\nRedick's reputation as a sharpshooter is based on his offensive prowess. He is a career 41.5% shooter from 3-point range. One of his best seasons was 2015-16 with the Clippers when he shot a career-best 47.5% from deep. The Clippers lost in the first round to Portland.\n\nRedick made a total of $116.4 million in his career, according to Spotrac.\n\nOver the last decade, former NBA players with little to no coaching experience have assumed head coaching roles with varying results.\n\nFormer Suns star Steve Nash had no prior NBA coaching experience before Brooklyn hired him in 2020. He was subsequently fired seven games into the 2022-23 campaign and went 94-67 during his three seasons. Brooklyn made the playoffs in his first two seasons under Nash and advanced as far as the Eastern Conference semifinals.\n\nFormer Lakers guard Derek Fisher took over as head coach of the New York Knicks also without any NBA coaching experience. His teams went 40-96 during his two seasons, missing the playoffs in both.\n\nJason Kidd has been one of the most successful NBA players without prior experience to transition to coaching. His lone season as Brooklyn's head coach ended with a 44-38 record and a loss in the Eastern Conference semifinals in 2013-14.

He parlayed that into what's now going to be the brief run of the Mind The Game podcast with Lakers star LeBron James.\n\nStill, this is a big gamble by Los Angeles. As much as he may know about the game, Redick has yet to work in any coaching role in the NBA and he's now about to assume one of the league's most demanding jobs.\n\nTwo things were true after the 2023-24 season concluded for the Lakers: It was time for Darvin Ham to go, and not all of the team's failings were on the coaches.\n\nShortly after the team's elimination in the first round of the playoffs, The Athletic's Shams Charania, Jovan Buha and Sam Amick wrote a lengthy postmortem that laid out the frustrations with Ham. His rotations were puzzling at times and he lacked the necessary public relations savvy that's required to be a front-facing figure for such a massive franchise.\n\nThe biggest problem facing the Lakers, however, is that they have a flawed roster oriented around an aging superstar and another who has struggled to stay on the floor in the past. And it's not immediately clear what they can do to significantly improve their championship odds.\n\nJames and Anthony Davis each appeared in 70-plus games and both performed at high levels.\n\nJames averaged 25.7 points, 7.3 rebounds and 8.3 assists, and he shot a career-high 41.0 percent on three-pointers. Davis put up 24.7 points, 12.6 rebounds and 2.3 blocks per contest and was understandably frustrated to get snubbed as a Defensive Player of the Year finalist.\n\nIn order to win an 18th NBA title, the Lakers need their two best players to stay healthy and play like All-Stars. That's exactly what L.A. got and all it resulted in was the seventh seed in the Western Conference and a first-round series in which it routinely unraveled against the reigning champion Denver Nuggets.\n\nSay what you want of Ham, but there's only so much a coach can do to scheme around Austin Reaves and D'Angelo Russell being his third- and fourth-best players in a postseason series against a genuine contender.\n\nMaybe a younger version of James could carry this roster further. He probably had worse supporting casts during his first run with the Cleveland Cavaliers. But he's not that guy anymore. His game has incrementally fallen off.\n\nLooking forward, the concern for the Lakers is they have no guarantees James can stay this productive moving into his age-40 season or that LeBron and AD will combine to miss just 17 games. If either regresses in any way, this franchise is headed for serious trouble next year.\n\nGeneral manager Rob Pelinka will inevitably do something to transform the player personnel, but whatever path he chooses will carry a lot of risk.\n\nESPN's Dave McMenamin reported in January that Los Angeles was already discussing blockbuster moves for a big star, with the Cleveland Cavaliers' Donovan Mitchell and Atlanta Hawks' Trae Young cited as examples.\n\nBeyond mortgaging what's left of the team's draft capital, that kind of deal would likely require giving up Reaves or other reserves of only slightly lesser quality. Building an even more top-heavy squad around James and Davis has already backfired once, and that was before the new collective bargaining agreement made it harder to execute the superteam blueprint.\n\nGoing in a different direction and attempting to strengthen around the margins would allow for Pelinka to utilize his trade assets in addressing multiple concerns. But it feels as though we watched that strategy, too, unfold already prior to the 2023 trade deadline. Pelinka's maneuvering helped propel the Lakers into the Western Conference Finals, where they were still second-best against the Nuggets.\n\nHiring a new coach was Pelinka's first order of business to open the offseason. It won't be his most consequential.", "source": {"uri": "bleacherreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleacher Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joseph_zucker@bleacherreport.com", "name": "Joseph Zucker", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Darvin Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Athletic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "The Athletic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Wojnarowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adrian Wojnarowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Conference_(NBA)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Western Conference (NBA)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_Reaves", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Austin Reaves"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trae_Young", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trae Young"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D'Angelo_Russell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "D'Angelo Russell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pelinka", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rob Pelinka"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donovan_Mitchell", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donovan Mitchell"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Conference_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Conference Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Hawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Hawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denver_Nuggets", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Denver Nuggets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_manager", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "General manager"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trade (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_bargaining", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Collective bargaining"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Professional", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 15}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 14}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://media.bleacherreport.com/image/upload/c_fill,g_faces,w_3800,h_2000,q_95/v1718910332/iemilqqubimshyetlz1q.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662595", "eventUri": "eng-9662595", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.003921568627450966, "wgt": 139, "relevance": 1}

LeBron James and Anthony Davis are also players who have plenty of chances with the ball, so there would need to be some type of adjustment.\n\nFiguring out those adjustments would be a challenge for Redick in his first year as head coach, but Young's post seems to suggest it is only a matter of time before the next offseason headline.", "source": {"uri": "bleacherreport.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Bleacher Report"}, "authors": [{"uri": "scott_polacek@bleacherreport.com", "name": "Scott Polacek", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_play-in_tournament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA play-in tournament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Basketball positions"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Hawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Hawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Atlanta, Georgia"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related_Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Society/Government/Government-Related Organizations", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques_and_Collectibles/Religious_and_Inspirational", "label": "dmoz/Shopping/Antiques and Collectibles/Religious and Inspirational", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball/Pickleball", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Paddleball/Pickleball", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Lost_and_Found", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Pets/Lost and Found", "wgt": 11}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 85}], "image": "https://media.bleacherreport.com/image/upload/c_fill,g_faces,w_3800,h_2000,q_95/v1718914560/xtxyfvrl6k96yibhrdnh.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662595", "eventUri": "eng-9662595", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.08235294117647052, "wgt": 125, "relevance": 1}

Now, he's cautioning the Lakers who are considering hiring his colleague, former NBA center JJ Reddick.\n\n\"This is what I will say about JJ Redick, I think he's a brilliant basketball mind, we got mad respect for him. We got love for him here at this network, I can tell you that much,\" Smith said on ESPN's \"Get Up\" on Wednesday. \"But he is an acquired taste. You understand? I love you JJ, but he's an acquired taste. He's my cup of tea, he ain't everybody's cup of tea.\n\n\"And JJ does not suffer fools much. It's hard for him to tolerate. Well, some people would perceive there being a lot of foolishness from time to time with the Lakers organization.\"\n\nFor weeks, there has been speculation that the Lakers were interested in hiring UConn head coach Dan Hurley. But Hurley turned down an offer a six-year, $70 million offer, saying he belongs with the Huskies.\n\n\"It was obviously tempting,\" Hurley said, via AP. \"The Lakers organization is just incredible, once in a lifetime to be presented with the opportunity to lead one of the most storied franchises in sports. It was a good chance to get to know some amazing people, but in the end there were too many reasons to be here.\"\n\nSince then, Reddick has appeared on Lakers forward LeBron James's podcast \"Mind the Game.\" Many see this as the star's endorsement of the ESPN analyst. Smith claims this has \"offended\" black coaches across the league.\n\nJames doesn't seem to care.

No pressure.)\n\nThe Lakers' search for a new coaching staff, however, is ongoing. The Athletic reported that the recently retired Rajon Rondo is a candidate, as are Dallas Mavericks assistant coach Jared Dudley, Boston Celtics assistant coach Sam Cassell and Portland Trail Blazers assistant coach Scott Brooks.\n\nThese names aren't new. On May 26, Marc Stein of The Stein Line reported that, should Redick land the job, he was expected to target Cassell and Dudley, as well as New Orleans Pelicans assistant coach James Borrego. (Both Borrego and Cassell were also candidates for the head-coaching position.) On May 29, the Los Angeles Times' Dan Woike reported that Cassell, Brooks, Rondo and Dudley were all under consideration, as was Greg St. Jean, who was an assistant coach with the Phoenix Suns last season and had been with the Lakers from 2019 to 2021.\n\nRondo played for the Lakers from 2018 to 2020 and again for the first few months of the 2021-22 season. He and Redick were in the same draft class (2006), and, in Rondo's brief second stint with the Lakers, he was teammates with Dudley. In 2013-14, Dudley and Redick were teammates with the Los Angeles Clippers and Cassell was on the coaching staff. Cassell coached Redick as an assistant under Doc Rivers from 2014 to 2017.\n\nIf Brooks, who was the head coach of the Oklahoma City Thunder from 2008 to 2015 and the Washington Wizards from 2016 to 2021, is on the staff, it will not be the first time that he has helped a first-time head coach make this transition.

According to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, the four-year contract was formally offered to Redick just a few hours ago and he's already begun to assemble his staff.\n\n\"JJ Redick has agreed on a four-year contract to become the next coach of the Los Angeles Lakers. Rob Pelinka offered him the job this morning and Redick's started working on a staff to surround himself with experience,\" wrote Woj. \"Pelinka became sold on Redick's ability to connect with players and his basketball IQ and believes surrounding him with an elite coaching staff will help shorten the learning curve in his first coaching job.\"\n\nRedick is a 15-year NBA veteran who has played for the Magic, Clippers, 76ers, Pelicans, Bucks, and Mavericks. He's well-respected around the league and has earned a reputation for being a basketball genius due to his platform on ESPN, and his podcasts which include 'The Old Man & The Three,' and 'Mind The Game.'\n\nDespite his extensive knowledge of the game, however, Redick has no head coaching experience at any level. Unlike Dan Hurley or James Borrego, Redick does not have any coaching credentials and this assignment with the Lakers will be his first time in this type of role. To say it's a major risk would be an understatement for the Lakers.\n\nFor GM Rob Pelinka, the hope is that Redick's skills as a leader and his ability to connect with the players will offset the growing pains and help Redick get the most out of this team. It won't hurt to bring in a team of experienced professionals to fill out his staff.\n\nOn social media, the reactions were pretty mixed but there are plenty of Lakers fans feeling hopeful about the future.\n\nOthers are much less optimistic and even joked that JJ's tenure will not be any different from the Lakers coaches who came before him... like Darvin Ham, Frank Vogel, and Luka Walton who all only lasted there a few years before getting fired.\n\nNobody knows if Redick, 39, started his podcast with a future coaching job in mind, but many are convinced that its sole purpose was to advertise his knack for the Xs and Os. Clearly, it had an impact on his chance to land this job and now he'll have to prove that it was the right decision.\n\nWhether you love him or hate him, this is a huge opportunity for JJ and it's no secret that the Lakers view him as somebody who can thrive in this role for decades to come. At the very least, he's somebody who can play nice with LeBron James, whose happiness and loyalty are the top priority for the Lakers.\n\nI think the Lakers would have been better off hiring a more experienced and established coach, but after Hurley spurned their offer, Redick was arguably the best man available. With free agency starting in a few months, the Lakers didn't have much longer to wait and now they can begin the process of filling out his coaching staff with some of the best names in the business.\n\nThe important thing going forward for the Lakers is that they give Redick some time to learn on the job so he can coach to his maximum potential without fear of losing his position.\n\nRelated: 8 Best Center Targets For The Los Angeles Lakers\n\nThank you for being a valued reader of Fadeaway World.

Redick was tied to the job for weeks, but Los Angeles made the deal official on Thursday, handing him a lucrative four-year deal.\n\nIt felt like a matter of when, not if, the former 3-point weapon got into coaching. He talked extensively about his desire to do so, and given his documented expertise on the sport, it felt like he was destined to be a head coach in the NBA.\n\nNow, Redick gets a shot at coaching one of the most storied franchises in the league as his first task. It's no easy one, but it's a job that most certainly could be the beginning of a long reign for the former player.\n\nAs Redick gets set to begin his next chapter as a coach, let's revisit his playing days and dissect his career a bit further.\n\nLAKERS HIRE JJ REDICK\n\nRedick was known for his ability to do damage offensively from beyond the arc. He led the NBA in 3-point percentage in 2015-16 with the Clippers, averaging 16.3 points and 2.7 3-pointers per game while converting at a 47.5 percent clip. His highest point-per-game average was 18.1 with the 76ers in 2018-19.\n\nHis 41.5 career 3-point percentage places him 18th in NBA history. That mark is better than known 3-point assassins such as Klay Thompson (41.3 percent) and Ray Allen (40.0 percent).\n\nFor his career, Redick averaged 12.8 points, 2.0 rebounds and 2.0 assists per game. His best seasons came from 2013-20, where he had a seven-year stretch of averaging at least 15.0 points per game.\n\nRedick played NCAA hoops at Duke University. He spent four seasons with the Blue Devils, playing for the team from the 2002-03 season to the 2005-06 campaign.\n\nUnder legendary head coach Mike Krzyzewski, Redick enjoyed an incredibly successful collegiate career. He earned one National Player of the Year award (2006), two ACC Player of the Year awards (2005, 2006), two ACC Tournament MVPs (2005, 2006) and two All-American honors.\n\nThe Blue Devils won three ACC championships with the sharpshooter on the squad, but the team was unable to earn an NCAA title with Redick.\n\nMORE: A complete timeline of LeBron James' head coaches\n\nRedick played for six different teams throughout his 15-year NBA career. The guard began his career in Orlando after he was taken by the Magic with the No. 11 overall pick in the 2006 NBA Draft. He spent the first six-and-a-half seasons with the Magic before being traded to the Bucks.\n\nAfter finishing the 2012-13 season in Milwaukee, Redick was moved to the Clippers, where he spent the next four years of his career. Redick bounced around at the end of his playing days, spending two seasons for the 76ers, one-and-a-half seasons with the Pelicans and a half-season with the Mavericks.\n\nIn his lengthy career in the NBA, Redick never won an NBA championship.\n\nRedick elected to retire on September 21, 2021, after 15 seasons in the league.\n\nThe former NBA guard already had dipped his toes into the media world before officially putting his playing days behind him. He started his own podcast in 2016, becoming the first active NBA player to do so.\n\nAfter retirement, Redick joined ESPN as an on-air analyst before also taking on color commentary duties as a part of ESPN's NBA broadcast team.", "source": {"uri": "sportingnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Sporting News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick",

The Lakers will have a hard time significantly improving a roster that's lost four straight regular-season games and eight of nine playoff contests to Denver since 2023.\n\nOn the other hand, Golden State was in a better financial situation and operated under a more dynasty-friendly collective bargaining agreement. Kerr got Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green in their primes. Redick gets LeBron James months ahead of his 40th birthday and Anthony Davis, who's on the wrong side of 30 with a long injury history.\n\nFinally, there's the pressure. The Warriors won one playoff series -- a first-round win over the Nuggets in 2013 -- in the seven series prior to Kerr's hiring. The Lakers are always in championship-or-bust mode and haven't been patient since the 2020 title.\n\nSign Up for Pikes Peak 5 Game analysis and insights from The Gazette sports staff including columns by Woody Paige and Paul Klee.\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

Featured Local Savings\n\nBoston breaking a tie and becoming the first NBA franchise to 18 championships only amplifies the pressure in Los Angeles.\n\nMonty Williams, fired from Detroit, would've been the better hire for the Lakers.\n\nThe more impactful Western Conference move Thursday was Oklahoma City acquiring Alex Caruso from Chicago. Somehow, Sam Presti's front office kept all of its picks while sending Josh Giddey to Chicago.\n\nCaruso's 30 years old, Giddey's 21, but that's the only aspect working in Chicago's favor.\n\nGiddey's shooting struggles messed up Oklahoma City's offensive spacing and made him relatively unplayable this postseason. Caruso made 40.8% of his 3s on a bad Bulls team. He'll get better looks with the Thunder and will be part of an elite defensive lineup alongside Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Lu Dort, Jalen Williams and Chet Holmgren.\n\nThe Thunder just became an even more challenging matchup for the Nuggets. Heading into next season, Denver's biggest threats remain Minnesota and Oklahoma City. Redick's Lakers might not even be in the second tier with the Mavericks, Suns and Clippers.", "source": {"uri": "gazette.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Colorado Springs Gazette"}, "authors":

The hiring comes nearly two months after the franchise fired Darvin Ham after two seasons.\n\nRedick, who has no prior coaching experience in college or the NBA, played 15 seasons in the league, averaging 12.8 points on 41.3% shooting from deep. The Orlando Magic drafted Redick 11th overall in 2006, three years after the Cleveland Cavaliers selected LeBron James with the No. 1 pick.\n\nRedick and James faced off 35 times in the regular season and playoffs, with the Lakers star holding a 24-11 advantage. James averaged 27.1 points, 8.2 rebounds and 7.7 assists, while the former sharpshooter averaged 12.3 points.\n\nThis will be the fourth time James has a head coach whom he faced as a player. Here's a look back at other players James played against who ended up becoming his head coach.\n\nBefore winning a title with James in 2016, Lue laced up against him 14 times.\n\nTheir first matchup came in James' first Christmas Day game in 2003. James had 34 points in an overtime loss to Orlando, while Lue had 11 points and 2 assists. Lue's highest point total (19) against James came when the guard was with the Atlanta Hawks in December 2005.\n\nOne of James' 77 career 40-point outings came against Lue, when he had 40 points, 9 rebounds and 7 assists in a December 2004 win.\n\nWalton was the man in charge during James' first season in Los Angeles. The Lakers had a promising start before James suffered an injury on Christmas Day in 2018, hampering a campaign that ended without a playoff berth.\n\nWalton didn't have much success against James as a player, never winning consecutive matchups. The two-time NBA champion also never scored double-digit points versus James.\n\nLeBron, on the other hand, averaged 29.2 points, 7.3 rebounds, 7.9 assists and 1.5 steals.\n\nThe 2004 NBA champion only played two seasons after James was drafted. All four matchups took place during the 2004 calendar year, and Ham never exceeded 12 minutes of playing time.\n\nJames had his then-career-high scoring total against Ham on Nov. 26, 2004: 43 points on 68.2% shooting.", "source": {"uri": "espn.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ESPN.com"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Wojnarowski", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Adrian Wojnarowski"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assist_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Assist (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando_Magic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Orlando Magic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(basketball)", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Rebound (basketball)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Cavaliers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cleveland Cavaliers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NBA playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darvin_Ham", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Darvin Ham"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Overtime (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Christmas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orlando,_Florida", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Orlando, Florida"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta_Hawks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Atlanta Hawks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 10}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 12}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Tile_Games/Spectrangle", "label": "dmoz/Games/Tile Games/Spectrangle", "wgt": 13}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 99}], "image": "https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2024%2F0620%2Fr1348336_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662595", "eventUri": "eng-9662595", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "2004-11-26", "textStart": 2155, "textEnd": 2168}, {"amb": false, "date": "2005-12-", "textStart": 1277, "textEnd": 1290}, {"amb": false, "date": "2004-12-", "textStart": 1405, "textEnd": 1418}], "sentiment": 0.09019607843137245, "wgt": 456618670, "relevance": 2}

It involved when Anthony and Bryant were playing for Team USA in preparation for the 2008 Olympics.\n\nRedick was among the players who competed for a roster spot but he did not make it. Anthony said Bryant went after Redick defensively during tryouts like it was Game 7 of the NBA Finals.\n\nIt stemmed from Team USA coach MikeKrzyzewski talking up Redick before the practice. Redick played for Coach K at Duke\n\n\"I remember Kobe couldn't stand JJ Reddick,\" Anthony said. \"The moral of the story, Kobe took it personal against JJ Redick in practice because he got tired of Coach K talking about JJ Redick. Kobe took it very, very personal.\"\n\nBryant, who was killed in a helicopter crash in 2020, made it a nightmare for Redick the entire practice. It just showed how competitive he was during his 20 seasons that led to five championships and one of the greatest careers in league history.\n\nAnthony couldn't help but be impressed.\n\n\"He was running through the screens,\" Anthony said. \"He was denying JJ the ball. He would foul the (expletive) out of JJ. I'm like, 'Damn, why you treating the young boy like that?' ...

Redick as their next head coach continues the trend of former players making jump into coaching.\n\nFormer players like Steve Kerr, Jason Kidd, Steve Nash, Chauncey Billups, Tyronn Lue and Willie Green have found varying levels of success over the years in making the leap, and Redick will try to join their ranks in L.A.\n\nAs we look at the future of former and current NBA players who could one day become head coaches, the list is pretty impressive and expansive.\n\nWe've picked out five former players who could intrigue teams sooner than later for head coaching opportunities, just like Redick did with the Lakers.\n\nJamal Crawford\n\nThe most obvious choice on our list is Crawford, who was a cerebral and valuable role player in the NBA and has transitioned that success to a really promising NBA broadcast career. It wouldn't at all be surprising to see Crawford get interviews soon if he's got interest in coaching, particularly as his basketball acumen continues to be on display with his television work.\n\nLaMarcus Aldridge\n\nAldridge has the unique and envied experience of playing for Gregg Popovich with the San Antonio Spurs. It'd be fascinating to see Aldridge get a chance to coach a team, as we bet his years with Popovich would help tremendously as he schemed out what his basketball team would look like.\n\nUdonis Haslem\n\nHaslem was such an integral part of the Miami Heat's success while he played for the franchise, and his career longevity gave him exposure to great basketball minds like Pat Riley and Eric Spoelstra. While Haslem currently works in the Heat front office, we could very much see an NBA team reaching out to him in the future to talk about a coaching vacancy.\n\nAndre Iguodala Iguodala was one of the main players on those outstanding Golden State Warriors teams under Steve Kerr, and he'd be a very intriguing candidate for an NBA head coaching opportunity. Being able to parlay his time with one of the best basketball teams ever into coaching success feels very plausible. Marc Gasol\n\nGasol has always been one of the towering figures in the game, and we'd love to see what happens if he ever got an opportunity to coach for an NBA team. He's got the championship experience to know what it takes to lead a team to the NBA Finals, and he feels like a very underrated candidate for our list.\n\nMark Cuban is reportedly no longer in charge of the Mavericks' basketball operations side Alex Caruso, Josh Giddey trade grades: Who won the Bulls - Thunder deal? 8 bets for JJ Redick as Lakers head coach, including odds for how long he lasts and what happens with LeBron James", "source": {"uri": "ftw.usatoday.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "For The Win"}, "authors": [{"uri": "cory_woodroof@ftw.usatoday.com", "name": "Cory Woodroof", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamal_Crawford", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Jamal Crawford"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaMarcus_Aldridge", "type": "person", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "LaMarcus Aldridge"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willie_Green", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Willie Green"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udonis_Haslem", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Udonis Haslem"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Nash", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Nash"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Kerr", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Steve Kerr"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chauncey_Billups", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Chauncey Billups"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyronn_Lue", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tyronn Lue"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregg_Popovich", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Gregg Popovich"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Kidd", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Jason Kidd"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre_Iguodala", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Andre Iguodala"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Heat", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Miami Heat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Antonio_Spurs", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "San Antonio Spurs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Riley", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Pat Riley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Cuban", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Mark Cuban"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Mavericks", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Mavericks"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Finals", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NBA Finals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Chicago Bulls"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Gasol", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Marc Gasol"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_State_Warriors", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Golden State Warriors"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LeBron_James", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "LeBron James"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Caruso", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alex Caruso"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 31}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan_Pages", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Fan Pages", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 42}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/History", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Science", "wgt": 32}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 87}], "image": "https://ftw.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/90/2024/05/USATSI_20032146.jpg?w=640", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662595", "eventUri": "eng-9662595", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.5686274509803921, "wgt": 456619347, "relevance": 2}

The organization fired Darvin Ham on May 3 after two seasons.\n\nRedick, who has no prior coaching experience, played in the NBA for 15 seasons (2006-21) and is widely known for his strong 3-point shooting. He embarked on a broadcasting career during his time in the NBA, starting a podcast during the bubble season in 2020 and before becoming part of ESPN's lead broadcasting crew during the 2023-24 season after retiring from his playing career.\n\nThe Charlotte Hornets reportedly considered Redick for a coaching vacancy earlier this offseason.\n\nFOX Sports' Chris Broussard expressed his discontentment with the Lakers' decision to hire Redick on Thursday's edition of \"First Things First,\" saying the organization missed a great opportunity to bring in a better fit.\n\n\"I think they should have looked at Monty Williams,\" Broussard said. \"Other people talked about it and the timing -- if it was a little different. Why? You waited this long, and you would like to have a coach before the draft. But this draft pick for the Lakers is not essential to have a head coach in place.\"\n\nWilliams was most recently the head coach of the Detroit Pistons before being fired after one season.\n\n\"They tried to hire Monty a few years ago before he went to Phoenix,\" Broussard added. \"I know it didn't work out in Detroit. Anthony Davis had a great relationship with Monty Williams when he was in New Orleans ... At least interview him. Consider him. See what he would do with the team before you go out and make this hire.\n\n\"Will he coach LeBron [James]? Cause on the podcast he does push back a little bit. So maybe he would coach LeBron and do what they need, but it's just a complete question mark.\"\n\nNick Wright shared Broussard's sentiment, saying there's a lot of uncertainty about what Redick can do for the Lakers.\n\n\"It would be unfair of me to say JJ Redick is not going to be a good NBA head coach, just like it would be unfair of me to say that he is going to be a good NBA head coach,\" Wright said. \"He is being hired with as thin of a coaching r\u00e9sum\u00e9 as any coach that has ever taken the job in modern NBA history. To [have] never [been] a part of an NBA staff, front office, coach at a big-time high school -- let alone college -- you couldn't have a thinner coaching r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\n\n\"There is nothing to judge it on other than vibes and guess. My biggest concern with JJ is he appears to me to be ... very aware of criticism of himself. I think that can be a real detriment if you're the head coach of a basketball team -- head coach of the Lakers more so than anything.\"\n\n\"Just because you want to do a podcast with a guy, [that] is not, to me, evidence that you want him to be your head coach,\" Wright added when discussing whether it's fair to say that James was in favor of hiring Redick because of their off-court business ventures. \"This idea that they are doing this to please LeBron assumes, 'This is what LeBron wants.' The one piece of info that we do have definitively is [that] when they were interviewing Dan Hurley, LeBron reached out to Dan to tell him he would have his support and his buy-in if he were there.\n\n\"[LeBron] has not chimed in with the Lakers front office. He is staying out of it. We know that he voiced his endorsement to another guy -- the other guy. ... I just think people are assuming that because LeBron likes JJ doing the podcast with him, that he likes that idea of playing for him.\"\n\nJames and Redick host a weekly podcast, \"Mind The Game,\" on James' multimedia platform Uninterrupted, with the first episode being published earlier this year in mid-March.", "source": {"uri": "foxsports.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "FOX Sports"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJ_Redick", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "JJ Redick"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Williams", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Monty Williams"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Broussard", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chris Broussard"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Lakers", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Los Angeles Lakers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_coach", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Head coach"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Basketball Association"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_draft", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NBA draft"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Hurley", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Dan Hurley"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fox Sports"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Hornets", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Charlotte Hornets"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Connecticut", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "University of Connecticut"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-point_field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Three-point field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcast", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Podcast"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "ESPN"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Davis", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Anthony Davis"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_Pistons", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Detroit Pistons"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Phoenix, Arizona"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Detroit"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Basketball"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Health/Alternative/Coaching", "wgt": 38}, {"uri": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "label": "dmoz/Business/Management/Consulting", "wgt": 28}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Basketball/Coaching", "wgt": 41}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cheerleading/Organizations", "wgt": 22}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Cricket/Coaching", "wgt": 23}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 96}], "image": "https://a57.foxsports.com/statics.foxsports.com/www.foxsports.com/content/uploads/2024/06/1408/814/redick-wide.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9662595", "eventUri": "eng-9662595", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "imp": true, "date": "2024-05-03", "textStart": 290, "textEnd": 295}], "sentiment": 0.1686274509803922, "wgt": 456619967, "relevance": 2}

{"id": 225001336, "title": "Teacher stabbed partner to death after he begged for her forgiveness for affair", "text": "A primary school teacher stabbed her partner to death and buried his body in their garden after he declared his love \u201cuntil the day I die\u201d, a court has heard. Fiona Beal, 50, has admitted the murder of 42-year-old Nicholas Billingham, whose partly mummified remains were discovered four and a half months after he was last seen on November 1 2021. She pleaded guilty in April during a retrial at the Old Bailey, after her earlier trial at Northampton Crown Court collapsed on its 64th day. On Wednesday, she appeared at the Old Bailey for the start of her two-day sentencing by Judge Mark Lucraft KC. During the hearing, prosecutor Hugh Davies KC read out a letter Mr Bellingham had written to Beal after he had an affair during their 17-year relationship. In the letter, Mr Billingham accepted his faults and described Beal as \u201ckind hearted\u201d, \u201cgenerous\u201d and \u201cthe most beautiful woman in the world\u201d. He wrote: \u201cI promise to never again belittle you or make you feel rubbish again. \u201cMy body, my heart, my love has been yours since the day I met you and will be until the day I die. I love you with all my heart.\u201d On the day of his death, Mr Billingham had worked on a house renovation before returning to the home he shared with Beal in Northampton. That evening, she killed him in a \u201ccarefully planned domestic execution\u201d, Mr Davies said. Beal stabbed him in the neck and disposed of the body in the side return of their home like \u201cbuilding waste\u201d, Mr Davies said. She covered her tracks with a false story that they had Covid and needed to isolate. Similar messages were sent from Mr Billingham\u2019s phone from November 2 in which Beal pretended to be him. On November 8, Beal sent messages to her sisters saying she and Mr Billingham had split up, with one message saying he left because he had had an affair with another woman. On her return to work, she received sympathy from those who had heard about the apparent break-up. Beal\u2019s mental health started to deteriorate in late February 2022, the court was told. The following month, she rented a cabin in Cumbria and sent messages to family members which gave them cause for concern over her wellbeing, prompting them to call police to check on her. In the cabin, police found Beal\u2019s journals containing a confession to the killing. They also included reference to her having a split personality and an alter ego she called Tulip 22. She wrote: \u201cI had smoked all day. I had a bath, I left the water in. He had been pushing for sex. I encouraged the bath with the incentive of sex afterwards. \u201cWhile he was in the bath I kept the knife in my dressing gown pocket and then I had it in the drawer next to the bed. \u201cI brought a chisel, bin bag and cable ties up too. I got him to wear an eye mask.\u201d She went on: \u201cMy last words to him when he asked why was that he was not going to do to (another female) what he had done to me.\u201d The journals triggered a police investigation, which soon established that Mr Billingham had not been seen or spoken to by telephone since the afternoon of November 1 2021, the court heard. Beal was arrested in March 2022 after police discovered his body. Summarising the evidence, Mr Davies said Beal \u201cplanned to execute\u201d Mr Billingham then \u201cdelivered a false narrative\u201d that he had an affair and had run off and stopped communications. He said she \u201caccepted sympathy\u201d which resulted from her \u201cfalse narrative\u201d and \u201ctook elaborate and sustained steps over a period of weeks to conceal her crime\u201d. They included disposing of his body \u201cas if it was building waste in her garden\u201d, posing as him in communications with his friends, colleagues and family, and even manufactured arguments between him and her. All this was done while she continued \u201cto deliver high-quality teaching to Year 6 pupils as if nothing had happened\u201d, Mr Davies said. Beal even \u201cactively lied\u201d to her partner\u2019s mother when he was supposedly \u201coff grid\u201d with another woman, he added. The original trial collapsed last June when it emerged that a key defence witness was a court custody officer who had conducted welfare checks on Beal in the cells. The sentencing hearing continues and is expected to conclude on Thursday.", "summary": "<p>Beal appeared at the Old Bailey for the start of her two-day sentencing for the murder of Nicholas Billingham.</p>", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/fiona-beal-murder-affair-nicholas-billingham-northampton-old-bailey-b1160825.html", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/2024/04/26/15/26152444-453cdb2c-6966-4891-8002-77f744736381.jpg?width=1200", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-29 12:08:08", "author": "Emily Pennink", "authors": ["Emily Pennink"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.225}

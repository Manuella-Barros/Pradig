Only recently, Joel was revealed to be Lauren Bolton's killer in a huge twist last week. Roy Cropper had initially been wrongly arrested, charged and the number one suspect for the supposed murder of missing teenager Lauren. However, last week, DS Lisa Swain and newcomer Kit thought they had cracked the case as they arrested abuser Nathan Curtis, who previously made Bethany Platt's life a living misery and was recently released from prison. As they interrogated Nathan in the prison cell with Joel acting as his solicitor, a graphic flashback played as it looked like it was Nathan but later in the episode it was revealed in a shock twist that Joel was in fact Lauren's killer. So far, Joel has managed to escape justice and the cobbles' residents are oblivious to his evil ways. However, only recently, the hit ITV soap has dropped a few 'telling' clues which could lead to his downfall... Nathan Curtis On Wednesday's episode, Nathan, who Joel was representing, decided to sack him as his solicitor as he refused to plead guilty. Nathan insisted he was innocent and accused Joel of not listening to him, revealing he had found another solicitor, who had already looked into his case and listened to him. This left Joel feeling threatened. Could Nathan be suspicious of Joel and therefore expose him to the police? Taking to Twitter, now X, one person said: \"Nathan's actually dropped him! He already can see right through joel it's brilliant!! won't be long till he figures out it was him #corrie\" while another added: \"Nathan sacking Joel\u2026 #Corrie\" with shocked emojis. Ellie's revenge Earlier this week, Joel was in a bad mood after partner Dee-Dee Bailey gently rejected his marriage proposal before changing her mind. After the engagement snub, Joel found himself confronted by another one of his victims Ellie, who fans had feared may have suffered the same fate as Lauren. Ellie demanded more money off Joel who warned: \"I told you I didn't want to see you again!\" Ellie asked for \u00a3300 to which Joel told her to \"go and earn it\" before threatening: \"Don't contact me again, out!\" as she rushed out the car. Could Ellie of recorded their conversation and use it to bring the villain down? Taking to Twitter, now X, viewers said of Ellie: \"Don't tell him ya gonna blackmail him, Ellie, he'll kill ya #corrie\", a different account put: \"My guess is she\u2019ll try and blackmail Joel. #Corrie #CoronationStreet\", another wrote: \"#corrie she must know he murdered Lauren at this point, why is she still meeting with him?\" while a different account added: \"Oh dear our dear friend Joel is being blackmailed...\" Bethany Platt's expos\u00e9 Earlier this week, Joel decided to offer Sarah Platt legal advice off record after she found herself caught up in the Nathan drama after plotting to frame him but she never actually went through with it. After telling daughter Bethany of Joel's help, the investigative journalist was left suspicious as she questioned why the solicitor was helping her. Later, in the pub, Joel revealed that Dee-Dee had changed her mind and they were engaged as the couple put on a loved-up display. Sarah was left delighted for the duo but Bethany wasn't impressed as she admitted she had 'spider senses' about Joel as the episode ended with her looking at him suspiciously. Meanwhile, on Friday's episode, Bethany received some post she had redirected from London and was shocked to discover she had been a victim of fraud. Bethany was furious to learn someone had been fraudulently using her old company credit card. Speaking to Daisy Midgeley, the latter encouraged Bethany to obtain copies of the statements in a bid to prove she couldn\u2019t have made the purchases. Later, at the Rovers Return Inn, Joel Deering offered to give free legal advice to Bethany over the credit card and look into it. However, Bethany appeared suspicious of Joel again. Will Bethany uncover the truth and is she in danger? Taking to Twitter, now X, one person said: \"Go on, Bethany, trust your gut. Bring the creep down. #Corrie\", a different account put: \"Bethany sees Joel. She knows. Clever girl. #Corrie\" while another added: \"Ooh Bethany is onto Joel she\u2019ll be bringing him down #Corrie.\" Gail Platt It was announced on Wednesday that Gail star Helen Worth, 73, is leaving her role after a huge five decades and some iconic scenes on the cobbles. Details of what the storyline will be that leads to Gail leaving the soap after decades on screen have not been confirmed, but bosses have teased that it will be \"emotional\" and will no doubt be a fitting departure for a soap legend. There will no doubt be fears she could be killed off, as the storyline will see Gail and actress Helen bid farewell in a \"major storyline\". Helen will depart in scenes at the end of this year, whilst filming has yet to begin for the storyline. It\u2019s no doubt been planned for some time, in time for Gail and Helen\u2019s 50th year on the show. Taking to Twitter, now X, viewers have been quick to speculate on Gail's exit storyline with many predicting it could involve Joel. Soap watchers are now wondering whether Joel will try and target Bethany but in a twist it will involve her grandmother Gail. One person said: \"#Corrie calling it. Gail will die at the hands of Joel. Bethany is already suspicious of Joel. He will go to attack Bethany but will end up killing Gail instead, whether on purpose or incidentally\", a different account put: \"I suppose this Joel storyline is going to run until Christmas where he'll kill off Gail #Corrie\", another wrote: \"It\u2019s only occurred to me when watching #Corrie tonight that Joel will probs have something to do with Gail\u2019s exit\" while a different viewer added: \"I reckon Bethany tells Gail and Gail gets taken out in a fight to the death with Joel.\" Coronation Street airs Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays at 8pm on ITV1 and ITV X.* Follow Mirror Celebs and TV on TikTok , Snapchat , Instagram , Twitter , Facebook , YouTube and Threads.", "summary": "Coronation Street viewers are convinced that Joel Deering's downfall has been 'sealed' after several 'telling' clues recently on the ITV soap", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/itv-coronation-street-joel-deerings-32989676", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article32989790.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Joel-2jpeg.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-06-08 17:27:41", "author": "Olivia Wheeler,Olivia-Wheeler", "authors": ["Olivia Wheeler", "Olivia-Wheeler"], "language": "en", "catgory": "entertainment", "source_country": "GB", "sentiment": -0.64}

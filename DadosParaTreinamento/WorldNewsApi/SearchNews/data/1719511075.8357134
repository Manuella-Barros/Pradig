Officers spotted the VW Golf, understood to be stolen, in the early hours of today. The driver failed to stop for police in Huyton, Merseyside, and so a high-speed chase ensued. In the process of the chase, the driver of the VW Golf crashed into two cars. The pursuit only ended when the car drove into a subway and had \"nowhere left to go\". Pictures shared by Merseyside Police's road policing unit showed officers and detectives surrounding the car stuck inside the subway. The car was unable to get out due to a set of stairs at the end of the underpass. A spokesperson for the force said: \"This VW Golf was stolen in Bolton and failed to stop for patrols in Huyton, colliding with two members of the public\u2019s vehicles in the process. The pursuit ended when the vehicle entered a subway (yes a subway) and had nowhere left to go.\"", "summary": "Two vehicles damaged during pursuit", "url": "https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/driver-car-stolen-greater-manchester-29242236", "image": "https://i2-prod.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/article29242279.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_260524HuytonsubwayJPG.jpg", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 14:50:10", "author": "Neal Keeling,Olivia Williams", "authors": ["Neal Keeling", "Olivia Williams"], "language": "en", "source_country": "gb", "sentiment": -0.84}

The Bengals fell to the Ravens, 34-20. Syndication: The Enquirer\n\nThe NFL is full of rivalries and one of the biggest ones this generation is the Patrick Mahomes-led Chiefs vs the Joe Burrow-led Bengals. Although Burrow has yet to win a Super Bowl, his skill as a QB is almost unmatched, and he is not one to shy away from a showdown with Mahomes. In fact, the quarterback made his fighting spirit quite evident through a recent statement on the New Heights Podcast.\n\nThe Kelce brothers recently welcomed Joe Burrow, his teammate Orlando Brown Jr., and Cardinals QB Desmond Ridder, on the New Heights podcast. While the players initially discussed different aspects of the NFL, the conversation soon turned to the Chiefs-Bengals rivalry.\n\nAlthough the teams have always competed to be the best in the AFC, the Chiefs have reigned supreme to date. While speaking to Burrow, the Kelce brothers spoke about how the rivalry has fostered some brilliant talent among the two teams. To this, Burrow had an interesting answer, as he said,\n\n\"I think we both work really hard at what we do. They have great players we have great players I think we match up pretty well with them. We're kind of built to beat them.\"\n\nThe Bengals QB made it clear that his team is perfectly built to counteract the kind of offense and defense the Chiefs have. Burrow also mentioned how he is always excited to clash with Mahomes on the field. While Burrow's take made his confidence quite evident, Travis Kelce and Orlando Brown Jr. also had interesting points to make about the rivalry.\n\nBurrow wasn't the only one to speak about the Chiefs-Bengals rivalry, as Travis Kelce personally claimed that he loved playing against the Bengals. He appreciated his rivals and mentioned that they have one of the most accomplished defensive squads ever. Furthermore, Kelce also claimed to love the footballing culture the Bengals promote, saying\n\n\"I enjoy it because I love going up against the best man and obviously the Bengals man. You guys got great f*****g coaches great players.\"\n\nTravis Kelce's appreciation for the Bengals is well-placed. They have always showcased themselves as a football-first organization, keeping the game in their mind while performing on the gridiron. This spirit of the game is visible to an opponent, and it certainly is to players within the organization.\n\nOn the other hand, Orlando Brown Jr. approached the topic as a former Chiefs player and paid his respects to both teams. He mentioned how both the Chiefs and the Bengals are fierce in their drive and beyond competitive.\n\nOn top of it, Brown also appreciated both Patrick Mahomes and Joe Burrow. As someone who has played with both QBs, especially at such an important position, the tackle is bound to be familiar with the inner workings of the QB's styles of play.\n\nIn a nutshell, both the Chiefs and Bengals have the utmost respect for each other and cannot wait to clash on the gridiron.

In total, Burrow has missed 16 games due to injury since 2020 -- including seven games to end the 2023 season.\n\nThe Bengals made Burrow the highest-paid player in NFL history in March 2023, when they signed him to a 5-year, $275 million contract extension which pays him an average of $55 million per season.\n\nBurrow's payday was well-earned. The No. 1 overall pick in the 2020 NFL draft out of LSU, Burrow led the Bengals to the Super Bowl in 2021 and back to the AFC Championship Game in 2022.\n\nThe Bengals have also seen the value of their franchise increase exponentially since Burrow was drafted. According to Statista, the Bengals were valued at $2 billion in 2019 -- the year before Burrow was drafted -- and were valued at $3.5 billion in 2023.\n\nWith Burrow out, backup quarterback Jake Browning filled in admirably but the Bengals missed the playoffs for the first time since Burrow's rookie season and finished the season 9-8 -- last place in the AFC North.\n\nWith the return of Burrow, the Bengals have not only their best player back but still have a strong nucleus around him -- LSU teammate and wide receiver Ja'Marr Chase is one of the NFL's best at his position and another standout wide receiver, Tee Higgins, will play on the franchise tag in 2024.\n\nThe Bengals added more offensive help for Burrow in the 2024 NFL draft -- some that will help right away and some that will help down the road.\n\nCincinnati drafted massive Georgia offensive tackle Amarius Mims in the first round (No. 18 overall) but he might start his career playing behind Trent Brown at right tackle.\n\nIn forms of immediate help, the Bengals took Alabama wide receiver Jermaine Burton in the third round (No. 80 overall) -- potentially a plug-and-play starter who dropped in the draft due to off-field concerns.\n\nBurton played his first two seasons at Georgia and won a College Football Playoff national championship there in 2021 before transferring to Alabama. He led the Crimson Tide with 39 receptions for 798 receiving yards and 8 touchdowns in 2023 -- 20.5 yards per catch.\n\n\"Despite sliding a bit due to some off-field concerns, Burton has a three-level skill set with great explosiveness and impressive ball skills,\" wrote PFF's Trevor Sikkema in his post-draft grades. \"He didn't drop any of his 57 targets this past season and could be a solid complement to Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins from Day 1 due to his downfield playmaking ability.\"", "source": {"uri": "heavy.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Heavy"}, "authors": [{"uri":

Burrow hit the field with the team on Monday for workouts following his six-month recovery from wrist surgery.\n\nBurrow suffered a torn scapholunate ligament on his throwing hand on November 16 which required surgery. The former LSU star's recovery timeline had a mid-May goal for his return to the field, so it's great news for the Bengals that he's back this week.\n\nThe team's social media pages shared clips of the franchise quarterback arriving for the day of work in a vivid tie-dye ensemble and also hitting the field with his teammates with the caption: \"It's happening.\" They also posted a video of him throwing the football with quite a bit of zip.\n\nBurrow likely has more weeks of recovery ahead before he's back to 100%. He only began throwing small medicine balls in late February. Luckily, he'll get that time to recover before OTAs. This week's program is strength and conditioning only.\n\nBurrow has taken Cincinnati to great heights in his short time with the Bengals. He boasts a 5-2 record in the playoffs in his career after leading the team to an appearance in Super Bowl LVI in 2022. The Bengals repaid him with a five-year, $275 million contract extension ahead of last season. It made him the highest-paid QB in the league.\n\nThe Bengals missed out on the playoffs last year after finishing the season 9-8 following two consecutive playoff appearances. The only times the team hasn't made the playoffs recently is when Burrow's been hurt.\n\nInjuries have unfortunately been a major storyline in Burrow's four-year NFL career. He suffered a torn ACL and MCL in his left knee 10 games into his rookie season. This year, he only played in 10 games again for the Bengals after entering the season with a strained right calf from training camp.\n\nPrior to his injury in November, Burrow had thrown for 2,309 yards, 15 touchdowns and six interceptions. He had a completion rate of 66.8%, which was lower than his two previous seasons.\n\nTo protect Burrow better in the future, the Bengals opted to draft an offensive tackle - Amarius Mims - in the first round of the 2024 NFL Draft. For a new offensive weapon, the team also drafted Jermaine Burton out of Alabama.", "source": {"uri": "on3.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "On3"}, "authors": [{"uri": "nikki_chavanelle@on3.com", "name": "Nikki Chavanelle", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Bengals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Burrow", "type": "person", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Joe Burrow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Ligament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSU_Tigers_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "LSU Tigers football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_LVI", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl LVI"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jermaine_Burton", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jermaine Burton"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tackle_(gridiron_football_position)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tackle (gridiron football position)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medial_collateral_ligament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Medial collateral ligament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Crimson_Tide_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Alabama Crimson Tide football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cruciate_ligament_injury", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Anterior cruciate ligament injury"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft_(sports)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Draft (sports)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rookie", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Rookie"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interception", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Interception"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchdown", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Touchdown"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 100}], "image": "https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2023/09/28094833/joe-burrow-sept-28.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543707", "eventUri": "eng-9543707", "location": null, "extractedDates": [{"amb": false, "date": "-11-16", "textStart": 311, "textEnd": 322}], "sentiment": 0.2313725490196079, "wgt": 203, "relevance": 1}

Bengals coach Zac Taylor had said in recent press conferences that Burrow remained on track to meet those goals, and now it appears he has.\n\nIt's not clear how much work Burrow is doing at this point, but getting him back on the field - in cleats and practice jersey and wearing a compression sleeve on his throwing arm - is a big step after he missed the final seven-plus games of the 2023 season.\n\nBurrow opened last season with his calf not yet full healed from a strain he suffered on Day 2 of training camp, and he was not completely mobile until Week 5. The Bengals were 4-1 in after that, until a ligament tore in the first half of a Week 11 game at Baltimore. Cincinnati finished 9-8 with Jake Browning starting the final seven games, but the Bengals missed the playoffs after AFC North championship seasons in 2021 and 2022 and will be looking to get back on track for another run in 2024.", "source": {"uri": "daytondailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Dayton Daily News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Bengals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Social media"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Press conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zac_Taylor", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Zac Taylor"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_XFL_season", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "2023 XFL season"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_North", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AFC North"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_camp", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Training camp"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligament", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Ligament"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Browning", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Jake Browning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baltimore"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Lacrosse", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "label": "dmoz/Games/Online/Play-By-E-Mail", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Informal_Sports", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Informal Sports", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 78}], "image": "https://www.daytondailynews.com/resizer/STwOIr-H4uugrBMAoX_U2J5CuWc=/1200x630/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/coxohio/6J4YOELZY6RKYDXOE6D2N5L2GI.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543707", "eventUri": "eng-9543707", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.05098039215686279, "wgt": 200, "relevance": 1}

Kragthorpe in particular raved about Burrow, with the quarterbacks coach pronouncing Burrow to be as good as ever.\n\n\"I think he looked as quick and as athletic as I've seen him look,\" Kragthorpe said, via Geoff Hobson of the team's official website. \"He looked like the Joe Burrow we're used to seeing.

It also lines up with Burrow's stated timeline for returning to the field, as he told ESPN in March that he hoped to be completely cleared by May and fully participate in offseason team activities (OTAs) at the end of this month.\n\nBurrow has easily been one of the best quarterbacks in the league when active, as both of his fully healthy seasons have culminated in a Bengals trip to the AFC Championship Game. Following the 2021 season, Burrow's first full year in the league after he tore his ACL as a rookie in 2020, he led Cincinnati to an upset of the Kansas City Chiefs in the conference title game -- the only time Patrick Mahomes & Co. have failed to reach the Super Bowl since 2019. The Bengals then narrowly lost Super Bowl LVI to the Los Angeles Rams 23-20 and then lost to the Chiefs by the same score in the AFC Championship Game the following year.\n\nCincinnati faded from the playoff hunt last season after Burrow's injury, finishing 9-8 despite backup quarterback Jake Browning exceeding expectations in Burrow's place.\n\nIndividually, Burrow has also lived up to the gaudy hype placed on him as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2020 NFL Draft after winning the Heisman Trophy and leading LSU to a college football national title in 2019.

The Bengals shot-caller finished the latter half of the season yet again with another injury, this time to his right wrist and Cincinnati failed to make the playoffs. However, a fit Joe is a different animal, good enough to beat Mahomes and the Chiefs, more times than any other team.\n\nWhile Mahomes and the boys are looking to make a three-peat and defend their crown, Ocho feels there is only one hurdle in their way. On the recent episode of The Nightcap, Chad Ochocinco voiced his belief that Kansas City can win the third consecutive Super Bowl. While they do have all the pieces to do so, he feels that the AFC North, particularly the Bengals are standing in their way, especially with Burrow coming back healthy. He opined,\n\n\" So the words coming out of Patrick Mahomes mouth, they can possibly do but there's just one problem, also in the AFC North, in the AFC for that matter is the Bengals and we have a healthy Joe Burrow coming back. I'm telling you what a better story is, where's the Super Bowl this year? In New Orleans. We have 2 players on the Bengals that went to LSU. Where is LSU located- in Baton Rouge, not very far from New Orleans.\"\n\nOcho, with his wishful thinking, stated that the story is already in the stars as New Orleans hosts the Super Bowl next season and that the Bengals have two players from LSU, which is located in Baton Rouge. Being near New Orleans, and LSU stars on the team, it feels like kismet. Burrow and Chase won the Natty together and Joe also won the Heisman as a Tiger. Ocho said,\n\nThe Chiefs and Mahomes are set to do the impossible and Patrick is confident they are doing just that. But has anyone ever done that before?\n\nHas Any Team Achieved a Three-Peat in NFL History?\n\nWhen the Chiefs lifted their 3rd Super Bowl in five years, they officially became a dynasty. With confidence at an all-time high and being led by the greatest QB of this generation, they are looking to win it again and do something that many dynasties failed to do.\n\nThe NFL has seen great dynasties like the Steelers in the '70s, the 49ers in the '80s, the Cowboys in the '90s, the Patriots in the 2000s and 2010s, and finally the Chiefs. While most dynasties have managed to do a double, lifting the Lombardy twice, no one has ever done the three-peat. The closest that anyone came was the 49ers, who lifted the trophy in 1988 and 89, before losing in the NFC Championship game in 1990. As per the NFL, with the game set and the score almost tied, Roger Craig fumbled the ball and it was recovered by the Giants.\n\nWith 2:36 seconds left and the Giants trailing by only 1 point, they started a drive and drove the ball up to the 58-yard line, with Bahr kicking the field goal and ending the 49er's dream of lifting their third consecutive Super Bowl at the Candlestick Park.\n\nThe Chiefs have a chance to etch their name in history by making a three-peat. But Burrow is the only active QB to defeat mighty Mahomes and Kansas in the AFC Championship game. Another interesting match-up awaits. However, the Bengals will not be the only team that would try to stop the juggernaut. Most teams will be out for their blood.", "source": {"uri": "thesportsrush.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The SportsRush"}, "authors": [{"uri": "ayush_juneja@thesportsrush.com", "name": "Ayush Juneja", "type": "author", "isAgency": false}], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Burrow", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Joe Burrow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Johnson", "type": "person", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Chad Johnson"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSU_Tigers_football", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "LSU Tigers football"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Bengals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Orleans", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "New Orleans"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_North", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "AFC North"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_playoffs", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "NFL playoffs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-peat", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Three-peat"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baton_Rouge,_Louisiana", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Baton Rouge, Louisiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Baton Rouge, Louisiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Mahomes", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Mahomes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Football_Conference", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Football Conference"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisman_Trophy", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Heisman Trophy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_goal", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Field goal"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candlestick_Park", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Candlestick Park"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Championship_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AFC Championship Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFC_Championship_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "NFC Championship Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_49ers", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "San Francisco 49ers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England_Patriots", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "New England Patriots"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Quarterback"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 20}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 19}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 16}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Lawn_Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Lawn Bowling", "wgt": 17}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin_Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin Bowling", "wgt": 18}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 90}], "image": "https://cdn-wp.thesportsrush.com/2023/01/e8a40ff9-untitled-design-609.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543707", "eventUri": "eng-9543707", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.2156862745098038, "wgt": 169, "relevance": 1}

Let's look at the candidates", "body": "The NFL is getting used to the Kansas City Chiefs winning Super Bowls, and as a result, it is getting used to the Chiefs playing the first game of the NFL season.\n\nThe Chiefs will host the opening game of the NFL regular season for the third time in five years, a reward each reigning champion enjoys. And once again, we're wondering which opponent the Chiefs will get. The NFL typically tries to get a marquee opponent to face the champs and get the season going.\n\nWe know the eight candidates for opening night, since we have known each team's opponents for the 2024 season for months. Here is a guess at who will kick off the season at Kansas City:\n\nThere wouldn't be a lot of buzz for any of these teams. The Buccaneers would be the best of the group but ... nah. The only reason any of these three teams would end up on opening night is the NFL knows that we're all going to be watching even if Liberty North High School is the opponent.\n\nIt's rare for the NFL to make the opening game a divisional contest. The last time that happened was 2012 when the Dallas Cowboys played the New York Giants. The only other time was 2008, also with the Giants. Since we don't have to worry about the NFL's infatuation with the NFC East for this year's opening game, it seems unlikely they'd match up the Chiefs with an AFC West opponent. Maybe Jim Harbaugh's debut with the Chargers or the Raiders having been the last team to beat the Chiefs (and bragging a bit about it) might move the needle. But it seems unlikely.\n\nThe NFL likes to give us a good game in the opener, but not too good. Again, we're watching no matter what. Last season, games against the Bills or Bengals would have been spicier than Lions-Chiefs, but those Bills and Bengals games ended up getting prime real estate for the networks in the late Sunday afternoon slot. The best possible game for this season's opener might be an AFC championship game rematch with the Ravens, but you'll probably see that one in prime time this fall.\n\nThe Texans are going to get plenty of prime-time love from the schedule makers this season. C.J. Stroud is an instant star and the addition of Stefon Diggs makes the Texans one of the NFL's most watchable teams. Stroud vs. Patrick Mahomes would be great theater. If this ends up being the choice, nobody would complain. It would probably be a great game, too.\n\nThe Bengals didn't have a great season in 2023, but a lot of that had to do with Joe Burrow's injury. With Burrow back, we can crank the Bengals-Chiefs rivalry back up. Because the Bengals weren't a big factor last season, we might forget the heat from the Chiefs-Bengals playoff battles, the \"Burrowhead\" talk and Travis Kelce calling the mayor of Cincinnati a \"jabroni\" after Kansas City beat the Bengals in an AFC championship game. There will also be interest in seeing how Burrow looks after a wrist injury ended his season last November. Unless there's concern that Burrow might not be ready -- and there doesn't seem to be much worry over that -- this seems like an easy pick for the NFL. Though, the league has a few good candidates for opening night.", "source": {"uri": "ca.sports.yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo Sports Canada"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_Chiefs", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City Chiefs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampa_Bay_Buccaneers", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Tampa Bay Buccaneers"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Super Bowl"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_Bengals", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati Bengals"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_University", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Liberty University"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_West", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "AFC West"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Harbaugh", "type": "person", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Jim Harbaugh"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFC_East", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "NFC East"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Dallas Cowboys"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_time", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Prime time"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Giants", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "New York Giants"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City,_Missouri", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kansas City, Missouri"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Burrow", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Joe Burrow"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Mahomes", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Patrick Mahomes"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Kelce", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Travis Kelce"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefon_Diggs", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Stefon Diggs"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFC_Championship_Game", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "AFC Championship Game"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore_Ravens", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Baltimore Ravens"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cincinnati"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Ten-Pin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Instructors", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "label": "dmoz/Sports/Bowling/Candlepin", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Sports", "label": "news/Sports", "wgt": 79}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/9iHIr4LprkjaipU0avdp6Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-04/ca736220-fc1b-11ee-bfa7-464c689d19a6", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9543707", "eventUri": "eng-9543707", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": 0.3254901960784313, "wgt": 163, "relevance": 1}

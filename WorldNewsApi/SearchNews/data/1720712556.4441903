The adjacent 18-hole golf course opened in 2000. Among the park additions will be: \u2022 A 1-mile extension: The 13-mile trail system has been expanded by one mile, offering a new technical trail called \u201cThe Jungle\u201d on the south side of Salt Creek. This challenging black diamond single-track trail features tight switchbacks, sudden drops, and a rock garden, pushing even experienced riders to their limits. \u2022 Rock Armoring: Strategic rock armoring has been implemented throughout the trails to improve drainage and prevent erosion, ensuring the long-term sustainability of what is deemed as a valuable recreational resource, with the added infrastructure as an investment to ensure trails are open more often. \u2022 Dedicated Kids Loop: A new, quarter-mile loop specifically designed for children ages 5-13 will be added this summer to provide \u201ca safe and engaging space\u201d for young patrons to explore and build confidence on their bikes. The loop features rollers, rocks, and boardwalks creating a fun and challenging environment for developing skills. \u201cSince its opening in 2019, the Creekside Trails landscape has been a cherished asset for our community thanks to the generous support of donors, sponsors, and volunteers who share our passion for outdoor recreation,\u201d Nuppnau said. \u201cWe\u2019re incredibly grateful for their contributions and excited to continue growing this beautiful and impactful resource.\u201d Nuppnau said he is \u201chopeful\u201d the new components of the park trails will be ready by early fall for a ribbon cutting and unveiling. \u201cWe are still in the process of our needed fundraising,\u201d Nuppnau said Friday. \u201cThe overall cost for this project is around $10,000 and we have about half of that money already secured.\u201d Valparaiso\u2019s landscape to date includes more than 1,000 acres of recreational spaces divided among 22 different parks, each unique and with an independent history. Nuppnau celebrated his one-year anniversary in May as Valparaiso director of parks after a previous five years with the department and as the successor of John Seibert. Seibert and Nuppnau worked together on several key projects in the past two years in addition to Creekside Trails, such as the new Flounder and Friends Skatepark, which opened in spring 2023.

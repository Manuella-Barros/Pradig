Robyn Hayward clapped back at Sam Presti after the Thunder general manager said he \u201cmissed\u201d in acquiring Gordon to help bolster the team\u2019s title chances. Responding to a Bleacher Report Instagram post highlighting Presti\u2019s quote, Robyn responded in the comments: \u201cWhy trade for someone and not play them? \u2026 missed it by not integrating him???\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.\u201d Presti fired the first barb in this salvo when he bluntly analyzed Gordon\u2019s effect on the roster after he added the veteran for three players and two second-round picks this February. After averaging 14.5 points over roughly 32 minutes per game with the Hornets, Gordon tallied just 5.3 points per game spanning 17.2 minutes in 26 games with the Thunder. Gordon did not score during the NBA playoffs, playing a total of 46 minutes over seven games and hoisting just three shots before the Mavericks eliminated the Thunder in the second round. \u201cI missed on that,\u201d Presti said of the Hayward trade, per ESPN. \u201cThat\u2019s on me. But I\u2019m learning, I\u2019m trying to learn this team, I\u2019m trying to learn the pace of the team a little bit. And trying to be a great observer of the team as it\u2019s going through its paces, knowing that it\u2019s really going to change on its own in and of itself.\u201d He added: \u201cI don\u2019t think I read that one perfect, and I\u2019m learning from that in terms of bringing somebody midseason and especially early on in the process for our team.\u201d Gordon, a 2010 first-round pick, previously called his time with Oklahoma City \u201cfrustrating\u201d and \u201cdisappointing.\u201d \u201cI feel as a player, I have a lot to offer,\u201d Gordon said, according to ESPN. \u201cJust wasn\u2019t really given much of an opportunity to do that. I thought I would be given that opportunity.\u201d Robyn, who wed Gordon in 2014, echoed this sentiments with her Instagram comment. The two share four children: son Theo and daughters Bernie, Charlie and Nora Mae, according to People. It certainly seems that both sides have reasons to be frustrated, with the Thunder hoping Hayward would provide a nice veteran bench presence and Gordon hoping to be involved more.

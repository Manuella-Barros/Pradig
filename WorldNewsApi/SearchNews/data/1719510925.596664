Red Bull driver Sergio Perez\u2019s right rear wheel was clipped by the front left tire of Kevin Magnussen\u2019s Haas car behind him, sending Perez spinning into the crash barrier. The crash split Perez\u2019s car almost in half and also sent Nico Hulkenberg\u2019s Haas car spinning as he followed behind. None of the drivers appeared harmed and all walked back to their team garages. A red flag came out with debris littering the track to allow Perez\u2019s mangled Red Bull to be cleared away by a crane. The Mexican driver walked back accompanied by two race marshals. On a dramatic lap, two Alpines also tangled near the tunnel with Esteban Ocon\u2019s front nose sending teammate Pierre Gasly\u2019s car up in the air. With other cars lagging behind and the tunnel approaching, a serious accident was avoided. Governing body FIA ordered a standing restart at 3:44 p.m. local time, with Ferrari\u2019s Charles Leclerc in pole ahead of McLaren\u2019s Oscar Piastri and Ferrari\u2019s Carlos Sainz Jr. going from third despite puncturing moments after the start. Sainz was trying to pass Piastri and had to use a run-off area at Casino Square. Magnussen was already on 10 penalty points out of 12 this season. He could get a race ban if race stewards rule he caused the crash and he gets more penalty points. However, it may be argued that it was a racing incident as Perez seemed to move when Magnussen was right behind him. ___ AP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing", "summary": "<a href=\"https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL21vbmFjby1mMS1jcmFzaC1yZWQtYnVsbC1oYWFzLTZhYWJhMzBjZTgzMzk5NzhhZDRlYmM2OTg4N2VlNzBh0gEA?oc=5\" target=\"_blank\">Big crash involving 3 cars on 1st lap of Monaco GP brings out red flag to temporarily halt race</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">The Associated Press</font>", "url": "https://apnews.com/article/monaco-f1-crash-red-bull-haas-6aaba30ce8339978ad4ebc69887ee70a", "image": "https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/a2ec8e5/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4924x2770+0+257/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fa3%2F9e%2Fe9658e43f4f76c3ec6d88f1b8dde%2F40e73dc2c83048cf998dda64fe66a349", "video": null, "publish_date": "2024-05-26 13:44:00", "author": "Jerome Pugmire", "authors": ["Jerome Pugmire"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": -0.512}

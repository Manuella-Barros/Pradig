Watts' brother, photographer Ben Watts, confirmed the news in an Instagram post, sharing a video that showed the actress in an elevator wearing a white gown and holding a bouquet of white flowers. Crudup stood behind her wearing a dark suit, while Kai, 15 \u2014 whom Naomi shares with ex Liev Schreiber, along with son Sasha, 16 \u2014 and the actress's niece Ruby appeared to serve as bridesmaids, both wearing strapless nude gowns. The whole group, including Sasha and what appeared to be Crudup's son, William Parker, 20 \u2014 whom he shares with ex Mary-Louise Parker \u2014 smiled and waved at the camera as the elevator doors closed, revealing Ben filming in the reflection of the doors. \"Off they go Naomi x Billy x family #benwatts #scrapbooking,\" he wrote alongside the video, which was soundtracked by Frank Sinatra's song, \"Love and Marriage.\" Ben shared a few more details from the special event on his Instagram Stories the same evening. In one photo, he posed in bathing shorts beside his movie star sister in casual daytime attire, writing, \"Getting ready for tonight,\" and tagging Naomi. The next clip showed his daughter Ruby getting ready in what appeared to be a hotel room. \"Rubys getting ready to be a bridesmaid,\" Ben wrote over the video. Next, the photographer posted the same video of the group in the elevator with the caption, \"Almost time @naomiwatts.\" Again, Sinatra's track \"Love and Marriage\" played over the clip, with the lyrics \"Love and marriage/Love and marriage/Go together like horse and carriage,\" also appearing over the video. A following clip showed a stunning room filled with chairs arranged in rows and guests \u2014 including Justin Theroux and his girlfriend Nicole Brydon Bloom, and what appeared to be Nicole Kidman \u2014 sitting and mingling in formal wear. \"Let the ceremony begin,\" Ben wrote over the clip. The final Instagram Stories video he posted panned over the guests seated behind him, including what looked to be Kidman, 56, wearing a sparkly silver top for the event. \"Ceremony about to start in this fantastic location..... mums a bit emotional understandably,\" he wrote over the clip, before panning to show his and Naomi's mom, Myfanwy Edwards Roberts, looking tearful as she sat next to him. Earlier the same day, Ben had shared a sweet video on Instagram of what appeared to be a welcome event ahead of the ceremony. As well as filming the crowd \u2014 which included Naomi in a stunning yellow dress with floral print detailing, Crudup, Sasha, Theroux, Bloom \u2014 the photographer captured part of a sweet speech the actress made to her guests as she stood in front of them with her husband. \"This is a reminder of what life's about. The affirmation of love being one of the simplest things, but the most important,\" Naomi said as she held Crudup's hand while he beamed at her. \"I\u2019m making a video \u2026\u2026but tomorrow I\u2019m taking pictures.

The actress herself had shared several posts on her Instagram Stories, including a snap with Crudup posted by her stylist, from the first event and standing with DJ Prince01. Meanwhile, destination wedding, event and travel planner Billy Folchetti posted a shot of the same ceremony venue that had featured in Ben's Instagram Stories posts, writing \"Ceremony Vibe. #thatsluxe #mexicocity,\" over the image. In the shot, the same lined-up chairs and light installations appeared, though without any guests. Folchetti also shared a black and white image that showed guests at tables. \"Dinner is served,\" he wrote over the image, tagging the location as Mexico City. Later he posted clips of a disco ball and DJ Prince01 spinning the decks, tagging the DJ in both. Representatives for Naomi and Crudup did not immediately respond to PEOPLE's request for comment.

Watts first announced the couple's 2023 marriage in an Instagram post on June 10, a day after the pair had fans buzzing when they were seen wearing wedding attire in photos obtained by Page Six. Watts shared a snapshot of herself and Crudup smiling as they stood in front of a Manhattan courthouse. Watts wore a white floral lace wedding dress and held a simple bouquet of white flowers, while Crudup sported a sleek navy suit without a tie. \"Hitched! ?\ufe0f?\u2665\ufe0f,\" Watts captioned the photo. After their wedding, during a January 2024 appearance on Live with Kelly and Mark, Watts revealed that when it came to their ceremony, \"nothing was planned because we wanted to keep it low-key.\" \"I even got my flowers from the bodega at the corner,\" she shared. \"It's never too late, right?\" she said of her relationship with Crudup, thanking the co-hosts for their well-wishes. \"We found each other later than\u2026 yeah, late in life. And it\u2019s really a special thing.

She also wore the ring on the same finger during a Today appearance around the same time, and played coy when the hosts asked about the diamond. \"My eye is hurting. There's a big glint coming from some ring over here,\" Hoda Kotb said. \"It just struck me.

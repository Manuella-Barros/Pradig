Taylor Swift sweetly congratulated a couple after she witnessed them get engaged during her combined \u201cFolklore\u201d and \u201cEvermore\u201d set at her Eras Tour show in Edinburgh, Scotland, Friday night. \u201cI love performing this entire show in the sunlight \u2019cause I\u2019m pretty sure I just, like, saw somebody get engaged over here,\u201d the pop star told the crowd at Murrayfield Stadium in a clip shared on Threads. Once fans confirmed the exciting news, the \u201cKarma\u201d hitmaker, 34, pumped both her arms in the air and screamed, \u201cYes!\u201d \u201cCongratulations, wow!\u201d she enthusiastically added. \u201cI just saw that whole thing. Man, that\u2019s amazing \u2026 Thanks for doing that at my concert; that\u2019s a big moment!\u201d Friday night\u2019s concert marked the first of three shows Swift has scheduled in Scotland. She then tours the rest of the UK, hitting Liverpool, Cardiff, London and Dublin before venturing elsewhere in Europe. The milestone moment for Swift\u2019s Scottish fans comes as engagement rumors continue to swirl around the Grammy winner herself and her NFL star beau, Travis Kelce. Earlier this year, a person close to the famous couple told Page Six that Swift and Kelce have \u201cdiscussed\u201d taking the next step in their relationship and that \u201cthere is a plan.\u201d \u201cThey will get engaged on their one-year anniversary in July,\u201d the source further claimed. Kelce, 34, then fueled engagement rumors in March while he and his brother, Jason Kelce, spoke about lab-grown diamonds on their \u201cNew Heights\u201d podcast. Swift and the Kansas City Chiefs tight end, who have been dating almost a year, went public with their romance in September 2023 when the \u201cLover\u201d singer supported Travis at a game at Arrowhead Stadium. She then offered a glimpse into their relationship during her Time Person of the Year profile in December 2023, explaining why they decided to confirm their romance. \u201cWhen you say a relationship is public, that means I\u2019m going to see him do what he loves, we\u2019re showing up for each other, other people are there and we don\u2019t care,\u201d Swift noted at the time. A close friend of Travis\u2019 recently said that he hopes wedding bells are in the couple\u2019s near future. Patrick Regan said on the \u201cYour Day Off\u201d podcast this past Monday of the superstars tying the knot, \u201cHopefully soon, that\u2019ll be fun.\u201d", "summary": "\"Thanks for doing that at my concert; that's a big moment!\" the pop star gushed from stage during her \"Folklore\" and \"Evermore\" set.", "url": "https://pagesix.com/2024/06/08/entertainment/taylor-swift-congratulates-fans-who-get-engaged-at-eras-tour-show/", "image": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/83471264.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "video": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/V6XubSx6-guILbWnz.mp4", "publish_date": "2024-06-08 16:38:35", "author": "Sara Whitman", "authors": ["Sara Whitman"], "language": "en", "source_country": "us", "sentiment": 0.25}

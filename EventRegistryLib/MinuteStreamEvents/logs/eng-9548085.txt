Claiborne County Sheriff Bob Brooks said a man was in a car struck by one of the trees.\n\nOn May 8, a tornado emergency - the weather service's highest alert level - was issued for an area south of Nashville including the towns of Spring Hill, Chapel Hill, and Eagleville.\n\nThe National Weather Service had previously reported a likely tornado on the ground in nearby Columbia, about 45 miles south of Nashville. People in Columbia were injured and homes were damaged, according to Lynn Thompson, assistant director of Maury County 911. Mr. Thompson told The Associated Press that he could not provide any further details: \"We're getting overloaded right now.\"\n\nRita Thompson, marketing and communications director with Maury Regional Health, said the hospital had received five patients. One died, another was in serious condition, and three had injuries that were not life-threatening.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration issued a temporary ground stop at Nashville International Airport because of the weather, media outlets reported. Northeast of Nashville, a flash flood emergency was issued for Sumner and Robertson counties including the cities of Hendersonville and Gallatin. The National Weather Service said water rescues were ongoing in those areas and described the flooding from heavy thunderstorms as life-threatening.\n\n\"Do not attempt to travel unless you are fleeing an area subject to flooding or under an evacuation order,\" the weather agency alert said.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Nashville on the evening of May 8 issued a tornado watch for parts of Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri, and Tennessee until 3 a.m. CDT. The weather service continued issuing tornado warnings into the night, mostly in Tennessee, but also in Missouri, Alabama, Georgia, and Texas.\n\nIn North Carolina, a state of emergency was declared for Gaston County the evening of May 8 following a large storm. First responders were working to clear roads of downed power lines and broken trees and were helping residents, officials said.\n\nMore than 135,000 customers had lost power in the state as of May 8 evening, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nThe National Weather Service confirmed tornadoes touched down May 7 in western Ohio: five in Warren County and one each in Darke, Mercer, and Auglaize counties. The weather service said crews are still surveying areas in other counties to determine if tornadoes struck there as well. The strong storms also brought hail and heavy rains to the state and knocked out power to thousands of utility customers.\n\nIn Michigan, the first-ever tornado emergency in Michigan was issued Tuesday. Weather service meteorologist Nathan Jeruzal said the tornadoes there touched down one each in Kalamazoo, Cass, and, Branch counties - all in the southwestern part of the state. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties. Kalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart and more than a dozen mobile homes were destroyed. About 50 people temporarily were trapped inside the damaged facility because of downed power lines.\n\nMore than a dozen homes were destroyed in a mobile home park in adjacent Pavilion Township and 16 people were injured, said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller.\n\nOn May 8, Samantha Smith she stepped from her mother's partially wrecked home in Pavilion Township, about 137 miles west of Detroit. Being able to recover some cherished items offered Ms. Smith a rare moment of relief amid the storm's devastation. She said her parents and brother were injured during the storm but survived.\n\n\"I have thanked God probably a billion times since this happened yesterday,\" she said. \"My kids are healthy and good. We just gotta make back up what we lost.\"\n\nTravis Wycoff ventured out May 7 at night after seeing on radar that a tornado had touched down in the Portage area, and he said he helped an elderly couple out of their partially collapsed home and freed a service dog from a home.\n\n\"There were a lot of people running through the streets trying to find people and their pets,\" Mr. Wycoff said. \"It was just a lot of chaos.\"\n\nIn southern Indiana, the National Weather Service confirmed a tornado touched down early May 8. The Clark County Emergency Management Agency said the storm damaged 24 structures, including homes in a subdivision north of the city of Sellersburg, located about 12 miles north of Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nCandice Holmes, a resident of the Lewis & Clark subdivision north of Sellersburg, said she, her husband, and son sought shelter in their bathroom when they heard the approaching storm and \"the wind just picked up all at once.\"\n\n\"It was definitely a scary moment. ... And I'm glad we're alive,\" Ms. Holmes told WDRB-TV.\n\nTornadoes were also confirmed in Pennsylvania just outside Pittsburgh, in central Arkansas, and in northern West Virginia. The West Virginia twister was at least the 11th tornado this year in the state, which sees two tornadoes in an average year.\n\nBaseball-sized hail was reported on May 8 in areas just southwest of St. Louis. Heavy downpours caused flash flooding and at least one water rescue near Sullivan, a town that was struck by a small tornado just two days earlier. Damaging hail also was reported in the Kansas City area.\n\nOn May 6, parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail, and tornadoes, including a deadly twister that ripped through an Oklahoma town. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nAcross the U.S., the entire week is looking stormy. The Midwest and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, St. Louis, Cincinnati, Nashville, and Memphis, Tennessee - cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.", "source": {"uri": "csmonitor.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Christian Science Monitor"}, "authors": [{"uri": "christian_science_monitor@csmonitor.com",

(AP) -- Severe storms tore through parts of the U.S. again Wednesday, spawning damaging tornadoes, producing massive hail, and killing two people in Tennessee and one person in North Carolina.\n\nA storm that rumbled across northeastern Tennessee brought high winds that knocked down powerlines and trees. Claiborne County Sheriff Bob Brooks said a 22-year-old man was in a car struck by one of the trees.\n\nWednesday afternoon, a tornado emergency -- the weather service's highest alert level -- was issued for an area south of Nashville including the towns of Spring Hill, Chapel Hill and Eagleville.\n\nThe National Weather Service had previously reported a likely tornado on the ground in nearby Columbia, about 45 miles (72 kilometers) south of Nashville. People in Columbia were injured and homes were damaged, according to Lynn Thompson, assistant director of Maury County 911. Thompson told The Associated Press that he could not provide any further details: \"We're getting overloaded right now.\"\n\nRita Thompson, Marketing & Communications director with Maury Regional Health, said the hospital had received five patients. One died, another was in serious condition and three had injuries that were not life-threatening.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration issued a temporary ground stop at Nashville International Airport because of the weather, media outlets reported. Northeast of Nashville, a flash flood emergency was issued for Sumner and Robertson counties including the cities of Hendersonville and Gallatin. The National Weather Service said water rescues were ongoing in those areas and described the flooding from heavy thunderstorms as life-threatening.\n\n\"Do not attempt to travel unless you are fleeing an area subject to flooding or under an evacuation order,\" the weather agency alert said.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Nashville on Wednesday evening issued a tornado watch for parts of Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri and Tennessee until 3 a.m. CDT. The weather service continued issuing tornado warnings into the night, mostly in Tennessee, but also in Missouri, Alabama, Georgia and Texas.\n\nIn North Carolina, a state of emergency was declared for Gaston County Wednesday evening following a large storm. First responders were working to clear roads of downed power lines and broken trees and were helping residents, officials said. The New Hope Fire Department responded to a tree down on a car. One person in the car was killed and another was taken to a hospital, officials said.\n\nMore than 135,000 customers had lost power in the state as of Wednesday evening, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nThe National Weather Service confirmed tornadoes touched down Tuesday in western Ohio: five in Warren County and one each in Darke, Mercer and Auglaize counties. The weather service said crews are still surveying areas in other counties to determine if tornadoes struck there, as well. The strong storms also brought hail and heavy rains to the state and knocked out power to thousands of utility customers.\n\nIn Michigan, weather service meteorologist Nathan Jeruzal said the tornadoes there touched down one each in Kalamazoo, Cass and Branch counties -- all in the southwestern part of the state. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\nKalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart and more than a dozen mobile homes were destroyed. About 50 people temporarily were trapped inside the damaged facility because of downed power lines.\n\nMore than a dozen homes were destroyed in a mobile home park in adjacent Pavilion Township and 16 people were injured, said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller.\n\nSamantha Smith clutched a box Wednesday afternoon as she stepped from her mother's partially wrecked home in Pavilion Township, about 137 miles (220 kilometers) west of Detroit. Inside the box were her grandmother's ashes. Being able to recover the most cherished of items offered Smith a rare moment of relief amid the storm's devastation. She said her parents and brother were injured during the storm but survived.\n\n\"I have thanked God probably a billion times since this happened yesterday,\" she said. \"My kids are healthy and good. We just gotta make back up what we lost.\"\n\nTravis Wycoff ventured out Tuesday night after seeing on radar that a tornado had touched down in the Portage area, and he said he helped an elderly couple out of their partially collapsed home and freed a service dog from a home.\n\n\"There were a lot of people running through the streets trying to find people and their pets,\" Wycoff said. \"It was just a lot of chaos.\"\n\nIn southern Indiana, the National Weather Service confirmed a tornado touched down early Wednesday. The Clark County Emergency Management Agency said the storm damaged 24 structures, including homes in a subdivision north of the city of Sellersburg, located about 12 miles (19 kilometers) north of Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nCandice Holmes, a resident of the Lewis & Clark subdivision north of Sellersburg, said she, her husband and son sought shelter in their bathroom when they heard the approaching storm and \"the wind just picked up all at once.\"\n\n\"It was definitely a scary moment. ... And I'm glad we're alive,\" Holmes told WDRB-TV.\n\nTornadoes were also confirmed in Pennsylvania just outside Pittsburgh, in central Arkansas and in northern West Virginia. The West Virginia twister was at least the 11th tornado this year in the state, which sees two tornadoes in an average year.\n\nBaseball-sized hail was reported Wednesday in areas just southwest of St. Louis. Heavy downpours caused flash flooding and at least one water rescue near Sullivan, a town that was struck by a small tornado just two days earlier. Damaging hail also was reported in the Kansas City area.\n\nOn Monday, parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and tornadoes, including a deadly twister that ripped through an Oklahoma town. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nAcross the U.S., the entire week is looking stormy. The Midwest and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, St. Louis, Cincinnati, Nashville and Memphis, Tennessee -- cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nDownload the FOX13 Memphis app to receive alerts from breaking news in your neighborhood.\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD\n\nTrending stories:\n\nTornado Watch issued

Brad Devereaux/Kalamazoo Gazette via AP\n\nAbout 50 people were trapped inside a FedEx distribution facility after a tornado hit Portage, Mich., on Tuesday evening, Kalamazoo County authorities said.\n\nFirst responders were trying to get the people out but were waiting for the power company to clear downed wires blocking the way, Taylor Koopman, Kalamazoo County spokeswoman, said Tuesday evening.\n\nFedEx said the company was monitoring the situation.\n\n\"Our thoughts are with those affected by the tornado in Portage, Michigan, and we are grateful there were no serious injuries resulting from the damage to our facility at 6701 Portage Road,\" company spokeswoman Shannon Davis said. \"We continue to assess the damage, and we are implementing contingency plans to lessen any potential impacts on service.\"\n\nPart of the roof collapsed after the tornado struck, mlive.com reported. Photos showed walls caved in.\n\nNo deaths had been reported in the city as of about 8 p.m., Portage Mayor Patricia Randall said, though crews were still assessing the damage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe storm caused \"extensive\" damage in several areas of the city and leaving more than 21,000 of roughly 49,000 residents without power, Randall said in an email. As of about 8 p.m., she had heard of no deaths.\n\nPolice were assessing the damage, \"but with so many trees and wires down, travel is slow,\" Randall said.\n\nA mobile home park in nearby Kalamazoo was also \"hit hard,\" Koopman said, with \"entire homes destroyed.\"\n\nOn X, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer urged people in southwestern Michigan to \"continue monitoring severe weather alerts and follow the advice of emergency officials.\"\n\nSeveral intense tornadoes plowed across parts of southern Michigan on Tuesday evening, causing damage and leaving injuries in their wake. Areas around Kalamazoo and Union City, about 30 miles to the southeast, appeared to be hard hit. More than 30,000 customers were without power across the region following the storms.\n\nTwisters were also confirmed in Indiana and Ohio as storms swarmed the Great Lakes, Midwest and Ohio Valley. Tornado watches stretched from southern Kentucky into southern Michigan on Tuesday evening, where severe storms capable of producing tornadoes, large hail and damaging wind were possible into the night.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Michigan, one large tornado was seen crossing U.S. Route 131 near Kalamazoo just after 6 p.m. Significant damage was reported just to the south in Portage. A second tornado was also observed near Portage a little more than an hour after the first. The National Weather Service issued \"particularly dangerous situation\" warnings for both storms, which are reserved for confirmed large and extremely dangerous twisters.\n\nEarlier in the evening, a rare tornado emergency was hoisted by the Weather Service for another storm that tracked through Union City in south-central Michigan and probably produced either a long-track tornado or multiple tornadoes that touched down intermittently for more than an hour.\n\nThe tornado emergency in Union City - reserved for the most dire situations when a large tornado threatens a population center - was the first issued in Michigan by the Weather Service.\n\nThe tornadoes struck the Midwest, Great Lakes and Ohio Valley just one day after a violent EF4 tornado on the 0-to-5 Enhanced Fujita scale for intensity devastated parts of the city of Barnsdall in northeast Oklahoma, killing one person.\n\nThe severe storms that spawned tornadoes erupted as low pressure swept from the southern Plains on Monday into the Great Lakes on Tuesday. A warm front extending east from the low pressure zone served as the main conduit for the tornado-producing thunderstorms in southern Michigan.\n\nAt one point there were multiple concurrent \"particularly dangerous situation\" tornado warnings in addition to the tornado emergency for Union City. More than three dozen tornado warnings had been issued in the Midwest and Great Lakes through 8 p.m. Eastern time.\n\nLarge hail was also observed from the rotating thunderstorms that erupted throughout the Midwest. At least 100 reports of large hail were logged by the Weather Service, growing as large as four inches in diameter in Union City and three inches in diameter in Steuben, Ind.\n\nTuesday marked the 13th day in a row with tornadoes in the Lower 48. As the active storm pattern persists, additional twisters are possible in the Tennessee Valley and Mid-South on Wednesday. Scattered severe storms could hit the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast on Thursday, before a break in severe weather Friday through the weekend.\n\nCopy the Story Link\n\nComments are not available on this

The National Weather Service said water rescues were ongoing in those areas and described the flooding from heavy thunderstorms as life-threatening.\n\n\"Do not attempt to travel unless you are fleeing an area subject to flooding or under an evacuation order,\" the weather agency alert said.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Nashville on Wednesday evening issued a tornado watch for parts of Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri and Tennessee until 3 a.m. CDT. The weather service continued issuing tornado warnings into the night, mostly in Tennessee, but also in Missouri, Alabama, Georgia and Texas.\n\nIn North Carolina, a state of emergency was declared for Gaston County Wednesday evening following a large storm. First responders were working to clear roads of downed power lines and broken trees and were helping residents, officials said. The New Hope Fire Department responded to a tree down on a car. One person in the car was killed and another was taken to a hospital, officials said.\n\nMore than 152,000 customers were without power in North Carolina and Tennessee Wednesday night, according to utility tracker PowerOutage.us.\n\nTornadoes were first reported after dark Tuesday in parts of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, according to the National Weather Service. The storms came a day after a deadly twister ripped through an Oklahoma town.\n\nThe National Weather Service confirmed tornadoes touched down Tuesday in western Ohio: five in Warren County and one each in Darke, Mercer and Auglaize counties. The weather service said crews are still surveying areas of Franklin and Butler counties to determine if tornadoes struck there, as well. Radar indicated a tornado struck Jefferson County, but teams will have to evaluate the damage to determine its rating, said Jeff Craven, a weather service meteorologist in Pittsburgh.\n\nCrews on Wednesday were able to survey the damage caused by the strong storms that contained hail and heavy rains and knocked out power to thousands of utility customers.\n\nIn Michigan, weather service meteorologist Nathan Jeruzal said the tornadoes there touched down one each in Kalamazoo, Cass and Branch counties -- all in the southwestern part of the state. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\nKalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart and more than a dozen mobile homes were destroyed. About 50 people temporarily were trapped inside the damaged facility because of downed power lines.\n\nMore than a dozen homes were destroyed in a mobile home park in adjacent Pavilion Township and 16 people were injured, said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller.\n\nSamantha Smith clutched a box Wednesday afternoon as she stepped from her mother's partially wrecked home in Pavilion Township, about 137 miles west of Detroit. Inside the box were her grandmother's ashes. Being able to recover the most cherished of items offered Smith a rare moment of relief amid the storm's devastation.\n\nHer parents and brother were injured during the storm but survived.\n\n\"I have thanked God probably a billion times since this happened yesterday,\" she said. \"My kids are healthy and good. We just gotta make back up what we lost.\"\n\nTravis Wycoff ventured out Tuesday night after seeing on radar that a tornado had touched down in the Portage area, and he said he helped an elderly couple out of their partially collapsed home and freed a service dog from a home.\n\n\"There were a lot of people running through the streets trying to find people and their pets,\" Wycoff said. \"It was just a lot of chaos.\"\n\nIn southern Indiana, the National Weather Service confirmed a tornado touched down early Wednesday, damaging homes in a subdivision north of the city of Sellersburg, located about 12 miles north of Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nThe Clark County Emergency Management Agency said the storm damaged 24 structures.\n\nCandice Holmes, a resident of the Lewis & Clark subdivision north of Sellersburg, said she, her husband and son sought shelter in their bathroom when they heard the approaching storm and \"the wind just picked up all at once.\"\n\n\"It was definitely a scary moment. ... And I'm glad we're alive,\" Holmes told WDRB-TV.\n\nTornadoes were also confirmed in Pennsylvania just outside Pittsburgh, in central Arkansas and in northern West Virginia. The West Virginia twister, which started early Wednesday in far eastern Ohio, was at least the 11th tornado this year in the state that sees two tornadoes in an average year.\n\nBaseball-sized hail was reported Wednesday in areas just southwest of St. Louis, Missouri. Heavy downpours caused flash flooding and at least one water rescue near Sullivan, a town that was struck by a small tornado just two days earlier. Damaging hail also was reported in the Kansas City area.\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central US were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nAcross the US, the entire week is looking stormy. The Midwest and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati -- cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.", "source": {"uri": "tasnimnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "\u062e\u0628\u0631\u06af\u0632\u0627\u0631\u06cc \u062a\u0633\u0646\u06cc\u0645"}, "authors":

Photos showed walls caved in.\n\nNo deaths had been reported in the city as of about 8 p.m., Portage Mayor Patricia Randall said, though crews were still assessing the damage.\n\nThe storm caused \"extensive\" damage in several areas of the city and leaving more than 21,000 of roughly 49,000 residents without power, Randall said in an email. As of about 8 p.m., she had heard of no deaths.\n\nPolice were assessing the damage, \"but with so many trees and wires down, travel is slow,\" Randall said.\n\nA mobile home park in nearby Kalamazoo was also \"hit hard,\" Koopman said, with \"entire homes destroyed.\"\n\nOn X, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer urged people in southwestern Michigan to \"continue monitoring severe weather alerts and follow the advice of emergency officials.\"\n\nSeveral intense tornadoes plowed across parts of southern Michigan on Tuesday evening, causing damage and leaving injuries in their wake. Areas around Kalamazoo and Union City, about 30 miles to the southeast, appeared to be hard hit. More than 30,000 customers were without power across the region following the storms.\n\nTwisters were also confirmed in Indiana and Ohio as storms swarmed the Great Lakes, Midwest and Ohio Valley. Tornado watches stretched from southern Kentucky into southern Michigan on Tuesday evening, where severe storms capable of producing tornadoes, large hail and damaging wind were possible into the night.\n\nIn Michigan, one large tornado was seen crossing U.S. Route 131 near Kalamazoo just after 6 p.m. Significant damage was reported just to the south in Portage. A second tornado was also observed near Portage a little more than an hour after the first. The National Weather Service issued \"particularly dangerous situation\" warnings for both storms, which are reserved for confirmed large and extremely dangerous twisters.\n\nEarlier in the evening, a rare tornado emergency was hoisted by the Weather Service for another storm that tracked through Union City in south-central Michigan and probably produced either a long-track tornado or multiple tornadoes that touched down intermittently for more than an hour.\n\nThe tornado emergency in Union City - reserved for the most dire situations when a large tornado threatens a population center - was the first issued in Michigan by the Weather Service.\n\nThe tornadoes struck the Midwest, Great Lakes and Ohio Valley just one day after a violent EF4 tornado on the 0-to-5 Enhanced Fujita scale for intensity devastated parts of the city of Barnsdall in northeast Oklahoma, killing one person.\n\nThe severe storms that spawned tornadoes erupted as low pressure swept from the southern Plains on Monday into the Great Lakes on Tuesday. A warm front extending east from the low pressure zone served as the main conduit for the tornado-producing thunderstorms in southern Michigan.\n\nAt one point there were multiple concurrent \"particularly dangerous situation\" tornado warnings in addition to the tornado emergency for Union City. More than three dozen tornado warnings had been issued in the Midwest and Great Lakes through 8 p.m. Eastern time.\n\nLarge hail was also observed from the rotating thunderstorms that erupted throughout the Midwest. At least 100 reports of large hail were logged by the Weather Service, growing as large as four inches in diameter in Union City and three inches in diameter in Steuben, Ind.\n\nTuesday marked the 13th day in a row with tornadoes in the Lower 48. As the active storm pattern persists, additional twisters are possible in the Tennessee Valley and Mid-South on Wednesday. Scattered severe storms could hit the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast on Thursday, before a break in severe weather Friday through the weekend.", "source": {"uri": "rsoe-edis.org", "dataType": "news",

Police are focused on life-saving efforts before beginning damage assessments, Bingaman added.\n\nThe first possible Portage tornado was seen by radar around 6:05 p.m. northwest of the city in Kalamazoo County, weather officials said.

At least 20 people were injured amid the dangerous weather, though no injuries were serious, officials reported Wednesday morning.\n\nCity officials report that two tornadoes touched down in Portage, but the NWS -- which is responsible for officially confirming whether a tornado occurred -- has only confirmed one tornado, as of this writing.\n\nThe NWS told Local 4 on Wednesday that they received 11 reports of tornadoes in southern Michigan on Tuesday night. Those reports were preliminary, however, and the NWS said it could just be multiple reports of the same tornado.\n\nIt's possible that one tornado caused all of the damage, rather than several. But officials won't know for sure until they survey the area and assess the damage. That process began Wednesday, and could continue through Friday, officials said.\n\nThe NWS' Grand Rapids office, which oversees the area, was expected to release more information after they've finished assessing damage.\n\n---> Related: Update on major damage, outages, traffic issues in Michigan city hit by tornado\n\nMany people displaced\n\nThe most significant damage caused by the at least one tornado occurred in an area bound by Centre Avenue, Oakland Drive, Schuring Road, and Westnedge Avenue, officials said.\n\nOfficials with the city of Portage also said many people in the city have been displaced due to the damage. One of the areas hardest hit was a mobile home park. You can see that footage below.\n\nAt least one shelter was open for residents who were displaced. That shelter is at First Assembly of God on Oakland Drive.\n\n\u2b07\ufe0f Watch: Our damage report from the Kalamazoo County mobile home park\n\nFedEx facility destroyed\n\nResidential and commercial buildings were badly damaged during the storm, including a FedEx facility.\n\n\"Our thoughts are with those affected by the tornado in Portage, Michigan, and we are grateful there were no serious injuries resulting from the damage to our facility at 6701 Portage Road,\" a FedEx spokesperson said in a statement. \"We continue to assess the damage, and we are implementing contingency plans to lessen any potential impacts on service. Customers with questions about their shipments can check fedex.com for updates.\"\n\nEmergency declaration in Portage\n\nPortage Mayor Patricia Randall issued an emergency declaration that will allow the city to receive resources from the state and federal governments.\n\nOfficials from Michigan State Police, the Kalamazoo County Sheriff's Office, Kalamazoo Public Safety, the West Michigan 5th District Technical Rescue Team, LifeEMS, and others were helping in the aftermath of the storms as of Wednesday.\n\nResidents were asked to check on their neighbors and stay off the roads to keep them clear for first responders.\n\n---> Video: Watch as tornado touches down in small Michigan town\n\nState of emergency also declared\n\nMichigan Gov.

(AP Photo/George Walker IV)\n\nForecasters warned a wave of dangerous storms in the U.S. could march through parts of the South early Thursday, after storms a day earlier spawned damaging tornadoes and massive hail, leaving two dead in Tennessee and one dead in North Carolina.\n\nThe storms continue an outbreak of torrential rain and tornadoes that has cut across the country this week, from the Plains to the Midwest and now the southeastern U.S. At least four people have died in storms since Monday.\n\nAmid Wednesday's storms, the National Weather Service continued issuing tornado warnings that stretch past midnight in North Carolina, Alabama, Georgia, Missouri and Kentucky. Parts of Arkansas and Mississippi were also under a tornado watch through the pre-dawn hours.\n\nOne storm that rumbled across northeastern Tennessee on Wednesday brought high winds that knocked down power lines and trees. Bob Brooks, the sheriff in Claiborne County about an hour north of Knoxville, said a 22-year-old man was in a car when he was fatally struck by one of the trees.\n\nA second person was killed in the city of Columbia in Maury County, where the National Weather Service said a likely tornado had touched down. Columbia is just south of Nashville.\n\nHomes were damaged and people injured, according to Lynn Thompson, assistant director of Maury County 911. Thompson told The Associated Press that he could not provide any further details: \"We're getting overloaded right now.\"\n\nRita Thompson, a spokesperson for Maury Regional Health, said the hospital had received five patients, including the person who died. Another was in serious condition and three had injuries that were not life-threatening, she said.\n\nThe storms also prompted the Federal Aviation Administration to issue a temporary ground stop at Nashville International Airport and the National Weather Service to issue a tornado emergency -- its highest alert level -- for other nearby areas south of the state's capital, including Chapel Hill and Eagleville.\n\nMeanwhile, torrential rain and thunderstorms led to water rescues northeast of Nashville.\n\n\"Do not attempt to travel unless you are fleeing an area subject to flooding or under an evacuation order,\" the National Weather Service warned when it issued a flash flood emergency.\n\nIn North Carolina, a state of emergency was declared Wednesday night for Gaston County, west of Charlotte, following a large storm that toppled power lines and severed trees, including one that landed on a car. One person in the car was killed and another was taken to a hospital, officials said.\n\nThe storms rolled into the region Wednesday after parts of the central United States were battered Monday by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and tornadoes, including a deadly twister that ripped through an Oklahoma town and killed one person. Then, on Tuesday, the Midwest took the brunt of the bad weather.\n\nThe National Weather Service said tornadoes touched down in parts of Michigan, Ohio and Indiana on Tuesday.\n\nIn Michigan, tornadoes swirled through the southwestern part of the state, in and around Kalamazoo County, according to the National Weather Service. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\nKalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart, leaving about 50 people temporarily trapped inside because of downed power lines.\n\nTravis Wycoff ventured out Tuesday night after seeing on radar that a tornado had touched down in the Portage area, and he said he helped an elderly couple out of their partially collapsed home and freed a service dog from another home.\n\n\"There were a lot of people running through the streets trying to find people and their pets,\" Wycoff said. \"It was just a lot of chaos.\"\n\nIn the adjacent Pavilion Township, more than a dozen homes were destroyed in a mobile home park and 16 people were injured, said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller.\n\nSamantha Smith clutched a box Wednesday afternoon outside her mother's partially wrecked home in Pavilion Township. Inside the box were her grandmother's ashes. Being able to recover the most cherished of items offered Smith a rare moment of relief amid the storm's devastation. She said her parents and brother were injured during the storm but survived.\n\n\"I have thanked God probably a billion times since this happened yesterday,\" she said. \"My kids are healthy and good. We just gotta make back up what we lost.\"\n\nTornadoes were also confirmed in Pennsylvania just outside Pittsburgh, in central Arkansas and in northern West Virginia. The West Virginia twister was at least the 11th tornado this year in the state, which sees two tornadoes in an average year.\n\nBoth the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.", "source": {"uri": "castanet.net", "dataType": "news", "title": "Castanet"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service", "type": "wiki",

(AP) -- Severe storms tore through the central and southeast U.S. late Tuesday and Wednesday, spawning damaging tornadoes, producing massive hail, and killing one person in Tennessee and another in North Carolina when trees toppled onto their vehicles.\n\nThe storm that rumbled across northeastern Tennessee brought high winds that knocked down powerlines and trees. Claiborne County Sheriff Bob Brooks said a 22-year-old man was in a car struck by one of the trees.\n\nWednesday afternoon, a tornado emergency -- the weather service's highest alert level -- was issued for an area south of Nashville including the towns of Spring Hill, Chapel Hill and Eagleville.\n\nA tornado warning had previously been issued in nearby Columbia, about 45 miles (72 kilometers) south of Nashville. People in Columbia were injured and homes were damaged, according to Lynn Thompson, assistant director of Maury County 911. Thompson told The Associated Press that he could not provide any further details: \"We're getting overloaded right now.\"\n\nIn North Carolina, a state of emergency was declared for Gaston County Wednesday evening following a large storm. First responders were working to clear roads of downed power lines and broken trees and were helping residents, officials said. The New Hope Fire Department responded to a tree down on a car. One person in the car was killed and another was taken to a hospital, officials said.\n\nMore than 135,000 customers had lost power in the state as of Wednesday evening, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nTornadoes were first reported after dark Tuesday in parts of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, according to the National Weather Service. The storms came a day after a deadly twister ripped through an Oklahoma town.\n\nThe National Weather Service confirmed tornadoes touched down Tuesday in western Ohio: five in Warren County and one each in Darke, Mercer and Auglaize counties. The weather service said crews are still surveying areas of Franklin and Butler counties to determine if tornadoes struck there, as well. Radar indicated a tornado struck Jefferson County, but teams will have to evaluate the damage to determine its rating, said Jeff Craven, a weather service meteorologist in Pittsburgh.\n\nCrews on Wednesday were able to survey the damage caused by the strong storms that contained hail and heavy rains and knocked out power to thousands of utility customers.\n\nIn Michigan, weather service meteorologist Nathan Jeruzal said the tornadoes there touched down one each in Kalamazoo, Cass and Branch counties -- all in the southwestern part of the state. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\nKalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart and more than a dozen mobile homes were destroyed. About 50 people temporarily were trapped inside the damaged facility because of downed power lines.\n\nMore than a dozen homes were destroyed in a mobile home park in adjacent Pavilion Township and 16 people were injured, said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller.\n\nSamantha Smith clutched a box Wednesday afternoon as she stepped from her mother's partially wrecked home in Pavilion Township, about 137 miles (220 kilometers) west of Detroit.

And I'm glad we're alive,\" Holmes told WDRB-TV.\n\nTornadoes were also confirmed in Pennsylvania just outside Pittsburgh, in central Arkansas and in northern West Virginia. The West Virginia twister, which started early Wednesday in far eastern Ohio, was at least the 11th tornado this year in the state that sees two tornadoes in an average year.\n\nBaseball-sized hail was reported Wednesday in areas just southwest of St. Louis, Missouri. Heavy downpours caused flash flooding and at least one water rescue near Sullivan, a town that was struck by a small tornado just two days earlier. Damaging hail also was reported in the Kansas City area.\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nAcross the U.S., the entire week is looking stormy. The Midwest and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati -- cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nMurphy reported from Oklahoma City.

At least four people have died in storms since Monday.\n\nAmid Wednesday's storms, the National Weather Service continued issuing tornado warnings that stretch past midnight in North Carolina, Alabama, Georgia, Missouri and Kentucky. Parts of Arkansas and Mississippi were also under a tornado watch through the pre-dawn hours.\n\nOne storm that rumbled across northeastern Tennessee on Wednesday brought high winds that knocked down power lines and trees. Bob Brooks, the sheriff in Claiborne County about an hour north of Knoxville, said a 22-year-old man was in a car when he was fatally struck by one of the trees.\n\nA second person was killed in the city of Columbia in Maury County, where the National Weather Service said a likely tornado had touched down. Columbia is just south of Nashville.\n\nHomes were damaged and people injured, according to Lynn Thompson, assistant director of Maury County 911. Thompson told The Associated Press that he could not provide any further details: \"We're getting overloaded right now.\" Rita Thompson, a spokesperson for Maury Regional Health, said the hospital had received five patients, including the person who died. Another was in serious condition and three had injuries that were not life-threatening, she said.\n\nThe storms also prompted the Federal Aviation Administration to issue a temporary ground stop at Nashville International Airport and the National Weather Service to issue a tornado emergency -- its highest alert level -- for other nearby areas south of the state's capital, including Chapel Hill and Eagleville.\n\nMeanwhile, torrential rain and thunderstorms led to water rescues northeast of Nashville. \"Do not attempt to travel unless you are fleeing an area subject to flooding or under an evacuation order,\" the National Weather Service warned when it issued a flash flood emergency.\n\nIn North Carolina, a state of emergency was declared Wednesday night for Gaston County, west of Charlotte, following a large storm that toppled power lines and severed trees, including one that landed on a car. One person in the car was killed and another was taken to a hospital, officials said.\n\nThe storms rolled into the region Wednesday after parts of the central United States were battered Monday by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and tornadoes, including a deadly twister that ripped through an Oklahoma town and killed one person. Then, on Tuesday, the Midwest took the brunt of the bad weather. The National Weather Service said tornadoes touched down in parts of Michigan, Ohio and Indiana on Tuesday.\n\nIn Michigan, tornadoes swirled through the southwestern part of the state, in and around Kalamazoo County, according to the National Weather Service. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\nKalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart, leaving about 50 people temporarily trapped inside because of downed power lines.\n\nTravis Wycoff ventured out Tuesday night after seeing on radar that a tornado had touched down in the Portage area, and he said he helped an elderly couple out of their partially collapsed home and freed a service dog from another home.\n\n\"There were a lot of people running through the streets trying to find people and their pets,\" Wycoff said. \"It was just a lot of chaos.\"\n\nIn the adjacent Pavilion Township, more than a dozen homes were destroyed in a mobile home park and 16 people were injured, said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller.\n\nSamantha Smith clutched a box Wednesday afternoon outside her mother's partially wrecked home in Pavilion Township. Inside the box were her grandmother's ashes. Being able to recover the most cherished of items offered Smith a rare moment of relief amid the storm's devastation. She said her parents and brother were injured during the storm but survived.\n\n\"I have thanked God probably a billion times since this happened yesterday,\" she said. \"My kids are healthy and good. We just gotta make back up what we lost.\" Tornadoes were also confirmed in Pennsylvania just outside Pittsburgh, in central Arkansas and in northern West Virginia.\n\nThe West Virginia twister was at least the 11th tornado this year in the state, which sees two tornadoes in an average year. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.", "source": {"uri": "indianexpress.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Indian Express"}, "authors": [{"uri":

(AP) -- Severe storms tore through the central and southeast U.S. late Tuesday and Wednesday, spawning damaging tornadoes, producing massive hail, and killing one person in Tennessee and another in North Carolina when trees toppled onto their vehicles.\n\nThe storm that rumbled across northeastern Tennessee brought high winds that knocked down powerlines and trees. Claiborne County Sheriff Bob Brooks said a 22-year-old man was in a car struck by one of the trees.\n\nWednesday afternoon, a tornado emergency -- the weather service's highest alert level -- was issued for an area south of Nashville including the towns of Spring Hill, Chapel Hill and Eagleville.\n\nA tornado warning had previously been issued in nearby Columbia, about 45 miles (72 kilometers) south of Nashville. People in Columbia were injured and homes were damaged, according to Lynn Thompson, assistant director of Maury County 911. Thompson told The Associated Press that he could not provide any further details: \"We're getting overloaded right now.\"\n\nIn North Carolina, a state of emergency was declared for Gaston County Wednesday evening following a large storm. First responders were working to clear roads of downed power lines and broken trees and were helping residents, officials said. The New Hope Fire Department responded to a tree down on a car. One person in the car was killed and another was taken to a hospital, officials said.\n\nMore than 135,000 customers had lost power in the state as of Wednesday evening, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nTornadoes were first reported after dark Tuesday in parts of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, according to the National Weather Service. The storms came a day after a deadly twister ripped through an Oklahoma town.\n\nThe National Weather Service confirmed tornadoes touched down Tuesday in western Ohio: five in Warren County and one each in Darke, Mercer and Auglaize counties. The weather service said crews are still surveying areas of Franklin and Butler counties to determine if tornadoes struck there, as well. Radar indicated a tornado struck Jefferson County, but teams will have to evaluate the damage to determine its rating, said Jeff Craven, a weather service meteorologist in Pittsburgh.\n\nCrews on Wednesday were able to survey the damage caused by the strong storms that contained hail and heavy rains and knocked out power to thousands of utility customers.\n\nIn Michigan, weather service meteorologist Nathan Jeruzal said the tornadoes there touched down one each in Kalamazoo, Cass and Branch counties -- all in the southwestern part of the state. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\nKalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart and more than a dozen mobile homes were destroyed. About 50 people temporarily were trapped inside the damaged facility because of downed power lines.\n\nMore than a dozen homes were destroyed in a mobile home park in adjacent Pavilion Township and 16 people were injured, said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller.\n\nSamantha Smith clutched a box Wednesday afternoon as she stepped from her mother's partially wrecked home in Pavilion Township, about 137 miles (220 kilometers) west of Detroit. Inside the box were her grandmother's ashes. Being able to recover the most cherished of items offered Smith a rare moment of relief amid the storm's devastation.\n\nHer parents and brother were injured during the storm but survived.\n\n\"I have thanked God probably a billion times since this happened yesterday,\" she said. \"My kids are healthy and good. We just gotta make back up what we lost.\"\n\nTravis Wycoff ventured out Tuesday night after seeing on radar that a tornado had touched down in the Portage area, and he said he helped an elderly couple out of their partially collapsed home and freed a service dog from a home.\n\n\"There were a lot of people running through the streets trying to find people and their pets,\" Wycoff said. \"It was just a lot of chaos.\"\n\nIn southern Indiana, the National Weather Service confirmed a tornado touched down early Wednesday, damaging homes in a subdivision north of the city of Sellersburg, located about 12 miles (19 kilometers) north of Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nThe Clark County Emergency Management Agency said the storm damaged 24 structures.\n\nCandice Holmes, a resident of the Lewis & Clark subdivision north of Sellersburg, said she, her husband and son sought shelter in their bathroom when they heard the approaching storm and \"the wind just picked up all at once.\"\n\n\"It was definitely a scary moment. ... And I'm glad we're alive,\" Holmes told WDRB-TV.\n\nTornadoes were also confirmed in Pennsylvania just outside Pittsburgh, in central Arkansas and in northern West Virginia. The West Virginia twister, which started early Wednesday in far eastern Ohio, was at least the 11th tornado this year in the state that sees two tornadoes in an average year.\n\nBaseball-sized hail was reported Wednesday in areas just southwest of St. Louis, Missouri. Heavy downpours caused flash flooding and at least one water rescue near Sullivan, a town that was struck by a small tornado just two days earlier. Damaging hail also was reported in the Kansas City area.\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nAcross the U.S., the entire week is looking stormy. The Midwest and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati -- cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nMurphy reported from Oklahoma City. Associated Press journalists around the country contributed to this report, including Rio Yamat, Heather Hollingsworth, Colleen Slevin, Jim Salter, Kathy McCormack, Sarah Brumfield, Beatrice Dupuy, Alexa St. John, Adrian Sainz, John Raby and Lisa Baumann.\n\nThe Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

(AP) -- Severe storms were tearing through the central and southeast U.S. late Tuesday and Wednesday, spawning damaging tornadoes, producing massive hail, and killing two people in Tennessee and one person in North Carolina.\n\nA storm that rumbled across northeastern Tennessee brought high winds that knocked down powerlines and trees. Claiborne County Sheriff Bob Brooks said a 22-year-old man was in a car struck by one of the trees.\n\nWednesday afternoon, a tornado emergency -- the weather service's highest alert level -- was issued for an area south of Nashville including the towns of Spring Hill, Chapel Hill and Eagleville.\n\nThe National Weather Service had previously reported a likely tornado on the ground in nearby Columbia, about 45 miles south of Nashville. People in Columbia were injured and homes were damaged, according to Lynn Thompson, assistant director of Maury County 911. Thompson told The Associated Press that he could not provide any further details: \"We're getting overloaded right now.\"\n\nRita Thompson, Marketing & Communications director with Maury Regional Health, said the hospital had received five patients. One died, another was in serious condition and three had injuries that were not life-threatening.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration issued a temporary ground stop at Nashville International Airport because of the weather, media outlets reported. Northeast of Nashville, a flash flood emergency was issued for Sumner and Robertson counties including the cities of Hendersonville and Gallatin. The National Weather Service said water rescues were ongoing in those areas and described the flooding from heavy thunderstorms as life-threatening.\n\n\"Do not attempt to travel unless you are fleeing an area subject to flooding or under an evacuation order,\" the weather agency alert said.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Nashville on Wednesday evening issued a tornado watch for parts of Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri and Tennessee until 3 a.m. CDT. The weather service continued issuing tornado warnings into the night, mostly in Tennessee, but also in Missouri, Alabama, Georgia and Texas.\n\nIn North Carolina, a state of emergency was declared for Gaston County Wednesday evening following a large storm. First responders were working to clear roads of downed power lines and broken trees and were helping residents, officials said. The New Hope Fire Department responded to a tree down on a car. One person in the car was killed and another was taken to a hospital, officials said.\n\nMore than 135,000 customers had lost power in the state as of Wednesday evening, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nThe National Weather Service confirmed tornadoes touched down Tuesday in western Ohio: five in Warren County and one each in Darke, Mercer and Auglaize counties. The weather service said crews are still surveying areas in other counties to determine if tornadoes struck there, as well. The strong storms also brought hail and heavy rains to the state and knocked out power to thousands of utility customers.\n\nIn Michigan, weather service meteorologist Nathan Jeruzal said the tornadoes there touched down one each in Kalamazoo, Cass and Branch counties -- all in the southwestern part of the state. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\nKalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart and more than a dozen mobile homes were destroyed. About 50 people temporarily were trapped inside the damaged facility because of downed power lines.\n\nMore than a dozen homes were destroyed in a mobile home park in adjacent Pavilion Township and 16 people were injured, said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller.\n\nSamantha Smith clutched a box Wednesday afternoon as she stepped from her mother's partially wrecked home in Pavilion Township, about 137 miles west of Detroit. Inside the box were her grandmother's ashes. Being able to recover the most cherished of items offered Smith a rare moment of relief amid the storm's devastation. She said her parents and brother were injured during the storm but survived.\n\n\"I have thanked God probably a billion times since this happened yesterday,\" she said. \"My kids are healthy and good. We just gotta make back up what we lost.\"\n\nTravis Wycoff ventured out Tuesday night after seeing on radar that a tornado had touched down in the Portage area, and he said he helped an elderly couple out of their partially collapsed home and freed a service dog from a home.\n\n\"There were a lot of people running through the streets trying to find people and their pets,\" Wycoff said. \"It was just a lot of chaos.\"\n\nIn southern Indiana, the National Weather Service confirmed a tornado touched down early Wednesday. The Clark County Emergency Management Agency said the storm damaged 24 structures, including homes in a subdivision north of the city of Sellersburg, located about 12 miles north of Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nCandice Holmes, a resident of the Lewis & Clark subdivision north of Sellersburg, said she, her husband and son sought shelter in their bathroom when they heard the approaching storm and \"the wind just picked up all at once.\"\n\n\"It was definitely a scary moment. ... And I'm glad we're alive,\" Holmes told WDRB-TV.\n\nTornadoes were also confirmed in Pennsylvania just outside Pittsburgh, in central Arkansas and in northern West Virginia. The West Virginia twister was at least the 11th tornado this year in the state, which sees two tornadoes in an average year.\n\nBaseball-sized hail was reported Wednesday in areas just southwest of St. Louis. Heavy downpours caused flash flooding and at least one water rescue near Sullivan, a town that was struck by a small tornado just two days earlier. Damaging hail also was reported in the Kansas City area.\n\nOn Monday, parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and tornadoes, including a deadly twister that ripped through an Oklahoma town. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nAcross the U.S., the entire week is looking stormy. The Midwest and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, St. Louis, Cincinnati, Nashville and Memphis, Tennessee -- cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\n___", "source": {"uri": "wgxa.tv", "dataType": "news", "title": "WGXA"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@wgxa.tv", "name": "Associated Press", "type":

A storm that rumbled across northeastern Tennessee brought high winds that knocked down powerlines and trees. Claiborne County Sheriff Bob Brooks said a 22-year-old man was in a car struck by one of the trees.\n\nWednesday afternoon, a tornado emergency - the weather service's highest alert level - was issued for an area south of Nashville including the towns of Spring Hill, Chapel Hill and Eagleville.\n\nThe National Weather Service had previously reported a likely tornado on the ground in nearby Columbia, about 45 miles (72 kilometers) south of Nashville. People in Columbia were injured and homes were damaged, according to Lynn Thompson, assistant director of Maury County 911. Thompson told The Associated Press that he could not provide any further details: \"We're getting overloaded right now.\"\n\nRita Thompson, Marketing & Communications director with Maury Regional Health, said the hospital had received five patients. One died, another was in serious condition and three had injuries that were not life-threatening.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration issued a temporary ground stop at Nashville International Airport because of the weather, media outlets reported. Northeast of Nashville, a flash flood emergency was issued for Sumner and Robertson counties including the cities of Hendersonville and Gallatin. The National Weather Service said water rescues were ongoing in those areas and described the flooding from heavy thunderstorms as life-threatening.\n\n\"Do not attempt to travel unless you are fleeing an area subject to flooding or under an evacuation order,\" the weather agency alert said.\n\nIn North Carolina, a state of emergency was declared for Gaston County Wednesday evening following a large storm. First responders were working to clear roads of downed power lines and broken trees and were helping residents, officials said. The New Hope Fire Department responded to a tree down on a car. One person in the car was killed and another was taken to a hospital, officials said.\n\nMore than 135,000 customers had lost power in the state as of Wednesday evening, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nTornadoes were first reported after dark Tuesday in parts of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, according to the National Weather Service. The storms came a day after a deadly twister ripped through an Oklahoma town.\n\nThe National Weather Service confirmed tornadoes touched down Tuesday in western Ohio: five in Warren County and one each in Darke, Mercer and Auglaize counties. The weather service said crews are still surveying areas in other counties to determine if tornadoes struck there, as well.\n\nCrews on Wednesday were able to survey the damage caused by the strong storms that contained hail and heavy rains and knocked out power to thousands of utility customers.\n\nIn Michigan, weather service meteorologist Nathan Jeruzal said the tornadoes there touched down one each in Kalamazoo, Cass and Branch counties - all in the southwestern part of the state. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\nKalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart and more than a dozen mobile homes were destroyed. About 50 people temporarily were trapped inside the damaged facility because of downed power lines.\n\nMore than a dozen homes were destroyed in a mobile home park in adjacent Pavilion Township and 16 people were injured, said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller.\n\nSamantha Smith clutched a box Wednesday afternoon as she stepped from her mother's partially wrecked home in Pavilion Township, about 137 miles (220 kilometers) west of Detroit. Inside the box were her grandmother's ashes. Being able to recover the most cherished of items offered Smith a rare moment of relief amid the storm's devastation.\n\nHer parents and brother were injured during the storm but survived.\n\n\"I have thanked God probably a billion times since this happened yesterday,\" she said. \"My kids are healthy and good. We just gotta make back up what we lost.\"\n\nTravis Wycoff ventured out Tuesday night after seeing on radar that a tornado had touched down in the Portage area, and he said he helped an elderly couple out of their partially collapsed home and freed a service dog from a home.\n\n\"There were a lot of people running through the streets trying to find people and their pets,\" Wycoff said. \"It was just a lot of chaos.\"\n\nIn southern Indiana, the National Weather Service confirmed a tornado touched down early Wednesday, damaging homes in a subdivision north of the city of Sellersburg, located about 12 miles (19 kilometers) north of Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nThe Clark County Emergency Management Agency said the storm damaged 24 structures.\n\nCandice Holmes, a resident of the Lewis & Clark subdivision north of Sellersburg, said she, her husband and son sought shelter in their bathroom when they heard the approaching storm and \"the wind just picked up all at once.\"\n\n\"It was definitely a scary moment. ... And I'm glad we're alive,\" Holmes told WDRB-TV.", "source": {"uri": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Times of India"}, "authors": [{"uri":

The township is located in Kalamazoo County, where 15 to 20 people had minor injuries and were transported to two area hospitals, according to the county's emergency management spokesperson Andrew Alspach.\n\nIn the neighboring city of Portage, about 7 miles south of Kalamazoo, pictures and videos showed a FedEx facility with significant roof and structural damage after a storm hit the area Tuesday evening. However, there were no serious injuries, a FedEx representative told CNN.\n\nAbout 50 people were trapped in the building due to downed wires, Taylor Koopman, a spokesperson for Kalamazoo County administrator's office, told MLive.com, adding work to clear the wires was ongoing as of 9:30 p.m. ET. However, city of Portage spokesperson Mary Beth Block told CNN in an email the building had been cleared by authorities.\n\nTwo tornadoes hit the Portage area Tuesday, the National Weather Service said.\n\n\"We have significant damage, including damage to residential and commercial buildings, trees down across many roads in the city, and several reports of gas leaks,\" Portage city officials said in a news release.\n\nThe city pleaded with its residents to \"stay home\" and \"please stay off the roads. First responders are stuck in gridlock.\"\n\nThe Village of Centreville was hit hard during a possible tornado on Tuesday, according to St. Joseph County officials. Multiple buildings, residential and commercial, were destroyed after a possible tornado touched down in Centreville on Tuesday, according to St. Joseph County Undersheriff Jason Bingaman. The storm damage ripped off roofs and flattened homes \"completely down,\" Bingaman told CNN.\n\nIn Branch County, about 60 miles south of Kalamazoo, at least seven homes were destroyed, according to Emergency Management Director Tim Miner, who added he was unable to get out and assess damage to other parts of the county.\n\nOne city in the county, Union City, was under a rare tornado emergency earlier that went into effect when \"a large and destructive tornado\" was over the area, about 10 miles northwest of Coldwater and moving northeast at 45 mph, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nAccording to the Storm Prediction Center, at least nine tornado reports were made in Michigan on Tuesday. Hail the size of softballs was also reported in some parts of the state.\n\nMore than 34,000 homes and businesses in Michigan were left without power as of early Wednesday, according to poweroutage.us. Elsewhere in the Midwest, more than 16,000 residents were in the dark in Ohio.\n\nGov. Gretchen Whitmer said her heart was going out to those impacted by the severe weather in southwest Michigan. The governor declared a state of emergency for Kalamazoo, St. Joseph, Branch and Cass counties, she said Tuesday night.\n\n\"We will work with emergency teams overnight to monitor the situation and coordinate resources for those affected. Michigan is strong and together we will rebuild,\" the governor said.\n\nAfter Tuesday brought tornadoes, large hail, damaging wind gusts and heavy rainfall mainly across the Great Lakes and the Ohio Valley, much of the Eastern US braces for another round of storms Wednesday. More than 145 million people could see some sort of storms Wednesday from Texas to Maine.\n\nTornado threat continues Wednesday\n\nA population of over 2 million people will be under the strongest severe storm threat Wednesday. The Storm Prediction Center has issued a level 4 of 5 moderate risk of severe thunderstorms across parts of southern Missouri, southern Illinois, southwestern Kentucky and northwestern and central Tennessee. Severe storms in the area are expected to ramp up Wednesday afternoon, producing some strong tornadoes greater than EF2 strength, large hail greater than 3 inches in diameter and damaging wind gusts greater than 74 mph.\n\nNortheastern Texas to western West Virginia is under a level 3 of 5 enhanced severe storm threat. That includes the cities of Memphis, St. Louis, Louisville and Little Rock. The area could see some tornadoes, hail greater than 2 inches and gusts greater than 74 mph.\n\nNumerous severe thunderstorms are likely Wednesday from parts of the mid Mississippi, Ohio and Tennessee Valleys into the southern Plains, according to the Storm Prediction Center. As severe storms hit, tornadoes, very large hail, and damaging winds are expected over the large area. Some of the tornadoes may be strong, according to the center.\n\n\"The greatest flash flooding threat also overlaps with the risk of severe thunderstorms, centered over Kentucky and Tennessee as well sections of neighboring states,\" the National Weather Service said. \"Residents and visitors are advised to have multiple ways of receiving warnings and never drive across flooded roadways.\"\n\nLower severe storm threats spread from central Texas to the southern tip of Maine and includes the cities of Dallas, Austin, Atlanta, Chicago, Washington D.C., Baltimore, New York City, Boston, Philadelphia, Indianapolis and Charlotte. There, the threats are more likely to be large hail and damaging wind gusts, but tornadoes cannot be ruled out.\n\nThere have been 13 consecutive days of tornado reports across US\n\nSpring is known for severe storms and tornadoes - and Spring 2024 is no exception. There has been at least one tornado report every day since April 25, a streak of 13 consecutive days, according to the Storm Prediction Center. A total of 287 tornadoes were reported in that time span.\n\nApril to June is peak tornado season across the US, with May traditionally seeing the most tornadoes. This month is coming off a particularly active April, where there were 300 tornadoes, the second most on record, according to the center. The all-time record occurred in April 2011, when there were 757 tornadoes.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

There, the threats are more likely to be large hail and damaging wind gusts, but tornadoes cannot be ruled out.\n\nDebris is seen from a damaged FedEx facility after a tornado in Portage, Michigan, Tuesday, May 7. Brad Devereaux/Kalamazoo Gazette/AP\n\nThere have been 13 consecutive days of tornado reports across US\n\nSpring is known for severe storms and tornadoes - and Spring 2024 is no exception. There has been at least one tornado report every day since April 25, a streak of 13 consecutive days, according to the Storm Prediction Center. A total of 287 tornadoes were reported in that time span.\n\nApril to June is peak tornado season across the US, with May traditionally seeing the most tornadoes. This month is coming off a particularly active April, where there were 300 tornadoes, the second most on record, according to the center. The all-time record occurred in April 2011, when there were 757 tornadoes.\n\nCNN's Mary Gilbert, Steve Almasy, Joe Sutton, Amy Simonson, Lucy Kafanov and Andi Babineau contributed to this report.",

Parts of Arkansas and Mississippi were also under a tornado watch through the pre-dawn hours.\n\nOne storm that rumbled across northeastern Tennessee on Wednesday brought high winds that knocked down power lines and trees. Bob Brooks, the sheriff in Claiborne County about an hour north of Knoxville, said a 22-year-old man was in a car when he was fatally struck by one of the trees.\n\nA second person was killed in the city of Columbia in Maury County, where the National Weather Service said a likely tornado had touched down. Columbia is just south of Nashville.\n\nHomes were damaged and people injured, according to Lynn Thompson, assistant director of Maury County 911. Thompson told The Associated Press that he could not provide any further details: \"We're getting overloaded right now.\"\n\nRita Thompson, a spokesperson for Maury Regional Health, said the hospital had received five patients, including the person who died. Another was in serious condition and three had injuries that were not life-threatening, she said.\n\nThe storms also prompted the Federal Aviation Administration to issue a temporary ground stop at Nashville International Airport and the National Weather Service to issue a tornado emergency -- its highest alert level -- for other nearby areas south of the state's capital, including Chapel Hill and Eagleville.\n\nMeanwhile, torrential rain and thunderstorms led to water rescues northeast of Nashville.\n\n\"Do not attempt to travel unless you are fleeing an area subject to flooding or under an evacuation order,\" the National Weather Service warned when it issued a flash flood emergency.\n\nIn North Carolina, a state of emergency was declared Wednesday night for Gaston County, west of Charlotte, following a large storm that toppled power lines and severed trees, including one that landed on a car. One person in the car was killed and another was taken to a hospital, officials said.\n\nThe storms rolled into the region Wednesday after parts of the central United States were battered Monday by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and tornadoes, including a deadly twister that ripped through an Oklahoma town and killed one person. Then, on Tuesday, the Midwest took the brunt of the bad weather.\n\nThe National Weather Service said tornadoes touched down in parts of Michigan, Ohio and Indiana on Tuesday.\n\nIn Michigan, tornadoes swirled through the southwestern part of the state, in and around Kalamazoo County, according to the National Weather Service. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\nKalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart, leaving about 50 people temporarily trapped inside because of downed power lines.\n\nTravis Wycoff ventured out Tuesday night after seeing on radar that a tornado had touched down in the Portage area, and he said he helped an elderly couple out of their partially collapsed home and freed a service dog from another home.\n\n\"There were a lot of people running through the streets trying to find people and their pets,\" Wycoff said. \"It was just a lot of chaos.\"\n\nIn the adjacent Pavilion Township, more than a dozen homes were destroyed in a mobile home park and 16 people were injured, said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller.\n\nSamantha Smith clutched a box Wednesday afternoon outside her mother's partially wrecked home in Pavilion Township. Inside the box were her grandmother's ashes. Being able to recover the most cherished of items offered Smith a rare moment of relief amid the storm's devastation. She said her parents and brother were injured during the storm but survived.\n\n\"I have thanked God probably a billion times since this happened yesterday,\" she said. \"My kids are healthy and good. We just gotta make back up what we lost.\"\n\nTornadoes were also confirmed in Pennsylvania just outside Pittsburgh, in central Arkansas and in northern West Virginia. The West Virginia twister was at least the 11th tornado this year in the state, which sees two tornadoes in an average year.\n\nBoth the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this

Being able to recover the most cherished of items offered Smith a rare moment of relief amid the storm's devastation.\n\nPHOTOS: 3 tornadoes confirmed in Michigan, 1 man killed in Tennessee as severe storms cross central US\n\n\"Finding this box is the best thing that's happened to me these past 24 hours,\" she said. \"The main thing we were all worried about was my grandma's ashes.\"\n\nHer parents and brother were injured during the storm. Her brother suffered a broken pelvis and broken back, but he and other victims all survived, Smith added.\n\n\"I have thanked God probably a billion times since this happened yesterday,\" she said. \"My kids are healthy and good. We just gotta make back up what we lost.\"\n\nIn southern Indiana, the National Weather Service confirmed a tornado with a preliminary EF-0 rating and 85 mph (137 kph) winds touched down early Wednesday, damaging homes in a subdivision north of the city of Sellersburg, located about 12 miles (19 kilometers) north of Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nThe Clark County Emergency Management Agency said the storm damaged 24 structures.\n\nCandice Holmes, a resident of the Lewis & Clark subdivision north of Sellersburg, said she, her husband and son sought shelter in their bathroom when they heard the approaching storm and \"the wind just picked up all at once.\"\n\n\"My husband and my son stepped outside, opened the door and they slammed the door and ran back to the bathroom. And they held the bathroom door shut, as it came through,\" Holmes told WDRB-TV. \"It was over as soon as it started, but it was definitely a scary moment. And I'm glad we're alive.\"\n\nSurvey teams planned to head out Wednesday to determine whether tornadoes struck locations in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia, according to Jeff Craven, the meteorologist-in-charge in the weather service's Pittsburgh office.\n\nJust outside of Pittsburgh, a weather service team confirmed that a brief tornado with maximum winds of 105 mph (169 kph) overturned a trailer and snapped more than a dozen trees early Wednesday in Findlay Township, Pennsylvania.\n\nBaseball-sized hail was reported Wednesday in areas just southwest of St. Louis, Missouri. Heavy downpours caused flash flooding and at least one water rescue near Sullivan, a town that was struck by a small tornado just two days earlier, destroying a bar and damaging the high school. Damaging hail also was reported in the Kansas City area.\n\nRadar indicated Hancock County, West Virginia, and Jefferson County, Ohio, were hit by tornadoes, but teams will have to evaluate the damage to determine their rating, Craven said.\n\nHancock County Schools in West Virginia closed schools Wednesday because of \"extensive overnight weather issues\" in the county. News outlets reported damaged buildings and power outages.\n\nA National Weather Service team also was headed to Hot Springs, Arkansas, to survey damage and determine the strength of a tornado that hit early Wednesday morning, forecaster Tabitha Clarke said.\n\nThe tornado damaged some homes, uprooted trees and downed power lines. There were no immediate reports of injuries from the tornado, according to the state Division of Emergency Management.\n\nIn Portage, Michigan, about 50 people temporarily were trapped inside a damaged FedEx facility because of downed power lines. More than a dozen homes were destroyed in a mobile home park in adjacent Pavilion Township and 16 people were injured, said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller.\n\n\"We found homes in the roadway,\" Fuller said late Tuesday. \"We found homes in neighbors' homes. We found large trees in homes.\"\n\nPower was knocked out to more than 20,000 people.\n\n\"We're looking at homes throughout this community that are totally gone, they've been demolished,\" Fuller said in the light of day at Pavilion Estates mobile home park.\n\nA home where seven people were living \"is totally on its top,\" he said. \"They were able to self-rescue and get somewhere safe and came back today.\"\n\nTravis Wycoff ventured out Tuesday night after seeing on radar that a tornado had touched down in the Portage area. About five minutes later, he came upon the aftermath.\n\n\"There were a lot of people running through the streets trying to find people and their pets,\" Wycoff said. \"It was just a lot of chaos.\"\n\nWycoff said he helped an elderly couple out of their partially collapsed home and also freed a service dog from a home whose owner was at work.\n\nMore than 30,000 customers were without power in Michigan early Wednesday, and an additional 10,000 in Ohio, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nAcross the U.S., the entire week is looking stormy. The Midwest and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati - cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nOn Monday night, a deadly twister in Oklahoma tore through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall. At least one person was killed and another was missing. Dozens of homes were destroyed.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit Barnsdall in five weeks - a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles.\n\nAreas in Oklahoma, including Sulphur and Holdenville, are still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month.", "source":

Claiborne County Sheriff Bob Brooks said a 22-year-old man was in a car struck by one of the trees.\n\nWednesday afternoon, a tornado emergency -- the weather service's highest alert level -- was issued for an area south of Nashville including the towns of Spring Hill, Chapel Hill and Eagleville.\n\nA tornado warning had previously been issued in nearby Columbia, about 45 miles (72 kilometres) south of Nashville. People in Columbia were injured and homes were damaged, according to Lynn Thompson, assistant director of Maury County 911. Thompson told The Associated Press that he could not provide any further details: \"We're getting overloaded right now.\"\n\nIn North Carolina, a state of emergency was declared for Gaston County Wednesday evening following a large storm. First responders were working to clear roads of downed power lines and broken trees and were helping residents, officials said. The New Hope Fire Department responded to a tree down on a car. One person in the car was killed and another was taken to a hospital, officials said.\n\nMore than 135,000 customers had lost power in the state as of Wednesday evening, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nTornadoes were first reported after dark Tuesday in parts of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, according to the U.S. National Weather Service. The storms came a day after a deadly twister ripped through an Oklahoma town.\n\nThe National Weather Service confirmed tornadoes touched down Tuesday in western Ohio: five in Warren County and one each in Darke, Mercer and Auglaize counties. The weather service said crews are still surveying areas of Franklin and Butler counties to determine if tornadoes struck there, as well. Radar indicated a tornado struck Jefferson County, but teams will have to evaluate the damage to determine its rating, said Jeff Craven, a weather service meteorologist in Pittsburgh.\n\nCrews on Wednesday were able to survey the damage caused by the strong storms that contained hail and heavy rains and knocked out power to thousands of utility customers.\n\nIn Michigan, weather service meteorologist Nathan Jeruzal said the tornadoes there touched down one each in Kalamazoo, Cass and Branch counties -- all in the southwestern part of the state. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\nKalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart and more than a dozen mobile homes were destroyed. About 50 people temporarily were trapped inside the damaged facility because of downed power lines.\n\nMore than a dozen homes were destroyed in a mobile home park in adjacent Pavilion Township and 16 people were injured, said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller.\n\nSamantha Smith clutched a box Wednesday afternoon as she stepped from her mother's partially wrecked home in Pavilion Township, about 137 miles (220 kilometres) west of Detroit. Inside the box were her grandmother's ashes. Being able to recover the most cherished of items offered Smith a rare moment of relief amid the storm's devastation.\n\nHer parents and brother were injured during the storm but survived.\n\n\"I have thanked God probably a billion times since this happened yesterday,\" she said. \"My kids are healthy and good. We just gotta make back up what we lost.\"\n\nTravis Wycoff ventured out Tuesday night after seeing on radar that a tornado had touched down in the Portage area, and he said he helped an elderly couple out of their partially collapsed home and freed a service dog from a home.\n\n\"There were a lot of people running through the streets trying to find people and their pets,\" Wycoff said. \"It was just a lot of chaos.\"\n\nIn southern Indiana, the National Weather Service confirmed a tornado touched down early Wednesday, damaging homes in a subdivision north of the city of Sellersburg, located about 12 miles (19 kilometres) north of Louisville, Ky.\n\nThe Clark County Emergency Management Agency said the storm damaged 24 structures.\n\nCandice Holmes, a resident of the Lewis & Clark subdivision north of Sellersburg, said she, her husband and son sought shelter in their bathroom when they heard the approaching storm and \"the wind just picked up all at once.\"\n\n\"It was definitely a scary moment. ... And I'm glad we're alive,\" Holmes told WDRB-TV.\n\nTornadoes were also confirmed in Pennsylvania just outside Pittsburgh, in central Arkansas and in northern West Virginia. The West Virginia twister, which started early Wednesday in far eastern Ohio, was at least the 11th tornado this year in the state that sees two tornadoes in an average year.\n\nBaseball-sized hail was reported Wednesday in areas just southwest of St. Louis, Mo. Heavy downpours caused flash flooding and at least one water rescue near Sullivan, a town that was struck by a small tornado just two days earlier. Damaging hail also was reported in the Kansas City area.\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nAcross the U.S., the entire week is looking stormy. The Midwest and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati -- cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nMurphy reported from Oklahoma City.

(AP) -- Severe storms tore through the central and southeast U.S. late Tuesday and Wednesday, spawning damaging tornadoes, producing massive hail, and killing one person in Tennessee and another in North Carolina when trees toppled onto their vehicles.\n\nThe storm that rumbled across northeastern Tennessee brought high winds that knocked down powerlines and trees. Claiborne County Sheriff Bob Brooks said a 22-year-old man was in a car struck by one of the trees.\n\nWednesday afternoon, a tornado emergency -- the weather service's highest alert level -- was issued for an area south of Nashville including the towns of Spring Hill, Chapel Hill and Eagleville.\n\nThe National Weather Service had previously reported a likely tornado on the ground in nearby Columbia, about 45 miles (72 kilometers) south of Nashville. People in Columbia were injured and homes were damaged, according to Lynn Thompson, assistant director of Maury County 911. Thompson told The Associated Press that he could not provide any further details: \"We're getting overloaded right now.\"\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration issued a temporary ground stop at Nashville International Airport because of the weather, media outlets reported. Northeast of Nashville, a flash flood emergency was issued for Sumner and Robertson counties including the cities of Hendersonville and Gallatin. The National Weather Service said water rescues were ongoing in those areas and described the flooding from heavy thunderstorms as life-threatening.\n\n\"Do not attempt to travel unless you are fleeing an area subject to flooding or under an evacuation order,\" the weather agency alert said.\n\nIn North Carolina, a state of emergency was declared for Gaston County Wednesday evening following a large storm. First responders were working to clear roads of downed power lines and broken trees and were helping residents, officials said. The New Hope Fire Department responded to a tree down on a car. One person in the car was killed and another was taken to a hospital, officials said.\n\nMore than 135,000 customers had lost power in the state as of Wednesday evening, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nTornadoes were first reported after dark Tuesday in parts of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, according to the National Weather Service. The storms came a day after a deadly twister ripped through an Oklahoma town.\n\nThe National Weather Service confirmed tornadoes touched down Tuesday in western Ohio: five in Warren County and one each in Darke, Mercer and Auglaize counties. The weather service said crews are still surveying areas of Franklin and Butler counties to determine if tornadoes struck there, as well. Radar indicated a tornado struck Jefferson County, but teams will have to evaluate the damage to determine its rating, said Jeff Craven, a weather service meteorologist in Pittsburgh.\n\nCrews on Wednesday were able to survey the damage caused by the strong storms that contained hail and heavy rains and knocked out power to thousands of utility customers.\n\nIn Michigan, weather service meteorologist Nathan Jeruzal said the tornadoes there touched down one each in Kalamazoo, Cass and Branch counties -- all in the southwestern part of the state. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\nKalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart and more than a dozen mobile homes were destroyed. About 50 people temporarily were trapped inside the damaged facility because of downed power lines.\n\nMore than a dozen homes were destroyed in a mobile home park in adjacent Pavilion Township and 16 people were injured, said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller.\n\nSamantha Smith clutched a box Wednesday afternoon as she stepped from her mother's partially wrecked home in Pavilion Township, about 137 miles (220 kilometers) west of Detroit. Inside the box were her grandmother's ashes. Being able to recover the most cherished of items offered Smith a rare moment of relief amid the storm's devastation.\n\nHer parents and brother were injured during the storm but survived.\n\n\"I have thanked God probably a billion times since this happened yesterday,\" she said. \"My kids are healthy and good. We just gotta make back up what we lost.\"\n\nTravis Wycoff ventured out Tuesday night after seeing on radar that a tornado had touched down in the Portage area, and he said he helped an elderly couple out of their partially collapsed home and freed a service dog from a home.\n\n\"There were a lot of people running through the streets trying to find people and their pets,\" Wycoff said. \"It was just a lot of chaos.\"\n\nIn southern Indiana, the National Weather Service confirmed a tornado touched down early Wednesday, damaging homes in a subdivision north of the city of Sellersburg, located about 12 miles (19 kilometers) north of Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nThe Clark County Emergency Management Agency said the storm damaged 24 structures.\n\nCandice Holmes, a resident of the Lewis & Clark subdivision north of Sellersburg, said she, her husband and son sought shelter in their bathroom when they heard the approaching storm and \"the wind just picked up all at once.\"\n\n\"It was definitely a scary moment. ... And I'm glad we're alive,\" Holmes told WDRB-TV.\n\nTornadoes were also confirmed in Pennsylvania just outside Pittsburgh, in central Arkansas and in northern West Virginia. The West Virginia twister, which started early Wednesday in far eastern Ohio, was at least the 11th tornado this year in the state that sees two tornadoes in an average year.\n\nBaseball-sized hail was reported Wednesday in areas just southwest of St. Louis, Missouri. Heavy downpours caused flash flooding and at least one water rescue near Sullivan, a town that was struck by a small tornado just two days earlier. Damaging hail also was reported in the Kansas City area.\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nAcross the U.S., the entire week is looking stormy. The Midwest and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati -- cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.", "source": {"uri": "mb.com.ph", "dataType": "news", "title": "Manila Bulletin"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Parts of Arkansas and Mississippi were also under a tornado watch through the pre-dawn hours.\n\nOne storm that rumbled across northeastern Tennessee on Wednesday brought high winds that knocked down power lines and trees. Bob Brooks, the sheriff in Claiborne County about an hour north of Knoxville, said a 22-year-old man was in a car when he was fatally struck by one of the trees.\n\nA second person was killed in the city of Columbia in Maury County, where the National Weather Service said a likely tornado had touched down.

(AP) -- Severe storms tore through the central and southeast U.S. late Tuesday and Wednesday, spawning damaging tornadoes, producing massive hail, and killing one person in Tennessee and another in North Carolina when trees toppled onto their vehicles.\n\nThe storm that rumbled across northeastern Tennessee brought high winds that knocked down powerlines and trees. Claiborne County Sheriff Bob Brooks said a 22-year-old man was in a car struck by one of the trees.\n\nWednesday afternoon, a tornado emergency -- the weather service's highest alert level -- was issued for an area south of Nashville including the towns of Spring Hill, Chapel Hill and Eagleville.\n\nA tornado warning had previously been issued in nearby Columbia, about 45 miles (72 kilometers) south of Nashville. People in Columbia were injured and homes were damaged, according to Lynn Thompson, assistant director of Maury County 911. Thompson told The Associated Press that he could not provide any further details: \"We're getting overloaded right now.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nIn North Carolina, a state of emergency was declared for Gaston County Wednesday evening following a large storm. First responders were working to clear roads of downed power lines and broken trees and were helping residents, officials said. The New Hope Fire Department responded to a tree down on a car. One person in the car was killed and another was taken to a hospital, officials said.\n\nMore than 135,000 customers had lost power in the state as of Wednesday evening, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nTornadoes were first reported after dark Tuesday in parts of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, according to the National Weather Service. The storms came a day after a deadly twister ripped through an Oklahoma town.\n\nThe National Weather Service confirmed tornadoes touched down Tuesday in western Ohio: five in Warren County and one each in Darke, Mercer and Auglaize counties. The weather service said crews are still surveying areas of Franklin and Butler counties to determine if tornadoes struck there, as well. Radar indicated a tornado struck Jefferson County, but teams will have to evaluate the damage to determine its rating, said Jeff Craven, a weather service meteorologist in Pittsburgh.\n\nCrews on Wednesday were able to survey the damage caused by the strong storms that contained hail and heavy rains and knocked out power to thousands of utility customers.\n\nIn Michigan, weather service meteorologist Nathan Jeruzal said the tornadoes there touched down one each in Kalamazoo, Cass and Branch counties -- all in the southwestern part of the state. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\nKalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart and more than a dozen mobile homes were destroyed. About 50 people temporarily were trapped inside the damaged facility because of downed power lines.\n\nMore than a dozen homes were destroyed in a mobile home park in adjacent Pavilion Township and 16 people were injured, said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller.\n\nSamantha Smith clutched a box Wednesday afternoon as she stepped from her mother's partially wrecked home in Pavilion Township, about 137 miles (220 kilometers) west of Detroit. Inside the box were her grandmother's ashes. Being able to recover the most cherished of items offered Smith a rare moment of relief amid the storm's devastation.\n\nHer parents and brother were injured during the storm but survived.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"I have thanked God probably a billion times since this happened yesterday,\" she said. \"My kids are healthy and good. We just gotta make back up what we lost.\"\n\nTravis Wycoff ventured out Tuesday night after seeing on radar that a tornado had touched down in the Portage area, and he said he helped an elderly couple out of their partially collapsed home and freed a service dog from a home.\n\n\"There were a lot of people running through the streets trying to find people and their pets,\" Wycoff said. \"It was just a lot of chaos.\"\n\nIn southern Indiana, the National Weather Service confirmed a tornado touched down early Wednesday, damaging homes in a subdivision north of the city of Sellersburg, located about 12 miles (19 kilometers) north of Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nThe Clark County Emergency Management Agency said the storm damaged 24 structures.\n\nCandice Holmes, a resident of the Lewis & Clark subdivision north of Sellersburg, said she, her husband and son sought shelter in their bathroom when they heard the approaching storm and \"the wind just picked up all at once.\"\n\n\"It was definitely a scary moment. ... And I'm glad we're alive,\" Holmes told WDRB-TV.\n\nTornadoes were also confirmed in Pennsylvania just outside Pittsburgh, in central Arkansas and in northern West Virginia. The West Virginia twister, which started early Wednesday in far eastern Ohio, was at least the 11th tornado this year in the state that sees two tornadoes in an average year.\n\nBaseball-sized hail was reported Wednesday in areas just southwest of St. Louis, Missouri. Heavy downpours caused flash flooding and at least one water rescue near Sullivan, a town that was struck by a small tornado just two days earlier. Damaging hail also was reported in the Kansas City area.\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nAcross the U.S., the entire week is looking stormy. The Midwest and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati -- cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nMurphy reported from Oklahoma City. Associated Press journalists around the country contributed to this report, including Rio Yamat, Heather Hollingsworth, Colleen Slevin, Jim Salter, Kathy McCormack, Sarah Brumfield, Beatrice Dupuy, Alexa St. John, Adrian Sainz, John Raby and Lisa Baumann.\n\nThe Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Kalamazoo, Cass, and Branch counties in Michigan experienced tornadoes, causing significant damage. The storms also brought high winds, downing power lines and trees. In southeastern Indiana, an EF-0 tornado damaged homes in Sellersburg. Survey teams are assessing potential tornado damage in Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, and Arkansas. Portage, Michigan, suffered significant damage, with homes destroyed and people trapped in a FedEx facility. Over 30,000 customers in Michigan and 10,000 in Ohio lost power. Michigan Governor Whitmer declared a state of emergency. The Midwest and South are expected to face more severe weather this week.\n\nThree tornadoes have been confirmed in Michigan as severe storms barreled through the central US early Wednesday, killing one man in Tennessee when a tree toppled onto a vehicle he was in.\n\nThe storm that rumbled across northeastern Tennessee brought high winds that knocked down powerlines and trees. Claiborne County Sheriff Bob Brooks said a 22-year-old man was in a car struck by one of the trees.\n\nNational Weather Service meteorologist Nathan Jeruzal said the tornadoes in Michigan touched down one each in Kalamazoo, Cass and Branch counties -- all in the southwestern part of the state.\n\nKalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart and more than a dozen mobile homes were destroyed.\n\nTornadoes were first reported after dark Tuesday in parts of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, while portions of Illinois, Kentucky and Missouri were also under a tornado watch, according to the National Weather Service. The storms came a day after a deadly twister ripped through an Oklahoma town.\n\nSamantha Smith clutched a box Wednesday afternoon as she stepped from her mother's partially wrecked home in Michigan's Pavilion Township, about 137 miles (220 kilometers) west of Detroit. Inside the box were her grandmother's ashes. Being able to recover the most cherished of items offered Smith a rare moment of relief amid the storm's devastation.\n\n\"Finding this box is the best thing that's happened to me these past 24 hours,\" she said. \"The main thing we were all worried about was my grandma's ashes.\" Her parents and brother were injured during the storm. Her brother suffered a broken pelvis and broken back, but he and other victims all survived, Smith added.\n\n\"I have thanked God probably a billion times since this happened yesterday,\" she said. \"My kids are healthy and good. We just gotta make back up what we lost.\" In southern Indiana, the National Weather Service confirmed a tornado with a preliminary EF-0 rating and 85 mph (137 kph) winds touched down early Wednesday, damaging homes in a subdivision north of the city of Sellersburg, located about 12 miles (19 kilometers) north of Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nThe Clark County Emergency Management Agency said the storm damaged 24 structures.\n\nCandice Holmes, a resident of the Lewis & Clark subdivision north of Sellersburg, said she, her husband and son sought shelter in their bathroom when they heard the approaching storm and \"the wind just picked up all at once.\" \"My husband and my son stepped outside, opened the door and they slammed the door and ran back to the bathroom. And they held the bathroom door shut, as it came through,\" Holmes told WDRB-TV. \"It was over as soon as it started, but it was definitely a scary moment. And I'm glad we're alive.\" Survey teams planned to head out Wednesday to determine whether tornadoes struck locations in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia, according to Jeff Craven, the meteorologist-in-charge in the weather service's Pittsburgh office.\n\nRadar indicated Hancock County, West Virginia, and in Jefferson County, Ohio, were hit by tornadoes, but teams will have to evaluate the damage to determine their rating, Craven said.\n\nHancock County Schools in West Virginia closed schools Wednesday because of \"extensive overnight weather issues\" in the county. News outlets reported damaged buildings and power outages.\n\nA National Weather Service team also was headed to Hot Springs, Arkansas, to survey damage and determine the strength of a tornado that hit early Wednesday morning, forecaster Tabitha Clarke said.\n\nThe tornado damaged some homes, uprooted trees and downed power lines. There were no immediate reports of injuries from the tornado, according to the state Division of Emergency Management.\n\nIn Portage, Michigan, about 50 people temporarily were trapped inside a damaged FedEx facility because of downed power lines. More than a dozen homes were destroyed in a mobile home park in adjacent Pavilion Township and 16 people were injured, said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller.\n\n\"We found homes in the roadway,\" Fuller said late Tuesday. \"We found homes in neighbors' homes. We found large trees in homes.\" Power was knocked out to more than 20,000 people.\n\n\"We're looking at homes throughout this community that are totally gone, they've been demolished,\" Fuller said in the light of day at Pavilion Estates mobile home park.\n\nA home where seven people were living \"is totally on its top,\" he said. \"They were able to self-rescue and get somewhere safe and came back today.\" Travis Wycoff ventured out Tuesday night after seeing on radar that a tornado had touched down in the Portage area. About five minutes later, he came upon the aftermath.\n\n\"There were a lot of people running through the streets trying to find people and their pets,\" Wycoff said. \"It was just a lot of chaos.\" Wycoff said he helped an elderly couple out of their partially collapsed home and also freed a service dog from a home whose owner was at work.\n\nMore than 30,000 customers were without power in Michigan early Wednesday, and an additional 10,000 in Ohio, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nAcross the US, the entire week is looking stormy. The Midwest and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati -- cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nOn Monday night, a deadly twister in Oklahoma tore through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall. At least one person was killed and another was missing. Dozens of homes were destroyed.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit Barnsdall in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles.\n\nAreas in Oklahoma, including Sulphur and Holdenville, are still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month.(AP) RUP

Amid Wednesday's storms, the National Weather Service continued issuing tornado warnings that stretch past midnight in North Carolina, Alabama, Georgia, Missouri and Kentucky.\n\nParts of Arkansas and Mississippi were also under a tornado watch through the pre-dawn hours, according to a map it published as part of its warnings. One storm that rumbled across northeastern Tennessee on Wednesday brought high winds that knocked down power lines and trees. One video showed large hailstones battering vehicles and homes in the vicinity of Fire Station 1 in downtown Clarksville, which lies on Tennessee's border with Kentucky.\n\nOther videos shows trees toppled by heavy winds, and cars wading through inches of water that had collected on roads. The sheriff in Claiborne County, which lies about an hour north of Knoxville, said a 22-year-old man was in a car when he was fatally struck by one of the trees. A second person was killed in the city of Columbia in Maury County, also in Tennessee, where the National Weather Service said a likely tornado had touched down. Homes were damaged and people injured, according to Lynn Thompson, assistant director of Maury County 911. Thompson told The Associated Press that he could not provide any further details: 'We're getting overloaded right now.'\n\nRita Thompson, a spokesperson for Maury Regional Health, said the hospital had received five patients, including the person who died. Another was in serious condition and three had injuries that were not life-threatening, she said. The storms also prompted the Federal Aviation Administration to issue a temporary ground stop at Nashville International Airport and the National Weather Service to issue a tornado emergency - its highest alert level - for other nearby areas south of the state's capital, including Chapel Hill and Eagleville. Meanwhile, torrential rain and thunderstorms led to water rescues northeast of Nashville. 'Do not attempt to travel unless you are fleeing an area subject to flooding or under an evacuation order,' the National Weather Service warned when it issued a flash flood emergency.\n\nIn North Carolina, a state of emergency was declared Wednesday night for Gaston County, west of Charlotte, following a large storm that toppled power lines and severed trees, including one that landed on a car. One person in the car was killed and another was taken to a hospital, officials said. The storms rolled into the region Wednesday after parts of the central United States were battered Monday by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and tornadoes, including a deadly twister that ripped through an Oklahoma town and killed one person. Then, on Tuesday, the Midwest took the brunt of the bad weather.\n\nThe National Weather Service said tornadoes touched down in parts of Michigan, Ohio and Indiana on Tuesday. In Michigan, tornadoes swirled through the southwestern part of the state, in and around Kalamazoo County, according to the National Weather Service. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties. Kalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart, leaving about 50 people temporarily trapped inside because of downed power lines.\n\nKalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller said more than a dozen mobile homes in Pavilion Township were 'totally destroyed.' At least 16 people, he added, were injured there, though the injuries were not life-threatening. 'The clean-up efforts are tremendous. We're looking at homes throughout this community that are totally gone, they've been demolished,' Fuller said. Homes were completely flipped over and cars were smashed by debris and trees moved by the storm. A home where seven people were living 'is totally on its top,' he said. 'They were able to self-rescue and get somewhere safe and came back today.' 'We found homes in the roadway,' the sheriff said late on Tuesday. 'We found homes in neighbors' homes. We found large trees in homes.'\n\nTravis Wycoff ventured out Tuesday night after seeing on radar that a tornado had touched down in the Portage area, and he said he helped an elderly couple out of their partially collapsed home and freed a service dog from another home. 'There were a lot of people running through the streets trying to find people and their pets,' Wycoff said. 'It was just a lot of chaos.'\n\nSamantha Smith clutched a box Wednesday afternoon outside her mother\u00b4s partially wrecked home in Pavilion Township. Inside the box were her grandmother\u00b4s ashes. Being able to recover the most cherished of items offered Smith a rare moment of relief amid the storm's devastation. She said her parents and brother were injured during the storm but survived. 'I have thanked God probably a billion times since this happened yesterday,' she said. 'My kids are healthy and good. We just gotta make back up what we lost.'\n\nTornadoes were also confirmed in Pennsylvania just outside Pittsburgh, in central Arkansas and in northern West Virginia. The West Virginia twister was at least the 11th tornado this year in the state, which sees two tornadoes in an average year. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

Thousands more are under weather warnings.\n\nThe National Weather Service (NWS) has issued its first tornado emergency for Michigan, the highest alert level.\n\nTaylor Koopman, of the Kalamazoo County Administrator's office, told MLive.com that 50 people were trapped in the partially destroyed FedEx facility.\n\nCollapsed wires and debris must be removed in order to reach the group, she said, adding that it remained an \"active scene\".\n\n\"TAKE COVER NOW,\" the NWS warned residents of Portage, where the depot is located, earlier on Tuesday.\n\n\"Our thoughts are with those affected by the tornado in Portage, Michigan, and we are grateful there were no serious injuries resulting from the damage to our facility,\" FedEx said in a statement.\n\nSevere weather across West Michigan has led to multiple tornado watches and warnings, as well as a severe thunderstorm warning.\n\nA tornado emergency, the most severe type of tornado alert issued by the service, tells people that a tornado is imminent or has already been spotted in the area.\n\nA lower tornado watch remains in effect for several counties in southeast Michigan, as well as parts of Indiana and Kentucky. -- BBC",

Parts of Arkansas and Mississippi were also under a tornado watch through the pre-dawn hours.\n\nOne storm that rumbled across northeastern Tennessee on Wednesday brought high winds that knocked down power lines and trees. Bob Brooks, the sheriff in Claiborne County about an hour north of Knoxville, said a 22-year-old man was in a car when he was fatally struck by one of the trees.\n\nA second person was killed in the city of Columbia in Maury County, where the National Weather Service said a likely tornado had touched down. Columbia is just south of Nashville.\n\nHomes were damaged and people injured, according to Lynn Thompson, assistant director of Maury County 911. Thompson told The Associated Press that he could not provide any further details: \"We're getting overloaded right now.\"\n\nRita Thompson, a spokesperson for Maury Regional Health, said the hospital had received five patients, including the person who died. Another was in serious condition and three had injuries that were not life-threatening, she said.\n\nThe storms also prompted the Federal Aviation Administration to issue a temporary ground stop at Nashville International Airport and the National Weather Service to issue a tornado emergency -- its highest alert level -- for other nearby areas south of the state's capital, including Chapel Hill and Eagleville.\n\nMeanwhile, torrential rain and thunderstorms led to water rescues northeast of Nashville.\n\n\"Do not attempt to travel unless you are fleeing an area subject to flooding or under an evacuation order,\" the National Weather Service warned when it issued a flash flood emergency.\n\nIn North Carolina, a state of emergency was declared Wednesday night for Gaston County, west of Charlotte, following a large storm that toppled power lines and severed trees, including one that landed on a car. One person in the car was killed and another was taken to a hospital, officials said.\n\nThe storms rolled into the region Wednesday after parts of the central United States were battered Monday by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and tornadoes, including a deadly twister that ripped through an Oklahoma town and killed one person. Then, on Tuesday, the Midwest took the brunt of the bad weather.\n\nThe National Weather Service said tornadoes touched down in parts of Michigan, Ohio and Indiana on Tuesday.\n\nIn Michigan, tornadoes swirled through the southwestern part of the state, in and around Kalamazoo County, according to the National Weather Service. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\nKalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart, leaving about 50 people temporarily trapped inside because of downed power lines.\n\nTravis Wycoff ventured out Tuesday night after seeing on radar that a tornado had touched down in the Portage area, and he said he helped an elderly couple out of their partially collapsed home and freed a service dog from another home.\n\n\"There were a lot of people running through the streets trying to find people and their pets,\" Wycoff said. \"It was just a lot of chaos.\"\n\nIn the adjacent Pavilion Township, more than a dozen homes were destroyed in a mobile home park and 16 people were injured, said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller.\n\nSamantha Smith clutched a box Wednesday afternoon outside her mother's partially wrecked home in Pavilion Township. Inside the box were her grandmother's ashes. Being able to recover the most cherished of items offered Smith a rare moment of relief amid the storm's devastation. She said her parents and brother were injured during the storm but survived.\n\n\"I have thanked God probably a billion times since this happened yesterday,\" she said. \"My kids are healthy and good. We just gotta make back up what we lost.\"\n\nTornadoes were also confirmed in Pennsylvania just outside Pittsburgh, in central Arkansas and in northern West Virginia. The West Virginia twister was at least the 11th tornado this year in the state, which sees two tornadoes in an average year.\n\nBoth the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nDownload the FOX13 Memphis app to receive alerts from breaking news in your neighborhood.\n\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD\n\nTrending stories:\n\nTornado Watch issued for parts of the Mid-South

One person in the car was killed and another was taken to a hospital, officials said.\n\nThe storms rolled into the region Wednesday after parts of the central United States were battered Monday by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and tornadoes, including a deadly twister that ripped through an Oklahoma town and killed one person. Then, on Tuesday, the Midwest took the brunt of the bad weather.\n\nThe National Weather Service said tornadoes touched down in parts of Michigan, Ohio and Indiana on Tuesday.\n\nIn Michigan, tornadoes swirled through the southwestern part of the state, in and around Kalamazoo County, according to the National Weather Service. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\nKalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart, leaving about 50 people temporarily trapped inside because of downed power lines.\n\nTravis Wycoff ventured out Tuesday night after seeing on radar that a tornado had touched down in the Portage area, and he said he helped an elderly couple out of their partially collapsed home and freed a service dog from another home.\n\n\"There were a lot of people running through the streets trying to find people and their pets,\" Wycoff said. \"It was just a lot of chaos.\"\n\nIn the adjacent Pavilion Township, more than a dozen homes were destroyed in a mobile home park and 16 people were injured, said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller.\n\nSamantha Smith clutched a box Wednesday afternoon outside her mother's partially wrecked home in Pavilion Township. Inside the box were her grandmother's ashes. Being able to recover the most cherished of items offered Smith a rare moment of relief amid the storm's devastation. She said her parents and brother were injured during the storm but survived.\n\n\"I have thanked God probably a billion times since this happened yesterday,\" she said. \"My kids are healthy and good. We just gotta make back up what we lost.\"\n\nTornadoes were also confirmed in Pennsylvania just outside Pittsburgh, in central Arkansas and in northern West Virginia. The West Virginia twister was at least the 11th tornado this year in the state, which sees two tornadoes in an average year.\n\nBoth the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\n___\n\nCappelletti and White reported from Detroit.

On Tuesday, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for Kalamazoo, St. Joseph, Branch, and Cass counties in a statement on X.\n\n'My heart goes out to all those affected by tonight's severe weather in southwest Michigan. Emergency teams are on the ground and working to assist Michiganders. I encourage everyone to continue monitoring severe weather alerts and follow the advice of emergency officials,' Gretchen Whitmer said in a statement on X.\n\nShe also confirmed the State Emergency Operations center was activated. 'We will continue monitoring the situation and coordinating efforts overnight.' It is the first time on record (going back to 1999) that the state has ever issued a tornado emergency, ABC reports.\n\nA tornado that struck Portage, a city with a population of 50,000 in Southern Michigan, left downed powerlines, trees, and other debris in its path of destruction.\n\nPortage Mayor Patricia Randall said first responders are still assessing the widespread damage, but 'but with so many trees and wires down, travel is slow,' per The Washington Post. Seven structures, mostly homes, have been destroyed from a tornado that moved northeast out of St. Joseph County, Branch County Emergency Manager Tim Miner told the Detroit Free Press . He confirmed that there were no deaths or injuries/ A little over an hour later, a second tornado touched down around 7:20 pm.\n\nA third tornado was confirmed by the National Weather service just west of Battle Creek, near Galesburg, moving northeast at 40 mph. Up until 9 p.m., a severe thunderstorm warning that includes quarter-sized hail and wind gusts up to 60 mph is in place for portions of Calhoun County. Portage Mayor Patricia Randall 'with so many trees and wires down, travel is slow,' per The Washington Post. Close to 20,000 people are without power, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nAbout 50 people became trapped inside a FedEx distribution facility. Downed powerlines in the area delayed first responders from beginning their rescue mission. The roof partially collapsed as a result of the tornado, reported mlive.com. All employees have been accounted for, according to the City of Portage. FedEx issued a statement regarding the current situation.\n\n'Our thoughts are with those affected by the tornado in Portage, Michigan, and we are grateful there were no serious injuries resulting from the damage to our facility at 6701 Portage Road,' company spokeswoman Shannon Davis said. 'We continue to assess the damage, and we are implementing contingency plans to lessen any potential impacts on service.'\n\nA mobile home park, Pavillion Estates was also suffered mass destruction, leaving at least 16 injured, 17 residences destroyed, and 173 other structures damaged by thee tornado. The destruction in Michigan comes just a day after at least 15 tornadoes moved through the southern Plains. Officials confirmed one dead after a tornado that was two miles wide came through Barnsdall, Oklahoma.\n\nIn the storm zone, which stretches from Chicago to Nashville, Tennessee , are over 35 million Americans. Parts of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and Kentucky were under a tornado watch through Tuesday night. There could be a few tornadoes, severe gusts of up to 70 mph, and hail the size of baseballs.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

The weather service said crews are still surveying areas of Franklin and Butler counties to determine if tornadoes struck there, as well. Radar indicated a tornado struck Jefferson County, but teams will have to evaluate the damage to determine its rating, said Jeff Craven, a weather service meteorologist in Pittsburgh.\n\nCrews on Wednesday were able to survey the damage caused by the strong storms that contained hail and heavy rains and knocked out power to thousands of utility customers.\n\nIn Michigan, weather service meteorologist Nathan Jeruzal said the tornadoes there touched down one each in Kalamazoo, Cass and Branch counties -- all in the southwestern part of the state. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\nKalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart and more than a dozen mobile homes were destroyed. About 50 people temporarily were trapped inside the damaged facility because of downed power lines.\n\nMore than a dozen homes were destroyed in a mobile home park in adjacent Pavilion Township and 16 people were injured, said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller.\n\nSamantha Smith clutched a box Wednesday afternoon as she stepped from her mother's partially wrecked home in Pavilion Township, about 137 miles (220 kilometers) west of Detroit. Inside the box were her grandmother's ashes. Being able to recover the most cherished of items offered Smith a rare moment of relief amid the storm's devastation.\n\nHer parents and brother were injured during the storm but survived.\n\n\"I have thanked God probably a billion times since this happened yesterday,\" she said. \"My kids are healthy and good. We just gotta make back up what we lost.\"\n\nTravis Wycoff ventured out Tuesday night after seeing on radar that a tornado had touched down in the Portage area, and he said he helped an elderly couple out of their partially collapsed home and freed a service dog from a home.\n\n\"There were a lot of people running through the streets trying to find people and their pets,\" Wycoff said. \"It was just a lot of chaos.\"\n\nIn southern Indiana, the National Weather Service confirmed a tornado with a preliminary EF-0 rating and 85 mph (137 kph) winds touched down early Wednesday, damaging homes in a subdivision north of the city of Sellersburg, located about 12 miles (19 kilometers) north of Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nThe Clark County Emergency Management Agency said the storm damaged 24 structures.\n\nCandice Holmes, a resident of the Lewis & Clark subdivision north of Sellersburg, said she, her husband and son sought shelter in their bathroom when they heard the approaching storm and \"the wind just picked up all at once.\"\n\n\"It was over as soon as it started, but it was definitely a scary moment,\" Holmes told WDRB-TV. \"And I'm glad we're alive.\"\n\nJust outside of Pittsburgh, a weather service team confirmed a brief tornado with maximum winds of 105 mph (169 kph) overturned a trailer and snapped more than a dozen trees early Wednesday in Findlay Township, Pennsylvania.\n\nIn northern West Virginia, a tornado with maximum winds of about 130 mph (209 kph) that started early Wednesday in far eastern Ohio hit the community of Fairdale about an hour northwest of Pittsburgh. The weather service said it marked the first recorded tornado in Hancock County. It was at least the 11th tornado this year in West Virginia, which sees two tornadoes in an average year.\n\nBaseball-sized hail was reported Wednesday in areas just southwest of St. Louis, Missouri. Heavy downpours caused flash flooding and at least one water rescue near Sullivan, a town that was struck by a small tornado just two days earlier. Damaging hail also was reported in the Kansas City area.\n\nA National Weather Service team also was headed to Hot Springs, Arkansas, to determine the strength of a tornado that hit early Wednesday morning, forecaster Tabitha Clarke said. The twister damaged some homes, uprooted trees and downed power lines. There were no immediate reports of injuries from the tornado, according to the state Division of Emergency Management.\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nAcross the U.S., the entire week is looking stormy. The Midwest and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati -- cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nMurphy reported from Oklahoma City.

(AP) -- Severe storms were tearing through the central and southeast U.S. late Tuesday and Wednesday, spawning damaging tornadoes, producing massive hail, and killing two people in Tennessee and one person in North Carolina.\n\nA storm that rumbled across northeastern Tennessee brought high winds that knocked down powerlines and trees. Claiborne County Sheriff Bob Brooks said a 22-year-old man was in a car struck by one of the trees.\n\nWednesday afternoon, a tornado emergency -- the weather service's highest alert level -- was issued for an area south of Nashville including the towns of Spring Hill, Chapel Hill and Eagleville.\n\nThe National Weather Service had previously reported a likely tornado on the ground in nearby Columbia, about 45 miles (72 kilometers) south of Nashville. People in Columbia were injured and homes were damaged, according to Lynn Thompson, assistant director of Maury County 911. Thompson told The Associated Press that he could not provide any further details: \"We're getting overloaded right now.\"\n\nRita Thompson, Marketing & Communications director with Maury Regional Health, said the hospital had received five patients. One died, another was in serious condition and three had injuries that were not life-threatening.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration issued a temporary ground stop at Nashville International Airport because of the weather, media outlets reported. Northeast of Nashville, a flash flood emergency was issued for Sumner and Robertson counties including the cities of Hendersonville and Gallatin. The National Weather Service said water rescues were ongoing in those areas and described the flooding from heavy thunderstorms as life-threatening.\n\n\"Do not attempt to travel unless you are fleeing an area subject to flooding or under an evacuation order,\" the weather agency alert said.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Nashville on Wednesday evening issued a tornado watch for parts of Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri and Tennessee until 3 a.m. CDT. The weather service continued issuing tornado warnings into the night, mostly in Tennessee, but also in Missouri, Alabama, Georgia and Texas.\n\nIn North Carolina, a state of emergency was declared for Gaston County Wednesday evening following a large storm. First responders were working to clear roads of downed power lines and broken trees and were helping residents, officials said. The New Hope Fire Department responded to a tree down on a car. One person in the car was killed and another was taken to a hospital, officials said.\n\nMore than 135,000 customers had lost power in the state as of Wednesday evening, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nThe National Weather Service confirmed tornadoes touched down Tuesday in western Ohio: five in Warren County and one each in Darke, Mercer and Auglaize counties. The weather service said crews are still surveying areas in other counties to determine if tornadoes struck there, as well. The strong storms also brought hail and heavy rains to the state and knocked out power to thousands of utility customers.\n\nIn Michigan, weather service meteorologist Nathan Jeruzal said the tornadoes there touched down one each in Kalamazoo, Cass and Branch counties -- all in the southwestern part of the state.

The Clark County Emergency Management Agency said the storm damaged 24 structures, including homes in a subdivision north of the city of Sellersburg, located about 12 miles (19 kilometers) north of Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nCandice Holmes, a resident of the Lewis & Clark subdivision north of Sellersburg, said she, her husband and son sought shelter in their bathroom when they heard the approaching storm and \"the wind just picked up all at once.\"\n\n\"It was definitely a scary moment. ... And I'm glad we're alive,\" Holmes told WDRB-TV.\n\nTornadoes were also confirmed in Pennsylvania just outside Pittsburgh, in central Arkansas and in northern West Virginia. The West Virginia twister was at least the 11th tornado this year in the state, which sees two tornadoes in an average year.\n\nBaseball-sized hail was reported Wednesday in areas just southwest of St. Louis. Heavy downpours caused flash flooding and at least one water rescue near Sullivan, a town that was struck by a small tornado just two days earlier.

(AP) -- Severe storms tore through the central and southeast U.S. late Tuesday and Wednesday, spawning damaging tornadoes, producing massive hail, and killing two people in Tennessee and one person in North Carolina.\n\nA storm that rumbled across northeastern Tennessee brought high winds that knocked down powerlines and trees. Claiborne County Sheriff Bob Brooks said a 22-year-old man was in a car struck by one of the trees.\n\nWednesday afternoon, a tornado emergency -- the weather service's highest alert level -- was issued for an area south of Nashville including the towns of Spring Hill, Chapel Hill and Eagleville.\n\nThe National Weather Service had previously reported a likely tornado on the ground in nearby Columbia, about 45 miles (72 kilometers) south of Nashville. People in Columbia were injured and homes were damaged, according to Lynn Thompson, assistant director of Maury County 911. Thompson told The Associated Press that he could not provide any further details: \"We're getting overloaded right now.\"\n\nRita Thompson, Marketing & Communications director with Maury Regional Health, said the hospital had received five patients. One died, another was in serious condition and three had injuries that were not life-threatening.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration issued a temporary ground stop at Nashville International Airport because of the weather, media outlets reported. Northeast of Nashville, a flash flood emergency was issued for Sumner and Robertson counties including the cities of Hendersonville and Gallatin. The National Weather Service said water rescues were ongoing in those areas and described the flooding from heavy thunderstorms as life-threatening.\n\n\"Do not attempt to travel unless you are fleeing an area subject to flooding or under an evacuation order,\" the weather agency alert said.\n\nIn North Carolina, a state of emergency was declared for Gaston County Wednesday evening following a large storm. First responders were working to clear roads of downed power lines and broken trees and were helping residents, officials said. The New Hope Fire Department responded to a tree down on a car. One person in the car was killed and another was taken to a hospital, officials said.\n\nMore than 135,000 customers had lost power in the state as of Wednesday evening, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nTornadoes were first reported after dark Tuesday in parts of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, according to the National Weather Service. The storms came a day after a deadly twister ripped through an Oklahoma town.\n\nThe National Weather Service confirmed tornadoes touched down Tuesday in western Ohio: five in Warren County and one each in Darke, Mercer and Auglaize counties. The weather service said crews are still surveying areas in other counties to determine if tornadoes struck there, as well.\n\nCrews on Wednesday were able to survey the damage caused by the strong storms that contained hail and heavy rains and knocked out power to thousands of utility customers.\n\nIn Michigan, weather service meteorologist Nathan Jeruzal said the tornadoes there touched down one each in Kalamazoo, Cass and Branch counties -- all in the southwestern part of the state. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\nKalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart and more than a dozen mobile homes were destroyed. About 50 people temporarily were trapped inside the damaged facility because of downed power lines.\n\nMore than a dozen homes were destroyed in a mobile home park in adjacent Pavilion Township and 16 people were injured, said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller.\n\nSamantha Smith clutched a box Wednesday afternoon as she stepped from her mother's partially wrecked home in Pavilion Township, about 137 miles (220 kilometers) west of Detroit. Inside the box were her grandmother's ashes. Being able to recover the most cherished of items offered Smith a rare moment of relief amid the storm's devastation.\n\nHer parents and brother were injured during the storm but survived.\n\n\"I have thanked God probably a billion times since this happened yesterday,\" she said. \"My kids are healthy and good. We just gotta make back up what we lost.\"\n\nTravis Wycoff ventured out Tuesday night after seeing on radar that a tornado had touched down in the Portage area, and he said he helped an elderly couple out of their partially collapsed home and freed a service dog from a home.\n\n\"There were a lot of people running through the streets trying to find people and their pets,\" Wycoff said. \"It was just a lot of chaos.\"\n\nIn southern Indiana, the National Weather Service confirmed a tornado touched down early Wednesday, damaging homes in a subdivision north of the city of Sellersburg, located about 12 miles (19 kilometers) north of Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nThe Clark County Emergency Management Agency said the storm damaged 24 structures.\n\nCandice Holmes, a resident of the Lewis & Clark subdivision north of Sellersburg, said she, her husband and son sought shelter in their bathroom when they heard the approaching storm and \"the wind just picked up all at once.\"\n\n\"It was definitely a scary moment. ... And I'm glad we're alive,\" Holmes told WDRB-TV.\n\nTornadoes were also confirmed in Pennsylvania just outside Pittsburgh, in central Arkansas and in northern West Virginia. The West Virginia twister, which started early Wednesday in far eastern Ohio, was at least the 11th tornado this year in the state that sees two tornadoes in an average year.\n\nBaseball-sized hail was reported Wednesday in areas just southwest of St. Louis. Heavy downpours caused flash flooding and at least one water rescue near Sullivan, a town that was struck by a small tornado just two days earlier. Damaging hail also was reported in the Kansas City area.\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nAcross the U.S., the entire week is looking stormy. The Midwest and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, St. Louis, Cincinnati, Nashville and Memphis, Tennessee -- cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nCappelletti and White reported from Detroit.

(AP) -- At least eight tornadoes have touched down in Ohio and three have been confirmed in Michigan as severe storms barreled through the central U.S. late Tuesday and early Wednesday, killing one man in Tennessee when a tree toppled onto a vehicle he was in.\n\nThe storm that rumbled across northeastern Tennessee brought high winds that knocked down powerlines and trees. Claiborne County Sheriff Bob Brooks said a 22-year-old man was in a car struck by one of the trees.\n\nThe National Weather Service says confirmed tornadoes touched down Tuesday in Ohio, including five in Warren County in the state's southwest region.

Inside the box were her grandmother's ashes. Being able to recover the most cherished of items offered Smith a rare moment of relief amid the storm's devastation.\n\n\"Finding this box is the best thing that's happened to me these past 24 hours,\" she said. \"The main thing we were all worried about was my grandma's ashes.\"\n\nHer parents and brother were injured during the storm. Her brother suffered a broken pelvis and broken back, but he and other victims all survived, Smith added.\n\n\"I have thanked God probably a billion times since this happened yesterday,\" she said. \"My kids are healthy and good. We just gotta make back up what we lost.\"\n\nIn southern Indiana, the National Weather Service confirmed a tornado with a preliminary EF-0 rating and 85 mph (137 kph) winds touched down early Wednesday, damaging homes in a subdivision north of the city of Sellersburg, located about 12 miles (19 kilometers) north of Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nThe Clark County Emergency Management Agency said the storm damaged 24 structures.\n\nCandice Holmes, a resident of the Lewis & Clark subdivision north of Sellersburg, said she, her husband and son sought shelter in their bathroom when they heard the approaching storm and \"the wind just picked up all at once.\"\n\n\"My husband and my son stepped outside, opened the door and they slammed the door and ran back to the bathroom. And they held the bathroom door shut, as it came through,\" Holmes told WDRB-TV. \"It was over as soon as it started, but it was definitely a scary moment. And I'm glad we're alive.\"\n\nIn addition to the five in Warren County, confirmed tornadoes in Ohio were in the western part of the state in Greenville in Darke County, west of Coldwater in Mercer County and west of New Knoxville in Auglaize County. The weather service says crews are still surveying areas of Franklin and Butler counties to determine if tornadoes struck there, as well.\n\nJust outside of Pittsburgh, a weather service team confirmed that a brief tornado with maximum winds of 105 mph (169 kph) overturned a trailer and snapped more than a dozen trees early Wednesday in Findlay Township, Pennsylvania.\n\nBaseball-sized hail was reported Wednesday in areas just southwest of St. Louis, Missouri. Heavy downpours caused flash flooding and at least one water rescue near Sullivan, a town that was struck by a small tornado just two days earlier, destroying a bar and damaging the high school. Damaging hail also was reported in the Kansas City area.\n\nRadar indicated Hancock County, West Virginia, and Jefferson County, Ohio, were hit by tornadoes, but teams will have to evaluate the damage to determine their rating, Craven said.\n\nHancock County Schools in West Virginia closed schools Wednesday because of \"extensive overnight weather issues\" in the county. News outlets reported damaged buildings and power outages.\n\nA National Weather Service team also was headed to Hot Springs, Arkansas, to survey damage and determine the strength of a tornado that hit early Wednesday morning, forecaster Tabitha Clarke said.\n\nThe tornado damaged some homes, uprooted trees and downed power lines. There were no immediate reports of injuries from the tornado, according to the state Division of Emergency Management.\n\nIn Portage, Michigan, about 50 people temporarily were trapped inside a damaged FedEx facility because of downed power lines. More than a dozen homes were destroyed in a mobile home park in adjacent Pavilion Township and 16 people were injured, said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller.\n\n\"We found homes in the roadway,\" Fuller said late Tuesday. \"We found homes in neighbors' homes. We found large trees in homes.\"\n\nPower was knocked out to more than 20,000 people.\n\n\"We're looking at homes throughout this community that are totally gone, they've been demolished,\" Fuller said in the light of day at Pavilion Estates mobile home park.\n\nA home where seven people were living \"is totally on its top,\" he said. \"They were able to self-rescue and get somewhere safe and came back today.\"\n\nTravis Wycoff ventured out Tuesday night after seeing on radar that a tornado had touched down in the Portage area. About five minutes later, he came upon the aftermath.\n\n\"There were a lot of people running through the streets trying to find people and their pets,\" Wycoff said. \"It was just a lot of chaos.\"\n\nWycoff said he helped an elderly couple out of their partially collapsed home and also freed a service dog from a home whose owner was at work.\n\nMore than 30,000 customers were without power in Michigan early Wednesday, and an additional 10,000 in Ohio, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nMichigan Gov.

Dozens of homes were destroyed.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit Barnsdall in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles.\n\nAreas in Oklahoma, including Sulphur and Holdenville, are still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month.\n\nMurphy reported from Oklahoma City.

The National Weather Service issued tornado warnings for several states, including Kentucky and Missouri, as the storm system continues to move eastward. The storms brought high winds, downed power lines, and flooding, leading to travel disruptions, power outages, and building damage. Emergency responders and hospitals reported numerous injuries and a death in Columbia, Tennessee. Residents are urged to stay alert, avoid driving in flooded areas, and follow weather updates as the storm continues.\n\nForecasters warned a wave of dangerous storms in the U.S. could march through parts of the South early Thursday, after storms a day earlier spawned damaging tornadoes and massive hail, leaving two dead in Tennessee and one dead in North Carolina.\n\nThe storms continue an outbreak of torrential rain and tornadoes that has cut across the country this week, from the Plains to the Midwest and now the southeastern U.S. At least four people have died in storms since Monday.\n\nAmid Wednesday's storms, the National Weather Service continued issuing tornado warnings that stretch past midnight in North Carolina, Alabama, Georgia, Missouri and Kentucky. Parts of Arkansas and Mississippi were also under a tornado watch through the pre-dawn hours. One storm that rumbled across northeastern Tennessee on Wednesday brought high winds that knocked down power lines and trees. Bob Brooks, the sheriff in Claiborne County about an hour north of Knoxville, said a 22-year-old man was in a car when he was fatally struck by one of the trees.\n\nA second person was killed in the city of Columbia in Maury County, where the National Weather Service said a likely tornado had touched down. Columbia is just south of Nashville.\n\nHomes were damaged and people injured, according to Lynn Thompson, assistant director of Maury County 911. Thompson told The Associated Press that he could not provide any further details: \"We're getting overloaded right now.\" Rita Thompson, a spokesperson for Maury Regional Health, said the hospital had received five patients, including the person who died. Another was in serious condition and three had injuries that were not life-threatening, she said.\n\nThe storms also prompted the Federal Aviation Administration to issue a temporary ground stop at Nashville International Airport and the National Weather Service to issue a tornado emergency -- its highest alert level -- for other nearby areas south of the state's capital, including Chapel Hill and Eagleville.\n\nMeanwhile, torrential rain and thunderstorms led to water rescues northeast of Nashville. \"Do not attempt to travel unless you are fleeing an area subject to flooding or under an evacuation order,\" the National Weather Service warned when it issued a flash flood emergency.\n\nIn North Carolina, a state of emergency was declared Wednesday night for Gaston County, west of Charlotte, following a large storm that toppled power lines and severed trees, including one that landed on a car. One person in the car was killed and another was taken to a hospital, officials said. The storms rolled into the region Wednesday after parts of the central United States were battered Monday by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and tornadoes, including a deadly twister that ripped through an Oklahoma town and killed one person. Then, on Tuesday, the Midwest took the brunt of the bad weather.\n\nThe National Weather Service said tornadoes touched down in parts of Michigan, Ohio and Indiana on Tuesday.\n\nIn Michigan, tornadoes swirled through the southwestern part of the state, in and around Kalamazoo County, according to the National Weather Service. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\nKalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart, leaving about 50 people temporarily trapped inside because of downed power lines. Travis Wycoff ventured out Tuesday night after seeing on radar that a tornado had touched down in the Portage area, and he said he helped an elderly couple out of their partially collapsed home and freed a service dog from another home.\n\n\"There were a lot of people running through the streets trying to find people and their pets,\" Wycoff said. \"It was just a lot of chaos.\" In the adjacent Pavilion Township, more than a dozen homes were destroyed in a mobile home park and 16 people were injured, said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller.\n\nSamantha Smith clutched a box Wednesday afternoon outside her mother's partially wrecked home in Pavilion Township. Inside the box were her grandmother's ashes. Being able to recover the most cherished of items offered Smith a rare moment of relief amid the storm's devastation. She said her parents and brother were injured during the storm but survived.\n\n\"I have thanked God probably a billion times since this happened yesterday,\" she said. \"My kids are healthy and good. We just gotta make back up what we lost.\" Tornadoes were also confirmed in Pennsylvania just outside Pittsburgh, in central Arkansas and in northern West Virginia. The West Virginia twister was at least the 11th tornado this year in the state, which sees two tornadoes in an average year.\n\nBoth the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)", "source": {"uri": "devdiscourse.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Devdiscourse"},

The township is located in Kalamazoo County, where 15 to 20 people had minor injuries and were transported to two area hospitals, according to the county's emergency management spokesperson Andrew Alspach.\n\nIn the neighboring city of Portage, about 7 miles south of Kalamazoo, pictures and videos showed a FedEx facility with significant roof and structural damage after a storm hit the area Tuesday evening. However, there were no serious injuries, a FedEx representative told CNN.\n\nAbout 50 people were trapped in the building due to downed wires, Taylor Koopman, a spokesperson for Kalamazoo County administrator's office, told MLive.com, adding work to clear the wires was ongoing as of 9:30 p.m. ET. However, city of Portage spokesperson Mary Beth Block told CNN in an email the building had been cleared by authorities.\n\nAt least one tornado, possibly two, hit the Portage area Tuesday, as the area faced two tornado warnings in just over an hour, the National Weather Service said.\n\n\"We have significant damage, including damage to residential and commercial buildings, trees down across many roads in the city, and several reports of gas leaks,\" Portage city officials said in a news release.\n\nThe city pleaded with its residents to \"stay home\" and \"please stay off the roads. First responders are stuck in gridlock.\"\n\nMultiple buildings, residential and commercial, were destroyed after a possible tornado touched down in Centreville on Tuesday, according to St. Joseph County Undersheriff Jason Bingaman. The storm damage ripped off roofs and flattened homes \"completely down,\" Bingaman told CNN.\n\nIn Branch County, about 60 miles south of Kalamazoo, at least seven homes were destroyed, according to Emergency Management Director Tim Miner, who added he was unable to get out and assess damage to other parts of the county.\n\nTornadoes in Michigan are infrequent to begin with, but Union City, in Branch County, faced an unprecedented situation. The city was placed under Michigan's first tornado emergency when \"a large and destructive tornado\" was over the area, about 10 miles northwest of Coldwater and moving northeast at 45 mph, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nTornado emergencies are the most extreme form of a tornado warning and only issued when a tornado threatens catastrophic damage and loss of life, often in a populated area.\n\nAccording to the Storm Prediction Center, at least 10 tornadoes were reported in Michigan on Tuesday. Hail the size of softballs was also reported in some parts of the state.\n\nMore than 30,000 homes and businesses in Michigan were left without power as of early Wednesday, according to poweroutage.us.\n\nGov. Gretchen Whitmer said her heart was going out to those impacted by the severe weather in southwest Michigan. The governor declared a state of emergency for Kalamazoo, St. Joseph, Branch and Cass counties, she said Tuesday night.\n\n\"We will work with emergency teams overnight to monitor the situation and coordinate resources for those affected. Michigan is strong and together we will rebuild,\" the governor said.\n\nAfter Tuesday brought tornadoes, large hail, damaging wind gusts and heavy rainfall mainly across the Great Lakes and the Ohio Valley, a large area of the eastern and central US will face rounds of storms Wednesday. More than 145 million people could see some sort of storms Wednesday from Texas to Maine.\n\nTornado threat continues Wednesday\n\nNearly 4 million people are under a Level 4 of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms Wednesday, according to the Storm Prediction Center. Within this risk are parts of Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky and Tennessee -- including Nashville.\n\nAn additional 50 million people from Texas, through much of the Ohio Valley and into the mid-Atlantic, are under a Level 2 of 5 or Level 3 of 5 risk.\n\nSevere storms started to bubble to life around sunrise in parts of eastern Kansas. These storms will expand in scope and strength through the morning and push into parts of Missouri. This morning activity will heavily influence how the rest of the day unfolds.\n\nIf morning storms form into a powerful and organized line, damaging winds will be the biggest threat into the afternoon hours. Hail and tornadoes will also be possible. If this organized line doesn't form, the threat for individual storms to produce strong tornadoes - at least EF2 strength - will increase.\n\nParts of Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky and Tennessee face the greatest risk of strong tornadoes, especially from the afternoon onward.\n\nAdditional storms will fire up from the Southern Plains to the mid-Atlantic throughout the afternoon. Storms capable of the strongest winds and largest hail are most likely from Texas to Kentucky and Tennessee, but any storm could unload damaging wind gusts and hail up to the size of softballs.\n\nSome areas may encounter an initial round of severe storms early Wednesday only to be hit with another round later in the day.\n\nThe repeated rounds of storms Wednesday will also deliver torrential rainfall and raise the risk of flooding.\n\n\"The greatest flash flooding threat also overlaps with the risk of severe thunderstorms, centered over Kentucky and Tennessee as well sections of neighboring states,\" the National Weather Service said. A Level 3 of 4 risk of flooding rainfall is in place here, according to the Weather Prediction Center.\n\nRainfall rates could reach 2 inches per hour, which could dramatically increase the possibility of flash flooding. Locations worked over by multiple heavy storms could record more than 4 to 5 inches of rain.\n\nThere have been 13 consecutive days of tornado reports across US\n\nSpring is known for severe storms and tornadoes - and Spring 2024 is no exception. There has been at least one tornado report every day since April 25, a streak of 13 consecutive days, according to the Storm Prediction Center. A total of 287 tornadoes were reported in that time span.\n\nApril to June is peak tornado season across the US, with May traditionally seeing the most tornadoes. This month is coming off a particularly active April, where there were 300 tornadoes, the second most on record, according to the center. The all-time record occurred in April 2011, when there were 757 tornadoes.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

Claiborne County sheriff Bob Brooks said a 22-year-old man was in a car struck by one of the trees.\n\nWednesday afternoon, a tornado emergency -- the weather service's highest alert level -- was issued for an area south of Nashville including the towns of Spring Hill, Chapel Hill and Eagleville.\n\nThe National Weather Service had previously reported a likely tornado on the ground in nearby Columbia, about 45 miles (72 kilometres) south of Nashville.\n\nPeople in Columbia were injured and homes were damaged, according to Lynn Thompson, assistant director of Maury County 911. Mr Thompson told The Associated Press that he could not provide any further details: \"We're getting overloaded right now.\"\n\nRita Thompson, Marketing & Communications director with Maury Regional Health, said the hospital had received five patients. One died, another was in serious condition and three had injuries that were not life-threatening.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration issued a temporary ground stop at Nashville International Airport because of the weather, media outlets reported.\n\nNortheast of Nashville, a flash flood emergency was issued for Sumner and Robertson counties including the cities of Hendersonville and Gallatin.\n\nThe National Weather Service said water rescues were ongoing in those areas and described the flooding from heavy thunderstorms as life-threatening.\n\n\"Do not attempt to travel unless you are fleeing an area subject to flooding or under an evacuation order,\" the weather agency alert said.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Nashville on Wednesday evening issued a tornado watch for parts of Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri and Tennessee until 3am central daylight time.\n\nThe weather service continued issuing tornado warnings into the night, mostly in Tennessee, but also in Missouri, Alabama, Georgia and Texas.\n\nIn North Carolina, a state of emergency was declared for Gaston County on Wednesday evening following a large storm. First responders were working to clear roads of downed power lines and broken trees and were helping residents, officials said.\n\nThe New Hope Fire Department responded to a tree down on a car. One person in the car was killed and another was taken to a hospital, officials said.\n\nMore than 135,000 customers had lost power in the state as of Wednesday evening, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nThe National Weather Service confirmed tornadoes touched down on Tuesday in western Ohio: five in Warren County and one each in Darke, Mercer and Auglaize counties.\n\nThe weather service said crews are still surveying areas in other counties to determine if tornadoes struck there, as well. The strong storms also brought hail and heavy rains to the state and knocked out power to thousands of utility customers.\n\nIn Michigan, weather service meteorologist Nathan Jeruzal said the tornadoes there touched down one each in Kalamazoo, Cass and Branch counties -- all in the southwestern part of the state. Governor Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\nKalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart and more than a dozen mobile homes were destroyed. About 50 people temporarily were trapped inside the damaged facility because of downed power lines.\n\nMore than a dozen homes were destroyed in a mobile home park in adjacent Pavilion Township and 16 people were injured, said Kalamazoo County sheriff Richard Fuller.\n\nIn southern Indiana, the National Weather Service confirmed a tornado touched down early on Wednesday. The Clark County Emergency Management Agency said the storm damaged 24 structures, including homes in a subdivision north of the city of Sellersburg, located about 12 miles (19 kilometres) north of Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nTornadoes were also confirmed in Pennsylvania just outside Pittsburgh, in central Arkansas and in northern West Virginia. The West Virginia twister was at least the 11th tornado this year in the state, which sees two tornadoes in an average year.\n\nBaseball-sized hail was reported on Wednesday in areas just south-west of St Louis. Heavy downpours caused flash flooding and at least one water rescue near Sullivan, a town that was struck by a small tornado just two days earlier. Damaging hail also was reported in the Kansas City area.\n\nOn Monday, parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and tornadoes, including a deadly twister that ripped through an Oklahoma town. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.", "source": {"uri": "clactonandfrintongazette.co.uk", "dataType": "news", "title": "Clacton and Frinton Gazette"}, "authors":

(AP) -- Severe storms tore through the central and southeast U.S. late Tuesday and Wednesday, spawning damaging tornadoes, producing massive hail, and killing two people in Tennessee and one person in North Carolina.\n\nA storm that rumbled across northeastern Tennessee brought high winds that knocked down powerlines and trees. Claiborne County Sheriff Bob Brooks said a 22-year-old man was in a car struck by one of the trees.\n\nWednesday afternoon, a tornado emergency -- the weather service's highest alert level -- was issued for an area south of Nashville including the towns of Spring Hill, Chapel Hill and Eagleville.\n\nThe National Weather Service had previously reported a likely tornado on the ground in nearby Columbia, about 45 miles (72 kilometers) south of Nashville. People in Columbia were injured and homes were damaged, according to Lynn Thompson, assistant director of Maury County 911. Thompson told The Associated Press that he could not provide any further details: \"We're getting overloaded right now.\"\n\nRita Thompson, Marketing & Communications director with Maury Regional Health, said the hospital had received five patients. One died, another was in serious condition and three had injuries that were not life-threatening.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration issued a temporary ground stop at Nashville International Airport because of the weather, media outlets reported. Northeast of Nashville, a flash flood emergency was issued for Sumner and Robertson counties including the cities of Hendersonville and Gallatin. The National Weather Service said water rescues were ongoing in those areas and described the flooding from heavy thunderstorms as life-threatening.\n\n\"Do not attempt to travel unless you are fleeing an area subject to flooding or under an evacuation order,\" the weather agency alert said.\n\nIn North Carolina, a state of emergency was declared for Gaston County Wednesday evening following a large storm. First responders were working to clear roads of downed power lines and broken trees and were helping residents, officials said. The New Hope Fire Department responded to a tree down on a car. One person in the car was killed and another was taken to a hospital, officials said.\n\nMore than 135,000 customers had lost power in the state as of Wednesday evening, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nTornadoes were first reported after dark Tuesday in parts of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, according to the National Weather Service. The storms came a day after a deadly twister ripped through an Oklahoma town.\n\nThe National Weather Service confirmed tornadoes touched down Tuesday in western Ohio: five in Warren County and one each in Darke, Mercer and Auglaize counties. The weather service said crews are still surveying areas in other counties to determine if tornadoes struck there, as well.\n\nCrews on Wednesday were able to survey the damage caused by the strong storms that contained hail and heavy rains and knocked out power to thousands of utility customers.\n\nIn Michigan, weather service meteorologist Nathan Jeruzal said the tornadoes there touched down one each in Kalamazoo, Cass and Branch counties -- all in the southwestern part of the state. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\nKalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart and more than a dozen mobile homes were destroyed. About 50 people temporarily were trapped inside the damaged facility because of downed power lines.\n\nMore than a dozen homes were destroyed in a mobile home park in adjacent Pavilion Township and 16 people were injured, said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nSamantha Smith clutched a box Wednesday afternoon as she stepped from her mother's partially wrecked home in Pavilion Township, about 137 miles (220 kilometers) west of Detroit. Inside the box were her grandmother's ashes. Being able to recover the most cherished of items offered Smith a rare moment of relief amid the storm's devastation.\n\nHer parents and brother were injured during the storm but survived.\n\n\"I have thanked God probably a billion times since this happened yesterday,\" she said. \"My kids are healthy and good. We just gotta make back up what we lost.\"\n\nTravis Wycoff ventured out Tuesday night after seeing on radar that a tornado had touched down in the Portage area, and he said he helped an elderly couple out of their partially collapsed home and freed a service dog from a home.\n\n\"There were a lot of people running through the streets trying to find people and their pets,\" Wycoff said. \"It was just a lot of chaos.\"\n\nIn southern Indiana, the National Weather Service confirmed a tornado touched down early Wednesday, damaging homes in a subdivision north of the city of Sellersburg, located about 12 miles (19 kilometers) north of Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nThe Clark County Emergency Management Agency said the storm damaged 24 structures.\n\nCandice Holmes, a resident of the Lewis & Clark subdivision north of Sellersburg, said she, her husband and son sought shelter in their bathroom when they heard the approaching storm and \"the wind just picked up all at once.\"\n\n\"It was definitely a scary moment. ... And I'm glad we're alive,\" Holmes told WDRB-TV.\n\nTornadoes were also confirmed in Pennsylvania just outside Pittsburgh, in central Arkansas and in northern West Virginia. The West Virginia twister, which started early Wednesday in far eastern Ohio, was at least the 11th tornado this year in the state that sees two tornadoes in an average year.\n\nBaseball-sized hail was reported Wednesday in areas just southwest of St. Louis. Heavy downpours caused flash flooding and at least one water rescue near Sullivan, a town that was struck by a small tornado just two days earlier. Damaging hail also was reported in the Kansas City area.\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nAcross the U.S., the entire week is looking stormy. The Midwest and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, St. Louis, Cincinnati, Nashville and Memphis, Tennessee -- cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nCappelletti and White reported from Detroit.

The township is located in Kalamazoo County, where 15 to 20 people had minor injuries and were transported to two area hospitals, according to the county's emergency management spokesperson Andrew Alspach.\n\nIn the neighboring city of Portage, about 7 miles south of Kalamazoo, pictures and videos showed a FedEx facility with significant roof and structural damage after a storm hit the area Tuesday evening. However, there were no serious injuries, a FedEx representative told CNN.\n\nAbout 50 people were trapped in the building due to downed wires, Taylor Koopman, a spokesperson for Kalamazoo County administrator's office, told MLive.com, adding work to clear the wires was ongoing as of 9:30 p.m. ET. However, city of Portage spokesperson Mary Beth Block told CNN in an email the building had been cleared by authorities.\n\nAt least one tornado, possibly two, hit the Portage area Tuesday, as the area faced two tornado warnings in just over an hour, the National Weather Service said.\n\n\"We have significant damage, including damage to residential and commercial buildings, trees down across many roads in the city, and several reports of gas leaks,\" Portage city officials said in a news release.\n\nThe city pleaded with its residents to \"stay home\" and \"please stay off the roads. First responders are stuck in gridlock.\"\n\nMultiple buildings, residential and commercial, were destroyed after a possible tornado touched down in Centreville on Tuesday, according to St. Joseph County Undersheriff Jason Bingaman. The storm damage ripped off roofs and flattened homes \"completely down,\" Bingaman told CNN.\n\nIn Branch County, about 60 miles south of Kalamazoo, at least seven homes were destroyed, according to Emergency Management Director Tim Miner, who added he was unable to get out and assess damage to other parts of the county.\n\nTornadoes in Michigan are infrequent to begin with, but Union City, in Branch County, faced an unprecedented situation. The city was placed under Michigan's first tornado emergency when \"a large and destructive tornado\" was over the area, about 10 miles northwest of Coldwater and moving northeast at 45 mph, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nTornado emergencies are the most extreme form of a tornado warning and only issued when a tornado threatens catastrophic damage and loss of life, often in a populated area.\n\nAccording to the Storm Prediction Center, at least 10 tornadoes were reported in Michigan on Tuesday. Hail the size of softballs was also reported in some parts of the state.\n\nMore than 30,000 homes and businesses in Michigan were left without power as of early Wednesday, according to poweroutage.us.\n\nGov. Gretchen Whitmer said her heart was going out to those impacted by the severe weather in southwest Michigan. The governor declared a state of emergency for Kalamazoo, St. Joseph, Branch and Cass counties, she said Tuesday night.\n\n\"We will work with emergency teams overnight to monitor the situation and coordinate resources for those affected. Michigan is strong and together we will rebuild,\" the governor said.\n\nAfter Tuesday brought tornadoes, large hail, damaging wind gusts and heavy rainfall mainly across the Great Lakes and the Ohio Valley, a large area of the eastern and central US will face rounds of storms Wednesday. More than 145 million people could see some sort of storms Wednesday from Texas to Maine.\n\nTornado threat continues Wednesday\n\nNearly 4 million people are under a Level 4 of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms Wednesday, according to the Storm Prediction Center. Within this risk are parts of Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky and Tennessee -- including Nashville.\n\nAn additional 50 million people from Texas, through much of the Ohio Valley and into the mid-Atlantic, are under a Level 2 of 5 or Level 3 of 5 risk.\n\nSevere storms started to bubble to life around sunrise in parts of eastern Kansas. These storms will expand in scope and strength through the morning and push into parts of Missouri. This morning activity will heavily influence how the rest of the day unfolds.\n\nIf morning storms form into a powerful and organized line, damaging winds will be the biggest threat into the afternoon hours. Hail and tornadoes will also be possible. If this organized line doesn't form, the threat for individual storms to produce strong tornadoes - at least EF2 strength - will increase.\n\nParts of Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky and Tennessee face the greatest risk of strong tornadoes, especially from the afternoon onward.\n\nAdditional storms will fire up from the Southern Plains to the mid-Atlantic throughout the afternoon. Storms capable of the strongest winds and largest hail are most likely from Texas to Kentucky and Tennessee, but any storm could unload damaging wind gusts and hail up to the size of softballs.\n\nSome areas may encounter an initial round of severe storms early Wednesday only to be hit with another round later in the day.\n\nThe repeated rounds of storms Wednesday will also deliver torrential rainfall and raise the risk of flooding.\n\n\"The greatest flash flooding threat also overlaps with the risk of severe thunderstorms, centered over Kentucky and Tennessee as well sections of neighboring states,\" the National Weather Service said. A Level 3 of 4 risk of flooding rainfall is in place here, according to the Weather Prediction Center.\n\nRainfall rates could reach 2 inches per hour, which could dramatically increase the possibility of flash flooding. Locations worked over by multiple heavy storms could record more than 4 to 5 inches of rain.\n\nThere have been 13 consecutive days of tornado reports across US\n\nSpring is known for severe storms and tornadoes - and Spring 2024 is no exception. There has been at least one tornado report every day since April 25, a streak of 13 consecutive days, according to the Storm Prediction Center. A total of 287 tornadoes were reported in that time span.\n\nApril to June is peak tornado season across the US, with May traditionally seeing the most tornadoes. This month is coming off a particularly active April, where there were 300 tornadoes, the second most on record, according to the center. The all-time record occurred in April 2011, when there were 757 tornadoes.\n\nCNN's Steve Almasy, Joe Sutton, Amy Simonson, Lucy Kafanov and Andi Babineau contributed to this report.\n\nFor more CNN

(AP) -- At least eight tornadoes have touched down in Ohio and three have been confirmed in Michigan as severe storms barreled through the central U.S. late Tuesday and early Wednesday, killing one man in Tennessee when a tree toppled onto a vehicle he was in.\n\nThe storm that rumbled across northeastern Tennessee brought high winds that knocked down powerlines and trees. Claiborne County Sheriff Bob Brooks said a 22-year-old man was in a car struck by one of the trees.\n\nThe National Weather Service says confirmed tornadoes touched down Tuesday in Ohio, including five in Warren County in the state's southwest region. The confirmations came Wednesday after crews were able to survey the damage caused by the strong storms that contained hail and heavy rains and knocked out power to thousands of utility customers.\n\nWeather service meteorologist in Michigan Nathan Jeruzal said the tornadoes there touched down one each in Kalamazoo, Cass and Branch counties -- all in the southwestern part of the state.\n\nKalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart and more than a dozen mobile homes were destroyed.\n\nTornadoes were first reported after dark Tuesday in parts of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, while portions of Illinois, Kentucky and Missouri were also under a tornado watch, according to the National Weather Service. The storms came a day after a deadly twister ripped through an Oklahoma town.\n\nSamantha Smith clutched a box Wednesday afternoon as she stepped from her mother's partially wrecked home in Michigan's Pavilion Township, about 137 miles (220 kilometers) west of Detroit. Inside the box were her grandmother's ashes. Being able to recover the most cherished of items offered Smith a rare moment of relief amid the storm's devastation.\n\n\"Finding this box is the best thing that's happened to me these past 24 hours,\" she said. \"The main thing we were all worried about was my grandma's ashes.\"\n\nHer parents and brother were injured during the storm. Her brother suffered a broken pelvis and broken back, but he and other victims all survived, Smith added.\n\n\"I have thanked God probably a billion times since this happened yesterday,\" she said. \"My kids are healthy and good. We just gotta make back up what we lost.\"\n\nIn southern Indiana, the National Weather Service confirmed a tornado with a preliminary EF-0 rating and 85 mph (137 kph) winds touched down early Wednesday, damaging homes in a subdivision north of the city of Sellersburg, located about 12 miles (19 kilometers) north of Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nThe Clark County Emergency Management Agency said the storm damaged 24 structures.\n\nCandice Holmes, a resident of the Lewis & Clark subdivision north of Sellersburg, said she, her husband and son sought shelter in their bathroom when they heard the approaching storm and \"the wind just picked up all at once.\"\n\n\"My husband and my son stepped outside, opened the door and they slammed the door and ran back to the bathroom. And they held the bathroom door shut, as it came through,\" Holmes told WDRB-TV. \"It was over as soon as it started, but it was definitely a scary moment. And I'm glad we're alive.\"\n\nIn addition to the five in Warren County, confirmed tornadoes in Ohio were in the western part of the state in Greenville in Darke County, west of Coldwater in Mercer County and west of New Knoxville in Auglaize County. The weather service says crews are still surveying areas of Franklin and Butler counties to determine if tornadoes struck there, as well.\n\nJust outside of Pittsburgh, a weather service team confirmed that a brief tornado with maximum winds of 105 mph (169 kph) overturned a trailer and snapped more than a dozen trees early Wednesday in Findlay Township, Pennsylvania.\n\nBaseball-sized hail was reported Wednesday in areas just southwest of St. Louis, Missouri. Heavy downpours caused flash flooding and at least one water rescue near Sullivan, a town that was struck by a small tornado just two days earlier, destroying a bar and damaging the high school. Damaging hail also was reported in the Kansas City area.\n\nRadar indicated Hancock County, West Virginia, and Jefferson County, Ohio, were hit by tornadoes, but teams will have to evaluate the damage to determine their rating, Craven said.\n\nHancock County Schools in West Virginia closed schools Wednesday because of \"extensive overnight weather issues\" in the county. News outlets reported damaged buildings and power outages.\n\nA National Weather Service team also was headed to Hot Springs, Arkansas, to survey damage and determine the strength of a tornado that hit early Wednesday morning, forecaster Tabitha Clarke said.\n\nThe tornado damaged some homes, uprooted trees and downed power lines. There were no immediate reports of injuries from the tornado, according to the state Division of Emergency Management.\n\nIn Portage, Michigan, about 50 people temporarily were trapped inside a damaged FedEx facility because of downed power lines. More than a dozen homes were destroyed in a mobile home park in adjacent Pavilion Township and 16 people were injured, said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller.\n\n\"We found homes in the roadway,\" Fuller said late Tuesday. \"We found homes in neighbors' homes. We found large trees in homes.\"\n\nPower was knocked out to more than 20,000 people.\n\n\"We're looking at homes throughout this community that are totally gone, they've been demolished,\" Fuller said in the light of day at Pavilion Estates mobile home park.\n\nA home where seven people were living \"is totally on its top,\" he said. \"They were able to self-rescue and get somewhere safe and came back today.\"\n\nTravis Wycoff ventured out Tuesday night after seeing on radar that a tornado had touched down in the Portage area. About five minutes later, he came upon the aftermath.\n\n\"There were a lot of people running through the streets trying to find people and their pets,\" Wycoff said. \"It was just a lot of chaos.\"\n\nWycoff said he helped an elderly couple out of their partially collapsed home and also freed a service dog from a home whose owner was at work.\n\nMore than 30,000 customers were without power in Michigan early Wednesday, and an additional 10,000 in Ohio, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nAcross the U.S., the entire week is looking stormy. The Midwest and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati -- cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nOn Monday night, a deadly twister in Oklahoma tore through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall. At least one person was killed and another was missing. Dozens of homes were destroyed.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit Barnsdall in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles.\n\nAreas in Oklahoma, including Sulphur and Holdenville, are still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month.\n\nFacebookTwitterPinterestLinkedin", "source": {"uri": "wccbcharlotte.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WCCB Charlotte's CW"}, "authors": [{"uri": "miles_ruder@wccbcharlotte.com", "name":

Parts of Arkansas and Mississippi were also under a tornado watch through the pre-dawn hours.\n\nOne storm that rumbled across northeastern Tennessee on Wednesday brought high winds that knocked down power lines and trees. Bob Brooks, the sheriff in Claiborne County about an hour north of Knoxville, said a 22-year-old man was in a car when he was fatally struck by one of the trees.\n\nA second person was killed in the city of Columbia in Maury County, where the National Weather Service said a likely tornado had touched down.

Another was in serious condition and three had injuries that were not life-threatening, she said.\n\nThe storms also prompted the Federal Aviation Administration to issue a temporary ground stop at Nashville International Airport and the National Weather Service to issue a tornado emergency -- its highest alert level -- for other nearby areas south of the state's capital, including Chapel Hill and Eagleville.\n\nMeanwhile, torrential rain and thunderstorms led to water rescues northeast of Nashville.\n\n\"Do not attempt to travel unless you are fleeing an area subject to flooding or under an evacuation order,\" the National Weather Service warned when it issued a flash flood emergency.\n\nIn North Carolina, a state of emergency was declared Wednesday night for Gaston County, west of Charlotte, following a large storm that toppled power lines and severed trees, including one that landed on a car. One person in the car was killed and another was taken to a hospital, officials said.\n\nThe storms rolled into the region Wednesday after parts of the central United States were battered Monday by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and tornadoes, including a deadly twister that ripped through an Oklahoma town and killed one person.

Most of them would be without power until late Wednesday, city officials said.\n\nAt one point, about 50 people were trapped inside the FedEx facility because of downed power lines.

'State and local emergency teams are on the ground and working together to assist Michiganders.'\n\nNational Weather Service crews were working Wednesday to survey storm damage in several counties in Michigan's southwest Lower Peninsula to determine whether tornadoes touched down in those areas, including the two reported Tuesday night in the city of Portage, said meteorologist Mike Sutton with the weather service\u00b4s Grand Rapids office.\n\nTwo reported tornadoes blitzed the city of Portage (pictured) and an adjacent community Tuesday night, destroying homes and commercial buildings\n\nA resident walks past uprooted trees near businesses and buildings damaged after a tornado hit the area of Portage\n\nBusinesses and buildings are severely damaged after a tornado hit the area of Portage\n\nHe said the Grand Rapids office had received a total of 11 reports of tornadoes from storm spotters, emergency managers and the public from late Tuesday afternoon into Tuesday night, but as of 8 a.m. Wednesday, it had not confirmed any tornado touchdowns.\n\nSutton said it could be a couple days before the storm surveys are completed and he stressed that some of the tornado reports could be duplicate reports passed along by people who saw the same storm.\n\n'It\u00b4s quite possible those are multiple reports from the same tornado. The actual number of tornadoes may be lower depending on what they find when they\u00b4re out surveying,' he said.\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters.

Claiborne County Sheriff Bob Brooks said a 22-year-old man was in a car struck by one of the trees.\n\nNational Weather Service meteorologist Nathan Jeruzal said the tornadoes in Michigan touched down one each in Kalamazoo, Cass and Branch counties -- all in the southwestern part of the state.\n\nKalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart and more than a dozen mobile homes were destroyed.\n\nTornadoes were first reported after dark Tuesday in parts of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, while portions of Illinois, Kentucky and Missouri were also under a tornado watch, according to the National Weather Service. The storms came a day after a deadly twister ripped through an Oklahoma town.\n\nSamantha Smith clutched a box Wednesday afternoon as she stepped from her mother's partially wrecked home in Michigan's Pavilion Township, about 137 miles west of Detroit. Inside the box were her grandmother's ashes. Being able to recover the most cherished of items offered Smith a rare moment of relief amid the storm's devastation.\n\n\"Finding this box is the best thing that's happened to me these past 24 hours,\" she said. \"The main thing we were all worried about was my grandma's ashes.\"\n\nHer parents and brother were injured during the storm. Her brother suffered a broken pelvis and broken back, but he and other victims all survived, Smith added.\n\n\"I have thanked God probably a billion times since this happened yesterday,\" she said. \"My kids are healthy and good. We just gotta make back up what we lost.\"\n\nIn southern Indiana, the National Weather Service confirmed a tornado with a preliminary EF-0 rating and 85 mph winds touched down early Wednesday, damaging homes in a subdivision north of the city of Sellersburg, located about 12 miles north of Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nThe Clark County Emergency Management Agency said the storm damaged 24 structures.\n\nCandice Holmes, a resident of the Lewis & Clark subdivision north of Sellersburg, said she, her husband and son sought shelter in their bathroom when they heard the approaching storm and \"the wind just picked up all at once.\"\n\n\"My husband and my son stepped outside, opened the door and they slammed the door and ran back to the bathroom. And they held the bathroom door shut, as it came through,\" Holmes told WDRB-TV. \"It was over as soon as it started, but it was definitely a scary moment. And I'm glad we're alive.\"\n\nSurvey teams planned to head out Wednesday to determine whether tornadoes struck locations in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia, according to Jeff Craven, the meteorologist-in-charge in the weather service's Pittsburgh office.\n\nRadar indicated Hancock County, West Virginia, and in Jefferson County, Ohio, were hit by tornadoes, but teams will have to evaluate the damage to determine their rating, Craven said.\n\nHancock County Schools in West Virginia closed schools Wednesday because of \"extensive overnight weather issues\" in the county. News outlets reported damaged buildings and power outages.\n\nA National Weather Service team also was headed to Hot Springs, Arkansas, to survey damage and determine the strength of a tornado that hit early Wednesday morning, forecaster Tabitha Clarke said.\n\nThe tornado damaged some homes, uprooted trees and downed power lines. There were no immediate reports of injuries from the tornado, according to the state Division of Emergency Management.\n\nIn Portage, Michigan, about 50 people temporarily were trapped inside a damaged FedEx facility because of downed power lines.

Claiborne County Sheriff Bob Brooks said a 22-year-old man was in a car struck by one of the trees.\n\nNational Weather Service meteorologist Nathan Jeruzal said the tornadoes in Michigan touched down one each in Kalamazoo, Cass and Branch counties -- all in the southwestern part of the state.\n\nKalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart and more than a dozen mobile homes were destroyed.\n\nTornadoes were first reported after dark Tuesday in parts of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, while portions of Illinois, Kentucky and Missouri were also under a tornado watch, according to the National Weather Service. The storms came a day after a deadly twister ripped through an Oklahoma town.\n\nSamantha Smith clutched a box Wednesday afternoon as she stepped from her mother's partially wrecked home in Michigan's Pavilion Township, about 137 miles (220 kilometers) west of Detroit. Inside the box were her grandmother's ashes. Being able to recover the most cherished of items offered Smith a rare moment of relief amid the storm's devastation.\n\n\"Finding this box is the best thing that's happened to me these past 24 hours,\" she said. \"The main thing we were all worried about was my grandma's ashes.\"\n\nHer parents and brother were injured during the storm. Her brother suffered a broken pelvis and broken back, but he and other victims all survived, Smith added.\n\n\"I have thanked God probably a billion times since this happened yesterday,\" she said. \"My kids are healthy and good. We just gotta make back up what we lost.\"\n\nIn southern Indiana, the National Weather Service confirmed a tornado with a preliminary EF-0 rating and 85 mph (137 kph) winds touched down early Wednesday, damaging homes in a subdivision north of the city of Sellersburg, located about 12 miles (19 kilometers) north of Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nThe Clark County Emergency Management Agency said the storm damaged 24 structures.\n\nCandice Holmes, a resident of the Lewis & Clark subdivision north of Sellersburg, said she, her husband and son sought shelter in their bathroom when they heard the approaching storm and \"the wind just picked up all at once.\"\n\n\"My husband and my son stepped outside, opened the door and they slammed the door and ran back to the bathroom. And they held the bathroom door shut, as it came through,\" Holmes told WDRB-TV. \"It was over as soon as it started, but it was definitely a scary moment. And I'm glad we're alive.\"\n\nSurvey teams planned to head out Wednesday to determine whether tornadoes struck locations in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia, according to Jeff Craven, the meteorologist-in-charge in the weather service's Pittsburgh office.\n\nJust outside of Pittsburgh, a weather service team confirmed that a brief tornado with maximum winds of 105 mph (169 kph) overturned a trailer and snapped more than a dozen trees early Wednesday in Findlay Township, Pennsylvania.\n\nBaseball-sized hail was reported Wednesday in areas just southwest of St. Louis, Missouri. Heavy downpours caused flash flooding and at least one water rescue near Sullivan, a town that was struck by a small tornado just two days earlier, destroying a bar and damaging the high school. Damaging hail also was reported in the Kansas City area.\n\nRadar indicated Hancock County, West Virginia, and Jefferson County, Ohio, were hit by tornadoes, but teams will have to evaluate the damage to determine their rating, Craven said.\n\nHancock County Schools in West Virginia closed schools Wednesday because of \"extensive overnight weather issues\" in the county. News outlets reported damaged buildings and power outages.\n\nA National Weather Service team also was headed to Hot Springs, Arkansas, to survey damage and determine the strength of a tornado that hit early Wednesday morning, forecaster Tabitha Clarke said.\n\nThe tornado damaged some homes, uprooted trees and downed power lines. There were no immediate reports of injuries from the tornado, according to the state Division of Emergency Management.\n\nIn Portage, Michigan, about 50 people temporarily were trapped inside a damaged FedEx facility because of downed power lines. More than a dozen homes were destroyed in a mobile home park in adjacent Pavilion Township and 16 people were injured, said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller.\n\n\"We found homes in the roadway,\" Fuller said late Tuesday. \"We found homes in neighbors' homes. We found large trees in homes.\"\n\nPower was knocked out to more than 20,000 people.\n\n\"We're looking at homes throughout this community that are totally gone, they've been demolished,\" Fuller said in the light of day at Pavilion Estates mobile home park.\n\nA home where seven people were living \"is totally on its top,\" he said. \"They were able to self-rescue and get somewhere safe and came back today.\"\n\nTravis Wycoff ventured out Tuesday night after seeing on radar that a tornado had touched down in the Portage area. About five minutes later, he came upon the aftermath.\n\n\"There were a lot of people running through the streets trying to find people and their pets,\" Wycoff said. \"It was just a lot of chaos.\"\n\nWycoff said he helped an elderly couple out of their partially collapsed home and also freed a service dog from a home whose owner was at work.\n\nMore than 30,000 customers were without power in Michigan early Wednesday, and an additional 10,000 in Ohio, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nMichigan Gov.

Wednesday, May 8, 2024. A tornado ripped through the area the evening of May 7.\n\nBy JOEY CAPPELLETTI, ED WHITE and SEAN MURPHY - Associated Press\n\nPAVILION TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) -- At least eight tornadoes have touched down in Ohio and three were confirmed in Michigan as severe storms barreled through the central and southeast U.S. late Tuesday and Wednesday, killing one person in Tennessee and another in North Carolina when trees toppled onto their vehicles.\n\nThe storm that rumbled across northeastern Tennessee brought high winds that knocked down powerlines and trees. Claiborne County Sheriff Bob Brooks said a 22-year-old man was in a car struck by one of the trees.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, a tornado emergency -- the weather service's highest alert level -- was issued for an area south of Nashville including the towns of Spring Hill, Chapel Hill and Eagleville.\n\nA tornado warning had previously been issued in nearby Columbia, about 45 miles (72 kilometers) south of Nashville. People in Columbia were injured and homes were damaged, according to Lynn Thompson, assistant director of Maury County 911. Thompson told The Associated Press that he could not provide any further details: \"We're getting overloaded right now.\"\n\nIn North Carolina, a state of emergency was declared for Gaston County Wednesday evening following a large storm. First responders were working to clear roads of downed power lines and broken trees and were helping residents, officials said. The New Hope Fire Department responded to a tree down on a car. One person in the car was killed and another was taken to a hospital, officials said.\n\nMore than 135,000 customers had lost power in the state as of Wednesday evening, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nTornadoes were first reported after dark Tuesday in parts of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, according to the National Weather Service. The storms came a day after a deadly twister ripped through an Oklahoma town.\n\nThe National Weather Service confirmed tornadoes touched down Tuesday in western Ohio: five in Warren County and one each in Darke, Mercer and Auglaize counties. The weather service said crews are still surveying areas of Franklin and Butler counties to determine if tornadoes struck there, as well. Radar indicated a tornado struck Jefferson County, but teams will have to evaluate the damage to determine its rating, said Jeff Craven, a weather service meteorologist in Pittsburgh.\n\nCrews on Wednesday were able to survey the damage caused by the strong storms that contained hail and heavy rains and knocked out power to thousands of utility customers.\n\nIn Michigan, weather service meteorologist Nathan Jeruzal said the tornadoes there touched down one each in Kalamazoo, Cass and Branch counties -- all in the southwestern part of the state. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\nKalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart and more than a dozen mobile homes were destroyed. About 50 people temporarily were trapped inside the damaged facility because of downed power lines.\n\nMore than a dozen homes were destroyed in a mobile home park in adjacent Pavilion Township and 16 people were injured, said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller.\n\nSamantha Smith clutched a box Wednesday afternoon as she stepped from her mother's partially wrecked home in Pavilion Township, about 137 miles (220 kilometers) west of Detroit. Inside the box were her grandmother's ashes. Being able to recover the most cherished of items offered Smith a rare moment of relief amid the storm's devastation.\n\nHer parents and brother were injured during the storm but survived.\n\n\"I have thanked God probably a billion times since this happened yesterday,\" she said. \"My kids are healthy and good. We just gotta make back up what we lost.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nTravis Wycoff ventured out Tuesday night after seeing on radar that a tornado had touched down in the Portage area, and he said he helped an elderly couple out of their partially collapsed home and freed a service dog from a home.\n\n\"There were a lot of people running through the streets trying to find people and their pets,\" Wycoff said. \"It was just a lot of chaos.\"\n\nIn southern Indiana, the National Weather Service confirmed a tornado with a preliminary EF-0 rating and 85 mph (137 kph) winds touched down early Wednesday, damaging homes in a subdivision north of the city of Sellersburg, located about 12 miles (19 kilometers) north of Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nThe Clark County Emergency Management Agency said the storm damaged 24 structures.\n\nCandice Holmes, a resident of the Lewis & Clark subdivision north of Sellersburg, said she, her husband and son sought shelter in their bathroom when they heard the approaching storm and \"the wind just picked up all at once.\"\n\n\"It was over as soon as it started, but it was definitely a scary moment,\" Holmes told WDRB-TV. \"And I'm glad we're alive.\"\n\nJust outside of Pittsburgh, a weather service team confirmed a brief tornado with maximum winds of 105 mph (169 kph) overturned a trailer and snapped more than a dozen trees early Wednesday in Findlay Township, Pennsylvania.\n\nIn northern West Virginia, a tornado with maximum winds of about 130 mph (209 kph) that started early Wednesday in far eastern Ohio hit the community of Fairdale about an hour northwest of Pittsburgh. The weather service said it marked the first recorded tornado in Hancock County. It was at least the 11th tornado this year in West Virginia, which sees two tornadoes in an average year.\n\nBaseball-sized hail was reported Wednesday in areas just southwest of St. Louis, Missouri. Heavy downpours caused flash flooding and at least one water rescue near Sullivan, a town that was struck by a small tornado just two days earlier. Damaging hail also was reported in the Kansas City area.\n\nA National Weather Service team also was headed to Hot Springs, Arkansas, to determine the strength of a tornado that hit early Wednesday morning, forecaster Tabitha Clarke said. The twister damaged some homes, uprooted trees and downed power lines. There were no immediate reports of injuries from the tornado, according to the state Division of Emergency Management.\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nAcross the U.S., the entire week is looking stormy. The Midwest and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati -- cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nMurphy reported from Oklahoma City.

These scenes could play out again in the central and eastern US Wednesday.\n\nAt least a dozen people were injured at a mobile home park in Pavilion Township following a tornado Tuesday, according to a county official. The township is located in Kalamazoo County, where 15 to 20 people had minor injuries and were transported to two area hospitals, according to the county's emergency management spokesperson Andrew Alspach.\n\nIn the neighboring city of Portage, about 7 miles south of Kalamazoo, pictures and videos showed a FedEx facility with significant roof and structural damage after a storm hit the area Tuesday evening. However, a FedEx representative told CNN that there were no serious injuries.\n\nAbout 50 people were trapped in the building due to downed wires. Taylor Koopman, a spokesperson for the Kalamazoo County administrator's office, told MLive.com that work to clear the wires was ongoing as of 9:30 p.m. ET. However, city of Portage spokesperson Mary Beth Block told CNN in an email that authorities had removed the building.\n\n\"We have significant damage, including damage to residential and commercial buildings, trees down across many roads in the city, and several reports of gas leaks,\" Portage city officials said in a news release.\n\nThe city pleaded with its residents to \"stay home\" and \"please stay off the roads. First responders are stuck in gridlock.\"\n\nAccording to St. Joseph County Undersheriff Jason Bingaman, multiple residential and commercial buildings were destroyed after a possible tornado touched down in Centreville on Tuesday. The storm damage ripped off roofs and flattened homes \"completely down,\" Bingaman told CNN.\n\nIn Branch County, about 60 miles south of Kalamazoo, at least seven homes were destroyed. Emergency Management Director Tim Miner said he could not get out and assess damage to other parts of the county.\n\nTornadoes in Michigan are infrequent, but Union City, in Branch County, faced an unprecedented situation. According to the National Weather Service, the city was placed under Michigan's first tornado emergency when \"a large and destructive tornado\" was over the area, about 10 miles northwest of Coldwater and moving northeast at 45 mph.\n\nTornado emergencies are the most extreme form of a warning and only issued when a tornado threatens catastrophic damage and loss of life, often in a populated area.\n\nAccording to the Storm Prediction Center, at least 10 tornadoes were reported in Michigan on Tuesday. The size of softballs was also reported in some parts of the state.\n\nAccording to poweroutage.us, as of early Wednesday, more than 30,000 homes and businesses in Michigan were without power.\n\nGov. Gretchen Whitmer said her heart was going out to those impacted by the severe weather in southwest Michigan. The governor declared a state of emergency for Kalamazoo, St. Joseph, Branch and Cass counties, she said Tuesday night.", "source": {"uri": "endtimeheadlines.org", "dataType": "news", "title": "End

First responders were working to clear roads of downed power lines and broken trees and were helping residents, officials said.\n\nThe New Hope Fire Department responded to a tree down on a car. One person in the car was killed and another was taken to a hospital, officials said.\n\nMore than 135,000 customers had lost power in the state as of Wednesday evening, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nThe National Weather Service confirmed tornadoes touched down on Tuesday in western Ohio: five in Warren County and one each in Darke, Mercer and Auglaize counties.\n\nThe weather service said crews are still surveying areas in other counties to determine if tornadoes struck there, as well. The strong storms also brought hail and heavy rains to the state and knocked out power to thousands of utility customers.\n\nIn Michigan, weather service meteorologist Nathan Jeruzal said the tornadoes there touched down one each in Kalamazoo, Cass and Branch counties -- all in the southwestern part of the state. Governor Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\nKalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart and more than a dozen mobile homes were destroyed.

The Clark County Emergency Management Agency said the storm damaged 24 structures, including homes in a subdivision north of the city of Sellersburg, located about 12 miles (19 kilometres) north of Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nTornadoes were also confirmed in Pennsylvania just outside Pittsburgh, in central Arkansas and in northern West Virginia. The West Virginia twister was at least the 11th tornado this year in the state, which sees two tornadoes in an average year.\n\nBaseball-sized hail was reported on Wednesday in areas just south-west of St Louis. Heavy downpours caused flash flooding and at least one water rescue near Sullivan, a town that was struck by a small tornado just two days earlier. Damaging hail also was reported in the Kansas City area.\n\nOn Monday, parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and tornadoes, including a deadly twister that ripped through an Oklahoma town.

One died, another was in serious condition and three had injuries that were not life-threatening.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration issued a temporary ground stop at Nashville International Airport because of the weather, media outlets reported.\n\nNortheast of Nashville, a flash flood emergency was issued for Sumner and Robertson counties including the cities of Hendersonville and Gallatin.\n\nThe National Weather Service said water rescues were ongoing in those areas and described the flooding from heavy thunderstorms as life-threatening.\n\n\"Do not attempt to travel unless you are fleeing an area subject to flooding or under an evacuation order,\" the weather agency alert said.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Nashville on Wednesday evening issued a tornado watch for parts of Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri and Tennessee until 3am central daylight time.\n\nThe weather service continued issuing tornado warnings into the night, mostly in Tennessee, but also in Missouri, Alabama, Georgia and Texas.\n\nIn North Carolina, a state of emergency was declared for Gaston County on Wednesday evening following a large storm. First responders were working to clear roads of downed power lines and broken trees and were helping residents, officials said.\n\nThe New Hope Fire Department responded to a tree down on a car. One person in the car was killed and another was taken to a hospital, officials said.\n\nPaden Fincher looks to salvage items from what is left of his sister\u00b4s home following a severe storm in Barnsdall (Mike Simons/Tulsa World via AP)\n\nMore than 135,000 customers had lost power in the state as of Wednesday evening, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nThe National Weather Service confirmed tornadoes touched down on Tuesday in western Ohio: five in Warren County and one each in Darke, Mercer and Auglaize counties.\n\nThe weather service said crews are still surveying areas in other counties to determine if tornadoes struck there, as well. The strong storms also brought hail and heavy rains to the state and knocked out power to thousands of utility customers.\n\nIn Michigan, weather service meteorologist Nathan Jeruzal said the tornadoes there touched down one each in Kalamazoo, Cass and Branch counties -- all in the southwestern part of the state. Governor Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\nKalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart and more than a dozen mobile homes were destroyed. About 50 people temporarily were trapped inside the damaged facility because of downed power lines.\n\nMore than a dozen homes were destroyed in a mobile home park in adjacent Pavilion Township and 16 people were injured, said Kalamazoo County sheriff Richard Fuller.\n\nIn southern Indiana, the National Weather Service confirmed a tornado touched down early on Wednesday. The Clark County Emergency Management Agency said the storm damaged 24 structures, including homes in a subdivision north of the city of Sellersburg, located about 12 miles (19 kilometres) north of Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nTornadoes were also confirmed in Pennsylvania just outside Pittsburgh, in central Arkansas and in northern West Virginia. The West Virginia twister was at least the 11th tornado this year in the state, which sees two tornadoes in an average year.\n\nBaseball-sized hail was reported on Wednesday in areas just south-west of St Louis. Heavy downpours caused flash flooding and at least one water rescue near Sullivan, a town that was struck by a small tornado just two days earlier. Damaging hail also was reported in the Kansas City area.\n\nOn Monday, parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and tornadoes, including a deadly twister that ripped through an Oklahoma town.

Bob Brooks, the sheriff in Claiborne County about an hour north of Knoxville, said a 22-year-old man was in a car when he was fatally struck by one of the trees.\n\nA second person was killed in the city of Columbia in Maury County, where the National Weather Service said a likely tornado had touched down.

One person in the car was killed and another was taken to a hospital, officials said.\n\nThe storms rolled into the region Wednesday after parts of the central United States were battered Monday by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and tornadoes, including a deadly twister that ripped through an Oklahoma town and killed one person. Then, on Tuesday, the Midwest took the brunt of the bad weather.\n\nThe National Weather Service said tornadoes touched down in parts of Michigan, Ohio and Indiana on Tuesday.\n\nIn Michigan, tornadoes swirled through the southwestern part of the state, in and around Kalamazoo County, according to the National Weather Service. Gov.

Inside the box were her grandmother's ashes. Being able to recover the most cherished of items offered Smith a rare moment of relief amid the storm's devastation. She said her parents and brother were injured during the storm but survived.\n\n\"I have thanked God probably a billion times since this happened yesterday,\" she said. \"My kids are healthy and good. We just gotta make back up what we lost.\"\n\nTornadoes were also confirmed in Pennsylvania just outside Pittsburgh, in central Arkansas and in northern West Virginia.

Claiborne County Sheriff Bob Brooks said a 22-year-old man was in a car struck by one of the trees.\n\nWednesday afternoon, a tornado emergency -- the weather service's highest alert level -- was issued for an area south of Nashville including the towns of Spring Hill, Chapel Hill and Eagleville.\n\nA tornado warning had previously been issued in nearby Columbia, about 45 miles (72 kilometers) south of Nashville. People in Columbia were injured and homes were damaged, according to Lynn Thompson, assistant director of Maury County 911. Thompson told The Associated Press that he could not provide any further details: \"We're getting overloaded right now.\"\n\nIn North Carolina, a state of emergency was declared for Gaston County Wednesday evening following a large storm. First responders were working to clear roads of downed power lines and broken trees and were helping residents, officials said. The New Hope Fire Department responded to a tree down on a car. One person in the car was killed and another was taken to a hospital, officials said.\n\nMore than 135,000 customers had lost power in the state as of Wednesday evening, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nTornadoes were first reported after dark Tuesday in parts of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, according to the National Weather Service. The storms came a day after a deadly twister ripped through an Oklahoma town.\n\nThe National Weather Service confirmed tornadoes touched down Tuesday in western Ohio: five in Warren County and one each in Darke, Mercer and Auglaize counties. The weather service said crews are still surveying areas of Franklin and Butler counties to determine if tornadoes struck there, as well. Radar indicated a tornado struck Jefferson County, but teams will have to evaluate the damage to determine its rating, said Jeff Craven, a weather service meteorologist in Pittsburgh.\n\nCrews on Wednesday were able to survey the damage caused by the strong storms that contained hail and heavy rains and knocked out power to thousands of utility customers.\n\nIn Michigan, weather service meteorologist Nathan Jeruzal said the tornadoes there touched down one each in Kalamazoo, Cass and Branch counties -- all in the southwestern part of the state. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\nKalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart and more than a dozen mobile homes were destroyed. About 50 people temporarily were trapped inside the damaged facility because of downed power lines.\n\nMore than a dozen homes were destroyed in a mobile home park in adjacent Pavilion Township and 16 people were injured, said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller.\n\nSamantha Smith clutched a box Wednesday afternoon as she stepped from her mother's partially wrecked home in Pavilion Township, about 137 miles (220 kilometers) west of Detroit. Inside the box were her grandmother's ashes. Being able to recover the most cherished of items offered Smith a rare moment of relief amid the storm's devastation.\n\nHer parents and brother were injured during the storm but survived.\n\n\"I have thanked God probably a billion times since this happened yesterday,\" she said. \"My kids are healthy and good. We just gotta make back up what we lost.\"\n\nTravis Wycoff ventured out Tuesday night after seeing on radar that a tornado had touched down in the Portage area, and he said he helped an elderly couple out of their partially collapsed home and freed a service dog from a home.\n\n\"There were a lot of people running through the streets trying to find people and their pets,\" Wycoff said. \"It was just a lot of chaos.\"\n\nIn southern Indiana, the National Weather Service confirmed a tornado touched down early Wednesday, damaging homes in a subdivision north of the city of Sellersburg, located about 12 miles (19 kilometers) north of Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nThe Clark County Emergency Management Agency said the storm damaged 24 structures.\n\nCandice Holmes, a resident of the Lewis & Clark subdivision north of Sellersburg, said she, her husband and son sought shelter in their bathroom when they heard the approaching storm and \"the wind just picked up all at once.\"\n\n\"It was definitely a scary moment. ... And I'm glad we're alive,\" Holmes told WDRB-TV.\n\nTornadoes were also confirmed in Pennsylvania just outside Pittsburgh, in central Arkansas and in northern West Virginia. The West Virginia twister, which started early Wednesday in far eastern Ohio, was at least the 11th tornado this year in the state that sees two tornadoes in an average year.\n\nBaseball-sized hail was reported Wednesday in areas just southwest of St. Louis, Missouri. Heavy downpours caused flash flooding and at least one water rescue near Sullivan, a town that was struck by a small tornado just two days earlier. Damaging hail also was reported in the Kansas City area.\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nAcross the U.S., the entire week is looking stormy. The Midwest and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati -- cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\n___\n\nMurphy reported from Oklahoma City.

The storms continue an outbreak of torrential rain and tornadoes that has cut across the country this week, from the Plains to the Midwest and now the southeastern U.S. At least four people have died in storms since Monday.\n\nAmid Wednesday's storms, the National Weather Service continued issuing tornado warnings that stretch past midnight in North Carolina, Alabama, Georgia, Missouri and Kentucky. Parts of Arkansas and Mississippi were also under a tornado watch through the pre-dawn hours. One storm that rumbled across northeastern Tennessee on Wednesday brought high winds that knocked down power lines and trees. Bob Brooks, the sheriff in Claiborne County about an hour north of Knoxville, said a 22-year-old man was in a car when he was fatally struck by one of the trees. Powerful Storms Kill 3 as Tornadoes Tear Through Central and Southeastern US\n\nA second person was killed in the city of Columbia in Maury County, where the National Weather Service said a likely tornado had touched down. Columbia is just south of Nashville. Homes were damaged and people injured, according to Lynn Thompson, assistant director of Maury County 911. Thompson told The Associated Press that he could not provide any further details: \"We're getting overloaded right now.\"\n\nRita Thompson, a spokesperson for Maury Regional Health, said the hospital had received five patients, including the person who died. Another was in serious condition and three had injuries that were not life-threatening, she said. The storms also prompted the Federal Aviation Administration to issue a temporary ground stop at Nashville International Airport and the National Weather Service to issue a tornado emergency -- its highest alert level -- for other nearby areas south of the state's capital, including Chapel Hill and Eagleville.\n\nMeanwhile, torrential rain and thunderstorms led to water rescues northeast of Nashville. \"Do not attempt to travel unless you are fleeing an area subject to flooding or under an evacuation order,\" the National Weather Service warned when it issued a flash flood emergency. In North Carolina, a state of emergency was declared Wednesday night for Gaston County, west of Charlotte, following a large storm that toppled power lines and severed trees, including one that landed on a car. One person in the car was killed and another was taken to a hospital, officials said. 3 Tornadoes Confirmed in Michigan, 1 Man Killed in Tennessee as Severe Storms Cross Central US\n\nThe storms rolled into the region Wednesday after parts of the central United States were battered Monday by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and tornadoes, including a deadly twister that ripped through an Oklahoma town and killed one person. Then, on Tuesday, the Midwest took the brunt of the bad weather. The National Weather Service said tornadoes touched down in parts of Michigan, Ohio and Indiana on Tuesday. In Michigan, tornadoes swirled through the southwestern part of the state, in and around Kalamazoo County, according to the National Weather Service. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\nKalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart, leaving about 50 people temporarily trapped inside because of downed power lines. Travis Wycoff ventured out Tuesday night after seeing on radar that a tornado had touched down in the Portage area, and he said he helped an elderly couple out of their partially collapsed home and freed a service dog from another home. \"There were a lot of people running through the streets trying to find people and their pets,\" Wycoff said. \"It was just a lot of chaos.\"\n\nIn the adjacent Pavilion Township, more than a dozen homes were destroyed in a mobile home park and 16 people were injured, said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller.

Claiborne County Sheriff Bob Brooks said a 22-year-old man was in a car struck by one of the trees. Wednesday afternoon, a tornado emergency -- the weather service's highest alert level -- was issued for an area south of Nashville including the towns of Spring Hill, Chapel Hill and Eagleville.\n\nA tornado warning had previously been issued in nearby Columbia, about 72 kilometres south of Nashville. People in Columbia were injured and homes were damaged, according to Lynn Thompson, assistant director of Maury County 911. Thompson told The Associated Press that he could not provide any further details: \"We're getting overloaded right now.\"\n\nIn North Carolina, a state of emergency was declared for Gaston County Wednesday evening following a large storm. First responders were working to clear roads of downed power lines and broken trees and were helping residents, officials said. The New Hope Fire Department responded to a tree down on a car. One person in the car was killed and another was taken to a hospital, officials said.\n\nMore than 135,000 customers had lost power in the state as of Wednesday evening, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nTornadoes were first reported after dark Tuesday in parts of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, according to the U.S. National Weather Service. The storms came a day after a deadly twister ripped through an Oklahoma town.\n\nThe National Weather Service confirmed tornadoes touched down Tuesday in western Ohio: five in Warren County and one each in Darke, Mercer and Auglaize counties. The weather service said crews are still surveying areas of Franklin and Butler counties to determine if tornadoes struck there, as well. Radar indicated a tornado struck Jefferson County, but teams will have to evaluate the damage to determine its rating, said Jeff Craven, a weather service meteorologist in Pittsburgh.\n\nCrews on Wednesday were able to survey the damage caused by the strong storms that contained hail and heavy rains and knocked out power to thousands of utility customers.\n\nIn Michigan, weather service meteorologist Nathan Jeruzal said the tornadoes there touched down one each in Kalamazoo, Cass and Branch counties -- all in the southwestern part of the state. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\nKalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart and more than a dozen mobile homes were destroyed. About 50 people temporarily were trapped inside the damaged facility because of downed power lines.\n\nMore than a dozen homes were destroyed in a mobile home park in adjacent Pavilion Township and 16 people were injured, said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller.\n\nSamantha Smith clutched a box Wednesday afternoon as she stepped from her mother's partially wrecked home in Pavilion Township, about 220 kilometres west of Detroit. Inside the box were her grandmother's ashes. Being able to recover the most cherished of items offered Smith a rare moment of relief amid the storm's devastation.\n\nHer parents and brother were injured during the storm, but survived.\n\n\"I have thanked God probably a billion times since this happened yesterday,\" she said. \"My kids are healthy and good. We just gotta make back up what we lost.\"\n\nTornadoes were also confirmed in Pennsylvania just outside Pittsburgh, in central Arkansas and in northern West Virginia. The West Virginia twister, which started early Wednesday in far eastern Ohio, was at least the 11th tornado this year in a state that sees two tornadoes in an average year.\n\nBaseball-sized hail was reported Wednesday in areas just southwest of St. Louis, Missouri. Heavy downpours caused flash flooding and at least one water rescue near Sullivan, a town that was struck by a small tornado just two days earlier. Damaging hail also was reported in the Kansas City area.\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.", "source": {"uri": "cbc.ca", "dataType": "news", "title": "CBC News"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

A tornado first touched down in Portage around 6 p.m. near eastbound Centre Street at Shaver Road, first responders reported, the Kalamazoo County Sheriff's Office said on Facebook. The tornado left scattered building debris and power lines down, the Sheriff's Office said.\n\nSocial media posts showed buildings in Portage with heavy damage.\n\nTwo trained spotters reported another tornado in Portage at 7:18 p.m. and a tornado was reported nearby in Comstock at 7:22 p.m., according to the weather service storm reports. A tornado also was reported in Mendon at 5:50 p.m. and Leonidas at 6 p.m., according to the reports.\n\nTree damage was reported in Leonidas, and trees 3 feet in diameter were reported down in northeast Portage, the weather service said. More downed large trees and power lines, as well as scattered shingles, were reported in west Portage. There also were reports of large hail, ranging from 1.5 inches to 4 inches in diameter, in Portage, parts of St. Joseph County and Union City, according to the weather service.\n\nSteven Burnett was making dinner when he received alerts that a tornado touched down near his home on Meredith Street. His wife, children, brother and sister-in-law, their children and his mother-in-law dashed to a small bathroom in the basement and prayed.\n\n\"It was really calm when it started, then we heard the wind and the whole entire house just shook,\" Burnett said. \"Two whole families were crammed in a bathroom in the basement; we all fit and we all held hands as my daughter and nephew started praying ... It made me feel calmer.\"\n\nWhen he took stock after the storm, he found a tree had fallen on his home and vehicles.\n\nNearby, on East Milham Avenue, trampolines hung in trees and roofing material littered the road and nearby yards as bulldozers and Consumers Energy crews worked alongside the Portage Public Works Department to clear roads and shut off gas.\n\nSpencer White, 24, and his 22-year-old brother watched as the storm raised his neighbor's trampoline and launched it into trees.\n\n\"I was standing at the back porch -- and winds, probably about 70 mph -- then, I saw the neighbor's trampoline go up over the house, and that's when me and my brother ran for the cellar and started clearing it out so we could get in,\" White said.\n\nConsumers Energy reported power outages affecting 27,263 customers. The outages were centered in Portage, and several parts of St. Joseph County, which is south of Kalamazoo and borders Indiana.\n\nGov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for Kalamazoo, St. Joseph, Branch and Cass counties, and urged residents to stay safe and follow the instructions of emergency officials.\n\n\"My heart goes out to all those affected by tonight's severe weather in southwest Michigan,\" Whitmer said. \"Emergency teams are on the ground and working to assist Michiganders. I encourage everyone to continue monitoring severe weather alerts and follow the advice of emergency officials.\"\n\nNational Weather Service meteorologist Nathan Marsili said a twister touched down in central St. Joseph County and traveled to the northeast part of the county between 5:30 and 6 p.m. The tornado was confirmed by the weather service using radar and spotters, Marsili said. The tornado's path passed just north of Centreville to southeast of Mendon and Leonidas.\n\nMarsili said there are several reports of debris on roads and damage to buildings.\n\nTornado warnings were issued after 5 p.m. and remained in effect until around 7 p.m. Tuesday for southeast Van Buren, central Kalamazoo and south central Calhoun counties after an \"extremely dangerous tornado\" was located on radar, the National Weather Service said.\n\n\"This is a PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS SITUATION. TAKE COVER NOW!\" the weather service said at 5:49 p.m. A \"large, extremely dangerous and potentially deadly tornado is developing,\" located about 6 miles west of Portage moving northeast at 45 mph.\n\nStorm chaser Ryan Harriot from the Village of Britton in Lenawee County, started following storm reports, first to Coldwater and then west near Schoolcraft. From there, he and his friend followed a storm to Portage and saw a tornado at 6:05 p.m.\n\n\"I've been chasing storms for a decade and witnessed many tornadoes, but this one was visibly one of the widest I've seen,\" said Harriot, 26. \"It was probably 1,000 to 2,000 yards or a quarter-mile wide. It disappeared out of view and we tried to follow it but came across a damage we couldn't maneuver through.\"\n\nHarriot said he could see a FedEx facility that had the heaviest damage.\n\n\"There was a lot of tree damage around the building and it was obvious that the building was the most impacted, Harriot said. \"We tried to get closer but we couldn't move with the damage and other people that came outside gawking at the scene,\" he said.\n\nHigh winds and hail had been expected along with a risk of tornadoes, but the weather service Tuesday evening began issuing warnings for Calhoun, Kalamazoo and Van Buren counties, saying radar indicated rotation and then warned of \"extremely dangerous\" tornadoes, and with them a swift turn in the weather.\n\n\"To repeat, a tornado is on the ground,\" the weather service reported near 5:30 p.m. TAKE COVER NOW! Move to a basement or an interior room on the lowest floor of a sturdy building. Avoid windows. If you are outdoors, in a mobile home, or in a vehicle, move to the closest substantial shelter and protect yourself from flying debris.\"\n\nFor Calhoun County, before the twister struck, the weather service warned: \"You are in a life-threatening situation. Flying debris may be deadly to those caught without shelter.\"\n\nThe weather service warned mobile homes would be destroyed and \"considerable damage to homes, businesses, and vehicles is likely and complete destruction is possible.\"\n\nIn central Kalamazoo County, a warning was in effect until 7 p.m. after a confirmed \"large and extremely dangerous tornado\" was near Kalamazoo, moving northeast at 35 mph. Weather spotters also indicated a tornado had occurred near Portage, the weather service reported Tuesday evening.\n\nElsewhere, tornado watches were in effect Tuesday night for Washtenaw, Lenawee and Monroe counties in southeast Michigan.\n\nThe extreme weather that hit Michigan came after a tornado swept through an Oklahoma town Monday night and killed one person.\n\nTemperatures will wane into Thursday, with projected highs of 62 in those cities as a cold front enters the area Wednesday night, according to NWS Detroit.\n\n\u00a92024 The Detroit News.

(AP) -- At least eight tornadoes have touched down in Ohio and three were confirmed in Michigan as severe storms barreled through the central and southeast U.S. late Tuesday and Wednesday, killing one person in Tennessee and another in North Carolina when trees toppled onto their vehicles.\n\nThe storm that rumbled across northeastern Tennessee brought high winds that knocked down powerlines and trees. Claiborne County Sheriff Bob Brooks said a 22-year-old man was in a car struck by one of the trees.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, a tornado emergency -- the weather service's highest alert level -- was issued for an area south of Nashville including the towns of Spring Hill, Chapel Hill and Eagleville.\n\nA tornado warning had previously been issued in nearby Columbia, about 45 miles (72 kilometers) south of Nashville. People in Columbia were injured and homes were damaged, according to Lynn Thompson, assistant director of Maury County 911. Thompson told The Associated Press that he could not provide any further details: \"We're getting overloaded right now.\"\n\nIn North Carolina, a state of emergency was declared for Gaston County Wednesday evening following a large storm. First responders were working to clear roads of downed power lines and broken trees and were helping residents, officials said. The New Hope Fire Department responded to a tree down on a car. One person in the car was killed and another was taken to a hospital, officials said.\n\nMore than 135,000 customers had lost power in the state as of Wednesday evening, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nTornadoes were first reported after dark Tuesday in parts of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, according to the National Weather Service. The storms came a day after a deadly twister ripped through an Oklahoma town.\n\nThe National Weather Service confirmed tornadoes touched down Tuesday in western Ohio: five in Warren County and one each in Darke, Mercer and Auglaize counties. The weather service said crews are still surveying areas of Franklin and Butler counties to determine if tornadoes struck there, as well. Radar indicated a tornado struck Jefferson County, but teams will have to evaluate the damage to determine its rating, said Jeff Craven, a weather service meteorologist in Pittsburgh.\n\nCrews on Wednesday were able to survey the damage caused by the strong storms that contained hail and heavy rains and knocked out power to thousands of utility customers.\n\nIn Michigan, weather service meteorologist Nathan Jeruzal said the tornadoes there touched down one each in Kalamazoo, Cass and Branch counties -- all in the southwestern part of the state. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\nKalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart and more than a dozen mobile homes were destroyed. About 50 people temporarily were trapped inside the damaged facility because of downed power lines.\n\nMore than a dozen homes were destroyed in a mobile home park in adjacent Pavilion Township and 16 people were injured, said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller.\n\nSamantha Smith clutched a box Wednesday afternoon as she stepped from her mother's partially wrecked home in Pavilion Township, about 137 miles (220 kilometers) west of Detroit. Inside the box were her grandmother's ashes. Being able to recover the most cherished of items offered Smith a rare moment of relief amid the storm's devastation.\n\nHer parents and brother were injured during the storm but survived.\n\n\"I have thanked God probably a billion times since this happened yesterday,\" she said. \"My kids are healthy and good. We just gotta make back up what we lost.\"\n\nTravis Wycoff ventured out Tuesday night after seeing on radar that a tornado had touched down in the Portage area, and he said he helped an elderly couple out of their partially collapsed home and freed a service dog from a home.\n\n\"There were a lot of people running through the streets trying to find people and their pets,\" Wycoff said. \"It was just a lot of chaos.\"\n\nIn southern Indiana, the National Weather Service confirmed a tornado with a preliminary EF-0 rating and 85 mph (137 kph) winds touched down early Wednesday, damaging homes in a subdivision north of the city of Sellersburg, located about 12 miles (19 kilometers) north of Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nThe Clark County Emergency Management Agency said the storm damaged 24 structures.\n\nCandice Holmes, a resident of the Lewis & Clark subdivision north of Sellersburg, said she, her husband and son sought shelter in their bathroom when they heard the approaching storm and \"the wind just picked up all at once.\"\n\n\"It was over as soon as it started, but it was definitely a scary moment,\" Holmes told WDRB-TV. \"And I'm glad we're alive.\"\n\nJust outside of Pittsburgh, a weather service team confirmed a brief tornado with maximum winds of 105 mph (169 kph) overturned a trailer and snapped more than a dozen trees early Wednesday in Findlay Township, Pennsylvania.\n\nIn northern West Virginia, a tornado with maximum winds of about 130 mph (209 kph) that started early Wednesday in far eastern Ohio hit the community of Fairdale about an hour northwest of Pittsburgh. The weather service said it marked the first recorded tornado in Hancock County. It was at least the 11th tornado this year in West Virginia, which sees two tornadoes in an average year.\n\nBaseball-sized hail was reported Wednesday in areas just southwest of St. Louis, Missouri. Heavy downpours caused flash flooding and at least one water rescue near Sullivan, a town that was struck by a small tornado just two days earlier. Damaging hail also was reported in the Kansas City area.\n\nA National Weather Service team also was headed to Hot Springs, Arkansas, to determine the strength of a tornado that hit early Wednesday morning, forecaster Tabitha Clarke said. The twister damaged some homes, uprooted trees and downed power lines. There were no immediate reports of injuries from the tornado, according to the state Division of Emergency Management.\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nAcross the U.S., the entire week is looking stormy. The Midwest and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati -- cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nMurphy reported from Oklahoma City. Associated Press journalists around the country contributed to this report, including Rio Yamat, Heather Hollingsworth, Colleen Slevin, Jim Salter, Kathy McCormack, Sarah Brumfield, Beatrice Dupuy, Alexa St. John, Adrian Sainz, John Raby and Lisa Baumann.\n\nThe Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

(AP) -- At least eight tornadoes have touched down in Ohio and three have been confirmed in Michigan as severe storms barreled through the central U.S. late Tuesday and early Wednesday, killing one man in Tennessee when a tree toppled onto a vehicle he was in.\n\nThe storm that rumbled across northeastern Tennessee brought high winds that knocked down powerlines and trees. Claiborne County Sheriff Bob Brooks said a 22-year-old man was in a car struck by one of the trees.\n\nThe National Weather Service says confirmed tornadoes touched down Tuesday in Ohio, including five in Warren County in the state's southwest region. The confirmations came Wednesday after crews were able to survey the damage caused by the strong storms that contained hail and heavy rains and knocked out power to thousands of utility customers.\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nWeather service meteorologist in Michigan Nathan Jeruzal said the tornadoes there touched down one each in Kalamazoo, Cass and Branch counties -- all in the southwestern part of the state.\n\nKalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart and more than a dozen mobile homes were destroyed.\n\nTornadoes were first reported after dark Tuesday in parts of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, while portions of Illinois, Kentucky and Missouri were also under a tornado watch, according to the National Weather Service. The storms came a day after a deadly twister ripped through an Oklahoma town.\n\nSamantha Smith clutched a box Wednesday afternoon as she stepped from her mother's partially wrecked home in Michigan's Pavilion Township, about 137 miles (220 kilometers) west of Detroit. Inside the box were her grandmother's ashes. Being able to recover the most cherished of items offered Smith a rare moment of relief amid the storm's devastation.\n\n\"Finding this box is the best thing that's happened to me these past 24 hours,\" she said. \"The main thing we were all worried about was my grandma's ashes.\"\n\nHer parents and brother were injured during the storm. Her brother suffered a broken pelvis and broken back, but he and other victims all survived, Smith added.\n\n\"I have thanked God probably a billion times since this happened yesterday,\" she said. \"My kids are healthy and good. We just gotta make back up what we lost.\"\n\nIn southern Indiana, the National Weather Service confirmed a tornado with a preliminary EF-0 rating and 85 mph (137 kph) winds touched down early Wednesday, damaging homes in a subdivision north of the city of Sellersburg, located about 12 miles (19 kilometers) north of Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nThe Clark County Emergency Management Agency said the storm damaged 24 structures.\n\nCandice Holmes, a resident of the Lewis & Clark subdivision north of Sellersburg, said she, her husband and son sought shelter in their bathroom when they heard the approaching storm and \"the wind just picked up all at once.\"\n\n\"My husband and my son stepped outside, opened the door and they slammed the door and ran back to the bathroom. And they held the bathroom door shut, as it came through,\" Holmes told WDRB-TV. \"It was over as soon as it started, but it was definitely a scary moment. And I'm glad we're alive.\"\n\nIn addition to the five in Warren County, confirmed tornadoes in Ohio were in the western part of the state in Greenville in Darke County, west of Coldwater in Mercer County and west of New Knoxville in Auglaize County. The weather service says crews are still surveying areas of Franklin and Butler counties to determine if tornadoes struck there, as well.\n\nJust outside of Pittsburgh, a weather service team confirmed that a brief tornado with maximum winds of 105 mph (169 kph) overturned a trailer and snapped more than a dozen trees early Wednesday in Findlay Township, Pennsylvania.\n\nBaseball-sized hail was reported Wednesday in areas just southwest of St. Louis, Missouri. Heavy downpours caused flash flooding and at least one water rescue near Sullivan, a town that was struck by a small tornado just two days earlier, destroying a bar and damaging the high school. Damaging hail also was reported in the Kansas City area.\n\nRadar indicated Hancock County, West Virginia, and Jefferson County, Ohio, were hit by tornadoes, but teams will have to evaluate the damage to determine their rating, Craven said.\n\nHancock County Schools in West Virginia closed schools Wednesday because of \"extensive overnight weather issues\" in the county. News outlets reported damaged buildings and power outages.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nA National Weather Service team also was headed to Hot Springs, Arkansas, to survey damage and determine the strength of a tornado that hit early Wednesday morning, forecaster Tabitha Clarke said.\n\nThe tornado damaged some homes, uprooted trees and downed power lines. There were no immediate reports of injuries from the tornado, according to the state Division of Emergency Management.\n\nIn Portage, Michigan, about 50 people temporarily were trapped inside a damaged FedEx facility because of downed power lines. More than a dozen homes were destroyed in a mobile home park in adjacent Pavilion Township and 16 people were injured, said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller.\n\n\"We found homes in the roadway,\" Fuller said late Tuesday. \"We found homes in neighbors' homes. We found large trees in homes.\"\n\nPower was knocked out to more than 20,000 people.\n\n\"We're looking at homes throughout this community that are totally gone, they've been demolished,\" Fuller said in the light of day at Pavilion Estates mobile home park.\n\nA home where seven people were living \"is totally on its top,\" he said. \"They were able to self-rescue and get somewhere safe and came back today.\"\n\nTravis Wycoff ventured out Tuesday night after seeing on radar that a tornado had touched down in the Portage area. About five minutes later, he came upon the aftermath.\n\n\"There were a lot of people running through the streets trying to find people and their pets,\" Wycoff said. \"It was just a lot of chaos.\"\n\nWycoff said he helped an elderly couple out of their partially collapsed home and also freed a service dog from a home whose owner was at work.\n\nMore than 30,000 customers were without power in Michigan early Wednesday, and an additional 10,000 in Ohio, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nAcross the U.S., the entire week is looking stormy. The Midwest and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati -- cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nOn Monday night, a deadly twister in Oklahoma tore through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall. At least one person was killed and another was missing. Dozens of homes were destroyed.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit Barnsdall in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles.\n\nAreas in Oklahoma, including Sulphur and Holdenville, are still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month.\n\nMurphy reported from Oklahoma City. Associated Press journalists around the country contributed to this report, including Rio Yamat, Heather Hollingsworth, Colleen Slevin, Jim Salter, Kathy McCormack, Sarah Brumfield, Beatrice Dupuy and Alexa St. John.\n\nThe Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

(AP) -- At least eight tornadoes have touched down in Ohio and three were confirmed in Michigan as severe storms barreled through the central and southeast U.S. late Tuesday and Wednesday, killing one person in Tennessee and another in North Carolina when trees toppled onto their vehicles.\n\nThe storm that rumbled across northeastern Tennessee brought high winds that knocked down powerlines and trees. Claiborne County Sheriff Bob Brooks said a 22-year-old man was in a car struck by one of the trees.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, a tornado emergency -- the weather service's highest alert level -- was issued for an area south of Nashville including the towns of Spring Hill, Chapel Hill and Eagleville.\n\nA tornado warning had previously been issued in nearby Columbia, about 45 miles (72 kilometers) south of Nashville. People in Columbia were injured and homes were damaged, according to Lynn Thompson, assistant director of Maury County 911. Thompson told The Associated Press that he could not provide any further details: \"We're getting overloaded right now.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...\n\nIn North Carolina, a state of emergency was declared for Gaston County Wednesday evening following a large storm. First responders were working to clear roads of downed power lines and broken trees and were helping residents, officials said. The New Hope Fire Department responded to a tree down on a car. One person in the car was killed and another was taken to a hospital, officials said.\n\nMore than 135,000 customers had lost power in the state as of Wednesday evening, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nTornadoes were first reported after dark Tuesday in parts of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, according to the National Weather Service. The storms came a day after a deadly twister ripped through an Oklahoma town.\n\nThe National Weather Service confirmed tornadoes touched down Tuesday in western Ohio: five in Warren County and one each in Darke, Mercer and Auglaize counties. The weather service said crews are still surveying areas of Franklin and Butler counties to determine if tornadoes struck there, as well. Radar indicated a tornado struck Jefferson County, but teams will have to evaluate the damage to determine its rating, said Jeff Craven, a weather service meteorologist in Pittsburgh.\n\nCrews on Wednesday were able to survey the damage caused by the strong storms that contained hail and heavy rains and knocked out power to thousands of utility customers.\n\nIn Michigan, weather service meteorologist Nathan Jeruzal said the tornadoes there touched down one each in Kalamazoo, Cass and Branch counties -- all in the southwestern part of the state. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\nKalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart and more than a dozen mobile homes were destroyed. About 50 people temporarily were trapped inside the damaged facility because of downed power lines.\n\nMore than a dozen homes were destroyed in a mobile home park in adjacent Pavilion Township and 16 people were injured, said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller.\n\nSamantha Smith clutched a box Wednesday afternoon as she stepped from her mother's partially wrecked home in Pavilion Township, about 137 miles (220 kilometers) west of Detroit. Inside the box were her grandmother's ashes. Being able to recover the most cherished of items offered Smith a rare moment of relief amid the storm's devastation.\n\nHer parents and brother were injured during the storm but survived.\n\n\"I have thanked God probably a billion times since this happened yesterday,\" she said. \"My kids are healthy and good. We just gotta make back up what we lost.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nTravis Wycoff ventured out Tuesday night after seeing on radar that a tornado had touched down in the Portage area, and he said he helped an elderly couple out of their partially collapsed home and freed a service dog from a home.\n\n\"There were a lot of people running through the streets trying to find people and their pets,\" Wycoff said. \"It was just a lot of chaos.\"\n\nIn southern Indiana, the National Weather Service confirmed a tornado with a preliminary EF-0 rating and 85 mph (137 kph) winds touched down early Wednesday, damaging homes in a subdivision north of the city of Sellersburg, located about 12 miles (19 kilometers) north of Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nThe Clark County Emergency Management Agency said the storm damaged 24 structures.\n\nCandice Holmes, a resident of the Lewis & Clark subdivision north of Sellersburg, said she, her husband and son sought shelter in their bathroom when they heard the approaching storm and \"the wind just picked up all at once.\"\n\n\"It was over as soon as it started, but it was definitely a scary moment,\" Holmes told WDRB-TV. \"And I'm glad we're alive.\"\n\nJust outside of Pittsburgh, a weather service team confirmed a brief tornado with maximum winds of 105 mph (169 kph) overturned a trailer and snapped more than a dozen trees early Wednesday in Findlay Township, Pennsylvania.\n\nIn northern West Virginia, a tornado with maximum winds of about 130 mph (209 kph) that started early Wednesday in far eastern Ohio hit the community of Fairdale about an hour northwest of Pittsburgh. The weather service said it marked the first recorded tornado in Hancock County. It was at least the 11th tornado this year in West Virginia, which sees two tornadoes in an average year.\n\nBaseball-sized hail was reported Wednesday in areas just southwest of St. Louis, Missouri. Heavy downpours caused flash flooding and at least one water rescue near Sullivan, a town that was struck by a small tornado just two days earlier. Damaging hail also was reported in the Kansas City area.\n\nA National Weather Service team also was headed to Hot Springs, Arkansas, to determine the strength of a tornado that hit early Wednesday morning, forecaster Tabitha Clarke said. The twister damaged some homes, uprooted trees and downed power lines. There were no immediate reports of injuries from the tornado, according to the state Division of Emergency Management.\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nAcross the U.S., the entire week is looking stormy. The Midwest and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati -- cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nMurphy reported from Oklahoma City. Associated Press journalists around the country contributed to this report, including Rio Yamat, Heather Hollingsworth, Colleen Slevin, Jim Salter, Kathy McCormack, Sarah Brumfield, Beatrice Dupuy, Alexa St. John, Adrian Sainz, John Raby and Lisa Baumann.\n\nThe Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

(Marshall Gorby/Dayton Daily [...]\n\nCOLUMBIA, Tenn. (AP) -- Forecasters warned a wave of dangerous storms in the U.S. could march through parts of the South early Thursday, after storms a day earlier spawned damaging tornadoes and massive hail, leaving two dead in Tennessee and one dead in North Carolina.\n\nThe storms continue an outbreak of torrential rain and tornadoes that has cut across the country this week, from the Plains to the Midwest and now the southeastern U.S. At least four people have died in storms since Monday.\n\nAmid Wednesday's storms, the National Weather Service continued issuing tornado warnings that stretch past midnight in North Carolina, Alabama, Georgia, Missouri and Kentucky. Parts of Arkansas and Mississippi were also under a tornado watch through the pre-dawn hours.\n\nOne storm that rumbled across northeastern Tennessee on Wednesday brought high winds that knocked down power lines and trees. Bob Brooks, the sheriff in Claiborne County about an hour north of Knoxville, said a 22-year-old man was in a car when he was fatally struck by one of the trees.\n\nA second person was killed in the city of Columbia in Maury County, where the National Weather Service said a likely tornado had touched down. Columbia is just south of Nashville.\n\nHomes were damaged and people injured, according to Lynn Thompson, assistant director of Maury County 911. Thompson told The Associated Press that he could not provide any further details: \"We're getting overloaded right now.\"\n\nRita Thompson, a spokesperson for Maury Regional Health, said the hospital had received five patients, including the person who died. Another was in serious condition and three had injuries that were not life-threatening, she said.\n\nThe storms also prompted the Federal Aviation Administration to issue a temporary ground stop at Nashville International Airport and the National Weather Service to issue a tornado emergency -- its highest alert level -- for other nearby areas south of the state's capital, including Chapel Hill and Eagleville.\n\nMeanwhile, torrential rain and thunderstorms led to water rescues northeast of Nashville.\n\n\"Do not attempt to travel unless you are fleeing an area subject to flooding or under an evacuation order,\" the National Weather Service warned when it issued a flash flood emergency.\n\nIn North Carolina, a state of emergency was declared Wednesday night for Gaston County, west of Charlotte, following a large storm that toppled power lines and severed trees, including one that landed on a car. One person in the car was killed and another was taken to a hospital, officials said.\n\nThe storms rolled into the region Wednesday after parts of the central United States were battered Monday by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and tornadoes, including a deadly twister that ripped through an Oklahoma town and killed one person. Then, on Tuesday, the Midwest took the brunt of the bad weather.\n\nThe National Weather Service said tornadoes touched down in parts of Michigan, Ohio and Indiana on Tuesday.\n\nIn Michigan, tornadoes swirled through the southwestern part of the state, in and around Kalamazoo County, according to the National Weather Service. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\nKalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart, leaving about 50 people temporarily trapped inside because of downed power lines.\n\nTravis Wycoff ventured out Tuesday night after seeing on radar that a tornado had touched down in the Portage area, and he said he helped an elderly couple out of their partially collapsed home and freed a service dog from another home.\n\n\"There were a lot of people running through the streets trying to find people and their pets,\" Wycoff said. \"It was just a lot of chaos.\"\n\nIn the adjacent Pavilion Township, more than a dozen homes were destroyed in a mobile home park and 16 people were injured, said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller.\n\nSamantha Smith clutched a box Wednesday afternoon outside her mother's partially wrecked home in Pavilion Township.

The township is located in Kalamazoo County, where 15 to 20 people had minor injuries and were transported to two area hospitals, according to the county's emergency management spokesperson Andrew Alspach.\n\nIn the neighboring city of Portage, about 7 miles south of Kalamazoo, pictures and videos showed a FedEx facility with significant roof and structural damage after a storm hit the area Tuesday evening. However, there were no serious injuries, a FedEx representative told CNN.\n\nAbout 50 people were trapped in the building due to downed wires, Taylor Koopman, a spokesperson for Kalamazoo County administrator's office, told MLive.com, adding work to clear the wires was ongoing as of 9:30 p.m. ET. However, city of Portage spokesperson Mary Beth Block told CNN in an email the building had been cleared by authorities.\n\nTwo tornadoes hit the Portage area Tuesday, the National Weather Service said.\n\n\"We have significant damage, including damage to residential and commercial buildings, trees down across many roads in the city, and several reports of gas leaks,\" Portage city officials said in a news release.\n\nThe city pleaded with its residents to \"stay home\" and \"please stay off the roads. First responders are stuck in gridlock.\"\n\nThe Village of Centreville was hit hard during a possible tornado on Tuesday, according to St. Joseph County officials. Multiple buildings, residential and commercial, were destroyed after a possible tornado touched down in Centreville on Tuesday, according to St. Joseph County Undersheriff Jason Bingaman. The storm damage ripped off roofs and flattened homes \"completely down,\" Bingaman told CNN.\n\nIn Branch County, about 60 miles south of Kalamazoo, at least seven homes were destroyed, according to Emergency Management Director Tim Miner, who added he was unable to get out and assess damage to other parts of the county.\n\nOne city in the county, Union City, was under a rare tornado emergency earlier that went into effect when \"a large and destructive tornado\" was over the area, about 10 miles northwest of Coldwater and moving northeast at 45 mph, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nAccording to the Storm Prediction Center, at least nine tornado reports were made in Michigan on Tuesday. Hail the size of softballs was also reported in some parts of the state.\n\nMore than 34,000 homes and businesses in Michigan were left without power as of early Wednesday, according to poweroutage.us. Elsewhere in the Midwest, more than 16,000 residents were in the dark in Ohio.\n\nGov. Gretchen Whitmer said her heart was going out to those impacted by the severe weather in southwest Michigan. The governor declared a state of emergency for Kalamazoo, St. Joseph, Branch and Cass counties, she said Tuesday night.\n\n\"We will work with emergency teams overnight to monitor the situation and coordinate resources for those affected. Michigan is strong and together we will rebuild,\" the governor said.\n\nAfter Tuesday brought tornadoes, large hail, damaging wind gusts and heavy rainfall mainly across the Great Lakes and the Ohio Valley, much of the Eastern US braces for another round of storms Wednesday. Over 140 million people could see some sort of storms Wednesday from Texas to Maine.\n\nTornado threat continues Wednesday\n\nSevere thunderstorms are likely Wednesday across parts of the southern Plains into the mid Mississippi, Ohio and Tennessee Valleys, according to the Storm Prediction Center. As severe storms hit, tornadoes, very large hail, and damaging winds are expected over the large area. Some of the tornadoes may be strong, according to the center.\n\nA population of nearly 20 million people will be under the strongest severe storm threat. The Storm Prediction Center has issued a level 3 of 5 enhanced risk of severe thunderstorms from northeast Texas to western Virginia, which includes much of the lower Ohio Valley, Tennessee Valley and middle to lower Mississippi Valley. Cities in the strongest threat for severe storms include Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Louisville.\n\n\"The greatest flash flooding threat also overlaps with the risk of severe thunderstorms, centered over Kentucky and Tennessee as well sections of neighboring states,\" the National Weather Service said. \"Residents and visitors are advised to have multiple ways of receiving warnings and never drive across flooded roadways.\"\n\nLower severe storm threats spread from central Texas to the southern tip of Maine and includes the cities of Dallas, Atlanta, Chicago, Washington D.C., Baltimore, New York City, Boston and Charlotte. There, the threats are more likely to be large hail and damaging wind gusts, but tornadoes cannot be ruled out.\n\nThere have been 13 consecutive days of tornado reports across US\n\nSpring is known for severe storms and tornadoes - and Spring 2024 is no exception. There has been at least one tornado report every day since April 25, a streak of 13 consecutive days, according to the Storm Prediction Center. A total of 287 tornadoes were reported in that time span.\n\nApril to June is peak tornado season across the US, with May traditionally seeing the most tornadoes. This month is coming off a particularly active April, where there were 300 tornadoes, the second most on record, according to the center. The all-time record occurred in April 2011, when there were 757 tornadoes.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

Claiborne County Sheriff Bob Brooks said a 22-year-old man was in a car struck by one of the trees.\n\nNational Weather Service meteorologist Nathan Jeruzal said the tornadoes in Michigan touched down one each in Kalamazoo, Cass and Branch counties -- all in the southwestern part of the state.\n\nKalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart and more than a dozen mobile homes were destroyed.\n\nTornadoes were first reported after dark Tuesday in parts of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, while portions of Illinois, Kentucky and Missouri were also under a tornado watch, according to the National Weather Service. The storms came a day after a deadly twister ripped through an Oklahoma town.\n\nSamantha Smith clutched a box Wednesday afternoon as she stepped from her mother's partially wrecked home in Michigan's Pavilion Township, about 137 miles (220 kilometers) west of Detroit. Inside the box were her grandmother's ashes. Being able to recover the most cherished of items offered Smith a rare moment of relief amid the storm's devastation.\n\n\"Finding this box is the best thing that's happened to me these past 24 hours,\" she said. \"The main thing we were all worried about was my grandma's ashes.\"\n\nHer parents and brother were injured during the storm. Her brother suffered a broken pelvis and broken back, but he and other victims all survived, Smith added.\n\n\"I have thanked God probably a billion times since this happened yesterday,\" she said. \"My kids are healthy and good. We just gotta make back up what we lost.\"\n\nIn southern Indiana, the National Weather Service confirmed a tornado with a preliminary EF-0 rating and 85 mph (137 kph) winds touched down early Wednesday, damaging homes in a subdivision north of the city of Sellersburg, located about 12 miles (19 kilometers) north of Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nThe Clark County Emergency Management Agency said the storm damaged 24 structures.\n\nCandice Holmes, a resident of the Lewis & Clark subdivision north of Sellersburg, said she, her husband and son sought shelter in their bathroom when they heard the approaching storm and \"the wind just picked up all at once.\"\n\n\"My husband and my son stepped outside, opened the door and they slammed the door and ran back to the bathroom. And they held the bathroom door shut, as it came through,\" Holmes told WDRB-TV. \"It was over as soon as it started, but it was definitely a scary moment. And I'm glad we're alive.\"\n\nSurvey teams planned to head out Wednesday to determine whether tornadoes struck locations in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia, according to Jeff Craven, the meteorologist-in-charge in the weather service's Pittsburgh office.\n\nRadar indicated Hancock County, West Virginia, and in Jefferson County, Ohio, were hit by tornadoes, but teams will have to evaluate the damage to determine their rating, Craven said.\n\nHancock County Schools in West Virginia closed schools Wednesday because of \"extensive overnight weather issues\" in the county. News outlets reported damaged buildings and power outages.\n\nA National Weather Service team also was headed to Hot Springs, Arkansas, to survey damage and determine the strength of a tornado that hit early Wednesday morning, forecaster Tabitha Clarke said.\n\nThe tornado damaged some homes, uprooted trees and downed power lines. There were no immediate reports of injuries from the tornado, according to the state Division of Emergency Management.\n\nIn Portage, Michigan, about 50 people temporarily were trapped inside a damaged FedEx facility because of downed power lines. More than a dozen homes were destroyed in a mobile home park in adjacent Pavilion Township and 16 people were injured, said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller.\n\n\"We found homes in the roadway,\" Fuller said late Tuesday. \"We found homes in neighbors' homes. We found large trees in homes.\"\n\nPower was knocked out to more than 20,000 people.\n\n\"We're looking at homes throughout this community that are totally gone, they've been demolished,\" Fuller said in the light of day at Pavilion Estates mobile home park.\n\nA home where seven people were living \"is totally on its top,\" he said. \"They were able to self-rescue and get somewhere safe and came back today.\"\n\nTravis Wycoff ventured out Tuesday night after seeing on radar that a tornado had touched down in the Portage area. About five minutes later, he came upon the aftermath.\n\n\"There were a lot of people running through the streets trying to find people and their pets,\" Wycoff said. \"It was just a lot of chaos.\"\n\nWycoff said he helped an elderly couple out of their partially collapsed home and also freed a service dog from a home whose owner was at work.\n\nMore than 30,000 customers were without power in Michigan early Wednesday, and an additional 10,000 in Ohio, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nAcross the U.S., the entire week is looking stormy. The Midwest and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati -- cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nOn Monday night, a deadly twister in Oklahoma tore through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall. At least one person was killed and another was missing. Dozens of homes were destroyed.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit Barnsdall in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles.\n\nAreas in Oklahoma, including Sulphur and Holdenville, are still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month.", "source":

The township is located in Kalamazoo County, where 15 to 20 people had minor injuries and were transported to two area hospitals, according to the county's emergency management spokesperson Andrew Alspach.\n\nIn the neighboring city of Portage, about 7 miles south of Kalamazoo, pictures and videos showed a FedEx facility with significant roof and structural damage after a storm hit the area Tuesday evening. However, there were no serious injuries, a FedEx representative told CNN.\n\nAbout 50 people were trapped in the building due to downed wires, Taylor Koopman, a spokesperson for Kalamazoo County administrator's office, told MLive.com, adding work to clear the wires was ongoing as of 9:30 p.m. ET. However, city of Portage spokesperson Mary Beth Block told CNN in an email the building had been cleared by authorities.\n\nTwo tornadoes hit the Portage area Tuesday, the National Weather Service said.\n\n\"We have significant damage, including damage to residential and commercial buildings, trees down across many roads in the city, and several reports of gas leaks,\" Portage city officials said in a news release.\n\nThe city pleaded with its residents to \"stay home\" and \"please stay off the roads. First responders are stuck in gridlock.\"\n\nThe Village of Centreville was hit hard during a possible tornado on Tuesday, according to St. Joseph County officials. Multiple buildings, residential and commercial, were destroyed after a possible tornado touched down in Centreville on Tuesday, according to St. Joseph County Undersheriff Jason Bingaman. The storm damage ripped off roofs and flattened homes \"completely down,\" Bingaman told CNN.\n\nIn Branch County, about 60 miles south of Kalamazoo, at least seven homes were destroyed, according to Emergency Management Director Tim Miner, who added he was unable to get out and assess damage to other parts of the county.\n\nOne city in the county, Union City, was under a rare tornado emergency earlier that went into effect when \"a large and destructive tornado\" was over the area, about 10 miles northwest of Coldwater and moving northeast at 45 mph, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nAccording to the Storm Prediction Center, at least nine tornado reports were made in Michigan on Tuesday. Hail the size of softballs was also reported in some parts of the state.\n\nMore than 34,000 homes and businesses in Michigan were left without power as of early Wednesday, according to poweroutage.us. Elsewhere in the Midwest, more than 16,000 residents were in the dark in Ohio.\n\nGov. Gretchen Whitmer said her heart was going out to those impacted by the severe weather in southwest Michigan. The governor declared a state of emergency for Kalamazoo, St. Joseph, Branch and Cass counties, she said Tuesday night.\n\n\"We will work with emergency teams overnight to monitor the situation and coordinate resources for those affected. Michigan is strong and together we will rebuild,\" the governor said.\n\nAfter Tuesday brought tornadoes, large hail, damaging wind gusts and heavy rainfall mainly across the Great Lakes and the Ohio Valley, much of the Eastern US braces for another round of storms Wednesday. More than 145 million people could see some sort of storms Wednesday from Texas to Maine.\n\nTornado threat continues Wednesday\n\nA population of over 2 million people will be under the strongest severe storm threat Wednesday. The Storm Prediction Center has issued a level 4 of 5 moderate risk of severe thunderstorms across parts of southern Missouri, southern Illinois, southwestern Kentucky and northwestern and central Tennessee. Severe storms in the area are expected to ramp up Wednesday afternoon, producing some strong tornadoes greater than EF2 strength, large hail greater than 3 inches in diameter and damaging wind gusts greater than 74 mph.\n\nNortheastern Texas to western West Virginia is under a level 3 of 5 enhanced severe storm threat. That includes the cities of Memphis, St. Louis, Louisville and Little Rock. The area could see some tornadoes, hail greater than 2 inches and gusts greater than 74 mph.\n\nNumerous severe thunderstorms are likely Wednesday from parts of the mid Mississippi, Ohio and Tennessee Valleys into the southern Plains, according to the Storm Prediction Center. As severe storms hit, tornadoes, very large hail, and damaging winds are expected over the large area. Some of the tornadoes may be strong, according to the center.\n\n\"The greatest flash flooding threat also overlaps with the risk of severe thunderstorms, centered over Kentucky and Tennessee as well sections of neighboring states,\" the National Weather Service said. \"Residents and visitors are advised to have multiple ways of receiving warnings and never drive across flooded roadways.\"\n\nLower severe storm threats spread from central Texas to the southern tip of Maine and includes the cities of Dallas, Austin, Atlanta, Chicago, Washington D.C., Baltimore, New York City, Boston, Philadelphia, Indianapolis and Charlotte. There, the threats are more likely to be large hail and damaging wind gusts, but tornadoes cannot be ruled out.\n\nThere have been 13 consecutive days of tornado reports across US\n\nSpring is known for severe storms and tornadoes - and Spring 2024 is no exception. There has been at least one tornado report every day since April 25, a streak of 13 consecutive days, according to the Storm Prediction Center. A total of 287 tornadoes were reported in that time span.\n\nApril to June is peak tornado season across the US, with May traditionally seeing the most tornadoes. This month is coming off a particularly active April, where there were 300 tornadoes, the second most on record, according to the center. The all-time record occurred in April 2011, when there were 757 tornadoes.\n\nCNN's Mary Gilbert, Steve Almasy, Joe Sutton, Amy Simonson, Lucy Kafanov and Andi Babineau contributed to this report.",

(AP) -- Severe storms tore through the central and southeast U.S. late Tuesday and Wednesday, spawning damaging tornadoes, producing massive hail, and killing one person in Tennessee and another in North Carolina when trees toppled onto their vehicles.\n\nThe storm that rumbled across northeastern Tennessee brought high winds that knocked down powerlines and trees. Claiborne County Sheriff Bob Brooks said a 22-year-old man was in a car struck by one of the trees.\n\nWednesday afternoon, a tornado emergency -- the weather service's highest alert level -- was issued for an area south of Nashville including the towns of Spring Hill, Chapel Hill and Eagleville.\n\nA tornado warning had previously been issued in nearby Columbia, about 45 miles (72 kilometers) south of Nashville. People in Columbia were injured and homes were damaged, according to Lynn Thompson, assistant director of Maury County 911. Thompson told The Associated Press that he could not provide any further details: \"We're getting overloaded right now.\"\n\nIn North Carolina, a state of emergency was declared for Gaston County Wednesday evening following a large storm. First responders were working to clear roads of downed power lines and broken trees and were helping residents, officials said. The New Hope Fire Department responded to a tree down on a car. One person in the car was killed and another was taken to a hospital, officials said.\n\nMore than 135,000 customers had lost power in the state as of Wednesday evening, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nTornadoes were first reported after dark Tuesday in parts of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, according to the National Weather Service. The storms came a day after a deadly twister ripped through an Oklahoma town.\n\nThe National Weather Service confirmed tornadoes touched down Tuesday in western Ohio: five in Warren County and one each in Darke, Mercer and Auglaize counties. The weather service said crews are still surveying areas of Franklin and Butler counties to determine if tornadoes struck there, as well. Radar indicated a tornado struck Jefferson County, but teams will have to evaluate the damage to determine its rating, said Jeff Craven, a weather service meteorologist in Pittsburgh.\n\nCrews on Wednesday were able to survey the damage caused by the strong storms that contained hail and heavy rains and knocked out power to thousands of utility customers.\n\nIn Michigan, weather service meteorologist Nathan Jeruzal said the tornadoes there touched down one each in Kalamazoo, Cass and Branch counties -- all in the southwestern part of the state. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\nKalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart and more than a dozen mobile homes were destroyed. About 50 people temporarily were trapped inside the damaged facility because of downed power lines.\n\nMore than a dozen homes were destroyed in a mobile home park in adjacent Pavilion Township and 16 people were injured, said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller.\n\nSamantha Smith clutched a box Wednesday afternoon as she stepped from her mother's partially wrecked home in Pavilion Township, about 137 miles (220 kilometers) west of Detroit. Inside the box were her grandmother's ashes. Being able to recover the most cherished of items offered Smith a rare moment of relief amid the storm's devastation.\n\nHer parents and brother were injured during the storm but survived.\n\n\"I have thanked God probably a billion times since this happened yesterday,\" she said. \"My kids are healthy and good. We just gotta make back up what we lost.\"\n\nToday's Top Headlines Mica Miller's final hours: NC sheriff releases findings of Myrtle Beach woman's death Timeline: What happened on the day Mica Miller died?

And I'm glad we're alive,\" Holmes told WDRB-TV.\n\nTornadoes were also confirmed in Pennsylvania just outside Pittsburgh, in central Arkansas and in northern West Virginia. The West Virginia twister, which started early Wednesday in far eastern Ohio, was at least the 11th tornado this year in the state that sees two tornadoes in an average year.\n\nBaseball-sized hail was reported Wednesday in areas just southwest of St. Louis, Missouri. Heavy downpours caused flash flooding and at least one water rescue near Sullivan, a town that was struck by a small tornado just two days earlier. Damaging hail also was reported in the Kansas City area.\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nAcross the U.S., the entire week is looking stormy. The Midwest and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati -- cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nMurphy reported from Oklahoma City. Associated Press journalists around the country contributed to this report, including Rio Yamat, Heather Hollingsworth, Colleen Slevin, Jim Salter, Kathy McCormack, Sarah Brumfield, Beatrice Dupuy, Alexa St. John, Adrian Sainz, John Raby and Lisa Baumann.\n\nThe Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Claiborne County Sheriff Bob Brooks said a 22-year-old man was in a car struck by one of the trees.\n\nWednesday afternoon, a tornado emergency -- the weather service's highest alert level -- was issued for an area south of Nashville including the towns of Spring Hill, Chapel Hill and Eagleville.\n\nThe National Weather Service had previously reported a likely tornado on the ground in nearby Columbia, about 45 miles (72 kilometers) south of Nashville. People in Columbia were injured and homes were damaged, according to Lynn Thompson, assistant director of Maury County 911. Thompson told The Associated Press that he could not provide any further details: \"We're getting overloaded right now.\" Rita Thompson, Marketing & Communications director with Maury Regional Health, said the hospital had received five patients. One died, another was in serious condition and three had injuries that were not life-threatening.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration issued a temporary ground stop at Nashville International Airport because of the weather, media outlets reported. Northeast of Nashville, a flash flood emergency was issued for Sumner and Robertson counties including the cities of Hendersonville and Gallatin. The National Weather Service said water rescues were ongoing in those areas and described the flooding from heavy thunderstorms as life-threatening. \"Do not attempt to travel unless you are fleeing an area subject to flooding or under an evacuation order,\" the weather agency alert said.\n\nIn North Carolina, a state of emergency was declared for Gaston County Wednesday evening following a large storm. First responders were working to clear roads of downed power lines and broken trees and were helping residents, officials said. The New Hope Fire Department responded to a tree down on a car. One person in the car was killed and another was taken to a hospital, officials said. More than 135,000 customers had lost power in the state as of Wednesday evening, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nTornadoes were first reported after dark Tuesday in parts of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, according to the National Weather Service. The storms came a day after a deadly twister ripped through an Oklahoma town.\n\nThe National Weather Service confirmed tornadoes touched down Tuesday in western Ohio: five in Warren County and one each in Darke, Mercer and Auglaize counties. The weather service said crews are still surveying areas in other counties to determine if tornadoes struck there, as well.\n\nCrews on Wednesday were able to survey the damage caused by the strong storms that contained hail and heavy rains and knocked out power to thousands of utility customers.\n\nIn Michigan, weather service meteorologist Nathan Jeruzal said the tornadoes there touched down one each in Kalamazoo, Cass and Branch counties -- all in the southwestern part of the state. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\nKalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart and more than a dozen mobile homes were destroyed. About 50 people temporarily were trapped inside the damaged facility because of downed power lines. More than a dozen homes were destroyed in a mobile home park in adjacent Pavilion Township and 16 people were injured, said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller.\n\nSamantha Smith clutched a box Wednesday afternoon as she stepped from her mother's partially wrecked home in Pavilion Township, about 137 miles (220 kilometers) west of Detroit. Inside the box were her grandmother's ashes. Being able to recover the most cherished of items offered Smith a rare moment of relief amid the storm's devastation.\n\nHer parents and brother were injured during the storm but survived.\n\n\"I have thanked God probably a billion times since this happened yesterday,\" she said. \"My kids are healthy and good. We just gotta make back up what we lost.\" Travis Wycoff ventured out Tuesday night after seeing on radar that a tornado had touched down in the Portage area, and he said he helped an elderly couple out of their partially collapsed home and freed a service dog from a home.\n\n\"There were a lot of people running through the streets trying to find people and their pets,\" Wycoff said. \"It was just a lot of chaos.\" In southern Indiana, the National Weather Service confirmed a tornado touched down early Wednesday, damaging homes in a subdivision north of the city of Sellersburg, located about 12 miles (19 kilometers) north of Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nThe Clark County Emergency Management Agency said the storm damaged 24 structures.\n\nCandice Holmes, a resident of the Lewis & Clark subdivision north of Sellersburg, said she, her husband and son sought shelter in their bathroom when they heard the approaching storm and \"the wind just picked up all at once.\" \"It was definitely a scary moment. ...

(AP) -- Forecasters warned a wave of dangerous storms in the U.S. could march through parts of the South early Thursday, after storms a day earlier spawned damaging tornadoes and massive hail, leaving two dead in Tennessee and one dead in North Carolina.\n\nThe storms continue an outbreak of torrential rain and tornadoes that has cut across the country this week, from the Plains to the Midwest and now the southeastern U.S. At least four people have died in storms since Monday.\n\nAmid Wednesday's storms, the National Weather Service continued issuing tornado warnings that stretch past midnight in North Carolina, Alabama, Georgia, Missouri and Kentucky. Parts of Arkansas and Mississippi were also under a tornado watch through the pre-dawn hours.\n\nOne storm that rumbled across northeastern Tennessee on Wednesday brought high winds that knocked down power lines and trees. Bob Brooks, the sheriff in Claiborne County about an hour north of Knoxville, said a 22-year-old man was in a car when he was fatally struck by one of the trees.\n\nA second person was killed in the city of Columbia in Maury County, where the National Weather Service said a likely tornado had touched down. Columbia is just south of Nashville.\n\nHomes were damaged and people injured, according to Lynn Thompson, assistant director of Maury County 911.

(AP) -- Forecasters warned a wave of dangerous storms in the U.S. could march through parts of the South early Thursday, after storms a day earlier spawned damaging tornadoes and massive hail, leaving two dead in Tennessee and one dead in North Carolina.\n\nThe storms continue an outbreak of torrential rain and tornadoes that has cut across the country this week, from the Plains to the Midwest and now the southeastern U.S. At least four people have died in storms since Monday.\n\nAmid Wednesday's storms, the National Weather Service continued issuing tornado warnings that stretch past midnight in North Carolina, Alabama, Georgia, Missouri and Kentucky. Parts of Arkansas and Mississippi were also under a tornado watch through the pre-dawn hours.\n\nOne storm that rumbled across northeastern Tennessee on Wednesday brought high winds that knocked down power lines and trees. Bob Brooks, the sheriff in Claiborne County about an hour north of Knoxville, said a 22-year-old man was in a car when he was fatally struck by one of the trees.\n\nA second person was killed in the city of Columbia in Maury County, where the National Weather Service said a likely tornado had touched down. Columbia is just south of Nashville.\n\nHomes were damaged and people injured, according to Lynn Thompson, assistant director of Maury County 911. Thompson told The Associated Press that he could not provide any further details: \"We're getting overloaded right now.\"\n\nRita Thompson, a spokesperson for Maury Regional Health, said the hospital had received five patients, including the person who died.

A tornado first touched down in Portage around 6 p.m. near eastbound Centre Street at Shaver Road, first responders reported, the Kalamazoo County Sheriff's Office said on Facebook. The tornado left scattered building debris and power lines down, the Sheriff's Office said.\n\nSocial media posts showed buildings in Portage with heavy damage.\n\nTwo trained spotters reported another tornado in Portage at 7:18 p.m. and a tornado was reported nearby in Comstock at 7:22 p.m., according to the weather service storm reports. A tornado also was reported in Mendon at 5:50 p.m. and Leonidas at 6 p.m., according to the reports.\n\nTree damage was reported in Leonidas, and trees 3 feet in diameter were reported down in northeast Portage, the weather service said. More downed large trees and power lines, as well as scattered shingles, were reported in west Portage. There also were reports of large hail, ranging from 1.5 inches to 4 inches in diameter, in Portage, parts of St. Joseph County and Union City, according to the weather service.\n\nSteven Burnett was making dinner when he received alerts that a tornado touched down near his home on Meredith Street. His wife, children, brother and sister-in-law, their children and his mother-in-law dashed to a small bathroom in the basement and prayed.\n\n\"It was really calm when it started, then we heard the wind and the whole entire house just shook,\" Burnett said. \"Two whole families were crammed in a bathroom in the basement; we all fit and we all held hands as my daughter and nephew started praying ... It made me feel calmer.\"\n\nWhen he took stock after the storm, he found a tree had fallen on his home and vehicles.\n\nNearby, on East Milham Avenue, trampolines hung in trees and roofing material littered the road and nearby yards as bulldozers and Consumers Energy crews worked alongside the Portage Public Works Department to clear roads and shut off gas.\n\nSpencer White, 24, and his 22-year-old brother watched as the storm raised his neighbor's trampoline and launched it into trees.\n\n...continued", "source": {"uri": "arcamax.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "ArcaMax"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tornado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Electric power transmission"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portage_County,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Portage County, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Portage County, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalamazoo_County,_Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kalamazoo County, Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kalamazoo County, Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Joseph_County,_Indiana", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "St. Joseph County, Indiana"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "St. Joseph County, Indiana"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comstock_Township,_Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Comstock Township, Michigan"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendon,_Massachusetts", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Mendon, Massachusetts"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mendon, Massachusetts"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "National Weather Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook", "type": "org", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Facebook"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hail", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Hail"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnett_County,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Burnett County, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Burnett County, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_ethnicity_in_the_United_States_census", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Race and ethnicity in the United States census"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumers_Energy", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Consumers Energy"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trampoline", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Trampoline"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_school", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State school"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_City,_New_Jersey", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Union City, New Jersey"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Union City, New Jersey"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing/Tree_Climbing", "label": "dmoz/Recreation/Climbing/Tree Climbing", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 66}], "image": "https://resources.arcamax.com/newspics/288/28840/2884096.gif", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548085", "eventUri": "eng-9548085", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Portage County, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.09019607843137256, "wgt": 184, "relevance": 1}

The storms came a day after a deadly twister ripped through an Oklahoma town.\n\nSamantha Smith clutched a box Wednesday afternoon as she stepped from her mother's partially wrecked home in Michigan's Pavilion Township, about 137 miles (220 kilometers) west of Detroit. Inside the box were her grandmother's ashes. Being able to recover the most cherished of items offered Smith a rare moment of relief amid the storm's devastation.\n\n\"Finding this box is the best thing that's happened to me these past 24 hours,\" she said. \"The main thing we were all worried about was my grandma's ashes.\"\n\nHer parents and brother were injured during the storm. Her brother suffered a broken pelvis and broken back, but he and other victims all survived, Smith added.\n\n\"I have thanked God probably a billion times since this happened yesterday,\" she said. \"My kids are healthy and good. We just gotta make back up what we lost.\"\n\nIn southern Indiana, the National Weather Service confirmed a tornado with a preliminary EF-0 rating and 85 mph (137 kph) winds touched down early Wednesday, damaging homes in a subdivision north of the city of Sellersburg, located about 12 miles (19 kilometers) north of Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nThe Clark County Emergency Management Agency said the storm damaged 24 structures.\n\nCandice Holmes, a resident of the Lewis & Clark subdivision north of Sellersburg, said she, her husband and son sought shelter in their bathroom when they heard the approaching storm and \"the wind just picked up all at once.\"\n\n\"My husband and my son stepped outside, opened the door and they slammed the door and ran back to the bathroom. And they held the bathroom door shut, as it came through,\" Holmes told WDRB-TV. \"It was over as soon as it started, but it was definitely a scary moment. And I'm glad we're alive.\"\n\nSurvey teams planned to head out Wednesday to determine whether tornadoes struck locations in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia, according to Jeff Craven, the meteorologist-in-charge in the weather service's Pittsburgh office.\n\nRadar indicated Hancock County, West Virginia, and in Jefferson County, Ohio, were hit by tornadoes, but teams will have to evaluate the damage to determine their rating, Craven said.\n\nHancock County Schools in West Virginia closed schools Wednesday because of \"extensive overnight weather issues\" in the county. News outlets reported damaged buildings and power outages.\n\nA National Weather Service team also was headed to Hot Springs, Arkansas, to survey damage and determine the strength of a tornado that hit early Wednesday morning, forecaster Tabitha Clarke said.\n\nThe tornado damaged some homes, uprooted trees and downed power lines. There were no immediate reports of injuries from the tornado, according to the state Division of Emergency Management.\n\nIn Portage, Michigan, about 50 people temporarily were trapped inside a damaged FedEx facility because of downed power lines. More than a dozen homes were destroyed in a mobile home park in adjacent Pavilion Township and 16 people were injured, said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller.\n\n\"We found homes in the roadway,\" Fuller said late Tuesday. \"We found homes in neighbors' homes. We found large trees in homes.\"\n\nPower was knocked out to more than 20,000 people.\n\n\"We're looking at homes throughout this community that are totally gone, they've been demolished,\" Fuller said in the light of day at Pavilion Estates mobile home park.\n\nA home where seven people were living \"is totally on its top,\" he said. \"They were able to self-rescue and get somewhere safe and came back today.\"\n\nTravis Wycoff ventured out Tuesday night after seeing on radar that a tornado had touched down in the Portage area. About five minutes later, he came upon the aftermath.\n\n\"There were a lot of people running through the streets trying to find people and their pets,\" Wycoff said. \"It was just a lot of chaos.\"\n\nWycoff said he helped an elderly couple out of their partially collapsed home and also freed a service dog from a home whose owner was at work.\n\nMore than 30,000 customers were without power in Michigan early Wednesday, and an additional 10,000 in Ohio, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nAcross the US, the entire week is looking stormy. The Midwest and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati -- cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nOn Monday night, a deadly twister in Oklahoma tore through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall. At least one person was killed and another was missing. Dozens of homes were destroyed.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit Barnsdall in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles.\n\nAreas in Oklahoma, including Sulphur and Holdenville, are still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month.(AP)",

Twisters were first reported after dark Tuesday in parts of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, while portions of Illinois, Kentucky and Missouri were also under a tornado watch, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nCrews are working to clean up a mobile home park that was ripped into pieces by the storm in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller said more than a dozen mobile homes in Pavilion Township were 'totally destroyed.' At least 16 people, he added, were injured there, though the injuries were not life-threatening. 'The clean-up efforts are tremendous. We're looking at homes throughout this community that are totally gone, they've been demolished,' Fuller said.\n\nHomes were completely flipped over and cars were smashed by debris and trees moved by the storm. A home where seven people were living 'is totally on its top,' he said. 'They were able to self-rescue and get somewhere safe and came back today.' 'We found homes in the roadway,' the sheriff said late Tuesday. 'We found homes in neighbors' homes. We found large trees in homes.'\n\nIn southwestern Michigan, two reported tornadoes blitzed the city of Portage and an adjacent community Tuesday night, destroying homes and commercial buildings, including a FedEx facility that was ripped apart. No serious injuries were immediately reported, but city officials said in a news release that the twisters knocked out power to more than 20,000 people. Most of them would be without power until late Wednesday, city officials said.\n\nAt one point, about 50 people were trapped inside the FedEx facility because of downed power lines. But company spokesperson Shannon Davis said late Tuesday that 'all team members are safe and accounted for.' Multiple homes and businesses were destroyed after a possible tornado touched down in Centreville on Tuesday, St. Joseph County Undersheriff Jason Bingaman told CNN.\n\nRoofs were ripped off and homes flattened 'completely down' by the storm, Bingaman said. At least seven homes were destroyed in nearby Branch County, according to Emergency Management Director Tim Miner. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties. 'My heart goes out to all those impacted by tonight's severe weather in southwest Michigan,' Whitmer said in a message on social media. 'State and local emergency teams are on the ground and working together to assist Michiganders.'\n\nNational Weather Service crews were working Wednesday to survey storm damage in several counties in Michigan's southwest Lower Peninsula to determine whether tornadoes touched down in those areas, including the two reported Tuesday night in the city of Portage, said meteorologist Mike Sutton with the weather service's Grand Rapids office. He said the Grand Rapids office had received a total of 11 reports of tornadoes from storm spotters, emergency managers and the public from late Tuesday afternoon into Tuesday night, but as of 8 a.m. Wednesday, it had not confirmed any tornado touchdowns.\n\nSutton said it could be a couple days before the storm surveys are completed and he stressed that some of the tornado reports could be duplicate reports passed along by people who saw the same storm. 'It's quite possible those are multiple reports from the same tornado. The actual number of tornadoes may be lower depending on what they find when they're out surveying,' he said. Tuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nNumerous severe thunderstorms are forecasted Wednesday from parts of the mid Mississippi, Ohio, and Tennessee Valleys into the southern Plains, according to the National Weather Service. Tornadoes, very large to giant hail, and potentially significant damaging winds are possible. Across the U.S., the entire week is looking stormy. The Midwest and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati - cities where more than 21 million people live.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

Claiborne County Sheriff Bob Brooks said a 22-year-old man was in a car struck by one of the trees.\n\nNational Weather Service meteorologist Nathan Jeruzal said the tornadoes in Michigan touched down one each in Kalamazoo, Cass and Branch counties - all in the southwestern part of the state.\n\nKalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart and more than a dozen mobile homes were destroyed.\n\nTornadoes were first reported after dark Tuesday in parts of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, while portions of Illinois, Kentucky and Missouri were also under a tornado watch, according to the National Weather Service. The storms came a day after a deadly twister ripped through an Oklahoma town.\n\nSamantha Smith clutched a box Wednesday afternoon as she stepped from her mother's partially wrecked home in Michigan's Pavilion Township, about 137 miles (220 kilometers) west of Detroit. Inside the box were her grandmother's ashes. Being able to recover the most cherished of items offered Smith a rare moment of relief amid the storm's devastation.\n\n\"Finding this box is the best thing that's happened to me these past 24 hours,\" she said. \"The main thing we were all worried about was my grandma's ashes.\"\n\nHer parents and brother were injured during the storm. Her brother suffered a broken pelvis and broken back, but he and other victims all survived, Smith added.\n\n\"I have thanked God probably a billion times since this happened yesterday,\" she said. \"My kids are healthy and good. We just gotta make back up what we lost.\"\n\nIn southern Indiana, the National Weather Service confirmed a tornado with a preliminary EF-0 rating and 85 mph (137 kph) winds touched down early Wednesday, damaging homes in a subdivision north of the city of Sellersburg, located about 12 miles (19 kilometers) north of Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nThe Clark County Emergency Management Agency said the storm damaged 24 structures.\n\nSEE ALSO | Chicago weather: 4 animals die in north suburban barn collapse, other severe storm damage reported\n\nCandice Holmes, a resident of the Lewis & Clark subdivision north of Sellersburg, said she, her husband and son sought shelter in their bathroom when they heard the approaching storm and \"the wind just picked up all at once.\"\n\n\"My husband and my son stepped outside, opened the door and they slammed the door and ran back to the bathroom. And they held the bathroom door shut, as it came through,\" Holmes told WDRB-TV. \"It was over as soon as it started, but it was definitely a scary moment. And I'm glad we're alive.\"\n\nSurvey teams planned to head out Wednesday to determine whether tornadoes struck locations in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia, according to Jeff Craven, the meteorologist-in-charge in the weather service's Pittsburgh office.\n\nRadar indicated Hancock County, West Virginia, and in Jefferson County, Ohio, were hit by tornadoes, but teams will have to evaluate the damage to determine their rating, Craven said.\n\nHancock County Schools in West Virginia closed schools Wednesday because of \"extensive overnight weather issues\" in the county. News outlets reported damaged buildings and power outages.\n\nA National Weather Service team also was headed to Hot Springs, Arkansas, to survey damage and determine the strength of a tornado that hit early Wednesday morning, forecaster Tabitha Clarke said.\n\nThe tornado damaged some homes, uprooted trees and downed power lines. There were no immediate reports of injuries from the tornado, according to the state Division of Emergency Management.\n\nIn Portage, Michigan, about 50 people temporarily were trapped inside a damaged FedEx facility because of downed power lines. More than a dozen homes were destroyed in a mobile home park in adjacent Pavilion Township and 16 people were injured, said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller.\n\n\"We found homes in the roadway,\" Fuller said late Tuesday. \"We found homes in neighbors' homes. We found large trees in homes.\"\n\nPower was knocked out to more than 20,000 people.\n\n\"We're looking at homes throughout this community that are totally gone, they've been demolished,\" Fuller said in the light of day at Pavilion Estates mobile home park.\n\nA home where seven people were living \"is totally on its top,\" he said. \"They were able to self-rescue and get somewhere safe and came back today.\"\n\nTravis Wycoff ventured out Tuesday night after seeing on radar that a tornado had touched down in the Portage area. About five minutes later, he came upon the aftermath.\n\n\"There were a lot of people running through the streets trying to find people and their pets,\" Wycoff said. \"It was just a lot of chaos.\"\n\nWycoff said he helped an elderly couple out of their partially collapsed home and also freed a service dog from a home whose owner was at work.\n\nMore than 30,000 customers were without power in Michigan early Wednesday, and an additional 10,000 in Ohio, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nAcross the U.S., the entire week is looking stormy. The Midwest and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati - cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nOn Monday night, a deadly twister in Oklahoma tore through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall. At least one person was killed and another was missing. Dozens of homes were destroyed.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit Barnsdall in five weeks - a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles.\n\nAreas in Oklahoma, including Sulphur and Holdenville, are still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month.", "source":

(AP) -- At least eight tornadoes have touched down in Ohio and three have been confirmed in Michigan as severe storms barreled through the central U.S. late Tuesday and early Wednesday, killing one man in Tennessee when a tree toppled onto a vehicle he was in.\n\nThe storm that rumbled across northeastern Tennessee brought high winds that knocked down powerlines and trees. Claiborne County Sheriff Bob Brooks said a 22-year-old man was in a car struck by one of the trees.\n\nThe National Weather Service says confirmed tornadoes touched down Tuesday in Ohio, including five in Warren County in the state's southwest region. The confirmations came Wednesday after crews were able to survey the damage caused by the strong storms that contained hail and heavy rains and knocked out power to thousands of utility customers.\n\nWeather service meteorologist in Michigan Nathan Jeruzal said the tornadoes there touched down one each in Kalamazoo, Cass and Branch counties -- all in the southwestern part of the state.\n\nKalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart and more than a dozen mobile homes were destroyed.\n\nTornadoes were first reported after dark Tuesday in parts of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, while portions of Illinois, Kentucky and Missouri were also under a tornado watch, according to the National Weather Service. The storms came a day after a deadly twister ripped through an Oklahoma town.\n\nSamantha Smith clutched a box Wednesday afternoon as she stepped from her mother's partially wrecked home in Michigan's Pavilion Township, about 137 miles (220 kilometers) west of Detroit. Inside the box were her grandmother's ashes. Being able to recover the most cherished of items offered Smith a rare moment of relief amid the storm's devastation.\n\n\"Finding this box is the best thing that's happened to me these past 24 hours,\" she said. \"The main thing we were all worried about was my grandma's ashes.\"\n\nHer parents and brother were injured during the storm. Her brother suffered a broken pelvis and broken back, but he and other victims all survived, Smith added.\n\n\"I have thanked God probably a billion times since this happened yesterday,\" she said. \"My kids are healthy and good. We just gotta make back up what we lost.\"\n\nIn southern Indiana, the National Weather Service confirmed a tornado with a preliminary EF-0 rating and 85 mph (137 kph) winds touched down early Wednesday, damaging homes in a subdivision north of the city of Sellersburg, located about 12 miles (19 kilometers) north of Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nThe Clark County Emergency Management Agency said the storm damaged 24 structures.\n\nCandice Holmes, a resident of the Lewis & Clark subdivision north of Sellersburg, said she, her husband and son sought shelter in their bathroom when they heard the approaching storm and \"the wind just picked up all at once.\"\n\n\"My husband and my son stepped outside, opened the door and they slammed the door and ran back to the bathroom. And they held the bathroom door shut, as it came through,\" Holmes told WDRB-TV. \"It was over as soon as it started, but it was definitely a scary moment. And I'm glad we're alive.\"\n\nIn addition to the five in Warren County, confirmed tornadoes in Ohio were in the western part of the state in Greenville in Darke County, west of Coldwater in Mercer County and west of New Knoxville in Auglaize County. The weather service says crews are still surveying areas of Franklin and Butler counties to determine if tornadoes struck there, as well.\n\nJust outside of Pittsburgh, a weather service team confirmed that a brief tornado with maximum winds of 105 mph (169 kph) overturned a trailer and snapped more than a dozen trees early Wednesday in Findlay Township, Pennsylvania.\n\nBaseball-sized hail was reported Wednesday in areas just southwest of St. Louis, Missouri. Heavy downpours caused flash flooding and at least one water rescue near Sullivan, a town that was struck by a small tornado just two days earlier, destroying a bar and damaging the high school. Damaging hail also was reported in the Kansas City area.\n\nRadar indicated Hancock County, West Virginia, and Jefferson County, Ohio, were hit by tornadoes, but teams will have to evaluate the damage to determine their rating, Craven said.\n\nHancock County Schools in West Virginia closed schools Wednesday because of \"extensive overnight weather issues\" in the county. News outlets reported damaged buildings and power outages.\n\nA National Weather Service team also was headed to Hot Springs, Arkansas, to survey damage and determine the strength of a tornado that hit early Wednesday morning, forecaster Tabitha Clarke said.\n\nThe tornado damaged some homes, uprooted trees and downed power lines. There were no immediate reports of injuries from the tornado, according to the state Division of Emergency Management.\n\nIn Portage, Michigan, about 50 people temporarily were trapped inside a damaged FedEx facility because of downed power lines. More than a dozen homes were destroyed in a mobile home park in adjacent Pavilion Township and 16 people were injured, said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller.\n\n\"We found homes in the roadway,\" Fuller said late Tuesday. \"We found homes in neighbors' homes. We found large trees in homes.\"\n\nPower was knocked out to more than 20,000 people.\n\n\"We're looking at homes throughout this community that are totally gone, they've been demolished,\" Fuller said in the light of day at Pavilion Estates mobile home park.\n\nA home where seven people were living \"is totally on its top,\" he said. \"They were able to self-rescue and get somewhere safe and came back today.\"\n\nTravis Wycoff ventured out Tuesday night after seeing on radar that a tornado had touched down in the Portage area. About five minutes later, he came upon the aftermath.\n\n\"There were a lot of people running through the streets trying to find people and their pets,\" Wycoff said. \"It was just a lot of chaos.\"\n\nWycoff said he helped an elderly couple out of their partially collapsed home and also freed a service dog from a home whose owner was at work.\n\nMore than 30,000 customers were without power in Michigan early Wednesday, and an additional 10,000 in Ohio, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nAcross the U.S., the entire week is looking stormy. The Midwest and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati -- cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nOn Monday night, a deadly twister in Oklahoma tore through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall. At least one person was killed and another was missing. Dozens of homes were destroyed.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit Barnsdall in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles.\n\nAreas in Oklahoma, including Sulphur and Holdenville, are still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month.\n\n___\n\nMurphy reported from Oklahoma City. Associated Press journalists around the country contributed to this report, including Rio Yamat, Heather Hollingsworth, Colleen Slevin, Jim Salter, Kathy McCormack, Sarah Brumfield, Beatrice Dupuy and Alexa St. John.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

(AP) -- Three tornadoes have been confirmed in Michigan as severe storms barreled through the central U.S. early Wednesday, killing one man in Tennessee when a tree toppled onto a vehicle he was in.\n\nThe storm that rumbled across northeastern Tennessee brought high winds that knocked down powerlines and trees. Claiborne County Sheriff Bob Brooks said a 22-year-old man was in a car struck by one of the trees.\n\nNational Weather Service meteorologist Nathan Jeruzal said the tornadoes in Michigan touched down one each in Kalamazoo, Cass and Branch counties -- all in the southwestern part of the state.\n\nKalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart and more than a dozen mobile homes were destroyed.\n\nTornadoes were first reported after dark Tuesday in parts of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, while portions of Illinois, Kentucky and Missouri were also under a tornado watch, according to the National Weather Service. The storms came a day after a deadly twister ripped through an Oklahoma town.\n\nSamantha Smith clutched a box Wednesday afternoon as she stepped from her mother's partially wrecked home in Michigan's Pavilion Township, about 137 miles (220 kilometers) west of Detroit. Inside the box were her grandmother's ashes. Being able to recover the most cherished of items offered Smith a rare moment of relief amid the storm's devastation.\n\n\"Finding this box is the best thing that's happened to me these past 24 hours,\" she said. \"The main thing we were all worried about was my grandma's ashes.\"\n\nHer parents and brother were injured during the storm. Her brother suffered a broken pelvis and broken back, but he and other victims all survived, Smith added.\n\n\"I have thanked God probably a billion times since this happened yesterday,\" she said. \"My kids are healthy and good. We just gotta make back up what we lost.\"\n\nIn southern Indiana, the National Weather Service confirmed a tornado with a preliminary EF-0 rating and 85 mph (137 kph) winds touched down early Wednesday, damaging homes in a subdivision north of the city of Sellersburg, located about 12 miles (19 kilometers) north of Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nThe Clark County Emergency Management Agency said the storm damaged 24 structures.\n\nCandice Holmes, a resident of the Lewis & Clark subdivision north of Sellersburg, said she, her husband and son sought shelter in their bathroom when they heard the approaching storm and \"the wind just picked up all at once.\"\n\n\"My husband and my son stepped outside, opened the door and they slammed the door and ran back to the bathroom. And they held the bathroom door shut, as it came through,\" Holmes told WDRB-TV. \"It was over as soon as it started, but it was definitely a scary moment. And I'm glad we're alive.\"\n\nSurvey teams planned to head out Wednesday to determine whether tornadoes struck locations in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia, according to Jeff Craven, the meteorologist-in-charge in the weather service's Pittsburgh office.\n\nRadar indicated Hancock County, West Virginia, and in Jefferson County, Ohio, were hit by tornadoes, but teams will have to evaluate the damage to determine their rating, Craven said.\n\nHancock County Schools in West Virginia closed schools Wednesday because of \"extensive overnight weather issues\" in the county. News outlets reported damaged buildings and power outages.\n\nA National Weather Service team also was headed to Hot Springs, Arkansas, to survey damage and determine the strength of a tornado that hit early Wednesday morning, forecaster Tabitha Clarke said.\n\nThe tornado damaged some homes, uprooted trees and downed power lines. There were no immediate reports of injuries from the tornado, according to the state Division of Emergency Management.\n\nIn Portage, Michigan, about 50 people temporarily were trapped inside a damaged FedEx facility because of downed power lines. More than a dozen homes were destroyed in a mobile home park in adjacent Pavilion Township and 16 people were injured, said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller.\n\n\"We found homes in the roadway,\" Fuller said late Tuesday. \"We found homes in neighbors' homes. We found large trees in homes.\"\n\nPower was knocked out to more than 20,000 people.\n\n\"We're looking at homes throughout this community that are totally gone, they've been demolished,\" Fuller said in the light of day at Pavilion Estates mobile home park.\n\nA home where seven people were living \"is totally on its top,\" he said. \"They were able to self-rescue and get somewhere safe and came back today.\"\n\nTravis Wycoff ventured out Tuesday night after seeing on radar that a tornado had touched down in the Portage area. About five minutes later, he came upon the aftermath.\n\n\"There were a lot of people running through the streets trying to find people and their pets,\" Wycoff said. \"It was just a lot of chaos.\"\n\nWycoff said he helped an elderly couple out of their partially collapsed home and also freed a service dog from a home whose owner was at work.\n\nMore than 30,000 customers were without power in Michigan early Wednesday, and an additional 10,000 in Ohio, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nAcross the U.S., the entire week is looking stormy. The Midwest and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati -- cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nOn Monday night, a deadly twister in Oklahoma tore through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall. At least one person was killed and another was missing. Dozens of homes were destroyed.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit Barnsdall in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles.\n\nAreas in Oklahoma, including Sulphur and Holdenville, are still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month.\n\nMurphy reported from Oklahoma City. Associated Press journalists around the country contributed to this report, including Rio Yamat, Heather Hollingsworth, Colleen Slevin, Jim Salter, Kathy McCormack, Sarah Brumfield, Beatrice Dupuy and Alexa St. John.\n\nThe Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Randall said in a statement that her city was struck by two tornadoes on Tuesday, with no reports of injuries or death so far.\n\nOne of the vortexes ripped off the side of a massive FedEx facility there, leaving about 50 workers trapped as first responders hoped to clear live electrical wires blocking their safe exit, Kalamazoo County spokesperson Taylor Koopman said by email.\n\n\"The FedEx building in Portage sustained significant damage and is still an active scene,\" she said.\n\nAt Pavilion Estates Mobile Home Park in Kalamazoo County, entire residences were destroyed by a tornado, Koopman said. Rescue crews were on-site searching for survivors and those in need of temporary shelter, which was set up at Portage Senior Center, she said.\n\nResidents were urged to stay put as first responders sort out the situation.\n\n\"We have multiple scenes across the County and heavy damage,\" Koopman said. \"There are several reports of power outages, wires down, and debris in the roadways. We ask that folks stay off the road if they're able.\"\n\nMore than 32,000 utility customers in Michigan were without power Tuesday night, according to utility tracker PowerOutage.us.\n\nImagery of a strip mall barber shop in Portage showed its front ripped away to reveal its interior.\n\n\"Due to downed power lines and trees and possible gas leaks we are urging residents to stay in their homes so first responders can reach those who need assistance,\" Randall said.\n\nThe National Weather Service issued a rare tornado emergency statement Tuesday afternoon for an area, including Union City, southwest of Portage.\n\nA weather service meteorologist said that one tornado and likely one or two others were all but confirmed Tuesday night, even as the service customarily waits until the next day to send trained crews to the sites of possible tornadoes for confirmation.\n\nThe severe weather since mid-April is the result of waves of cool, low pressure storms moving east from the Pacific Northwest and clashing with the warmers climes of states near the Gulf Coast. The colliding air has produced unsettled weather ripe for tornadoes, flooding and hail.\n\nThere were 19 reported tornadoes in at least seven states on Monday.\n\nThe National Weather Service said heavy weather, including possible thunderstorms and flash floods, was in store for many of the same regions for the next couple of days.\n\nAn estimated 53 million people from northeast Texas to Virginia will be in the risk area for severe storms on Thursday.\n\nPortage is about 142 miles west of Detroit.", "source": {"uri": "aol.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Aol"}, "authors": [{"uri":

She said her parents and brother were injured during the storm but survived.\n\n'I have thanked God probably a billion times since this happened yesterday,' she said. 'My kids are healthy and good. We just gotta make back up what we lost.'\n\nTornadoes were also confirmed in Pennsylvania just outside Pittsburgh, in central Arkansas and in northern West Virginia.

(Credit: Chicago & Midwest Storm Chasers via CNN Newsource)\n\n(CNN) -- Powerful tornadoes and storms swept through southwestern Michigan Tuesday evening, destroying homes and businesses and injuring several residents, scenes that could play out once again in the central and eastern U.S. Wednesday.\n\nHere's the latest on the destruction in Michigan and ongoing storms:\n\n* Mobile home park struck by tornado: More than a dozen people were injured at a mobile home park in Pavilion Township in Kalamazoo County, Michigan, following a tornado Tuesday, according to a city official. Fifteen to 20 people had minor injuries and were transported to two area hospitals, according to the county's emergency management spokesperson Andrew Alspach.\n\n* One Michigan town may have been hit twice: At least one tornado, possibly two, hit Portage Tuesday evening, as the area faced two tornado warnings in just over an hour, the National Weather Service said. Homes and businesses in the city sustained significant damage, but there were no serious injuries, according to town officials. A tornado ripped a large hole into a FedEx facility. Downed wires nearby trapped about 50 people in the facility for a few hours, a spokesperson for the Kalamazoo County administrator's office, told MLive.com.\n\n* Damage reported in at least two other Michigan counties: Multiple homes and businesses were destroyed after a possible tornado touched down in Centreville on Tuesday, according to St. Joseph County Undersheriff Jason Bingaman. The storm damage ripped off roofs and flattened homes \"completely down,\" Bingaman told CNN. At least seven homes were destroyed in nearby Branch County, according to Emergency Management Director Tim Miner.\n\nFirst-ever tornado emergency in Michigan: Parts of Branch County, including Union City, were placed under Michigan's first tornado emergency when \"a large and destructive tornado\" was over the area Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service. Tornado emergencies are the most extreme form of a tornado warning and are only issued when a tornado threatens catastrophic damage and loss of life, often in a populated area.\n\n* Chaotic severe weather stretch: April to June is the most active time for tornadoes in the US, and May is typically the busiest month. This year has been no exception. At least one tornado has been reported in the US every day since April 25 - a streak of 13 days and counting. Nearly 300 tornado reports - at least two of which were confirmed EF4s - were submitted in that time span, according to the Storm Prediction Center.\n\nHomes are left damaged after a tornado at Pavilion Estate Mobile Home Park in Kalamazoo County, Michigan, on May 7, 2024. (Credit: Chicago & Midwest Storm Chasers via CNN Newsource)\n\nTornado Threat Continues Wednesday\n\nNearly 4 million people are under a Level 4 of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms Wednesday, according to the Storm Prediction Center. Within this risk are parts of Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky and Tennessee -- including Nashville.\n\nAn additional 50 million people from Texas, through much of the Ohio Valley and into the mid-Atlantic, are under a Level 2 of 5 or Level 3 of 5 risk.\n\nSevere storms started to bubble to life around sunrise in parts of eastern Kansas. These storms will expand in scope and strength through the morning and push into parts of Missouri. This morning activity will heavily influence how the rest of the day unfolds.\n\nIf morning storms form into a powerful and organized line, damaging winds will be the biggest threat into the afternoon hours. Hail and tornadoes will also be possible. If this organized line doesn't form, the threat for individual storms to produce strong tornadoes - at least EF2 strength - will increase.\n\nParts of Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky and Tennessee face the greatest risk of strong tornadoes, especially from the afternoon onward.\n\nAdditional storms will fire up from the Southern Plains to the mid-Atlantic throughout the afternoon. Storms capable of the strongest winds and largest hail are most likely from Texas to Kentucky and Tennessee, but any storm could unload damaging wind gusts and hail up to the size of softballs.\n\nSome areas may encounter an initial round of severe storms early Wednesday only to be hit with another round later in the day. Tennessee is a prime example. Additional severe weather is likely after thunderstorms unleashed hail, damaging winds and triggered multiple tornado warnings Wednesday morning.\n\nThe repeated rounds of storms Wednesday will also deliver torrential rainfall and raise the risk of flooding.\n\n\"The greatest flash flooding threat also overlaps with the risk of severe thunderstorms, centered over Kentucky and Tennessee as well sections of neighboring states,\" the National Weather Service said. A Level 3 of 4 risk of flooding rainfall is in place here, according to the Weather Prediction Center.\n\nRainfall rates could reach 2 inches per hour, which could dramatically increase the possibility of flash flooding. Locations worked over by multiple heavy storms could record more than 4 to 5 inches of rain.", "source": {"uri": "news.wttw.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "WTTW News"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

(AP) -- Forecasters warned a wave of dangerous storms in the U.S. could march through parts of the South early Thursday, after storms a day earlier spawned damaging tornadoes and massive hail, leaving two dead in Tennessee and one dead in North Carolina.\n\nThe storms continue an outbreak of torrential rain and tornadoes that has cut across the country this week, from the Plains to the Midwest and now the southeastern U.S. At least four people have died in storms since Monday.\n\nAmid Wednesday's storms, the National Weather Service continued issuing tornado warnings that stretch past midnight in North Carolina, Alabama, Georgia, Missouri and Kentucky. Parts of Arkansas and Mississippi were also under a tornado watch through the pre-dawn hours.\n\nOne storm that rumbled across northeastern Tennessee on Wednesday brought high winds that knocked down power lines and trees. Bob Brooks, the sheriff in Claiborne County about an hour north of Knoxville, said a 22-year-old man was in a car when he was fatally struck by one of the trees.\n\nA second person was killed in the city of Columbia in Maury County, where the National Weather Service said a likely tornado had touched down. Columbia is just south of Nashville.\n\nHomes were damaged and people injured, according to Lynn Thompson, assistant director of Maury County 911. Thompson told The Associated Press that he could not provide any further details: \"We're getting overloaded right now.\"\n\nRita Thompson, a spokesperson for Maury Regional Health, said the hospital had received five patients, including the person who died. Another was in serious condition and three had injuries that were not life-threatening, she said.\n\nThe storms also prompted the Federal Aviation Administration to issue a temporary ground stop at Nashville International Airport and the National Weather Service to issue a tornado emergency -- its highest alert level -- for other nearby areas south of the state's capital, including Chapel Hill and Eagleville.\n\nMeanwhile, torrential rain and thunderstorms led to water rescues northeast of Nashville.\n\n\"Do not attempt to travel unless you are fleeing an area subject to flooding or under an evacuation order,\" the National Weather Service warned when it issued a flash flood emergency.\n\nIn North Carolina, a state of emergency was declared Wednesday night for Gaston County, west of Charlotte, following a large storm that toppled power lines and severed trees, including one that landed on a car. One person in the car was killed and another was taken to a hospital, officials said.\n\nThe storms rolled into the region Wednesday after parts of the central United States were battered Monday by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and tornadoes, including a deadly twister that ripped through an Oklahoma town and killed one person. Then, on Tuesday, the Midwest took the brunt of the bad weather.\n\nThe National Weather Service said tornadoes touched down in parts of Michigan, Ohio and Indiana on Tuesday.\n\nIn Michigan, tornadoes swirled through the southwestern part of the state, in and around Kalamazoo County, according to the National Weather Service. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\nKalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart, leaving about 50 people temporarily trapped inside because of downed power lines.\n\nTravis Wycoff ventured out Tuesday night after seeing on radar that a tornado had touched down in the Portage area, and he said he helped an elderly couple out of their partially collapsed home and freed a service dog from another home.\n\n\"There were a lot of people running through the streets trying to find people and their pets,\" Wycoff said. \"It was just a lot of chaos.\"\n\nIn the adjacent Pavilion Township, more than a dozen homes were destroyed in a mobile home park and 16 people were injured, said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller.\n\nSamantha Smith clutched a box Wednesday afternoon outside her mother's partially wrecked home in Pavilion Township. Inside the box were her grandmother's ashes. Being able to recover the most cherished of items offered Smith a rare moment of relief amid the storm's devastation. She said her parents and brother were injured during the storm but survived.\n\n\"I have thanked God probably a billion times since this happened yesterday,\" she said. \"My kids are healthy and good. We just gotta make back up what we lost.\"\n\nTornadoes were also confirmed in Pennsylvania just outside Pittsburgh, in central Arkansas and in northern West Virginia. The West Virginia twister was at least the 11th tornado this year in the state, which sees two tornadoes in an average year.\n\nBoth the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\n___\n\nCappelletti and White reported from Detroit. Associated Press journalists around the country contributed to this report, including Rio Yamat, Heather Hollingsworth, Colleen Slevin, Jim Salter, Kathy McCormack, Sarah Brumfield, Beatrice Dupuy, Alexa St. John, Adrian Sainz, John Raby and Lisa Baumann.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

(Marshall Gorby/Dayton Daily News via AP)\n\nCOLUMBIA, Tenn. (AP) -- Forecasters warned a wave of dangerous storms in the U.S. could march through parts of the South early Thursday, after storms a day earlier spawned damaging tornadoes and massive hail, leaving two dead in Tennessee and one dead in North Carolina.\n\nThe storms continue an outbreak of torrential rain and tornadoes that has cut across the country this week, from the Plains to the Midwest and now the southeastern U.S. At least four people have died in storms since Monday.\n\nAmid Wednesday's storms, the National Weather Service continued issuing tornado warnings that stretch past midnight in North Carolina, Alabama, Georgia, Missouri and Kentucky. Parts of Arkansas and Mississippi were also under a tornado watch through the pre-dawn hours.\n\nOne storm that rumbled across northeastern Tennessee on Wednesday brought high winds that knocked down power lines and trees. Bob Brooks, the sheriff in Claiborne County about an hour north of Knoxville, said a 22-year-old man was in a car when he was fatally struck by one of the trees.\n\nA second person was killed in the city of Columbia in Maury County, where the National Weather Service said a likely tornado had touched down. Columbia is just south of Nashville.\n\nHomes were damaged and people injured, according to Lynn Thompson, assistant director of Maury County 911. Thompson told The Associated Press that he could not provide any further details: \"We're getting overloaded right now.\"\n\nRita Thompson, a spokesperson for Maury Regional Health, said the hospital had received five patients, including the person who died. Another was in serious condition and three had injuries that were not life-threatening, she said.\n\nThe storms also prompted the Federal Aviation Administration to issue a temporary ground stop at Nashville International Airport and the National Weather Service to issue a tornado emergency -- its highest alert level -- for other nearby areas south of the state's capital, including Chapel Hill and Eagleville.\n\nMeanwhile, torrential rain and thunderstorms led to water rescues northeast of Nashville.\n\n\"Do not attempt to travel unless you are fleeing an area subject to flooding or under an evacuation order,\" the National Weather Service warned when it issued a flash flood emergency.\n\nIn North Carolina, a state of emergency was declared Wednesday night for Gaston County, west of Charlotte, following a large storm that toppled power lines and severed trees, including one that landed on a car. One person in the car was killed and another was taken to a hospital, officials said.\n\nThe storms rolled into the region Wednesday after parts of the central United States were battered Monday by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and tornadoes, including a deadly twister that ripped through an Oklahoma town and killed one person. Then, on Tuesday, the Midwest took the brunt of the bad weather.\n\nThe National Weather Service said tornadoes touched down in parts of Michigan, Ohio and Indiana on Tuesday.\n\nIn Michigan, tornadoes swirled through the southwestern part of the state, in and around Kalamazoo County, according to the National Weather Service. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\nKalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart, leaving about 50 people temporarily trapped inside because of downed power lines.\n\nTravis Wycoff ventured out Tuesday night after seeing on radar that a tornado had touched down in the Portage area, and he said he helped an elderly couple out of their partially collapsed home and freed a service dog from another home.\n\n\"There were a lot of people running through the streets trying to find people and their pets,\" Wycoff said. \"It was just a lot of chaos.\"\n\nIn the adjacent Pavilion Township, more than a dozen homes were destroyed in a mobile home park and 16 people were injured, said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller.\n\nSamantha Smith clutched a box Wednesday afternoon outside her mother's partially wrecked home in Pavilion Township. Inside the box were her grandmother's ashes. Being able to recover the most cherished of items offered Smith a rare moment of relief amid the storm's devastation. She said her parents and brother were injured during the storm but survived.\n\n\"I have thanked God probably a billion times since this happened yesterday,\" she said. \"My kids are healthy and good. We just gotta make back up what we lost.\"\n\nTornadoes were also confirmed in Pennsylvania just outside Pittsburgh, in central Arkansas and in northern West Virginia. The West Virginia twister was at least the 11th tornado this year in the state, which sees two tornadoes in an average year.\n\nCappelletti and White reported from Detroit. Associated Press journalists around the country contributed to this report, including Rio Yamat, Heather Hollingsworth, Colleen Slevin, Jim Salter, Kathy McCormack, Sarah Brumfield, Beatrice Dupuy, Alexa St. John, Adrian Sainz, John Raby and Lisa Baumann.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Photos showed walls caved in.\n\nNo deaths had been reported in the city as of about 8 p.m., Portage Mayor Patricia Randall said, though crews were still assessing the damage.\n\nThe storm caused \"extensive\" damage in several areas of the city and leaving more than 21,000 of roughly 49,000 residents without power, Randall said in an email. As of about 8 p.m., she had heard of no deaths.\n\nPolice were assessing the damage, \"but with so many trees and wires down, travel is slow,\" Randall said.\n\nA mobile home park in nearby Kalamazoo was also \"hit hard,\" Koopman said, with \"entire homes destroyed.\"\n\nOn X, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) urged people in southwestern Michigan to \"continue monitoring severe weather alerts and follow the advice of emergency officials.\"\n\nSeveral intense tornadoes plowed across parts of southern Michigan on Tuesday evening, causing damage and leaving injuries in their wake. Areas around Kalamazoo and Union City, about 30 miles to the southeast, appeared to be hard hit. More than 30,000 customers were without power across the region following the storms.\n\nTwisters were also confirmed in Indiana and Ohio as storms swarmed the Great Lakes, Midwest and Ohio Valley. Tornado watches stretched from southern Kentucky into southern Michigan on Tuesday evening, where severe storms capable of producing tornadoes, large hail and damaging wind were possible into the night.\n\nIn Michigan, one large tornado was seen crossing U.S. Route 131 near Kalamazoo just after 6 p.m. Significant damage was reported just to the south in Portage. A second tornado was also observed near Portage a little more than an hour after the first. The National Weather Service issued \"particularly dangerous situation\" warnings for both storms, which are reserved for confirmed large and extremely dangerous twisters.\n\nEarlier in the evening, a rare tornado emergency was hoisted by the Weather Service for another storm that tracked through Union City in south-central Michigan and probably produced either a long-track tornado or multiple tornadoes that touched down intermittently for more than an hour.\n\nThe tornado emergency in Union City - reserved for the most dire situations when a large tornado threatens a population center - was the first issued in Michigan by the Weather Service.\n\nThe tornadoes struck the Midwest, Great Lakes and Ohio Valley just one day after a violent EF4 tornado on the 0-to-5 Enhanced Fujita scale for intensity devastated parts of the city of Barnsdall in northeast Oklahoma, killing one person.\n\nThe severe storms that spawned tornadoes erupted as low pressure swept from the southern Plains on Monday into the Great Lakes on Tuesday. A warm front extending east from the low pressure zone served as the main conduit for the tornado-producing thunderstorms in southern Michigan.\n\nAt one point there were multiple concurrent \"particularly dangerous situation\" tornado warnings in addition to the tornado emergency for Union City. More than three dozen tornado warnings had been issued in the Midwest and Great Lakes through 8 p.m. Eastern time.\n\nLarge hail was also observed from the rotating thunderstorms that erupted throughout the Midwest. At least 100 reports of large hail were logged by the Weather Service, growing as large as four inches in diameter in Union City and three inches in diameter in Steuben, Ind.", "source": {"uri":

Officials said collapsed wires and debris had to be removed in order to reach those who were stuck inside.\n\nAll were safely rescued by early Wednesday, the Kalamazoo County Government said in a statement.\n\nLate on Tuesday, FedEx said in its own statement that it is \"grateful there were no serious injuries resulting from damage to our facility\".\n\nOver a dozen tornadoes were reported on Tuesday evening in Michigan, Indiana and Ohio.

Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for Kalamazoo and the neighboring counties of St. Joseph, Branch and Cass, which were also pummeled by storms and large hail.\n\nAt least two tornadoes had swept through the region, the governor said.\n\nThere was destruction throughout Kalamazoo County, including significant damage to a FedEx facility in Portage, according to Andrew Alspach, a spokesperson for the Kalamazoo County Office of Emergency Management. FedEx said in a statement that there were no serious injuries at the facility.\n\nMary Beth Block, a spokesperson for the city of Portage, said late Tuesday night that there were no reports of serious injuries in the city, though some residents were displaced.\n\nShe added that there were several reports of gas leaks in the city.\n\nRoughly 18,000 customers in Kalamazoo County were without power, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nAs storms moved through the region Tuesday, the National Weather Service issued a string of tornado warnings in cities across Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Ohio.\n\nThe storms were expected to continue for a third day. Forecasters said roughly 9.5 million people in cities in Ohio and Kentucky, including Columbus, Cincinnati and Louisville, faced an enhanced risk of severe thunderstorms Wednesday, with the possibility of strong tornadoes and large hail, according to the weather service's Storm Prediction Center.\n\nThe weather service had warned earlier that storms passing over the Midwest on Tuesday would produce heavy rain that may create some localized areas of flash flooding. Urban areas, roads, small streams and low-lying areas were most vulnerable, meteorologists said.\n\nMonday night, at least 15 tornadoes were reported to have struck parts of the Plains. One tornado that was up to 2 miles wide ripped through Barnsdall, Oklahoma, a city about 40 miles northwest of Tulsa, killing one person, an Osage County official said.\n\nOne Osage County official said it had leveled about one-third of the small city, which has a population of about 1,000, and caused multiple injuries. The Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported that up to 40 homes in the town had been damaged.\n\nThe tornado also lifted the roof off a nursing home in Barnsdall, though all residents were accounted for with no injuries or deaths, officials said.\n\nMayor Johnny Kelley said one person was reported missing.\n\n\"We are going through the debris very thoroughly,\" Kelley said at a news conference Tuesday.\n\nConsidering the widespread destruction, it was \"shocking\" there were so few casualties, he said: \"The devastation is pretty substantial.\"\n\nThe tornado also caused power outages in Missouri, Arkansas and Oklahoma. But by early Tuesday, power had been largely restored.\n\nIn Bartlesville, Oklahoma, about 45 miles north of Tulsa, city officials said that emergency responders had rescued people trapped at a Hampton Inn and were recovering downed power lines early Tuesday. Only minor injuries had been reported.\n\nRescue operations were also ongoing at the Osage Nation Reservation, where officials warned residents to stay clear of the roadways and damaged areas.",

(NewsNation) -- Severe storms barreled across the Midwest Tuesday with heavy rain and gusty winds, with as many as 25 tornadoes spotted in parts of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio.\n\nPortions of Illinois, Kentucky and Missouri were also under a tornado watch, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nAs the storms raged in the pre-dawn hours Wednesday, the National Weather Service in Pittsburgh warned that a tornado in northeastern Ohio could cross into Pennsylvania. Parts of West Virginia were also under a tornado warning.\n\nIn southwestern Michigan, two tornadoes hit the city of Portage near Kalamazoo on Tuesday night, destroying homes and commercial buildings -- including a FedEx facility that collapsed.\n\nAccording to the Kalamazoo County Sheriff's Office, about 15 to 17 homes at the Pavilion Estates, a mobile home park in the Portage area, were destroyed. The sheriff's office said 16 to 20 people were injured in Tuesday's storms; their injuries were not life-threatening.\n\nCity officials said in a news release that the twisters knocked out power to more than 20,000 people. Most of them would be without power until late Wednesday, city officials said.\n\nAt one point, at least 50 people were trapped inside the FedEx facility because of downed power lines. Shannon Davis, a company spokesperson, said late Tuesday that \"all team members are safe and accounted for.\"\n\nJeff Nazarians, a resident of Portage living near the FedEx facility, recounted to NewsNation how he was on his porch when he noticed a giant funnel cloud and debris flying through the air in his direction. He quickly ran through his house to seek shelter.\n\n\"It's not like you see on TV shows; outside it's pitch-white, swirling everywhere. I run to my basement as fast as I can. You just hear things outside dropping, flying, crashing, trees falling,\" he recalled. \"I thought the house was going to come up. My garage is torn off the ground. I come out, look around, and the FedEx building is destroyed across the street.\"\n\nThe National Weather Service issued its first-ever tornado emergency in Michigan Tuesday, the most dire of tornado alerts, for Union City and Sherwood.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency Tuesday night for Kalamazoo, St. Joseph, Branch and Cass Counties.\n\n\"Michigan is strong and together we can rebuild,\" she wrote on X.\n\nIn a statement, Whitmer wrote that the state of emergency was declared to expedite resources and Michicagion's State Emergency Operations Center to the impacted areas.\n\n\"My heart goes out to those impacted by tonight's ever weather in Michigan,\" Whitmer wrote.\n\nTuesday's storms came after parts of the central U.S. were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters.\n\nOn Monday night, a deadly twister in Oklahoma tore through the small 1,000-person town of Barnsdall. At least one person was killed and another was missing. Dozens of homes were destroyed.\n\nOklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, who toured the twister's damage on Tuesday, said it was rated by weather researchers as a violent tornado with winds reaching up to 200 mph.\n\nStitt said he and legislative leaders have agreed to set aside $45 million in this year's budget to help storm-damaged communities.\n\nAreas in Oklahoma, including Sulphur and Holdenville, are still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month.", "source": {"uri": "conservativeangle.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Brigitte Gabriel"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

Claiborne County Sheriff Bob Brooks said a 22-year-old man was in a car struck by one of the trees.\n\nWednesday afternoon, a tornado emergency -- the weather service's highest alert level -- was issued for an area south of Nashville including the towns of Spring Hill, Chapel Hill and Eagleville.\n\nThe National Weather Service had previously reported a likely tornado on the ground in nearby Columbia, about 45 miles south of Nashville. People in Columbia were injured and homes were damaged, according to Lynn Thompson, assistant director of Maury County 911. Thompson told The Associated Press that he could not provide any further details: \"We're getting overloaded right now.\"\n\nRita Thompson, Marketing & Communications director with Maury Regional Health, said the hospital had received five patients. One died, another was in serious condition and three had injuries that were not life-threatening.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration issued a temporary ground stop at Nashville International Airport because of the weather, media outlets reported. Northeast of Nashville, a flash flood emergency was issued for Sumner and Robertson counties including the cities of Hendersonville and Gallatin. The National Weather Service said water rescues were ongoing in those areas and described the flooding from heavy thunderstorms as life-threatening.\n\nIn North Carolina, a state of emergency was declared for Gaston County Wednesday evening after a large storm. First responders were working to clear roads of downed power lines and broken trees and were helping residents, officials said. The New Hope Fire Department responded to a tree down on a car. One person in the car was killed and another was taken to a hospital, officials said.\n\nThe National Weather Service confirmed tornadoes touched down Tuesday in western Ohio: five in Warren County and one each in Darke, Mercer and Auglaize counties. The weather service said crews were still surveying areas in other counties to determine if tornadoes struck there, as well.\n\nIn Michigan, weather service meteorologist Nathan Jeruzal said the tornadoes there touched down one each in Kalamazoo, Cass and Branch counties -- all in the southwestern part of the state. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\nIn southern Indiana, the National Weather Service confirmed a tornado touched down early Wednesday. The Clark County Emergency Management Agency said the storm damaged 24 structures, including homes in a subdivision north of the city of Sellersburg, located about 12 miles north of Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nTornadoes were also confirmed in Pennsylvania just outside Pittsburgh, in Central Arkansas and in northern West Virginia. The West Virginia twister was at least the 11th tornado this year in the state, which sees two tornadoes in an average year.\n\nInformation for this article was contributed by Rio Yamat, Heather Hollingsworth, Colleen Slevin, Jim Salter, Kathy McCormack, Sarah Brumfield, Beatrice Dupuy, Alexa St. John, Adrian Sainz, John Raby and Lisa Baumann of The Associated Press.\n\nA storm damaged mobile home is surrounded by debris at Pavilion Estates mobile home park just east of Kalamazoo, Mich.

The colliding air has produced unsettled weather ripe for tornadoes, flooding and hail.\n\nThere were 19 reported tornadoes in at least seven states Monday.\n\nThe National Weather Service said heavy weather, including possible thunderstorms and flash floods, was in store for many of the same regions for the next couple of days.\n\nAn estimated 53 million people from northeast Texas to Virginia will be in the risk area for severe storms Thursday.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado",

(AP) -- Forecasters warned a wave of dangerous storms in the U.S. could march through parts of the South early Thursday, after storms a day earlier spawned damaging tornadoes and massive hail, leaving two dead in Tennessee and one dead in North Carolina.\n\nThe storms continue an outbreak of torrential rain and tornadoes that has cut across the country this week, from the Plains to the Midwest and now the southeastern U.S. At least four people have died in storms since Monday.\n\nAmid Wednesday's storms, the National Weather Service continued issuing tornado warnings that stretch past midnight in North Carolina, Alabama, Georgia, Missouri and Kentucky. Parts of Arkansas and Mississippi were also under a tornado watch through the pre-dawn hours.\n\nOne storm that rumbled across northeastern Tennessee on Wednesday brought high winds that knocked down power lines and trees. Bob Brooks, the sheriff in Claiborne County about an hour north of Knoxville, said a 22-year-old man was in a car when he was fatally struck by one of the trees.\n\nA second person was killed in the city of Columbia in Maury County, where the National Weather Service said a likely tornado had touched down. Columbia is just south of Nashville.\n\nHomes were damaged and people injured, according to Lynn Thompson, assistant director of Maury County 911. Thompson told The Associated Press that he could not provide any further details: \"We're getting overloaded right now.\"\n\nRita Thompson, a spokesperson for Maury Regional Health, said the hospital had received five patients, including the person who died. Another was in serious condition and three had injuries that were not life-threatening, she said.\n\nThe storms also prompted the Federal Aviation Administration to issue a temporary ground stop at Nashville International Airport and the National Weather Service to issue a tornado emergency -- its highest alert level -- for other nearby areas south of the state's capital, including Chapel Hill and Eagleville.\n\nMeanwhile, torrential rain and thunderstorms led to water rescues northeast of Nashville.\n\n\"Do not attempt to travel unless you are fleeing an area subject to flooding or under an evacuation order,\" the National Weather Service warned when it issued a flash flood emergency.\n\nIn North Carolina, a state of emergency was declared Wednesday night for Gaston County, west of Charlotte, following a large storm that toppled power lines and severed trees, including one that landed on a car. One person in the car was killed and another was taken to a hospital, officials said.\n\nThe storms rolled into the region Wednesday after parts of the central United States were battered Monday by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and tornadoes, including a deadly twister that ripped through an Oklahoma town and killed one person. Then, on Tuesday, the Midwest took the brunt of the bad weather.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe National Weather Service said tornadoes touched down in parts of Michigan, Ohio and Indiana on Tuesday.\n\nIn Michigan, tornadoes swirled through the southwestern part of the state, in and around Kalamazoo County, according to the National Weather Service. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\nKalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart, leaving about 50 people temporarily trapped inside because of downed power lines.\n\nTravis Wycoff ventured out Tuesday night after seeing on radar that a tornado had touched down in the Portage area, and he said he helped an elderly couple out of their partially collapsed home and freed a service dog from another home.\n\n\"There were a lot of people running through the streets trying to find people and their pets,\" Wycoff said. \"It was just a lot of chaos.\"\n\nIn the adjacent Pavilion Township, more than a dozen homes were destroyed in a mobile home park and 16 people were injured, said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller.\n\nSamantha Smith clutched a box Wednesday afternoon outside her mother's partially wrecked home in Pavilion Township. Inside the box were her grandmother's ashes. Being able to recover the most cherished of items offered Smith a rare moment of relief amid the storm's devastation. She said her parents and brother were injured during the storm but survived.\n\n\"I have thanked God probably a billion times since this happened yesterday,\" she said. \"My kids are healthy and good. We just gotta make back up what we lost.\"\n\nTornadoes were also confirmed in Pennsylvania just outside Pittsburgh, in central Arkansas and in northern West Virginia. The West Virginia twister was at least the 11th tornado this year in the state, which sees two tornadoes in an average year.\n\nBoth the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nCappelletti and White reported from Detroit. Associated Press journalists around the country contributed to this report, including Rio Yamat, Heather Hollingsworth, Colleen Slevin, Jim Salter, Kathy McCormack, Sarah Brumfield, Beatrice Dupuy, Alexa St. John, Adrian Sainz, John Raby and Lisa Baumann.\n\nThe Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

(WOOD) -- Residents are dealing with the damage following multiple tornadoes in southwest Michigan.\n\nSign up for the Storm Team 8 daily forecast newsletter\n\nMost of the damage happened in the Portage area in Kalamazoo County and in Centreville in St. Joseph County.\n\nStorm Team 8 tracked a tornado in the Centreville area around 5:50 p.m. St. Joseph County dispatch confirmed to News 8 a potential tornado touched in Centreville.\n\nAt Main Street and Eleanor Drive in Centreville, a News 8 crew saw uprooted trees and debris from the damaged roof of nearby Nottawa Gas Company scattered through the area.\n\n\"They just moved back here within the year or so, and they sustained some pretty heavy damage on all their buildings back here,\" St. Joseph County Undersheriff Jason Bingaman told News 8. \"We'll have to see what the overall damage is, but they've got extensive damage.\"\n\nHe said several buildings, both residential and commercial, have been damaged. There have been no reports of fatalities or serious injuries, he said, and first responders are working to make sure people are safe.\n\n\"When the storm came in it was pretty chaotic,\" he said. \"It moved through here quickly, but it created a lot of damage in its path.\"\n\nIn Portage, Storm Team 8 tracked a large tornado around 6 p.m. Around 7:30 p.m., another tornado warning was issued for Kalamazoo County, a tornado touched down and Storm Team 8 tracked that twister as it cut through the area.\n\nA News 8 crew on scene in the Portage area saw significant damage to a FedEx facility. The roof was damaged, as were multiple loading docks. No one was hurt in the facility, workers told News 8, and everyone in the building was accounted for.\n\nThe building opened in May of 2022 on Portage Road and was double the size of the company's former ship center on Sprinkle Road, according to the facility's senior manager when it opened. More than 400 employees worked there at its opening two years ago.\n\nJeff Nazarians, who lives nearby, said he has never seen rain switched directions so fast.\n\n\"We just saw everything was just spinning and the water on the ground was spinning. So we just ran to the bathroom That's what we did, we just took shelter. But now coming out everything is a mess. It's crazy,\" he said.\n\nAt Pavilion Estates, a mobile home park in the Portage area, people walked through a field to get into the park, which was blocked off. Storm Team 8 saw multiple first responders on scene, including three ambulances.\n\nMany people were displaced and gathered at a nearby gas station. The park is blocked off, and residents tell News 8 the facility is trying to contain a gas leak and look for anyone who may be injured in the debris.\n\n\"It is absolute destruction in there. And there are trailers completely gone. There are trees down ... There are gonna be a lot of people with no homes tonight,\" said resident Taylor Kuehl. \"It shows the force of nature and how quick it can change and unfortunately, you know a lot of families in here just trying to make day by day survival and they just lost everything.\"\n\nThere are also several trees down in the area, and viewer video shows damage to other businesses in the Portage area.\n\nJude's Barbershop location on Centre Road was hit by the reported tornado, according to a social media post.\n\n\"Luckily, everyone is safe,\" Jude's Barbershop wrote.\n\nThe Portage Department of Public Safety is asking people to avoid travel in the city. The Kalamazoo Department of Public Safety reported no significant injuries or damage within the city of Kalamazoo.\n\nAround 6:15 p.m., a tornado emergency was issued for Union City in Branch County. A tornado emergency is a rare, severe warning.\n\nThe areas of tightest rotation were captured on radar.\n\nThe first tornado's path, which likely caused more significant damage, was most pronounced in Portage. There was a possible touchdown in parts of northern Cass County and southern Van Buren County. The second tornado's path most likely caused damaged in the Centreville area and north of Colon.\n\nThe storms and tornadoes caused power outages in West Michigan. The Consumers Energy map shows 27,041 customers in Michigan without power. The following West Michigan counties had more than 100 Consumers Energy customers without power as of 9:40 p.m.:\n\nBingaman reminded people to stay away from downed power lines. If you see one, assume it is energized and call 911 and Consumers Energy at 800.477.5050.\n\nPortage Public Schools announced it would close the district as well as Curious Kids and Prime Time Childcare on Wednesday so families and the community could \"begin to recover from tonight's storms,\" it wrote in a social media post. \"Be safe and take care.\"\n\n-- News 8's Anna Skog, Blake Harms

Gretchen Whitmer assured residents that help was on the way.\n\nInjuries, emergency officials said, included at least 20 people who were taken to hospitals and destruction to 176 homes in Kalamazoo County alone, a FedEx facility, and damage to other buildings in Portage and in St. Joseph and Branch counties.\n\nBut no one, it appeared early Wednesday, had been killed.\n\nWhere tornadoes didn't touch down, the threat ended, in most places, by midnight.\n\nIn western Michigan, first responders in the worst hit areas have been looking for residents whose whereabouts were not immediately known, but as the storms headed east, weather service officials said, they lost potency.\n\nThere was some storm damage in metro Detroit, the weather service in White Lake Township said, mostly along the shoreline of Lake St. Clair and in parts of Macomb County, but it was nowhere near the destruction Michiganders on the other side of the state faced.\n\nOn the state's west side, several homes seemed to have been flattened as if smashed from above, and buildings had parts torn apart, with twisted metal siding and missing rooftops.\n\n\"My heart goes out to all those affected by tonight's severe weather,\" Whitmer said around 8 p.m. Tuesday, as she declared a state of emergency for southwest Michigan. \"State and local emergency teams are on the ground and working together to assist Michiganders.\"\n\nIn Pavilion Estates Mobile Home Communityw, some of the manufactured homes -- which are especially vulnerable to destructive twisters -- looked in photographs as if they had been rolled over or picked up and tossed about.\n\nKalamazoo County, which includes Portage and the mobile home park, seemed to take the brunt of the destruction, with more tornadoes reportedly hitting Indiana and Ohio, which meteorologists said should be expected this time of year.\n\nIn a Tuesday night news conference, Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller said a tornado tore through the county, sweeping across the area from Texas Township, through Portage and into Pavilion Township, with \"significant damage\" to homes, including 15 or more that were \"totally destroyed.\"\n\nHe described a community filled with wreckage.\n\nHomes were in roadways and on top of other homes, as were trees, tree limbs and smashed vehicles.\n\nMore: Portage, Michigan tornado destroyed mobile homes, injured about 12\n\nAt one point, Fuller said, more than 100 first responders were in the mobile home park treating people for injuries and going door-to-door accounting for residents and looking for anyone who might have been harmed or missing.\n\nAnd even as emergency workers were helping residents, another storm cell swept through the area.\n\nFuller, however, said he was relieved to learn that many of the residents were paying attention to the weather alerts and warnings, and as the night went on, the dire forecasts may have helped because there did not seem to be any life-threatening injuries.\n\nHe said the alarms and sirens worked.\n\n\"The good thing is we're hearing more and more,\" Fuller said, adding that first responders have \"done multiple searches to ascertain the information, but there was nobody in those homes that were hurt significantly. There are injuries.\"\n\nMore searches, he said Tuesday night, are necessary.\n\nThe Red Cross, Fuller added, was working to find shelter for residents who lost their homes, and wireless telephone companies were trying to set up temporary networks to allow families -- and anyone who might need help -- to communicate.\n\nMichigan power outage map: How to check your status after latest round of

electricity, scrambled to secure and reconnect downed lines.\n\n\"Our Storm Response Teams are working around the clock to restore power as quickly as possible,\" Consumers said, urging people to

Wednesday, May 8, 2024. A tornado ripped through the area the evening of May 7.\n\nPAVILION TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) -- Three tornadoes have been confirmed in Michigan as severe storms barreled through the central U.S. early Wednesday, killing one man in Tennessee when a tree toppled onto a vehicle he was in.\n\nThe storm that rumbled across northeastern Tennessee brought high winds that knocked down powerlines and trees. Claiborne County Sheriff Bob Brooks said a 22-year-old man was in a car struck by one of the trees.\n\nNational Weather Service meteorologist Nathan Jeruzal said the tornadoes in Michigan touched down one each in Kalamazoo, Cass and Branch counties -- all in the southwestern part of the state.\n\nKalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart and more than a dozen mobile homes were destroyed.\n\nTornadoes were first reported after dark Tuesday in parts of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, while portions of Illinois, Kentucky and Missouri were also under a tornado watch, according to the National Weather Service. The storms came a day after a deadly twister ripped through an Oklahoma town.\n\nSamantha Smith clutched a box Wednesday afternoon as she stepped from her mother's partially wrecked home in Michigan's Pavilion Township, about 137 miles (220 kilometers) west of Detroit. Inside the box were her grandmother's ashes. Being able to recover the most cherished of items offered Smith a rare moment of relief amid the storm's devastation.\n\n\"Finding this box is the best thing that's happened to me these past 24 hours,\" she said. \"The main thing we were all worried about was my grandma's ashes.\"\n\nHer parents and brother were injured during the storm. Her brother suffered a broken pelvis and broken back, but he and other victims all survived, Smith added.\n\n\"I have thanked God probably a billion times since this happened yesterday,\" she said. \"My kids are healthy and good. We just gotta make back up what we lost.\"\n\nIn southern Indiana, the National Weather Service confirmed a tornado with a preliminary EF-0 rating and 85 mph (137 kph) winds touched down early Wednesday, damaging homes in a subdivision north of the city of Sellersburg, located about 12 miles (19 kilometers) north of Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nThe Clark County Emergency Management Agency said the storm damaged 24 structures.\n\nCandice Holmes, a resident of the Lewis & Clark subdivision north of Sellersburg, said she, her husband and son sought shelter in their bathroom when they heard the approaching storm and \"the wind just picked up all at once.\"\n\n\"My husband and my son stepped outside, opened the door and they slammed the door and ran back to the bathroom. And they held the bathroom door shut, as it came through,\" Holmes told WDRB-TV. \"It was over as soon as it started, but it was definitely a scary moment. And I'm glad we're alive.\"\n\nSurvey teams planned to head out Wednesday to determine whether tornadoes struck locations in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia, according to Jeff Craven, the meteorologist-in-charge in the weather service's Pittsburgh office.\n\nRadar indicated Hancock County, West Virginia, and in Jefferson County, Ohio, were hit by tornadoes, but teams will have to evaluate the damage to determine their rating, Craven said.\n\nHancock County Schools in West Virginia closed schools Wednesday because of \"extensive overnight weather issues\" in the county. News outlets reported damaged buildings and power outages.\n\nA National Weather Service team also was headed to Hot Springs, Arkansas, to survey damage and determine the strength of a tornado that hit early Wednesday morning, forecaster Tabitha Clarke said.\n\nThe tornado damaged some homes, uprooted trees and downed power lines. There were no immediate reports of injuries from the tornado, according to the state Division of Emergency Management.\n\nIn Portage, Michigan, about 50 people temporarily were trapped inside a damaged FedEx facility because of downed power lines. More than a dozen homes were destroyed in a mobile home park in adjacent Pavilion Township and 16 people were injured, said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller.\n\n\"We found homes in the roadway,\" Fuller said late Tuesday. \"We found homes in neighbors' homes. We found large trees in homes.\"\n\nPower was knocked out to more than 20,000 people.\n\n\"We're looking at homes throughout this community that are totally gone, they've been demolished,\" Fuller said in the light of day at Pavilion Estates mobile home park.\n\nA home where seven people were living \"is totally on its top,\" he said. \"They were able to self-rescue and get somewhere safe and came back today.\"\n\nTravis Wycoff ventured out Tuesday night after seeing on radar that a tornado had touched down in the Portage area. About five minutes later, he came upon the aftermath.\n\n\"There were a lot of people running through the streets trying to find people and their pets,\" Wycoff said. \"It was just a lot of chaos.\"\n\nWycoff said he helped an elderly couple out of their partially collapsed home and also freed a service dog from a home whose owner was at work.\n\nMore than 30,000 customers were without power in Michigan early Wednesday, and an additional 10,000 in Ohio, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nAcross the U.S., the entire week is looking stormy. The Midwest and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati -- cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nOn Monday night, a deadly twister in Oklahoma tore through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall. At least one person was killed and another was missing. Dozens of homes were destroyed.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit Barnsdall in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles.\n\nAreas in Oklahoma, including Sulphur and Holdenville, are still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month.\n\nMurphy reported from Oklahoma City.

(David Robert Elliott/The New York Times)\n\nTornadoes ripped through communities in Michigan on Tuesday evening as severe storms battered the Midwest, bringing more destruction a day after tornadoes in the southern Plains killed at least one person and damaged dozens of homes.\n\nOfficials in Kalamazoo County in southern Michigan said they were responding to a tornado that struck Portage, a city of about 50,000, leaving streets littered with downed power lines, trees and building debris.\n\nThe extent of the damage was not immediately clear, but local news outlets shared images from social media that showed damaged buildings.\n\nAnother a tornado warning was issued for Kalamazoo County, including Portage, even as emergency workers were responding to damage from the tornado that had hit earlier.\n\nOfficials in Kalamazoo County could not be immediately reached Tuesday evening. Roughly 20,000 customers in the county were without power in the county, according to PowerOutage.us, which aggregates utilities information across the U.S.\n\nAs storms moved through the region Tuesday afternoon, the Weather Service issued a string of tornado warnings in cities across Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana and Michigan.\n\nAbout 13.5 million people in parts of Indiana, northern Kentucky and western Ohio were warned about an enhanced risk for severe thunderstorms through Tuesday evening, with the possibility of strong tornadoes and large hail, according to the Storm Prediction Center of the National Weather Service.\n\nThe roughly 60,000-square-mile area may also experience frequent lightning and strong wind gusts, according to the Weather Service.\n\nA larger section of the Midwest, encompassing nearly 16 million people across portions of Illinois, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee, was facing a slight risk of severe weather Tuesday.\n\nThe Weather Service also warned that storms passing over the region would produce heavy rain that may create some localized areas of flash flooding. Urban areas, roads, small streams and low-lying areas were most vulnerable, meteorologists said.\n\nAt least 15 tornadoes were reported to have struck parts of the Plains on Monday night. One tornado that was up to 2 miles wide ripped through Barnsdall, Oklahoma, a city about 40 miles northwest of Tulsa, killing one person, an Osage County official said.\n\nIn the predawn hours, it was difficult to assess the damage caused by the tornado, but one Osage County official said it had leveled about one-third of the small city, which has a population of about 1,000, and caused multiple

Wednesday, May 8, 2024. A tornado ripped through the area the evening of May 7.\n\nPAVILION TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) -- Severe storms barreled through the Midwest early Wednesday, a day after two reported tornadoes struck a Michigan city and surrounding area, destroying homes and commercial buildings, including a FedEx facility.\n\nTornadoes were first reported after dark Tuesday in parts of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, while portions of Illinois, Kentucky and Missouri were also under a tornado watch, according to the National Weather Service. The storms came a day after a deadly twister ripped through an Oklahoma town.\n\nTravis Wycoff ventured from his southwestern Michigan home Tuesday night after seeing on radar that a tornado had touched down in the Portage area. About five minutes later, he came upon the aftermath.\n\n\"There were a lot of people running through the streets trying to find people and their pets,\" Wycoff said. \"It was just a lot of chaos.\"\n\nWycoff said he helped an elderly couple out of their partially collapsed home and also freed a service dog from a home whose owner was at work.\n\nWednesday morning, he handed out water and offered to help cut fallen tree branches around the Pavilion Estates mobile home park.\n\n\"It's community. I can't sit a mile away from here when I was perfectly safe,\" said Wycoff. \"I couldn't sit there in good conscience and not come down to try to help in some way.\"\n\nIn southern Indiana, the National Weather Service confirmed a tornado with a preliminary EF-0 rating and 85 mph (137 kph) winds touched down early Wednesday, damaging homes in a subdivision north of the city of Sellersburg, located about 12 miles (19 kilometers) north of Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nThe Clark County Emergency Management Agency said the storm damaged 24 structures.\n\nCandice Holmes, a resident of the Lewis & Clark subdivision north of Sellersburg, said she, her husband and son sought shelter in their bathroom when they heard the approaching storm and \"the wind just picked up all at once.\"\n\n\"My husband and my son stepped outside, opened the door and they slammed the door and ran back to the bathroom. And they held the bathroom door shut, as it came through,\" Holmes told WDRB-TV. \"It was over as soon as it started, but it was definitely a scary moment. And I'm glad we're alive.\"\n\nSurvey teams planned to head out Wednesday to determine whether tornadoes struck locations in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia, according to Jeff Craven, the meteorologist-in-charge in the weather service's Pittsburgh office.\n\nRadar indicated Hancock County, West Virginia, and in Jefferson County, Ohio, were hit by tornadoes, but teams will have to evaluate the damage to determine their rating, Craven said.\n\nHancock County Schools in West Virginia closed schools Wednesday because of \"extensive overnight weather issues\" in the county. News outlets reported damaged buildings and power outages.\n\nA National Weather Service team also was headed to Hot Springs, Arkansas, to survey damage and determine the strength of a tornado that hit early Wednesday morning, forecaster Tabitha Clarke said.\n\nThe tornado damaged some homes, uprooted trees and downed power lines. There were no immediate reports of injuries from the tornado, according to the state Division of Emergency Management.\n\nIn Michigan, two reported tornadoes blitzed the city of Portage and the adjacent Pavilion Township, destroying homes and commercial buildings, including a FedEx facility that was ripped apart.\n\nNo serious injuries were immediately reported, but city officials said in a news release that the twisters knocked out power to more than 20,000 people. Most of them would be without power until late Wednesday, city officials said.\n\nAt one point, about 50 people were trapped inside the FedEx facility because of downed power lines. But company spokesperson Shannon Davis said late Tuesday that \"all team members are safe and accounted for.\"\n\nKalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller said more than a dozen mobile homes in Pavilion Township were \"totally destroyed.\" At least 16 people, he added, were injured there, though the injuries were not life-threatening.\n\n\"We found homes in the roadway,\" the sheriff said late Tuesday. \"We found homes in neighbors' homes. We found large trees in homes.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the buzz of chainsaws and the snap of tree limbs filled the air as cleanup began at a mobile home park.\n\n\"The clean-up efforts are tremendous. ... We're looking at homes throughout this community that are totally gone, they've been demolished,\" Fuller said in the light of day Wednesday at Pavilion Estates mobile home park.\n\nA home where seven people were living \"is totally on its top,\" he said. \"They were able to self-rescue and get somewhere safe and came back today.\"\n\nPavilion Township is about 137 miles (220 kilometers) west of Detroit.\n\nMore than 30,000 customers were without power in Michigan early Wednesday, and an additional 10,000 in Ohio, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\nNational Weather Service crews were working Wednesday to survey storm damage in several counties in Michigan's southwest Lower Peninsula to determine whether tornadoes touched down in those areas, including the two reported Tuesday night in the Portage area, said meteorologist Mike Sutton with the weather service's Grand Rapids office.\n\nHe said the Grand Rapids office had received a total of 11 reports of tornadoes from storm spotters, emergency managers and the public from late Tuesday afternoon into Tuesday night, but as of 8 a.m. Wednesday, it had not confirmed any tornado touchdowns.\n\n\"It's quite possible those are multiple reports from the same tornado. The actual number of tornadoes may be lower depending on what they find when they're out surveying,\" Sutton said.\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nAcross the U.S., the entire week is looking stormy. The Midwest and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati -- cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nOn Monday night, a deadly twister in Oklahoma tore through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall. At least one person was killed and another was missing. Dozens of homes were destroyed.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit Barnsdall in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles.\n\nAreas in Oklahoma, including Sulphur and Holdenville, are still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month.\n\nMurphy reported from Oklahoma City.

Claiborne County Sheriff Bob Brooks said a 22-year-old man was in a car struck by one of the trees.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber?

People in Columbia were injured and homes were damaged, according to Lynn Thompson, assistant director of Maury County 911. Thompson told The Associated Press that he could not provide any further details: \"We're getting overloaded right now.\"\n\nIn North Carolina, a state of emergency was declared for Gaston County Wednesday evening following a large storm. First responders were working to clear roads of downed power lines and broken trees and were helping residents, officials said. The New Hope Fire Department responded to a tree down on a car. One person in the car was killed and another was taken to a hospital, officials said.\n\nMore than 135,000 customers had lost power in the state as of Wednesday evening, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nTornadoes were first reported after dark Tuesday in parts of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, according to the National Weather Service. The storms came a day after a deadly twister ripped through an Oklahoma town.\n\nThe National Weather Service confirmed tornadoes touched down Tuesday in western Ohio: five in Warren County and one each in Darke, Mercer and Auglaize counties. The weather service said crews are still surveying areas of Franklin and Butler counties to determine if tornadoes struck there, as well. Radar indicated a tornado struck Jefferson County, but teams will have to evaluate the damage to determine its rating, said Jeff Craven, a weather service meteorologist in Pittsburgh.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nCrews on Wednesday were able to survey the damage caused by the strong storms that contained hail and heavy rains and knocked out power to thousands of utility customers.\n\nIn Michigan, weather service meteorologist Nathan Jeruzal said the tornadoes there touched down one each in Kalamazoo, Cass and Branch counties -- all in the southwestern part of the state. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\nKalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart and more than a dozen mobile homes were destroyed. About 50 people temporarily were trapped inside the damaged facility because of downed power lines.\n\nMore than a dozen homes were destroyed in a mobile home park in adjacent Pavilion Township and 16 people were injured, said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller.\n\nSamantha Smith clutched a box Wednesday afternoon as she stepped from her mother's partially wrecked home in Pavilion Township, about 137 miles (220 kilometers) west of Detroit.

The weather service said it marked the first recorded tornado in Hancock County. It was at least the 11th tornado this year in West Virginia, which sees two tornadoes in an average year.\n\nBaseball-sized hail was reported Wednesday in areas just southwest of St. Louis, Missouri.

FedEx said in a statement that there were no serious injuries at the facility.\n\nAnother tornado warning was issued for Kalamazoo County, including Portage, even as emergency workers were responding to damage from the tornado that had hit earlier.\n\nOfficials in Kalamazoo County could not be immediately reached Tuesday evening. Roughly 20,000 customers in the county were without power, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nAs storms moved through the region Tuesday, the National Weather Service issued a string of tornado warnings in cities across Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Ohio.\n\nAbout 13.5 million people in parts of Indiana, northern Kentucky and western Ohio were warned about an enhanced risk for severe thunderstorms through Tuesday evening, with the possibility of strong tornadoes and large hail, according to the weather service's Storm Prediction Center.\n\nThe roughly 60,000-square-mile area may also experience frequent lightning and strong wind gusts, according to the weather service.\n\nA larger section of the Midwest, encompassing nearly 16 million people across portions of Illinois, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee, was facing a slight risk of severe weather Tuesday.\n\nThe weather service also warned that storms passing over the region would produce heavy rain that may create some localized areas of flash flooding. Urban areas, roads, small streams and low-lying areas were most vulnerable, meteorologists said.\n\nMonday night, at least 15 tornadoes were reported to have struck parts of the Plains. One tornado that was up to 2 miles wide ripped through Barnsdall, Oklahoma, a city about 40 miles northwest of Tulsa, killing one person, an Osage County official said.\n\nOne Osage County official said it had leveled about one-third of the small city, which has a population of about 1,000, and caused multiple injuries. The Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported that up to 40 homes in the town had been damaged.\n\nThe tornado also lifted the roof off a nursing home in Barnsdall, though all residents were accounted for with no injuries or deaths, officials said.\n\nMayor Johnny Kelley said one person was reported missing.\n\n\"We are going through the debris very thoroughly,\" Kelley said at a news conference Tuesday.\n\nConsidering the widespread destruction, it was \"shocking\" there were so few casualties, he said: \"The devastation is pretty substantial.\"\n\nThe tornado also caused power outages in Missouri, Arkansas and Oklahoma. But by early Tuesday, power had been largely restored.\n\nIn Bartlesville, Oklahoma, about 45 miles north of Tulsa, city officials said that emergency responders had rescued people trapped at a Hampton Inn and were recovering downed power lines early Tuesday. Only minor injuries had been reported.\n\nRescue operations were also ongoing at the Osage Nation Reservation, where officials warned residents to stay clear of the roadways and damaged areas.",

Most of them would be without power until late Wednesday, city officials said.\n\nAt one point, about 50 people were trapped inside the FedEx facility because of downed power lines. But company spokesperson Shannon Davis said late Tuesday that \"all team members are safe and accounted for.\" Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller said more than a dozen mobile homes in Pavilion Township were \"totally destroyed.\" At least 16 people, he added, were injured there, though the injuries were not life-threatening.\n\n\"We found homes in the roadway,\" the sheriff said late Tuesday. \"We found homes in neighbors' homes. We found large trees in homes.\" On Wednesday, the buzz of chainsaws and the snap of tree limbs filled the air as cleanup began at a mobile home park.\n\n\"The clean-up efforts are tremendous. ... We're looking at homes throughout this community that are totally gone, they've been demolished,\" Fuller said in the light of day Wednesday at Pavilion Estates mobile home park.\n\nA home where seven people were living \"is totally on its top,\" he said. \"They were able to self-rescue and get somewhere safe and came back today.\" Pavilion Township is adjacent to Portage and about 137 miles (220 kilometers) west of Detroit.\n\nMore than 30,000 customers were without power in Michigan early Wednesday, and an additional 10,000 in Ohio, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nMichigan Gov Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\n\"My heart goes out to all those impacted by tonight's severe weather in southwest Michigan,\" Whitmer said in a message on social media. \"State and local emergency teams are on the ground and working together to assist Michiganders.\" National Weather Service crews were working Wednesday to survey storm damage in several counties in Michigan's southwest Lower Peninsula to determine whether tornadoes touched down in those areas, including the two reported Tuesday night in the city of Portage, said meteorologist Mike Sutton with the weather service's Grand Rapids office.\n\nHe said the Grand Rapids office had received a total of 11 reports of tornadoes from storm spotters, emergency managers and the public from late Tuesday afternoon into Tuesday night, but as of 8 am Wednesday, it had not confirmed any tornado touchdowns.\n\nSutton said it could be a couple days before the storm surveys are completed and he stressed that some of the tornado reports could be duplicate reports passed along by people who saw the same storm.\n\n\"It's quite possible those are multiple reports from the same tornado. The actual number of tornadoes may be lower depending on what they find when they're out surveying,\" he said.\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nAcross the US, the entire week is looking stormy. The Midwest and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St Louis and Cincinnati -- cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nOn Monday night, a deadly twister in Oklahoma tore through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall. At least one person was killed and another was missing. Dozens of homes were destroyed.\n\nAerial videos showed homes reduced to piles of rubble and others with roofs torn off. The twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town. A 160-acre (65-hectare) wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained heavy damage.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit Barnsdall in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles.\n\nOklahoma Gov Kevin Stitt, who toured the twister's damage Tuesday, said it was rated by weather researchers as a violent tornado with winds reaching up to 200 mph (322 kph). Stitt said he and legislative leaders have agreed to set aside USD 45 million in this year's budget to help storm-damaged communities.\n\nAreas in Oklahoma, including Sulphur and Holdenville, are still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated

(AP) -- Severe storms tore through the central and southeast U.S. late Tuesday and Wednesday, spawning damaging tornadoes, producing massive hail, and killing one person in Tennessee and another in North Carolina when trees toppled onto their vehicles.\n\nThe storm that rumbled across northeastern Tennessee brought high winds that knocked down powerlines and trees. Claiborne County Sheriff Bob Brooks said a 22-year-old man was in a car struck by one of the trees.\n\nWednesday afternoon, a tornado emergency -- the weather service's highest alert level -- was issued for an area south of Nashville including the towns of Spring Hill, Chapel Hill and Eagleville.\n\nA tornado warning had previously been issued in nearby Columbia, about 45 miles (72 kilometers) south of Nashville. People in Columbia were injured and homes were damaged, according to Lynn Thompson, assistant director of Maury County 911. Thompson told The Associated Press that he could not provide any further details: \"We're getting overloaded right now.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

First responders were working to clear roads of downed power lines and broken trees and were helping residents, officials said. The New Hope Fire Department responded to a tree down on a car. One person in the car was killed and another was taken to a hospital, officials said.\n\nMore than 135,000 customers had lost power in the state as of Wednesday evening, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nTornadoes were first reported after dark Tuesday in parts of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, according to the National Weather Service. The storms came a day after a deadly twister ripped through an Oklahoma town.\n\nThe National Weather Service confirmed tornadoes touched down Tuesday in western Ohio: five in Warren County and one each in Darke, Mercer and Auglaize counties. The weather service said crews are still surveying areas of Franklin and Butler counties to determine if tornadoes struck there, as well. Radar indicated a tornado struck Jefferson County, but teams will have to evaluate the damage to determine its rating, said Jeff Craven, a weather service meteorologist in Pittsburgh.\n\nCrews on Wednesday were able to survey the damage caused by the strong storms that contained hail and heavy rains and knocked out power to thousands of utility customers.\n\nIn Michigan, weather service meteorologist Nathan Jeruzal said the tornadoes there touched down one each in Kalamazoo, Cass and Branch counties -- all in the southwestern part of the state. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\nKalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart and more than a dozen mobile homes were destroyed. About 50 people temporarily were trapped inside the damaged facility because of downed power lines.\n\nMore than a dozen homes were destroyed in a mobile home park in adjacent Pavilion Township and 16 people were injured, said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller.\n\nSamantha Smith clutched a box Wednesday afternoon as she stepped from her mother's partially wrecked home in Pavilion Township, about 137 miles (220 kilometers) west of Detroit. Inside the box were her grandmother's ashes. Being able to recover the most cherished of items offered Smith a rare moment of relief amid the storm's devastation.\n\nHer parents and brother were injured during the storm but survived.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"I have thanked God probably a billion times since this happened yesterday,\" she said. \"My kids are healthy and good. We just gotta make back up what we lost.\"\n\nTravis Wycoff ventured out Tuesday night after seeing on radar that a tornado had touched down in the Portage area, and he said he helped an elderly couple out of their partially collapsed home and freed a service dog from a home.\n\n\"There were a lot of people running through the streets trying to find people and their pets,\" Wycoff said. \"It was just a lot of chaos.\"\n\nIn southern Indiana, the National Weather Service confirmed a tornado touched down early Wednesday, damaging homes in a subdivision north of the city of Sellersburg, located about 12 miles (19 kilometers) north of Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nThe Clark County Emergency Management Agency said the storm damaged 24 structures.\n\nCandice Holmes, a resident of the Lewis & Clark subdivision north of Sellersburg, said she, her husband and son sought shelter in their bathroom when they heard the approaching storm and \"the wind just picked up all at once.\"\n\n\"It was definitely a scary moment. ... And I'm glad we're alive,\" Holmes told WDRB-TV.\n\nTornadoes were also confirmed in Pennsylvania just outside Pittsburgh, in central Arkansas and in northern West Virginia. The West Virginia twister, which started early Wednesday in far eastern Ohio, was at least the 11th tornado this year in the state that sees two tornadoes in an average year.\n\nBaseball-sized hail was reported Wednesday in areas just southwest of St. Louis, Missouri. Heavy downpours caused flash flooding and at least one water rescue near Sullivan, a town that was struck by a small tornado just two days earlier. Damaging hail also was reported in the Kansas City area.\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nAcross the U.S., the entire week is looking stormy.

The township is located in Kalamazoo County, where 15 to 20 people had minor injuries and were transported to two area hospitals, according to the county's emergency management spokesperson Andrew Alspach.\n\nIn the neighboring city of Portage, about 7 miles south of Kalamazoo, pictures and videos showed a FedEx facility with significant roof and structural damage after a storm hit the area Tuesday evening. However, there were no serious injuries, a FedEx representative told CNN.\n\nAbout 50 people were trapped in the building due to downed wires, Taylor Koopman, a spokesperson for Kalamazoo County administrator's office, told MLive.com, adding work to clear the wires was ongoing as of 9:30 p.m. ET. However, city of Portage spokesperson Mary Beth Block told CNN in an email the building had been cleared by authorities.\n\nTwo tornadoes hit the Portage area Tuesday, the National Weather Service said.\n\n\"We have significant damage, including damage to residential and commercial buildings, trees down across many roads in the city, and several reports of gas leaks,\" Portage city officials said in a news release.\n\nThe city pleaded with its residents to \"stay home\" and \"please stay off the roads. First responders are stuck in gridlock.\"\n\nThe Village of Centreville was hit hard during a possible tornado on Tuesday, according to St. Joseph County officials. Multiple buildings, residential and commercial, were destroyed after a possible tornado touched down in Centreville on Tuesday, according to St. Joseph County Undersheriff Jason Bingaman. The storm damage ripped off roofs and flattened homes \"completely down,\" Bingaman told CNN.\n\nIn Branch County, about 60 miles south of Kalamazoo, at least seven homes were destroyed, according to Emergency Management Director Tim Miner, who added he was unable to get out and assess damage to other parts of the county.\n\nOne city in the county, Union City, was under a rare tornado emergency earlier that went into effect when \"a large and destructive tornado\" was over the area, about 10 miles northwest of Coldwater and moving northeast at 45 mph, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nAccording to the Storm Prediction Center, at least nine tornado reports were made in Michigan on Tuesday. Hail the size of softballs was also reported in some parts of the state.\n\nMore than 34,000 homes and businesses in Michigan were left without power as of early Wednesday, according to poweroutage.us. Elsewhere in the Midwest, more than 16,000 residents were in the dark in Ohio.\n\nGov. Gretchen Whitmer said her heart was going out to those impacted by the severe weather in southwest Michigan. The governor declared a state of emergency for Kalamazoo, St. Joseph, Branch and Cass counties, she said Tuesday night.\n\n\"We will work with emergency teams overnight to monitor the situation and coordinate resources for those affected. Michigan is strong and together we will rebuild,\" the governor said.\n\nAfter Tuesday brought tornadoes, large hail, damaging wind gusts and heavy rainfall mainly across the Great Lakes and the Ohio Valley, much of the Eastern US braces for another round of storms Wednesday. Over 140 million people could see some sort of storms Wednesday from Texas to Maine.\n\nSevere thunderstorms are likely Wednesday across parts of the southern Plains into the mid Mississippi, Ohio and Tennessee Valleys, according to the Storm Prediction Center. As severe storms hit, tornadoes, very large hail, and damaging winds are expected over the large area. Some of the tornadoes may be strong, according to the center.\n\nA population of nearly 20 million people will be under the strongest severe storm threat. The Storm Prediction Center has issued a level 3 of 5 enhanced risk of severe thunderstorms from northeast Texas to western Virginia, which includes much of the lower Ohio Valley, Tennessee Valley and middle to lower Mississippi Valley. Cities in the strongest threat for severe storms include Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Louisville.\n\n\"The greatest flash flooding threat also overlaps with the risk of severe thunderstorms, centered over Kentucky and Tennessee as well sections of neighboring states,\" the National Weather Service said. \"Residents and visitors are advised to have multiple ways of receiving warnings and never drive across flooded roadways.\"\n\nLower severe storm threats spread from central Texas to the southern tip of Maine and includes the cities of Dallas, Atlanta, Chicago, Washington D.C., Baltimore, New York City, Boston and Charlotte. There, the threats are more likely to be large hail and damaging wind gusts, but tornadoes cannot be ruled out.\n\nSpring is known for severe storms and tornadoes - and Spring 2024 is no exception. There has been at least one tornado report every day since April 25, a streak of 13 consecutive days, according to the Storm Prediction Center. A total of 287 tornadoes were reported in that time span.\n\nApril to June is peak tornado season across the US, with May traditionally seeing the most tornadoes. This month is coming off a particularly active April, where there were 300 tornadoes, the second most on record, according to the center. The all-time record occurred in April 2011, when there were 757 tornadoes.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n\u2122 & \u00a9 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

The storms came a day after a deadly twister ripped through an Oklahoma town.\n\nTravis Wycoff ventured from his southwestern Michigan home Tuesday night after seeing on radar that a tornado had touched down in the Portage area. About five minutes later, he came upon the aftermath.\n\n\"There were a lot of people running through the streets trying to find people and their pets,\" Wycoff said. \"It was just a lot of chaos.\"\n\nWycoff said he helped an elderly couple out of their partially collapsed home and also freed a service dog from a home whose owner was at work.\n\nWednesday morning, he handed out water and offered to help cut fallen tree branches around the Pavilion Estates mobile home park.\n\n\"It's community. I can't sit a mile away from here when I was perfectly safe,\" said Wycoff. \"I couldn't sit there in good conscience and not come down to try to help in some way.\"\n\nIn southern Indiana, the National Weather Service confirmed a tornado with a preliminary EF-0 rating and 85 mph (137 kph) winds touched down early Wednesday, damaging homes in a subdivision north of the city of Sellersburg, located about 12 miles (19 kilometers) north of Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nThe Clark County Emergency Management Agency said the storm damaged 24 structures.\n\nCandice Holmes, a resident of the Lewis & Clark subdivision north of Sellersburg, said she, her husband and son sought shelter in their bathroom when they heard the approaching storm and \"the wind just picked up all at once.\"\n\n\"My husband and my son stepped outside, opened the door and they slammed the door and ran back to the bathroom. And they held the bathroom door shut, as it came through,\" Holmes told WDRB-TV. \"It was over as soon as it started, but it was definitely a scary moment. And I'm glad we're alive.\"\n\nSurvey teams planned to head out Wednesday to determine whether tornadoes struck locations in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia, according to Jeff Craven, the meteorologist-in-charge in the weather service's Pittsburgh office.\n\nRadar indicated Hancock County, West Virginia, and in Jefferson County, Ohio, were hit by tornadoes, but teams will have to evaluate the damage to determine their rating, Craven said.\n\nHancock County Schools in West Virginia closed schools Wednesday because of \"extensive overnight weather issues\" in the county. News outlets reported damaged buildings and power outages.\n\nA National Weather Service team also was headed to Hot Springs, Arkansas, to survey damage and determine the strength of a tornado that hit early Wednesday morning, forecaster Tabitha Clarke said.\n\nThe tornado damaged some homes, uprooted trees and downed power lines. There were no immediate reports of injuries from the tornado, according to the state Division of Emergency Management.\n\nIn Michigan, two reported tornadoes blitzed the city of Portage and the adjacent Pavilion Township, destroying homes and commercial buildings, including a FedEx facility that was ripped apart.\n\nNo serious injuries were immediately reported, but city officials said in a news release that the twisters knocked out power to more than 20,000 people. Most of them would be without power until late Wednesday, city officials said.\n\nAt one point, about 50 people were trapped inside the FedEx facility because of downed power lines. But company spokesperson Shannon Davis said late Tuesday that \"all team members are safe and accounted for.\"\n\nKalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller said more than a dozen mobile homes in Pavilion Township were \"totally destroyed.\" At least 16 people, he added, were injured there, though the injuries were not life-threatening.\n\n\"We found homes in the roadway,\" the sheriff said late Tuesday. \"We found homes in neighbors' homes. We found large trees in homes.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the buzz of chainsaws and the snap of tree limbs filled the air as cleanup began at a mobile home park.\n\n\"The clean-up efforts are tremendous. ... We're looking at homes throughout this community that are totally gone, they've been demolished,\" Fuller said in the light of day Wednesday at Pavilion Estates mobile home park.\n\nA home where seven people were living \"is totally on its top,\" he said. \"They were able to self-rescue and get somewhere safe and came back today.\"\n\nPavilion Township is about 137 miles (220 kilometers) west of Detroit.\n\nMore than 30,000 customers were without power in Michigan early Wednesday, and an additional 10,000 in Ohio, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\nNational Weather Service crews were working Wednesday to survey storm damage in several counties in Michigan's southwest Lower Peninsula to determine whether tornadoes touched down in those areas, including the two reported Tuesday night in the Portage area, said meteorologist Mike Sutton with the weather service's Grand Rapids office.\n\nHe said the Grand Rapids office had received a total of 11 reports of tornadoes from storm spotters, emergency managers and the public from late Tuesday afternoon into Tuesday night, but as of 8 a.m. Wednesday, it had not confirmed any tornado touchdowns.\n\n\"It's quite possible those are multiple reports from the same tornado. The actual number of tornadoes may be lower depending on what they find when they're out surveying,\" Sutton said.\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nAcross the U.S., the entire week is looking stormy. The Midwest and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati -- cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nOn Monday night, a deadly twister in Oklahoma tore through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall. At least one person was killed and another was missing. Dozens of homes were destroyed.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit Barnsdall in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles.\n\nAreas in Oklahoma, including Sulphur and Holdenville, are still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month.\n\n___\n\nMurphy reported from Oklahoma City. Associated Press journalists around the country contributed to this report, including Rio Yamat, Heather Hollingsworth, Colleen Slevin, Jim Salter, Kathy McCormack, Sarah Brumfield, Beatrice Dupuy and Alexa St. John.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

The National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center warned of an \"enhanced risk\" for severe weather spanning from Texas to South Carolina.\n\nSponsored: Gold is SOARING - here's what you need to do\n\nThese storms are part of a series of torrential rains and tornadoes that have impacted the Plains, Midwest, and now the Southeast throughout the week. The death toll since Monday has risen to at least four. The severe weather comes after an exceptionally stormy April, during which the U.S. experienced 300 confirmed tornadoes, the second-highest number on record for the month and the most since 2011.\n\nAs of Thursday, nearly a quarter-million homes and businesses across several Southern states were still without power due to the previous night's storms, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nIn Tennessee, a tornado damaged homes, injured people, toppled power lines and trees, and claimed the life of a 22-year-old man in a car in Claiborne County, north of Knoxville, as reported by officials. A second person lost their life south of Nashville in Columbia, where officials said a likely tornado blew homes off their foundations.\n\nColumbia resident Bob Booth had just returned home from Georgia and was about to watch television when he heard a \"crazy racket.\" He described the scene outside as \"all hell breaking loose\" and mentioned that the top half of one of his trees had fallen across the road. Booth was informed that it would take some time before his power was restored.\n\nHe noted that one neighbor was fortunate, as all of their trees were destroyed except for one that would have destroyed their house.\n\nSponsored: This \"miracle material\" is about to ROCK the market...\n\nIn Spring Hill, not far from Columbia, retired pastor Walter Shell and his wife took their two dogs and sought shelter in the basement when his phone alerted him to a tornado. Shell remarked, \"It missed where me and my wife were standing by about about 4 inches. It went around. It pays to pray, I can tell you.\"\n\nNortheast of Nashville, torrential rains led to a flash flood emergency and water rescues. The city's main airport issued a temporary ground stop, and the weather service issued a tornado emergency, its highest alert level, for nearby areas.\n\nSeveral Tennessee counties closed schools on Thursday. In Georgia, some districts north of Atlanta canceled in-person classes or delayed start times due to storm damage overnight, which included fallen trees on houses and vehicles around Clarkesville. No injuries were reported in the area.\n\nLynn Smith, director of the Habersham County Emergency Management Agency, said, \"We're just trying to clean up right now and wait for the next round.\"\n\nIn northern Alabama's DeKalb County, a strong tornado damaged at least 20 homes and caused injuries but no deaths, according to officials.\n\nSponsored: New Patented Manufacturing Process Could Be The Cancer Breakthrough We've All Been Waiting For\n\nIn North Carolina, a state of emergency was declared Wednesday night for Gaston County, west of Charlotte, after a storm toppled power lines and trees, including one that landed on a car, killing one person inside and sending another to the hospital.\n\nThe storms followed heavy rain, strong winds, hail, and tornadoes that affected parts of the central U.S. on Monday, including a twister that ripped through an Oklahoma town and killed one person. On Tuesday, the Midwest bore the brunt of the severe weather, with tornadoes touching down in parts of Michigan, Ohio, and Indiana.\n\nThe Kalamazoo area in Michigan was particularly hard hit, with a FedEx facility being ripped apart and downed power lines trapping about 50 people.\n\nTornadoes were also confirmed near Pittsburgh, in central Arkansas, and in northern West Virginia. The West Virginia twister was at least the 11th tornado this year in the state, which typically sees an average of two tornadoes per year.\n\nBoth the Plains and Midwest have been pummeled by tornadoes this spring, highlighting the ongoing threat of severe weather across the country.", "source": {"uri": "thehornnews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Horn News"}, "authors": [{"uri":

(AP) -- At least eight tornadoes have touched down in Ohio and three were confirmed in Michigan as severe storms barreled through the central and southeast U.S. late Tuesday and Wednesday, killing one person in Tennessee and another in North Carolina when trees toppled onto their vehicles.\n\nThe storm that rumbled across northeastern Tennessee brought high winds that knocked down powerlines and trees. Claiborne County Sheriff Bob Brooks said a 22-year-old man was in a car struck by one of the trees.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, a tornado emergency -- the weather service's highest alert level -- was issued for an area south of Nashville including the towns of Spring Hill, Chapel Hill and Eagleville.\n\nA tornado warning had previously been issued in nearby Columbia, about 45 miles (72 kilometers) south of Nashville. People in Columbia were injured and homes were damaged, according to Lynn Thompson, assistant director of Maury County 911. Thompson told The Associated Press that he could not provide any further details: \"We're getting overloaded right now.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

First responders were working to clear roads of downed power lines and broken trees and were helping residents, officials said. The New Hope Fire Department responded to a tree down on a car. One person in the car was killed and another was taken to a hospital, officials said.\n\nMore than 135,000 customers had lost power in the state as of Wednesday evening, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nTornadoes were first reported after dark Tuesday in parts of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, according to the National Weather Service. The storms came a day after a deadly twister ripped through an Oklahoma town.\n\nThe National Weather Service confirmed tornadoes touched down Tuesday in western Ohio: five in Warren County and one each in Darke, Mercer and Auglaize counties. The weather service said crews are still surveying areas of Franklin and Butler counties to determine if tornadoes struck there, as well. Radar indicated a tornado struck Jefferson County, but teams will have to evaluate the damage to determine its rating, said Jeff Craven, a weather service meteorologist in Pittsburgh.\n\nCrews on Wednesday were able to survey the damage caused by the strong storms that contained hail and heavy rains and knocked out power to thousands of utility customers.\n\nIn Michigan, weather service meteorologist Nathan Jeruzal said the tornadoes there touched down one each in Kalamazoo, Cass and Branch counties -- all in the southwestern part of the state. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\nKalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart and more than a dozen mobile homes were destroyed. About 50 people temporarily were trapped inside the damaged facility because of downed power lines.\n\nMore than a dozen homes were destroyed in a mobile home park in adjacent Pavilion Township and 16 people were injured, said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller.\n\nSamantha Smith clutched a box Wednesday afternoon as she stepped from her mother's partially wrecked home in Pavilion Township, about 137 miles (220 kilometers) west of Detroit. Inside the box were her grandmother's ashes. Being able to recover the most cherished of items offered Smith a rare moment of relief amid the storm's devastation.\n\nHer parents and brother were injured during the storm but survived.\n\n\"I have thanked God probably a billion times since this happened yesterday,\" she said. \"My kids are healthy and good.

The weather service said it marked the first recorded tornado in Hancock County. It was at least the 11th tornado this year in West Virginia, which sees two tornadoes in an average year.\n\nBaseball-sized hail was reported Wednesday in areas just southwest of St. Louis, Missouri. Heavy downpours caused flash flooding and at least one water rescue near Sullivan, a town that was struck by a small tornado just two days earlier. Damaging hail also was reported in the Kansas City area.\n\nA National Weather Service team also was headed to Hot Springs, Arkansas, to determine the strength of a tornado that hit early Wednesday morning, forecaster Tabitha Clarke said. The twister damaged some homes, uprooted trees and downed power lines. There were no immediate reports of injuries from the tornado, according to the state Division of Emergency Management.\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nAcross the U.S., the entire week is looking stormy. The Midwest and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati -- cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nMurphy reported from Oklahoma City.

About 50 people temporarily were trapped inside the damaged facility because of downed power lines.\n\nMore than a dozen homes were destroyed in a mobile home park in adjacent Pavilion Township and 16 people were injured, said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller.\n\nSamantha Smith clutched a box Wednesday afternoon as she stepped from her mother's partially wrecked home in Pavilion Township, about 137 miles (220 kilometers) west of Detroit. Inside the box were her grandmother's ashes. Being able to recover the most cherished of items offered Smith a rare moment of relief amid the storm's devastation.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHer parents and brother were injured during the storm but survived.\n\n\"I have thanked God probably a billion times since this happened yesterday,\" she said. \"My kids are healthy and good. We just gotta make back up what we lost.\"\n\nTravis Wycoff ventured out Tuesday night after seeing on radar that a tornado had touched down in the Portage area, and he said he helped an elderly couple out of their partially collapsed home and freed a service dog from a home.\n\n\"There were a lot of people running through the streets trying to find people and their pets,\" Wycoff said. \"It was just a lot of chaos.\"\n\nIn southern Indiana, the National Weather Service confirmed a tornado touched down early Wednesday, damaging homes in a subdivision north of the city of Sellersburg, located about 12 miles (19 kilometers) north of Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nThe Clark County Emergency Management Agency said the storm damaged 24 structures.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nCandice Holmes, a resident of the Lewis & Clark subdivision north of Sellersburg, said she, her husband and son sought shelter in their bathroom when they heard the approaching storm and \"the wind just picked up all at once.\"\n\n\"It was definitely a scary moment. ... And I'm glad we're alive,\" Holmes told WDRB-TV.\n\nTornadoes were also confirmed in Pennsylvania just outside Pittsburgh, in central Arkansas and in northern West Virginia. The West Virginia twister, which started early Wednesday in far eastern Ohio, was at least the 11th tornado this year in the state that sees two tornadoes in an average year.\n\nBaseball-sized hail was reported Wednesday in areas just southwest of St. Louis, Missouri. Heavy downpours caused flash flooding and at least one water rescue near Sullivan, a town that was struck by a small tornado just two days earlier. Damaging hail also was reported in the Kansas City area.\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAcross the U.S., the entire week is looking stormy. The Midwest and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati -- cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\n___\n\nMurphy reported from Oklahoma City.

A boy swept into a drain fights for his life", "body": "COLUMBIA, Tenn. (AP) -- Dangerous storms crashed over parts of the South on Thursday even as the region cleaned up from earlier severe weather that spawned tornadoes, killed at least three people, and gravely injured a boy who was swept into a storm drain as he played in a flooded street.\n\nA heavy line of storms swept into Atlanta near the end of the morning rush hour. Busy hub airports in Atlanta and Charlotte, North Carolina, reported delays. The National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center cited an \"enhanced risk\" for severe weather from Texas to South Carolina. An emergency manager reported \"significant wind damage\" from a possible tornado Thursday afternoon in the Vidalia, Georgia, area, a region known for producing onions.\n\nThe storms continue a streak of torrential rains and tornadoes this week from the Plains to the Midwest and, now, the Southeast. Since Monday, 39 states have been under threat of severe weather and at least four people have died. On Wednesday, 98 million people were under some sort of severe weather risk, said Evan Bentley, a Storm Prediction Center forecaster.\n\nThe weather comes on the heels of a stormy April in which the U.S. had 300 confirmed tornadoes, the second-most on record for the month and the most since 2011.\n\nMore than 100,000 homes and businesses still lacked power Thursday afternoon in several Southern states after storms the night before, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nOne in Tennessee damaged homes, injured people, toppled power lines and trees, and killed a 22-year-old man in a car in Claiborne County, north of Knoxville, officials said. A second person was killed south of Nashville in Columbia, the seat of Maury County, where officials said a tornado with 140 mph (225 kph) winds damaged or destroyed more than 100 homes.\n\nTennessee Gov. Bill Lee said the woman who died in Maury County was in a mobile home that was thrown several feet into a wooded area. Lee visited emergency managers and Tennessee Department of Transportation officials in the storm-stricken area Thursday. He thanked workers who spent the night clearing trees and debris from roads.\n\nLater, Lee told reporters that it is \"heartbreaking\" to see families whose lives have been affected by the tornado.\n\n\"To observe another family in a moment of crisis is hard to watch, but it is hopeful to be able to walk up and see their interaction with their neighbors and comments that they're going to make it,\" Lee said.\n\nBob Booth had just gotten home to Columbia from Georgia and was sitting down to watch television when he heard a \"crazy racket.\"\n\n\"I get up and look out, and it was all hell breaking loose outside,\" Booth said. \"Then the top half of one of my trees goes down across the road.\"\n\nRetired pastor Walter Shell said he and his wife grabbed their two dogs and headed for the basement when his phone alerted him to a tornado.\n\n\"It missed where me and my wife were standing by about 4 inches. It went around,\" he said. \"It pays to pray, I can tell you.\"\n\nTorrential rains led to a flash flood emergency and water rescues northeast of Nashville, and the weather service issued a tornado emergency, its highest alert level, for nearby areas.\n\nA 10-year-old boy was seriously injured in Christiana, southeast of Nashville, when he got caught in a storm drain and swept under streets while playing with other children as adults cleared debris, his father, Rutherford County Schools Superintendent Jimmy Sullivan, posted on social media.\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nThe boy, Asher, emerged in a drainage ditch and survived after being given CPR, \"but the damage is substantial,\" Sullivan posted on Facebook, asking for prayers.\n\n\"Asher needs a miracle,\" Sullivan wrote.\n\nDozens of people gathered at the school district's offices for a prayer vigil Thursday. They bowed their heads and closed their eyes in prayer, and they sang \"Amazing Grace\" together.\n\nSchools were closed Thursday and Friday in Rutherford and Maury. In Georgia, some districts north of Atlanta canceled in-person classes or delayed start times because of storm damage overnight that included fallen trees on houses and vehicles around Clarkesville. No injuries were reported there.\n\n\"We're just trying to clean up right now and wait for the next round,\" said Lynn Smith, director of the Habersham County Emergency Management Agency.\n\nA strong tornado damaged at least 20 homes in northern Alabama's DeKalb County and caused injuries but no deaths, officials said.\n\nIn North Carolina, a state of emergency was declared Wednesday night for Gaston County, west of Charlotte, after a storm that toppled power lines and trees, including one that landed on a car. One person in the car was killed, and another was taken to a hospital, officials said.\n\nThe storms followed heavy rain, strong winds, hail and tornadoes in parts of the central U.S. on Monday, including a twister that ripped through an Oklahoma town and killed one person. On Tuesday, the Midwest took the brunt of the bad weather. Tornadoes touched down in parts of Michigan, Ohio and Indiana, according to the weather service.\n\nMichigan's Kalamazoo area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart, with downed power lines trapping about 50 people.\n\nTornadoes were also confirmed near Pittsburgh, in central Arkansas and in northern West Virginia. The West Virginia twister was at least the 11th tornado this year in the state, which sees two tornadoes in an average year.\n\nBoth the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nAssociated Press journalists around the country contributed to this report, including Kimberlee Kruesi, Travis Loller, Jeff Amy, Joey Cappelletti, Ed White, Sarah Brumfield, Adrian Sainz and John Raby.\n\nThe Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

News outlets reported damaged buildings and power outages.\n\nHours earlier in southwestern Michigan, two reported tornadoes blitzed the city of Portage and an adjacent community Tuesday night, destroying homes and commercial buildings, including a FedEx facility that was ripped apart.\n\nNo serious injuries were immediately reported, but city officials said in a news release that the twisters knocked out power to more than 20,000 people. Most of them would be without power until late Wednesday, city officials said.\n\nAt one point, about 50 people were trapped inside the FedEx facility because of downed power lines. But company spokesperson Shannon Davis said late Tuesday that \"all team members are safe and accounted for.\"\n\nKalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller said more than a dozen mobile homes in Pavilion Township were \"totally destroyed.\" At least 16 people, he added, were injured there, though the injuries were not life-threatening.\n\n\"We found homes in the roadway,\" the sheriff said late Tuesday. \"We found homes in neighbors' homes. We found large trees in homes.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the buzz of chainsaws and the snap of tree limbs filled the air as cleanup began at a mobile home park.\n\n\"The clean-up efforts are tremendous. ... We're looking at homes throughout this community that are totally gone, they've been demolished,\" Fuller said in the light of day Wednesday at Pavilion Estates mobile home park.\n\nA home where seven people were living \"is totally on its top,\" he said. \"They were able to self-rescue and get somewhere safe and came back today.\"\n\nPavilion Township is adjacent to Portage and about 137 miles (220 kilometers) west of Detroit.\n\nMore than 30,000 customers were without power in Michigan early Wednesday, and an additional 10,000 in Ohio, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nMichigan Gov Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\n\"My heart goes out to all those impacted by tonight's severe weather in southwest Michigan,\" Whitmer said in a message on social media. \"State and local emergency teams are on the ground and working together to assist Michiganders.\"\n\nNational Weather Service crews were working Wednesday to survey storm damage in several counties in Michigan's southwest Lower Peninsula to determine whether tornadoes touched down in those areas, including the two reported Tuesday night in the city of Portage, said meteorologist Mike Sutton with the weather service's Grand Rapids office.\n\nHe said the Grand Rapids office had received a total of 11 reports of tornadoes from storm spotters, emergency managers and the public from late Tuesday afternoon into Tuesday night, but as of 8 am Wednesday, it had not confirmed any tornado touchdowns.\n\nSutton said it could be a couple days before the storm surveys are completed and he stressed that some of the tornado reports could be duplicate reports passed along by people who saw the same storm.\n\n\"It's quite possible those are multiple reports from the same tornado. The actual number of tornadoes may be lower depending on what they find when they're out surveying,\" he said.\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nAcross the US, the entire week is looking stormy. The Midwest and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St Louis and Cincinnati -- cities where more than 21 million people live.\n\nIt should be clear over the weekend.\n\nOn Monday night, a deadly twister in Oklahoma tore through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall. At least one person was killed and another was missing. Dozens of homes were destroyed.\n\nAerial videos showed homes reduced to piles of rubble and others with roofs torn off. The twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town.\n\nA 160-acre (65-hectare) wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained heavy damage.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit Barnsdall in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles.\n\nOklahoma Gov Kevin Stitt, who toured the twister's damage Tuesday, said it was rated by weather researchers as a violent tornado with winds reaching up to 200 mph (322 kph).\n\nStitt said he and legislative leaders have agreed to set aside USD 45 million in this year's budget to help storm-damaged communities.\n\nAreas in Oklahoma, including Sulphur and Holdenville, are still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month.

(AP) -- At least eight tornadoes have touched down in Ohio and three have been confirmed in Michigan as severe storms barreled through the central U.S. late Tuesday and early Wednesday, killing one man in Tennessee when a tree toppled onto a vehicle he was in.\n\nThe storm that rumbled across northeastern Tennessee brought high winds that knocked down powerlines and trees. Claiborne County Sheriff Bob Brooks said a 22-year-old man was in a car struck by one of the trees.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nThe National Weather Service says confirmed tornadoes touched down Tuesday in Ohio, including five in Warren County in the state's southwest region. The confirmations came Wednesday after crews were able to survey the damage caused by the strong storms that contained hail and heavy rains and knocked out power to thousands of utility customers.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nWeather service meteorologist in Michigan Nathan Jeruzal said the tornadoes there touched down one each in Kalamazoo, Cass and Branch counties -- all in the southwestern part of the state.\n\nKalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart and more than a dozen mobile homes were destroyed.\n\nTornadoes were first reported after dark Tuesday in parts of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, while portions of Illinois, Kentucky and Missouri were also under a tornado watch, according to the National Weather Service. The storms came a day after a deadly twister ripped through an Oklahoma town.\n\nSamantha Smith clutched a box Wednesday afternoon as she stepped from her mother's partially wrecked home in Michigan's Pavilion Township, about 137 miles (220 kilometers) west of Detroit. Inside the box were her grandmother's ashes. Being able to recover the most cherished of items offered Smith a rare moment of relief amid the storm's devastation.\n\n\"Finding this box is the best thing that's happened to me these past 24 hours,\" she said. \"The main thing we were all worried about was my grandma's ashes.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHer parents and brother were injured during the storm. Her brother suffered a broken pelvis and broken back, but he and other victims all survived, Smith added.\n\n\"I have thanked God probably a billion times since this happened yesterday,\" she said. \"My kids are healthy and good. We just gotta make back up what we lost.\"\n\nIn southern Indiana, the National Weather Service confirmed a tornado with a preliminary EF-0 rating and 85 mph (137 kph) winds touched down early Wednesday, damaging homes in a subdivision north of the city of Sellersburg, located about 12 miles (19 kilometers) north of Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nThe Clark County Emergency Management Agency said the storm damaged 24 structures.\n\nCandice Holmes, a resident of the Lewis & Clark subdivision north of Sellersburg, said she, her husband and son sought shelter in their bathroom when they heard the approaching storm and \"the wind just picked up all at once.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"My husband and my son stepped outside, opened the door and they slammed the door and ran back to the bathroom. And they held the bathroom door shut, as it came through,\" Holmes told WDRB-TV. \"It was over as soon as it started, but it was definitely a scary moment. And I'm glad we're alive.\"\n\nIn addition to the five in Warren County, confirmed tornadoes in Ohio were in the western part of the state in Greenville in Darke County, west of Coldwater in Mercer County and west of New Knoxville in Auglaize County. The weather service says crews are still surveying areas of Franklin and Butler counties to determine if tornadoes struck there, as well.\n\nJust outside of Pittsburgh, a weather service team confirmed that a brief tornado with maximum winds of 105 mph (169 kph) overturned a trailer and snapped more than a dozen trees early Wednesday in Findlay Township, Pennsylvania.\n\nBaseball-sized hail was reported Wednesday in areas just southwest of St. Louis, Missouri. Heavy downpours caused flash flooding and at least one water rescue near Sullivan, a town that was struck by a small tornado just two days earlier, destroying a bar and damaging the high school. Damaging hail also was reported in the Kansas City area.\n\nRadar indicated Hancock County, West Virginia, and Jefferson County, Ohio, were hit by tornadoes, but teams will have to evaluate the damage to determine their rating, Craven said.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHancock County Schools in West Virginia closed schools Wednesday because of \"extensive overnight weather issues\" in the county. News outlets reported damaged buildings and power outages.\n\nA National Weather Service team also was headed to Hot Springs, Arkansas, to survey damage and determine the strength of a tornado that hit early Wednesday morning, forecaster Tabitha Clarke said.\n\nThe tornado damaged some homes, uprooted trees and downed power lines. There were no immediate reports of injuries from the tornado, according to the state Division of Emergency Management.\n\nIn Portage, Michigan, about 50 people temporarily were trapped inside a damaged FedEx facility because of downed power lines. More than a dozen homes were destroyed in a mobile home park in adjacent Pavilion Township and 16 people were injured, said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller.\n\n\"We found homes in the roadway,\" Fuller said late Tuesday. \"We found homes in neighbors' homes. We found large trees in homes.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nPower was knocked out to more than 20,000 people.\n\n\"We're looking at homes throughout this community that are totally gone, they've been demolished,\" Fuller said in the light of day at Pavilion Estates mobile home park.\n\nA home where seven people were living \"is totally on its top,\" he said. \"They were able to self-rescue and get somewhere safe and came back today.\"\n\nTravis Wycoff ventured out Tuesday night after seeing on radar that a tornado had touched down in the Portage area. About five minutes later, he came upon the aftermath.\n\n\"There were a lot of people running through the streets trying to find people and their pets,\" Wycoff said. \"It was just a lot of chaos.\"\n\nWycoff said he helped an elderly couple out of their partially collapsed home and also freed a service dog from a home whose owner was at work.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nMore than 30,000 customers were without power in Michigan early Wednesday, and an additional 10,000 in Ohio, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nAcross the U.S., the entire week is looking stormy. The Midwest and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati -- cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nOn Monday night, a deadly twister in Oklahoma tore through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall. At least one person was killed and another was missing. Dozens of homes were destroyed.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit Barnsdall in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nAreas in Oklahoma, including Sulphur and Holdenville, are still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month.\n\n___\n\nMurphy reported from Oklahoma City.

Typically, survey field work after a severe storm is done the very next day. The survey team inspects the damage to buildings, homes, trees and even crops so they can determine if a tornado touchdown caused the damage, or if severe winds were to blame.\n\nOnce a tornado is confirmed by the NWS, the survey results include details like its estimated intensity, time on the ground, damage path and more.\n\nBut damage reports from Tuesday's storms came from multiple counties. So it could turn the survey work into a multi-day event if areas outside Kalamazoo County need to be investigated, NWS staff initially said.\n\nRELATED: 'Hell broke loose': Residents in shock after reported tornadoes rip through Portage\n\nThe city of Portage and surrounding townships in Kalamazoo County seemed to be the hardest hit as daybreak revealed the full extent of damage today. While there have been no reported fatalities there, up to 20 people were injured in the storm, sheriff's officials said. In a mobile home park just outside Portage, an estimated 176 homes were damaged and up to 17 were completely destroyed. The storm tossed homes into the road, into other homes, and sent trees down on homes and vehicles.\n\nThis morning, National Weather Service meteorologists in the Grand Rapids office said only one of the reported tornado touchdowns had been officially confirmed so far. That's the twister that hit the Portage area around 6 p.m. Tuesday. It was confirmed via video and radar data. NWS staff said it may be the only place they end up doing an official survey. A second tornado reported by a trained spotter in Portage about an hour later has not been officially confirmed. NWS officials today said they are trying to track down any photo or video evidence of that second Portage twister.\n\nThis has sparked some confusion among forecasters and those who report NWS weather news. This morning, there were questions as to exactly how many tornadoes may have touched down in Michigan on Tuesday. During the hours-long storm system's movement across Michigan, the NWS issued several Tornado Warnings of \"radar indicated\" tornadoes - or twisters identified by their rotation and debris as seen on radar. The NWS also used language for Tornado Warnings in Calhoun and Van Buren counties that \"a large, extremely dangerous and potentially deadly tornado is on the ground.\"\n\nAs of now, we're waiting to see if more NWS field surveys are planned to look at damage outside of Portage, and when those might happen.", "source": {"uri": "mlive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mlive"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Weather_Service", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "National Weather Service"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tornado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portage_County,_Wisconsin", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Portage County, Wisconsin"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Portage County, Wisconsin"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalamazoo_County,_Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Kalamazoo County, Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kalamazoo County, Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portage,_Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Portage, Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Portage, Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Rapids,_Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Grand Rapids, Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Grand Rapids, Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_township", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Civil township"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado_warning", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Tornado warning"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pressure_area", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Low-pressure area"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Radar"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Buren_County,_Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Van Buren County, Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Van Buren County, Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calhoun_County,_Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Calhoun County, Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Calhoun County, Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Science/Earth_Sciences/Atmospheric_Sciences", "label": "dmoz/Science/Earth Sciences/Atmospheric Sciences", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 59}], "image": "https://www.mlive.com/resizer/v2/EJGPLQ47DBH25CGORFCPZCGKZI.jpg?auth=7600114eb7241fa7f13edf23b9fc38c31413c414597a7c2751b1f1216a6be44f&width=1280&quality=90", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548085", "eventUri": "eng-9548085", "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Portage, Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.4509803921568627, "wgt": 165, "relevance": 1}

A boy swept into a drain fights for his life", "body": "COLUMBIA, Tenn. (AP) -- Dangerous storms crashed over parts of the South on Thursday even as the region cleaned up from earlier severe weather that spawned tornadoes, killed at least three people, and gravely injured a boy who was swept into a storm drain as he played in a flooded street.\n\nA heavy line of storms swept into Atlanta near the end of the morning rush hour. Busy hub airports in Atlanta and Charlotte, North Carolina, reported delays. The National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center cited an \"enhanced risk\" for severe weather from Texas to South Carolina.\n\nThe storms continue a streak of torrential rains and tornadoes this week from the Plains to the Midwest and, now, the Southeast. Since Monday, 39 states have been under threat of severe weather and at least four people have died. On Wednesday, 98 million people were under some sort of severe weather risk, said Evan Bentley, a Storm Prediction Center forecaster.\n\nThe weather comes on the heels of a stormy April in which the U.S. had 300 confirmed tornadoes, the second-most on record for the month and the most since 2011.\n\nMore than 170,000 homes and businesses still lacked power Thursday afternoon in several Southern states after storms the night before, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nOne in Tennessee damaged homes, injured people, toppled power lines and trees, and killed a 22-year-old man in a car in Claiborne County, north of Knoxville, officials said. A second person was killed south of Nashville in Columbia, the seat of Maury County, where officials said a tornado damaged or destroyed more than 140 homes.\n\nBob Booth had just gotten home to Columbia from Georgia and was sitting down to watch television when he heard a \"crazy racket.\"\n\n\"I get up and look out, and it was all hell breaking loose outside,\" Booth said. \"Then the top half of one of my trees goes down across the road.\"\n\nRetired pastor Walter Shell said he and his wife grabbed their two dogs and headed for the basement when his phone alerted him to a tornado.\n\n\"It missed where me and my wife were standing by about 4 inches. It went around,\" he said. \"It pays to pray, I can tell you.\"\n\nTorrential rains led to a flash flood emergency and water rescues northeast of Nashville, and the weather service issued a tornado emergency, its highest alert level, for nearby areas.\n\nA 10-year-old boy was seriously injured in Christiana, southeast of Nashville, when he got caught in a storm drain and swept under streets while playing with other children as adults cleared debris, his father, Rutherford County Schools Superintendent Jimmy Sullivan, posted on social media.\n\nThe boy, Asher, emerged in a drainage ditch and survived after being given CPR, \"but the damage is substantial,\" Sullivan posted on Facebook, asking for prayers. A vigil was planned for Thursday afternoon at the school district office.\n\n\"Asher needs a miracle,\" Sullivan wrote.\n\nSchools were closed Thursday in Rutherford and several other Tennessee counties. In Georgia, some districts north of Atlanta canceled in-person classes or delayed start times because of storm damage overnight that included fallen trees on houses and vehicles around Clarkesville. No injuries were reported there.\n\n\"We're just trying to clean up right now and wait for the next round,\" said Lynn Smith, director of the Habersham County Emergency Management Agency.\n\nA strong tornado damaged at least 20 homes in northern Alabama's DeKalb County and caused injuries but no deaths, officials said.\n\nIn North Carolina, a state of emergency was declared Wednesday night for Gaston County, west of Charlotte, after a storm that toppled power lines and trees, including one that landed on a car. One person in the car was killed, and another was taken to a hospital, officials said.\n\nThe storms followed heavy rain, strong winds, hail and tornadoes in parts of the central U.S. on Monday, including a twister that ripped through an Oklahoma town and killed one person. On Tuesday, the Midwest took the brunt of the bad weather. Tornadoes touched down in parts of Michigan, Ohio and Indiana, according to the weather service.\n\nMichigan's Kalamazoo area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart, with downed power lines trapping about 50 people.\n\nTornadoes were also confirmed near Pittsburgh, in central Arkansas and in northern West Virginia. The West Virginia twister was at least the 11th tornado this year in the state, which sees two tornadoes in an average year.\n\nBoth the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nAssociated Press journalists around the country contributed to this report, including Travis Loller, Jeff Amy, Joey Cappelletti, Ed White, Sarah Brumfield, Adrian Sainz and John Raby.\n\nThe Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

(AP) -- Dangerous storms crashed over parts of the South on Thursday even as the region cleaned up from earlier severe weather that spawned tornadoes, killed at least three people, and gravely injured a boy who was swept into a storm drain as he played in a flooded street.\n\nA heavy line of storms swept into Atlanta near the end of the morning rush hour. Busy hub airports in Atlanta and Charlotte, North Carolina, reported delays. The National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center cited an \"enhanced risk\" for severe weather from Texas to South Carolina.\n\nThe storms continue a streak of torrential rains and tornadoes this week from the Plains to the Midwest and, now, the Southeast. Since Monday, 39 states have been under threat of severe weather and at least four people have died. On Wednesday, 98 million people were under some sort of severe weather risk, said Evan Bentley, a Storm Prediction Center forecaster.\n\nThe weather comes on the heels of a stormy April in which the U.S. had 300 confirmed tornadoes, the second-most on record for the month and the most since 2011.\n\nMore than 170,000 homes and businesses still lacked power Thursday afternoon in several Southern states after storms the night before, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nOne in Tennessee damaged homes, injured people, toppled power lines and trees, and killed a 22-year-old man in a car in Claiborne County, north of Knoxville, officials said. A second person was killed south of Nashville in Columbia, the seat of Maury County, where officials said a tornado damaged or destroyed more than 100 homes.\n\nGov. Bill Lee says the woman who died in Maury County was in a mobile home at the time the storm hit, which was thrown several feet into a wooded area.\n\nBob Booth had just gotten home to Columbia from Georgia and was sitting down to watch television when he heard a \"crazy racket.\"\n\n\"I get up and look out, and it was all hell breaking loose outside,\" Booth said. \"Then the top half of one of my trees goes down across the road.\"\n\nRetired pastor Walter Shell said he and his wife grabbed their two dogs and headed for the basement when his phone alerted him to a tornado.\n\n\"It missed where me and my wife were standing by about 4 inches. It went around,\" he said. \"It pays to pray, I can tell you.\"\n\nTorrential rains led to a flash flood emergency and water rescues northeast of Nashville, and the weather service issued a tornado emergency, its highest alert level, for nearby areas.\n\nA 10-year-old boy was seriously injured in Christiana, southeast of Nashville, when he got caught in a storm drain and swept under streets while playing with other children as adults cleared debris, his father, Rutherford County Schools Superintendent Jimmy Sullivan, posted on social media.\n\nThe boy, Asher, emerged in a drainage ditch and survived after being given CPR, \"but the damage is substantial,\" Sullivan posted on Facebook, asking for prayers. A vigil was planned for Thursday afternoon at the school district office.\n\n\"Asher needs a miracle,\" Sullivan wrote.\n\nDozens of people gathered at the school district's offices for a prayer vigil Thursday. They bowed their heads and closed their eyes in prayer, and they sang \"Amazing Grace\" together.\n\nSchools were closed Thursday in Rutherford and several other Tennessee counties. In Georgia, some districts north of Atlanta canceled in-person classes or delayed start times because of storm damage overnight that included fallen trees on houses and vehicles around Clarkesville. No injuries were reported there.\n\n\"We're just trying to clean up right now and wait for the next round,\" said Lynn Smith, director of the Habersham County Emergency Management Agency.\n\nA strong tornado damaged at least 20 homes in northern Alabama's DeKalb County and caused injuries but no deaths, officials said.\n\nIn North Carolina, a state of emergency was declared Wednesday night for Gaston County, west of Charlotte, after a storm that toppled power lines and trees, including one that landed on a car. One person in the car was killed, and another was taken to a hospital, officials said.\n\nThe storms followed heavy rain, strong winds, hail and tornadoes in parts of the central U.S. on Monday, including a twister that ripped through an Oklahoma town and killed one person. On Tuesday, the Midwest took the brunt of the bad weather. Tornadoes touched down in parts of Michigan, Ohio and Indiana, according to the weather service.\n\nMichigan's Kalamazoo area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart, with downed power lines trapping about 50 people.\n\nTornadoes were also confirmed near Pittsburgh, in central Arkansas and in northern West Virginia. The West Virginia twister was at least the 11th tornado this year in the state, which sees two tornadoes in an average year.\n\nBoth the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nAssociated Press journalists around the country contributed to this report, including Travis Loller, Jeff Amy, Joey Cappelletti, Ed White, Sarah Brumfield, Adrian Sainz and John Raby.\n\nThe Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Gretchen Whitmer declares state of emergency in parts of state over tornadoes\n\nUnion City, Michigan, was under a tornado emergency on Tuesday evening, marking the first time the rare alert was issued within the state. A tornado emergency -- which the National Weather Service first started in 1999 -- is issued only when catastrophic damage is imminent or ongoing, as is the threat to human life.\n\nMeanwhile, there was notable damage in Portage, Michigan, located just south of Kalamazoo, where a large FedEx facility was damaged. All occupants of that building are alive and accounted for, according to the company.\n\nElsewhere, multiple homes have been damaged in places like Fairhaven, West Virginia; Irondale, Ohio; Charloe, Ohio; and Garland County, Arkansas.\n\nA new batch of energy will kick off storms in central Missouri and St. Louis Wednesday afternoon. There is a likelihood that Wednesday could be the third day of a multiday tornado outbreak -- the fourth such event in a month.\n\nThe energy from this storm will likely create numerous severe thunderstorms over a widespread area throughout the afternoon and evening hours from Texas to the Ozarks to the Ohio River Valley to the Mid-Atlantic.\n\nMORE: How to shelter during a tornado if you don't have a basement\n\nA tornado watch has been for parts of Missouri, Illinois and Kentucky through 5 p.m. CT.

No other tornado has had as many deaths since 2021.\n\nMajor metros in the path of potentially damaging storms Wednesday include St. Louis; Cincinnati; Louisville, Kentucky; Nashville and Memphis,

National Weather Service Meteorologist Nathan Jeruzal said the second cell had not yet been confirmed as a tornado as of Wednesday morning.\n\nKeep up with all things West Michigan business. Sign up for our free newsletters today.\n\nStill, the severe weather left a trail of destroyed homes and businesses in its path. Many Portage businesses announced via Facebook that they would not be open until further notice because of the severe damage to their buildings.\n\nThe hardest hit area in the city is bound by Centre Avenue, Oakland Drive, Schuring Road and Westnedge Avenue, according to a press release from the city of Portage.\n\n\"We are deeply saddened to inform you that our building has been significantly affected by the tornado that just hit our Portage community,\" Burn Boot Camp, a gym located at 7545 Westnedge Ave. in Portage, said on Facebook. \"The safety and well-being of our members and employees are our top priority, and as a result, we will be temporarily closed as we assess the damage and work on rebuilding.\"\n\nImages posted of the Portage Centre location of Jude's Barbershop, 2050 W. Centre Ave., showed entire exterior walls destroyed after being hit by the tornado.\n\n\"Our barbershop in Portage on Centre Rd was hit by the Tornado. Luckily, everyone is safe,\" according to the Jude's Facebook page.\n\nMichelle's, a Portage restaurant located at 677 Romence Road, did not face damage or power outages and remains open to the community. The business announced via Facebook that it would be open on May 8 starting at 6:45 a.m. for people to eat and regroup.\n\n\"We're just offering our facility if people just want to come and charge their phone and their phone or just get out, and, you know, out of the elements, and just to regroup,\" Michelle's owner Mark Romstadt told Crain's. \"Whatever they need, we're doing whatever we can.\"\n\nRomstadt said Michelle's is busier than normal. The business typically would have five employees on a Wednesday, but today 11 people are working to help with the increased number of customers, said Romstadt.\n\nLatitude 42, a restaurant and brewery with locations in Portage and Kalamazoo, lost power at its Portage location during dinner service last night, according to Brad Bishop, president of the company.\n\nThe restaurant is back online today. Bishop said Latitude is offering complimentary Wi-Fi, food and beverages to those in need, including a burger bar for first responders, which will be open from 11:30 to 2:30 today.\n\n\"We're hoping we can be there for the community and support them first and foremost,\" Bishop said. \"Anybody that needs help, we're here for them.\"\n\nAs well, a FedEx shipping facility on Portage Road was leveled. At one point during the storm Tuesday night, 50 employees were reportedly trapped inside the facility for a short time because of downed power lines.\n\n\"I can confirm those FedEx team members who initially sought shelter inside the building are all safe and accounted for,\" a FedEx spokesperson said in an emailed statement. \"We are grateful there were no serious injuries resulting from the damage to our facility at 6701 Portage Road. We continue to assess the damage, and we are implementing contingency plans to lessen any potential impacts on service.\"\n\nKalamazoo County Commissioner John Taylor, whose district includes the city of Portage, said residents are being asked to stay off the roads if possible to let emergency crews clear roadways of trees, power lines and other debris from the storm.\n\n\"We're transitioning from trying to save lives, and now we're in the cleanup phase,\" said Taylor, who serves as vice chairperson on the Kalamazoo County board. \"Stay off the roads at least for a little while longer, let emergency crews clear off the rest of the streets, then we can start the process of clearing damaged buildings.\"\n\nDriving this morning, Taylor said he saw entire strip malls \"completely ripped out\" on Centre Avenue near Oakland Drive.\n\nTaylor confirmed that, as of this morning, no known fatalities resulted from the tornadoes, and multiple people with injuries were sent to local hospitals.\n\nResidents who need assistance or access to shelter can call the city's 2-1-1 line. The Salvation Army set up shelters at Kalamazoo First Assembly of God church at 5550 Oakland Drive and Radiant Church at 995 Romence Road. The city of Portage's non-emergency offices are closed today.\n\nAs of Wednesday at 9 a.m., Consumers Energy reported nearly 24,000 power outages in its Southwest Michigan territory, including outages concentrated between Portage and Vicksburg and farther south in Colon in St. Joseph County.\n\nJeruzal, of the National Weather Service, said the strength of the tornado is yet to be determined by storm survey teams.\n\n\"We don't know exactly what the strength of the tornado is yet, but our teams are going to be evaluating that today,\" Jeruzal said. \"Seeing, you know, what type of damage exactly how they were fastened (buildings) ... some of the integrity of the buildings and they'll make determinations on how strong the tornado was from that.\"\n\nJeruzal said the storm survey teams began examining the site of the storm this morning and because of the amount of damage from the storm, evaluations can be ongoing throughout the day and potentially into tomorrow.\n\nIn addition to the damage to strip malls, Jeruzal noted the Portage FedEx facility and mobile home park faced significant damages and were more affected by severe weather conditions because those locations are not on foundations.\n\nMore from Crain's Grand Rapids Business:\n\nFormer Ottawa Beach Inn near Holland to be revived under new owners -- with a nod to the past\n\nDemolition starts for Acrisure

The weather service said one tornado also was reported in Centreville, Colon, Leonidas , Mendon and Wasepi in St. Joseph County. Another was reported in Sherwood in Branch County, and there was one in Comstock in Kalamazoo County.\n\nThe damage in Portage , among the hardest hit areas, was widespread, leaving several businesses inoperable. City officials, meanwhile, continued to assess the damage on Wednesday.\n\nAt Jude's Barbershop on West Centre Avenue in Portage, the shop is a \"total loss,\" office manager Amanda Renis said.\n\n\"Half the building is ripped off, the ceiling is partially gone and there's a gas leak,\" Renis told The News Wednesday morning. \"Jude's has been open for more than 20 years, but this location on Centre in the strip mall is newer, only four years old. Our other location right down the road is fully operable, thankfully.\"\n\nThe first tornado was reported at 5:15 p.m. Tuesday in Dowagiac and the last at 7:22 in Comstock, NWS said.\n\nThe tornadoes downed trees and power lines and scattered debris from buildings and homes. Late Tuesday, Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller III said up to 20 people reportedly were hospitalized for injuries from blown glass and debris. No fatalities were reported, he said.\n\nOn Wednesday, he said in a statement that the county's government has declared a local state of emergency. He also said Portage Public Safety has reported that door-to-door checks are being conducted in the hardest-hit areas. \"As recovery efforts continue, various agencies and organizations are working tirelessly to restore normalcy to affected areas and assist those in need,\" he said.\n\nThe tornadoes caused substantial damage in several areas, including Centre Street up to Shearing andWestnedge up to Angling Road , according to the sheriff's office. Fuller said Wednesday a FedEx building on Portage Rd. and the Pavilion Estates mobile home park both sustained extensive damage.\n\nAt one point, employees were trapped inside the FedEx building, county officials said. They also said entire homes were destroyed at the Pavilion Estates mobile home park. The county confirmed Wednesday that 176 homes on the property were damaged and 40 percent of those were heavily damaged.\n\n\"Portage first responders have ensured all employees are safely out of the FedEx building,\" the sheriff said. \"And our teams have also completed their search and rescue at Pavilion Estates and have confirmed 16 to 20 injuries at this time, with no casualties.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Salvation Army has established two shelters: First Assembly of God , located at 5550 Oakland Drive , and Radiant Church , located at 995 Romence Road. Each has a capacity of 100 people.\n\nThe Kalamazoo County sheriff said Portage police were investigating damage to the FedEx facility on Portage Road.\n\nResidents across the street from the site spent their Wednesday morning clearing wreckage on their own.\n\nHarsh winds uprooted trees in Williams' front and back yards on Lansing Avenue in Portage, tearing away chunks of driveway in one fell swoop, she said. No one on the block was injured, Williams said.\n\nAs retired electricians, Williams said she and her husband were just glad to have supportive friends willing to step in and help after the storm passed.\n\nUpheaval from the storm changed Pedro Martinez's plans for Wednesday, forcing him to spend the morning clearing his own driveway, the 67-year-old resident on Ramona Avenue said.\n\nThe violent storm downed several trees and some electrical wires on his street, though he hadn't heard of any injuries or casualties yet, Martinez said.\n\nMartinez and his family thought the alerts on their phones were just false alarms until the storm was practically on their doorstep, he said.\n\nMartinez' grandson, 9-year-old Daniel Martinez , said he was scared of these storm at first but still eager to help his family clean up the next day.\n\n\"I was running to my basement,\" Daniel Martinez said, adding the fear had shifted to excitement as he recounted the experience to friends the next day. \"I sent them a picture of the destruction.\"\n\nMichael Browers, 59, spent his morning with family helping him clear fallen trees, said the Ramona Avenue resident living a few doors down from Martinez.\n\nMore than a dozen pine trees fell in his backyard, while one large tree fell directly onto his roof, he said.\n\nThe damage was incalculable so far, he said.\n\nBrowers and his family were especially concerned their insurance might not be able to cover impending repairs, he said.\n\n\"Being disabled, I can make a couple cuts, go sit for a couple hours, then make a couple cuts and go sit for a couple hours,\" he said.\n\nThe only thing Browers felt he could do now in the aftermath of the storm was to take things one day at a time, he said.\n\n\"I've lived here about 35 years, and I haven't ever really taken it seriously,\" Martinez said of the extreme weather. \"I will now.\"\n\nAs neighbors rushed to clear damage, crews tend to thousands without power Wednesday.\n\nThere were 127 outages reported in Consumers Energy's service area and about 22,000 people affected, mainly in Portage, Colon and St. Joseph . Elsewhere, DTE Energy reported Wednesday afternoon it had more than 5,600 power interruptions, mainly in Fraser, Harrison Township and St. Clair Shores. Power was expected to be restored by 10 p.m.\n\nClean-up crews are on the ground with assistance from Michigan State Police, Kalamazoo County Sheriff's Department, City of Kalamazoo Public Safety, West Michigan 5th District Technical Rescue Team, LifeEMS and others.\n\nThe city of Portage non-emergency offices were closed on Wednesday. Those in need of assistance with sheltering or other human service needs should call 2-1-1.\n\nGov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for Kalamazoo , St. Joseph, Branch and Cass counties.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Michigan Department of Environment , Great Lakes, and Energy urged residents to follow cleanup guidelines set by the state.\n\n\"In times of significant weather incidents, we are keeping the health and safety of Michiganders at the forefront of cleanup efforts,\" EGLE Director Phil Roos said in a statement. \"Safe debris disposal is an essential part of this storm response process and protective of our state's environment.\"\n\nThe Better Business Bureau In Western Michigan also warned homeowners \"to beware of scammers, sometimes called 'storm chasers,' when looking to hire help to clean up. Homeowners should be wary of anyone going door-to-door offering storm cleanup assistance. They should also use caution when looking on social media for help. These situations prompt good-intentioned neighbors to lend a helping hand. It can also bring out those who are looking to take advantage of people during a vulnerable time.\"\n\nAs cleanup continues, clearer weather is forecast in most of the affected area.\n\n\"After a stormy Tuesday, tranquil weather will return for Wednesday with mostly sunny skies and temperatures in the upper 60s and 70s,\" meteorologists with the weather service's Grand Rapids office said.\n\nRain is expected to return Thursday as high temperatures fall to around 60, according to the weather service.\n\ncramirez@detroitnews.com\n\n@CharlesERamirez\n\n\u00a92024 The Detroit News.

(AP) -- Three tornadoes have been confirmed in Michigan as severe storms barreled through the central U.S. early Wednesday, killing one man in Tennessee when a tree toppled onto a vehicle he was in.\n\nThe storm that rumbled across northeastern Tennessee brought high winds that knocked down powerlines and trees. Claiborne County Sheriff Bob Brooks said a 22-year-old man was in a car struck by one of the trees.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber?

The storms came a day after a deadly twister ripped through an Oklahoma town.\n\nSamantha Smith clutched a box Wednesday afternoon as she stepped from her mother's partially wrecked home in Michigan's Pavilion Township, about 137 miles (220 kilometers) west of Detroit. Inside the box were her grandmother's ashes. Being able to recover the most cherished of items offered Smith a rare moment of relief amid the storm's devastation.\n\n\"Finding this box is the best thing that's happened to me these past 24 hours,\" she said. \"The main thing we were all worried about was my grandma's ashes.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHer parents and brother were injured during the storm.

And they held the bathroom door shut, as it came through,\" Holmes told WDRB-TV. \"It was over as soon as it started, but it was definitely a scary moment. And I'm glad we're alive.\"\n\nSurvey teams planned to head out Wednesday to determine whether tornadoes struck locations in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia, according to Jeff Craven, the meteorologist-in-charge in the weather service's Pittsburgh office.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nRadar indicated Hancock County, West Virginia, and in Jefferson County, Ohio, were hit by tornadoes, but teams will have to evaluate the damage to determine their rating, Craven said.\n\nHancock County Schools in West Virginia closed schools Wednesday because of \"extensive overnight weather issues\" in the county. News outlets reported damaged buildings and power outages.\n\nA National Weather Service team also was headed to Hot Springs, Arkansas, to survey damage and determine the strength of a tornado that hit early Wednesday morning, forecaster Tabitha Clarke said.\n\nThe tornado damaged some homes, uprooted trees and downed power lines. There were no immediate reports of injuries from the tornado, according to the state Division of Emergency Management.\n\nIn Portage, Michigan, about 50 people temporarily were trapped inside a damaged FedEx facility because of downed power lines. More than a dozen homes were destroyed in a mobile home park in adjacent Pavilion Township and 16 people were injured, said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller.\n\n\"We found homes in the roadway,\" Fuller said late Tuesday. \"We found homes in neighbors' homes.

About five minutes later, he came upon the aftermath.\n\n\"There were a lot of people running through the streets trying to find people and their pets,\" Wycoff said. \"It was just a lot of chaos.\"\n\nWycoff said he helped an elderly couple out of their partially collapsed home and also freed a service dog from a home whose owner was at work.\n\nMore than 30,000 customers were without power in Michigan early Wednesday, and an additional 10,000 in Ohio, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters.

The Midwest and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati -- cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nOn Monday night, a deadly twister in Oklahoma tore through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall. At least one person was killed and another was missing. Dozens of homes were destroyed.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit Barnsdall in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles.\n\nAreas in Oklahoma, including Sulphur and Holdenville, are still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month.\n\n___\n\nMurphy reported from Oklahoma City. Associated Press journalists around the country contributed to this report, including Rio Yamat, Heather Hollingsworth, Colleen Slevin, Jim Salter, Kathy McCormack, Sarah Brumfield, Beatrice Dupuy and Alexa St. John.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Busy hub airports in Atlanta and Charlotte, North Carolina, reported delays. The National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center cited an \"enhanced risk\" for severe weather from Texas to South Carolina.\n\nThe storms continue a streak of torrential rains and tornadoes this week from the Plains to the Midwest and, now, the Southeast. At least four people have died since Monday. The weather comes on the heels of a stormy April in which the US had 300 confirmed tornadoes, the second-most on record for the month and the most since 2011.\n\nNearly a quarter-million homes and businesses still lacked power Thursday in several Southern states after storms the night before, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nOne in Tennessee damaged homes, injured people, toppled power lines and trees, and killed a 22-year-old man in a car in Claiborne County, north of Knoxville, officials said. A second person was killed south of Nashville in Columbia, where officials said a likely tornado blew homes off their foundations.\n\nBob Booth had just gotten home to Columbia from Georgia and was sitting down to watch television when he heard a \"crazy racket.\" \"I get up and look out, and it was all hell breaking loose outside,\" Booth said. \"Then the top half of one of my trees goes down across the road.\" Booth said he was told it would be a while before his power was restored. One neighbour, he said, lost all trees except one that would have destroyed his house: \"So that guy is blessed.'' Retired pastor Walter Shell said he and his wife grabbed their two dogs and headed for the basement when his phone alerted him to a tornado.\n\n\"It missed where me and my wife were standing by about about 4 inches. It went around,\" he said. \"It pays to pray, I can tell you.\" Torrential rains led to a flash flood emergency and water rescues northeast of Nashville. A temporary ground stop was issued at Nashville's main airport, and the weather service issued a tornado emergency, its highest alert level, for nearby areas.\n\nSchools were closed Thursday in several Tennessee counties. In Georgia, some districts north of Atlanta canceled in-person classes or delayed start times because of storm damage overnight that included fallen trees on houses and vehicles around Clarkesville. No injuries were reported there.\n\n\"We're just trying to clean up right now and wait for the next round,\" said Lynn Smith, director of the Habersham County Emergency Management Agency.\n\nA strong tornado damaged at least 20 homes in northern Alabama's DeKalb County and caused injuries but no deaths, officials said.\n\nIn North Carolina, a state of emergency was declared Wednesday night for Gaston County, west of Charlotte, after a storm that toppled power lines and trees, including one that landed on a car. One person in the car was killed, and another was taken to a hospital, officials said. The storms followed heavy rain, strong winds, hail and tornadoes in parts of the central U.S. on Monday, including a twister that ripped through an Oklahoma town and killed one person. On Tuesday, the Midwest took the brunt of the bad weather. Tornadoes touched down in parts of Michigan, Ohio and Indiana, according to the weather service.\n\nMichigan's Kalamazoo area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart, with downed power lines trapping about 50 people.\n\nTornadoes were also confirmed near Pittsburgh, in central Arkansas and in northern West Virginia. The West Virginia twister was at least the 11th tornado this year in the state, which sees two tornadoes in an average year.\n\nBoth the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this

Especially hard-hit were the Timberlake Creek apartment complex on Schuring Road and two mobile home parks, Oak Brook Estates mobile home park along Lovers Lane and Pavilion Estates near Sprinkle Road.\n\nMORE: See the 11-mile path Kalamazoo County's tornado took Tuesday\n\nA second reported tornado in the county hasn't been confirmed yet by the National Weather Service, as of Thursday morning.\n\nThe confirmed tornado was rated as an EF2 by the National Weather Service with winds of up to 135 miles per hour, which is one mph less than the threshold for a EF3 tornado.\n\nHowever, no fatalities and only a handful of injuries were reported -- unlike the 1980 Kalamazoo tornado, in which five were killed and 79 were injured.\n\nThe 1980 twister began about 4 p.m. May 13, 1980, sweeping through the heavily populated Westwood neighborhood, damaging more than 200 homes before into plowing into the heart of downtown Kalamazoo.\n\nMORE: Remembering the Kalamazoo tornado 40 years after it struck May 13, 1980\n\nThere, among other damage, the storm demolished St. Augustine Cathedral School on West Michigan Avenue, sheered off the back wall of the seven-story Gilmore Department Store on the Kalamazoo Mall and toppled more than two dozen trees in Bronson Park that were at least 150 years old.\n\nThat storm was rated an F3, with winds of 150 to 175 mph, using the original Fujita scale. The Enhanced Fujita scale was adopted in 2007.\n\nThat was the deadliest storm in Kalamazoo's history, based on National Weather Service records that go back to 1950.\n\nHowever, it wasn't the most severe tornado in county history. That belongs to the F4 tornado on April 2, 1977. But that one resulted in zero deaths and only 10 injuries.\n\nHere's a chart of all confirmed tornadoes on record in Kalamazoo County on record, which dates back to 1954.\n\nThose records show that Kalamazoo County had 25 confirmed tornadoes in the past 74 years before this week. That includes one F4 tornado, two F3s, in 1965 and 1980, and now four F2s/EF2s.\n\nThere were six tornadoes before this week that resulted in injuries: In 1955, 1965, 1973, 1977, 1978 and 1980.\n\nThe county's last tornadoes occurred 15 years ago, on June 19, 2009, a day when there were actually two tornadoes reported around 10 p.m. The first was an EF1 that touched down for a two-mile stretch in Alamo Township. The second, an EF2, touched down for less than a mile but tore the roof off a home in Richland Township.\n\nHere's a map of all of Kalamazoo County's confirmed tornadoes on record, dating back to 1954. This week's tornado isn't included -- here's that map.\n\nAmong the memorable tornado events in Kalamazoo County was the so-called Palm Sunday tornado outbreaks on April 11, 1965, the deadliest day for tornadoes in the Great Lakes region, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nMichigan, Indiana and Ohio were especially hard hit. In all, there were 47 confirmed tornadoes, 271 deaths and 3,400 people injured, the NWS says.\n\nA dozen tornadoes swept through Michigan that day, killing 51 and injuring 800. Most of those deaths and injuries occurred when two tornadoes cut an 80-mile-plus path through Branch, Hillsdale, Lenawee and Monroe counties.\n\nIn Kalamazoo County, an F3 tornado touched down around 6:30 p.m. on Palm Sunday 1965 and cut a 14-mile path of destruction through Cooper, Richland and Ross townships, injuring 17, demolishing four homes and damaging 22 others. Another 14 people were injured in two tornadoes that tore through Allegan and Barry counties.\n\nThe Palm Sunday tornado outbreaks are considered a \"watershed moment in weather history,\" the NWS says. In the wake of that outbreak, the National Weather Service introduced the \"tornado watch\" and \"tornado warning\" system and worked with the media -- particularly television and radio stations -- to publicize tornado watch and warning announcements. In addition, communities began to use civil defense sirens to warn of approaching tornadoes.\n\nThe only F4 tornado ever recorded in Kalamazoo County occurred on April 2, 1977, and was one of two F4 tornadoes in Michigan that day. Although it was 47 years ago, those were also the most recent F4s in the state, according to NWS records.\n\nThe Gaylord tornado in 2022 was an EF3.\n\nThe 1977 Kalamazoo County twister first touched down in Comstock Township around 1:30 p.m. and took at 12-mile path northeast, tearing into Galesburg and Augusta, destroying buildings and injuring 10 people. One witness recalled seeing an Augusta home go up in the air and slam to the ground; another told of finding the roof of the Augusta Lumber Company \"sitting on top of my car,\" according to a WZZM-TV report marking the tornado's 47th anniversary.\n\nMinutes after that 1977 twister died out in Kalamazoo County, a second F4 tornado formed in Eaton County, racing from Bellevue to Eaton Rapids. That storm was even more dangerous, killing one person and injuring 40 others.\n\nThere were three other Kalamazoo County tornadoes since 1950 that resulted in an injury, according to the NWS:\n\nAn interesting side note: In the past 74 years, 12 of the 25 tornadoes recorded in Kalamazoo County occurred in a 15-year span, from 1965 to 1980. That period also includes five of the six tornadoes that resulted in injuries.\n\nIndeed, Kalamazoo had eight tornadoes during the 1970s, compared to no tornadoes since 2009 until this week.\n\nThe table below documents all confirmed tornadoes in Michigan from 1950 to 2020. It's searchable by county and can be sorted by category.\n\nOfficials say that tornado-related deaths and injuries have become less frequent because of better warning systems.\n\nThis week was the first time that a tornado \"emergency alert\" was issued in Michigan. That alert warns residents of a confirmed tornado sighting, with a threat of catastrophic damage and severe threat to human life.\n\nThis week, Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller underscored the importance of emergency alerts.\n\n\"Forty-four years ago, we had a much more tragic event come through and cause five lives to go,\" Fuller said during a May 8 press conference. \"Because they were paying attention last night and hearing the alerts, lives were saved. We heard more than one story where people said, 'We just got out of there.'\"", "source": {"uri": "mlive.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "mlive"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri":

At least four people have died since Monday.\n\nThe weather comes on the heels of a stormy April in which the US had 300 confirmed tornadoes, the second most on record for the month and the most since 2011.\n\nStorms had already left more than a quarter of a million customers without power on Thursday in North Carolina, Tennessee, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama and Missouri, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nA storm on Wednesday in north-eastern Tennessee damaged homes, injured people, toppled power lines and trees, and killed a 22-year-old man in a car in Claiborne County, north of Knoxville, officials said.\n\nA second person was killed south of Nashville in Columbia, where officials said a tornado had probably touched down and homes were blown off their foundations.\n\nSchools were closed Thursday in several Tennessee counties. Some districts north of Atlanta cancelled in-person classes or delayed start times because of storm damage overnight that included fallen trees on houses and vehicles around Clarkesville. No injuries were reported.\n\n\"We're just trying to clean up right now and wait for the next round,\" said Lynn Smith, director of the Habersham County Emergency Management Agency.\n\nTorrential rain led to a flash flood emergency and water rescues north-east of Nashville. The Federal Aviation Administration issued a temporary ground stop at Nashville's main airport, and the weather service issued a tornado emergency, its highest alert level, for nearby areas.\n\nIn North Carolina, a state of emergency was declared on Wednesday night for Gaston County, west of Charlotte, after a storm that toppled power lines and trees, including one that landed on a car. One person in the car was killed, and another was taken to a hospital, officials said.\n\nThe storms followed heavy rain, strong winds, hail and tornadoes in parts of the central US on Monday, including a twister that ripped through an Oklahoma town and killed one person.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Midwest took the brunt of the bad weather. Tornadoes touched down in parts of Michigan, Ohio and Indiana, according to the weather service.\n\nMichigan's Kalamazoo area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart, with downed power lines trapping about 50 people.\n\nTornadoes were also confirmed near Pittsburgh, in central Arkansas and in northern West Virginia.

The National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center cited an \"enhanced risk\" for severe weather from Texas to South Carolina.\n\nREAD MORE: Ohio valley braces for potential tornadoes after severe weather hits south\n\nThe storms continue a streak of torrential rains and tornadoes this week from the Plains to the Midwest and, now, the Southeast. At least four people have died since Monday. The weather comes on the heels of a stormy April in which the U.S. had 300 confirmed tornadoes, the second-most on record for the month and the most since 2011.\n\nNearly a quarter-million homes and businesses still lacked power Thursday in several Southern states after storms the night before, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nOne in Tennessee damaged homes, injured people, toppled power lines and trees, and killed a 22-year-old man in a car in Claiborne County, north of Knoxville, officials said.

One neighbor, he said, lost all trees except one that would have destroyed his house: \"So that guy is blessed.\"\n\nIn Spring Hill, not far from Columbia, retired pastor Walter Shell said he and his wife grabbed their two dogs and headed for the basement when his phone alerted him to a tornado.\n\n\"It missed where me and my wife were standing by about about 4 inches. It went around,\" he said. \"It pays to pray, I can tell you.\"\n\nTorrential rains led to a flash flood emergency and water rescues northeast of Nashville. A temporary ground stop was issued at Nashville's main airport, and the weather service issued a tornado emergency, its highest alert level, for nearby areas.\n\nSchools were closed Thursday in several Tennessee counties. In Georgia, some districts north of Atlanta canceled in-person classes or delayed start times because of storm damage overnight that included fallen trees on houses and vehicles around Clarkesville. No injuries were reported there.\n\n\"We're just trying to clean up right now and wait for the next round,\" said Lynn Smith, director of the Habersham County Emergency Management Agency.\n\nA strong tornado damaged at least 20 homes in northern Alabama's DeKalb County and caused injuries but no deaths, officials said.\n\nIn North Carolina, a state of emergency was declared Wednesday night for Gaston County, west of Charlotte, after a storm that toppled power lines and trees, including one that landed on a car. One person in the car was killed, and another was taken to a hospital, officials said.\n\nThe storms followed heavy rain, strong winds, hail and tornadoes in parts of the central U.S. on Monday, including a twister that ripped through an Oklahoma town and killed one person. On Tuesday, the Midwest took the brunt of the bad weather. Tornadoes touched down in parts of Michigan, Ohio and Indiana, according to the weather service.\n\nMichigan's Kalamazoo area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart, with downed power lines trapping about 50 people.\n\nTornadoes were also confirmed near Pittsburgh, in central Arkansas and in northern West Virginia.

Multiple injuries were reported at the park.\n\nBy ED WHITE, ALEXA ST. JOHN and SEAN MURPHY - Associated Press\n\nDETROIT (AP) -- Severe storms barreled through the Midwest early Wednesday, a day after two reported tornadoes struck one Michigan city and destroyed homes and commercial buildings, including a FedEx facility.\n\nTornadoes were first reported after dark Tuesday in parts of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, while portions of Illinois, Kentucky and Missouri were also under a tornado watch, according to the National Weather Service. The storms came a day after a deadly twister ripped through an Oklahoma town.\n\nAs the storms raged on in the pre-dawn hours Wednesday, the National Weather Service in Pittsburgh warned that a tornado in northeastern Ohio could cross into Pennsylvania. Parts of West Virginia were also under a tornado warning.\n\nHancock County Schools in West Virginia closed schools Wednesday because of \"extensive overnight weather issues\" in the county.

Most of them would be without power until late Wednesday, city officials said.\n\nAt one point, about 50 people were trapped inside the FedEx facility because of downed power lines. But company spokesperson Shannon Davis said late Tuesday that \"all team members are safe and accounted for.\"\n\nMore than 30,000 customers were without power in Michigan early Wednesday, and an additional 10,000 in Ohio, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\n\"My heart goes out to all those impacted by tonight's severe weather in southwest Michigan,\" Whitmer said in a message on social media. \"State and local emergency teams are on the ground and working together to assist Michiganders.\"\n\nNational Weather Service crews were working Wednesday to survey storm damage in several counties in Michigan's southwest Lower Peninsula to determine whether tornadoes touched down in those areas, including the two reported Tuesday night in the city of Portage, said meteorologist Mike Sutton with the weather service's Grand Rapids office.\n\nHe said the Grand Rapids office had received a total of 11 reports of tornadoes from storm spotters, emergency managers and the public from late Tuesday afternoon into Tuesday night, but as of 8 a.m. Wednesday, it had not confirmed any tornado touchdowns.\n\nSutton said it could be a couple days before the storm surveys are completed and he stressed that some of the tornado reports could be duplicate reports passed along by people who saw the same storm.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"It's quite possible those are multiple reports from the same tornado. The actual number of tornadoes may be lower depending on what they find when they're out surveying,\" he said.\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nAcross the U.S., the entire week is looking stormy. The Midwest and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati -- cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nOn Monday night, a deadly twister in Oklahoma tore through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall. At least one person was killed and another was missing. Dozens of homes were destroyed.\n\nAerial videos showed homes reduced to piles of rubble and others with roofs torn off. The twister tossed vehicles, downed power lines and stripped limbs and bark from trees across the town. A 160-acre (65-hectare) wax manufacturing facility in the community also sustained heavy damage.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit Barnsdall in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles.\n\nAt the Hampton Inn in nearby Bartlesville, several splintered two-by-fours were driven into the building. Chunks of insulation, twisted metal and other debris were scattered over the lawn, and vehicles in the parking lot were heavily damaged, with blown-out windows.\n\nHotel guest Matthew Macedo said he was ushered into a laundry room to wait out the storm.\n\n\"When the impact occurred, it was incredibly sudden,\" he said.\n\nOklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, who toured the twister's damage Tuesday, said it was rated by weather researchers as a violent tornado with winds reaching up to 200 mph (322 kph). Stitt said he and legislative leaders have agreed to set aside $45 million in this year's budget to help storm-damaged communities.\n\nAreas in Oklahoma, including Sulphur and Holdenville, are still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month.\n\nMurphy reported from Oklahoma City.

Busy hub airports in Atlanta and Charlotte, North Carolina, reported delays. The National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center cited an \"enhanced risk\" for severe weather from Texas to South Carolina.\n\nThe storms continue a streak of torrential rains and tornadoes this week from the Plains to the Midwest and, now, the Southeast. At least four people have died since Monday. The weather comes on the heels of a stormy April in which the U.S. had 300 confirmed tornadoes, the second-most on record for the month and the most since 2011.\n\nNearly a quarter-million homes and businesses still lacked power Thursday in several Southern states after storms the night before, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nOne in Tennessee damaged homes, injured people, toppled power lines and trees, and killed a 22-year-old man in a car in Claiborne County, north of Knoxville, officials said. A second person was killed south of Nashville in Columbia, where officials said a likely tornado blew homes off their foundations.\n\nBob Booth had just gotten home to Columbia from Georgia and was sitting down to watch television when he heard a \"crazy racket.\"\n\n\"I get up and look out, and it was all hell breaking loose outside,\" Booth said. \"Then the top half of one of my trees goes down across the road.\"\n\nRetired pastor Walter Shell said he and his wife grabbed their two dogs and headed for the basement when his phone alerted him to a tornado.\n\n\"It missed where me and my wife were standing by about 4 inches. It went around,\" he said. \"It pays to pray, I can tell you.\"\n\nTorrential rains led to a flash flood emergency and water rescues northeast of Nashville, and the weather service issued a tornado emergency, its highest alert level, for nearby areas.\n\nA 10-year-old boy was seriously injured in Christiana, southeast of Nashville, when he got caught in a storm drain and swept under streets while playing with other children as adults cleared debris, his father, Rutherford County Schools Superintendent Jimmy Sullivan, posted on social media.\n\nThe boy, Asher, emerged in a drainage ditch and survived after being given CPR, \"but the damage is substantial,\" Sullivan posted on Facebook, asking for prayers. A vigil was planned for Thursday afternoon at the school district office.\n\n\"Asher needs a miracle,\" Sullivan wrote.\n\nSchools were closed Thursday in Rutherford and several other Tennessee counties. In Georgia, some districts north of Atlanta canceled in-person classes or delayed start times because of storm damage overnight that included fallen trees on houses and vehicles around Clarkesville. No injuries were reported there.\n\n\"We're just trying to clean up right now and wait for the next round,\" said Lynn Smith, director of the Habersham County Emergency Management Agency.\n\nA strong tornado damaged at least 20 homes in northern Alabama's DeKalb County and caused injuries but no deaths, officials said.\n\nIn North Carolina, a state of emergency was declared Wednesday night for Gaston County, west of Charlotte, after a storm that toppled power lines and trees, including one that landed on a car. One person in the car was killed, and another was taken to a hospital, officials said.\n\nThe storms followed heavy rain, strong winds, hail and tornadoes in parts of the central U.S. on Monday, including a twister that ripped through an Oklahoma town and killed one person. On Tuesday, the Midwest took the brunt of the bad weather. Tornadoes touched down in parts of Michigan, Ohio and Indiana, according to the weather service.\n\nMichigan's Kalamazoo area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart, with downed power lines trapping about 50 people.\n\nTornadoes were also confirmed near Pittsburgh, in central Arkansas and in northern West Virginia. The West Virginia twister was at least the 11th tornado this year in the state, which sees two tornadoes in an average year.\n\nAssociated Press journalists around the country contributed to this report, including Travis Loller, Jeff Amy, Joey Cappelletti, Ed White, Sarah Brumfield, Adrian Sainz and John Raby.", "source": {"uri": "time.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "TIME"}, "authors": [],

No was was hurt in the collapse, the company told USA TODAY in a statement. Nearby, a tornado hit a mobile home community, injuring 16 to 20 people who were hospitalized with non life-threatening injuries.

A boy swept into a drain fights for his life", "body": "By KRISTIN M. HALL and GEORGE WALKER IV - Associated Press\n\nCOLUMBIA, Tenn. (AP) -- Dangerous storms crashed over parts of the South on Thursday even as the region cleaned up from earlier severe weather that spawned tornadoes, killed at least three people, and gravely injured a boy who was swept into a storm drain as he played in a flooded street.\n\nA heavy line of storms swept into Atlanta near the end of the morning rush hour. Busy hub airports in Atlanta and Charlotte, North Carolina, reported delays. The National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center cited an \"enhanced risk\" for severe weather from Texas to South Carolina.\n\nThe storms continue a streak of torrential rains and tornadoes this week from the Plains to the Midwest and, now, the Southeast. Since Monday, 39 states have been under threat of severe weather and at least four people have died. On Wednesday, 98 million people were under some sort of severe weather risk, said Evan Bentley, a Storm Prediction Center forecaster.\n\nThe weather comes on the heels of a stormy April in which the U.S. had 300 confirmed tornadoes, the second-most on record for the month and the most since 2011.\n\nMore than 170,000 homes and businesses still lacked power Thursday afternoon in several Southern states after storms the night before, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nOne in Tennessee damaged homes, injured people, toppled power lines and trees, and killed a 22-year-old man in a car in Claiborne County, north of Knoxville, officials said. A second person was killed south of Nashville in Columbia, the seat of Maury County, where officials said a tornado damaged or destroyed more than 140 homes.\n\nBob Booth had just gotten home to Columbia from Georgia and was sitting down to watch television when he heard a \"crazy racket.\"\n\n\"I get up and look out, and it was all hell breaking loose outside,\" Booth said. \"Then the top half of one of my trees goes down across the road.\"\n\nRetired pastor Walter Shell said he and his wife grabbed their two dogs and headed for the basement when his phone alerted him to a tornado.\n\n\"It missed where me and my wife were standing by about 4 inches. It went around,\" he said. \"It pays to pray, I can tell you.\"\n\nTorrential rains led to a flash flood emergency and water rescues northeast of Nashville, and the weather service issued a tornado emergency, its highest alert level, for nearby areas.\n\nA 10-year-old boy was seriously injured in Christiana, southeast of Nashville, when he got caught in a storm drain and swept under streets while playing with other children as adults cleared debris, his father, Rutherford County Schools Superintendent Jimmy Sullivan, posted on social media.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nThe boy, Asher, emerged in a drainage ditch and survived after being given CPR, \"but the damage is substantial,\" Sullivan posted on Facebook, asking for prayers. A vigil was planned for Thursday afternoon at the school district office.\n\n\"Asher needs a miracle,\" Sullivan wrote.\n\nSchools were closed Thursday in Rutherford and several other Tennessee counties. In Georgia, some districts north of Atlanta canceled in-person classes or delayed start times because of storm damage overnight that included fallen trees on houses and vehicles around Clarkesville. No injuries were reported there.\n\n\"We're just trying to clean up right now and wait for the next round,\" said Lynn Smith, director of the Habersham County Emergency Management Agency.\n\nA strong tornado damaged at least 20 homes in northern Alabama's DeKalb County and caused injuries but no deaths, officials said.\n\nIn North Carolina, a state of emergency was declared Wednesday night for Gaston County, west of Charlotte, after a storm that toppled power lines and trees, including one that landed on a car. One person in the car was killed, and another was taken to a hospital, officials said.\n\nThe storms followed heavy rain, strong winds, hail and tornadoes in parts of the central U.S. on Monday, including a twister that ripped through an Oklahoma town and killed one person. On Tuesday, the Midwest took the brunt of the bad weather. Tornadoes touched down in parts of Michigan, Ohio and Indiana, according to the weather service.\n\nMichigan's Kalamazoo area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart, with downed power lines trapping about 50 people.\n\nTornadoes were also confirmed near Pittsburgh, in central Arkansas and in northern West Virginia. The West Virginia twister was at least the 11th tornado this year in the state, which sees two tornadoes in an average year.\n\nBoth the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nAssociated Press journalists around the country contributed to this report, including Travis Loller, Jeff Amy, Joey Cappelletti, Ed White, Sarah Brumfield, Adrian Sainz and John Raby.\n\nThe Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

(AP) -- Severe storms tore through the central and southeast U.S. late Tuesday and Wednesday, spawning damaging tornadoes, producing massive hail, and killing two people in Tennessee and one person in North Carolina.\n\nA storm that rumbled across northeastern Tennessee brought high winds that knocked down powerlines and trees. Claiborne County Sheriff Bob Brooks said a 22-year-old man was in a car struck by one of the trees.\n\nWednesday afternoon, a tornado emergency -- the weather service's highest alert level -- was issued for an area south of Nashville including the towns of Spring Hill, Chapel Hill and Eagleville.\n\nThe National Weather Service had previously reported a likely tornado on the ground in nearby Columbia, about 45 miles (72 kilometers) south of Nashville. People in Columbia were injured and homes were damaged, according to Lynn Thompson, assistant director of Maury County 911. Thompson told The Associated Press that he could not provide any further details: \"We're getting overloaded right now.\"\n\nPeople are also reading...

One died, another was in serious condition and three had injuries that were not life-threatening.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration issued a temporary ground stop at Nashville International Airport because of the weather, media outlets reported. Northeast of Nashville, a flash flood emergency was issued for Sumner and Robertson counties including the cities of Hendersonville and Gallatin. The National Weather Service said water rescues were ongoing in those areas and described the flooding from heavy thunderstorms as life-threatening.\n\n\"Do not attempt to travel unless you are fleeing an area subject to flooding or under an evacuation order,\" the weather agency alert said.\n\nIn North Carolina, a state of emergency was declared for Gaston County Wednesday evening following a large storm. First responders were working to clear roads of downed power lines and broken trees and were helping residents, officials said. The New Hope Fire Department responded to a tree down on a car. One person in the car was killed and another was taken to a hospital, officials said.\n\nMore than 135,000 customers had lost power in the state as of Wednesday evening, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nTornadoes were first reported after dark Tuesday in parts of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, according to the National Weather Service. The storms came a day after a deadly twister ripped through an Oklahoma town.\n\nThe National Weather Service confirmed tornadoes touched down Tuesday in western Ohio: five in Warren County and one each in Darke, Mercer and Auglaize counties. The weather service said crews are still surveying areas in other counties to determine if tornadoes struck there, as well.\n\nCrews on Wednesday were able to survey the damage caused by the strong storms that contained hail and heavy rains and knocked out power to thousands of utility customers.\n\nIn Michigan, weather service meteorologist Nathan Jeruzal said the tornadoes there touched down one each in Kalamazoo, Cass and Branch counties -- all in the southwestern part of the state. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\nKalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart and more than a dozen mobile homes were destroyed. About 50 people temporarily were trapped inside the damaged facility because of downed power lines.\n\nMore than a dozen homes were destroyed in a mobile home park in adjacent Pavilion Township and 16 people were injured, said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nSamantha Smith clutched a box Wednesday afternoon as she stepped from her mother's partially wrecked home in Pavilion Township, about 137 miles (220 kilometers) west of Detroit. Inside the box were her grandmother's ashes. Being able to recover the most cherished of items offered Smith a rare moment of relief amid the storm's devastation.\n\nHer parents and brother were injured during the storm but survived.\n\n\"I have thanked God probably a billion times since this happened yesterday,\" she said. \"My kids are healthy and good. We just gotta make back up what we lost.\"\n\nTravis Wycoff ventured out Tuesday night after seeing on radar that a tornado had touched down in the Portage area, and he said he helped an elderly couple out of their partially collapsed home and freed a service dog from a home.\n\n\"There were a lot of people running through the streets trying to find people and their pets,\" Wycoff said. \"It was just a lot of chaos.\"\n\nIn southern Indiana, the National Weather Service confirmed a tornado touched down early Wednesday, damaging homes in a subdivision north of the city of Sellersburg, located about 12 miles (19 kilometers) north of Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nThe Clark County Emergency Management Agency said the storm damaged 24 structures.\n\nCandice Holmes, a resident of the Lewis & Clark subdivision north of Sellersburg, said she, her husband and son sought shelter in their bathroom when they heard the approaching storm and \"the wind just picked up all at once.\"\n\n\"It was definitely a scary moment. ... And I'm glad we're alive,\" Holmes told WDRB-TV.\n\nTornadoes were also confirmed in Pennsylvania just outside Pittsburgh, in central Arkansas and in northern West Virginia. The West Virginia twister, which started early Wednesday in far eastern Ohio, was at least the 11th tornado this year in the state that sees two tornadoes in an average year.\n\nBaseball-sized hail was reported Wednesday in areas just southwest of St. Louis. Heavy downpours caused flash flooding and at least one water rescue near Sullivan, a town that was struck by a small tornado just two days earlier. Damaging hail also was reported in the Kansas City area.\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nAcross the U.S., the entire week is looking stormy. The Midwest and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, St. Louis, Cincinnati, Nashville and Memphis, Tennessee -- cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nCappelletti and White reported from Detroit. Associated Press journalists around the country contributed to this report, including Rio Yamat, Heather Hollingsworth, Colleen Slevin, Jim Salter, Kathy McCormack, Sarah Brumfield, Beatrice Dupuy, Alexa St. John, Adrian Sainz, John Raby and Lisa Baumann.\n\nThe Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

(AP) -- A wave of dangerous storms began washing over parts of the South early Thursday, a day after severe weather with damaging tornadoes and large hail killed at least three people in the region.\n\nA heavy line of storms swept into Atlanta near the end of the morning rush hour. Busy hub airports in Atlanta and Charlotte, North Carolina, reported delays Thursday morning. Tornado warnings were issued for parts of Tennessee and Alabama.\n\nThe storms continue a streak of torrential rains and tornadoes this week from the Plains to the Midwest and, now, the Southeast. At least four people have died since Monday. The weather comes on the heels of a stormy April in which the U.S. had 300 confirmed tornadoes, the second-most on record for the month and the most since 2011.\n\nStorms had already left more than a quarter-million customers without power Thursday in North Carolina, Tennessee, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama and Missouri, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nA storm Wednesday in northeastern Tennessee damaged homes, injured people, toppled power lines and trees, and killed a 22-year-old man in a car in Claiborne County, north of Knoxville, officials said. A second person was killed south of Nashville in Columbia, the Maury County seat, where officials said a tornado had likely touched down and homes were blown off their foundations.\n\nBob Booth had just gotten home to Columbia from Georgia and was sitting down to watch television when he heard a \"crazy racket.\"\n\n\"I get up and look out, and it was all hell breaking loose outside,\" Booth said. \"Then the top half of one of my trees goes down across the road.\"\n\nBooth said he was told it would be a while before his power was restored. One neighbor, he said, lost all trees except one that would have destroyed his house: \"So that guy is blessed.\"\n\nSchools were closed Thursday in several Tennessee counties. Some districts north of Atlanta canceled in-person classes or delayed start times because of storm damage overnight that included fallen trees on houses and vehicles around Clarkesville. No injuries were reported there.\n\n\"We're just trying to clean up right now and wait for the next round,\" said Lynn Smith, director of the Habersham County Emergency Management Agency.\n\nTorrential rains led to a flash flood emergency and water rescues northeast of Nashville. The Federal Aviation Administration issued a temporary ground stop at Nashville's main airport, and the weather service issued a tornado emergency, its highest alert level, for nearby areas.\n\nIn North Carolina, a state of emergency was declared Wednesday night for Gaston County, west of Charlotte, after a storm that toppled power lines and trees, including one that landed on a car. One person in the car was killed, and another was taken to a hospital, officials said.\n\nThe storms followed heavy rain, strong winds, hail and tornadoes in parts of the central U.S. on Monday, including a twister that ripped through an Oklahoma town and killed one person. On Tuesday, the Midwest took the brunt of the bad weather. Tornadoes touched down in parts of Michigan, Ohio and Indiana, according to the weather service.\n\nMichigan's Kalamazoo area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart, with downed power lines trapping about 50 people.\n\nTornadoes were also confirmed near Pittsburgh, in central Arkansas and in northern West Virginia. The West Virginia twister was at least the 11th tornado this year in the state, which sees two tornadoes in an average year.\n\nBoth the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.", "source": {"uri": "norfolkdailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "The Norfolk Daily News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "associated_press@norfolkdailynews.com", "name": "Associated Press", "type": "author", "isAgency": true}, {"uri": "kristin_m_hall@norfolkdailynews.com", "name": "Kristin M.

The West Virginia twister was at least the 11th tornado this year in the state, which sees two tornadoes in an average year.\n\nBoth the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nCappelletti and White reported from Detroit. Associated Press journalists around the country contributed to this report, including Jeff Amy, Joey Cappelletti, Ed White, Rio Yamat, Heather Hollingsworth, Colleen Slevin, Jim Salter, Kathy McCormack, Sarah Brumfield, Beatrice Dupuy, Alexa St. John, Adrian Sainz, John Raby and Lisa Baumann.", "source": {"uri": "stripes.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Stars and Stripes"}, "authors":

Tornadoes were first reported after dark Tuesday in parts of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio.\n\nMeanwhile, the first-ever tornado emergency in Michigan was issued Tuesday, one of many called across the country in recent weeks as severe weather tears through states in the Plains and Midwest. As massive storms barrel East, homes and property have been destroyed and thousands of people have gone without power.\n\nTornado emergencies differ from tornado watches and warnings. According to the National Weather Service, emergencies are far rarer and are issued when there's an imminent or ongoing severe threat to human life and catastrophic damage. Watches suggest tornadoes are possible and that people in the area should be prepared. Warnings mean a weather radar indicates a tornado is coming, or it's been seen already, and people in the area need to act.\n\nAP photos.", "source": {"uri": "whmi.com", "dataType": "news", "title":

Gretchen Whitmer assured residents that help was on the way.\n\nInjuries, emergency officials said, included at least 20 people who were taken to hospitals and destruction to 176 homes in Kalamazoo County alone, a FedEx facility, and damage to other buildings in Portage and in St. Joseph and Branch counties.\n\nBut no one, it appeared early Wednesday, had been killed.\n\nWhere tornadoes didn't touch down, the threat ended, in most places, by midnight.\n\nHomes flattened, power out\n\nIn western Michigan, first responders in the worst hit areas have been looking for residents whose whereabouts were not immediately known, but as the storms headed east, weather service officials said, they lost potency.\n\nThere was some storm damage in metro Detroit, the weather service in White Lake Township said, mostly along the shoreline of Lake St. Clair and in parts of Macomb County, but it was nowhere near the destruction Michiganders on the other side of the state faced.\n\nOn the state's west side, several homes seemed to have been flattened as if smashed from above, and buildings had parts torn apart, with twisted metal siding and missing rooftops.\n\n\"My heart goes out to all those affected by tonight's severe weather,\" Whitmer said around 8 p.m. Tuesday, as she declared a state of emergency for southwest Michigan. \"State and local emergency teams are on the ground and working together to assist Michiganders.\"\n\nIn Pavilion Estates Mobile Home Communityw, some of the manufactured homes -- which are especially vulnerable to destructive twisters -- looked in photographs as if they had been rolled over or picked up and tossed about.\n\nKalamazoo County, which includes Portage and the mobile home park, seemed to take the brunt of the destruction, with more tornadoes reportedly hitting Indiana and Ohio, which meteorologists said should be expected this time of year.\n\nIn a Tuesday night news conference, Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller said a tornado tore through the county, sweeping across the area from Texas Township, through Portage and into Pavilion Township, with \"significant damage\" to homes, including 15 or more that were \"totally destroyed.\"\n\nHe described a community filled with wreckage.\n\nHomes were in roadways and on top of other homes, as were trees, tree limbs and smashed vehicles.\n\nAt one point, Fuller said, more than 100 first responders were in the mobile home park treating people for injuries and going door-to-door accounting for residents and looking for anyone who might have been harmed or missing.\n\nAnd even as emergency workers were helping residents, another storm cell swept through the area.\n\nFuller, however, said he was relieved to learn that many of the residents were paying attention to the weather alerts and warnings, and as the night went on, the dire forecasts may have helped because there did not seem to be any life-threatening injuries.\n\nHe said the alarms and sirens worked.\n\n\"The good thing is we're hearing more and more,\" Fuller said, adding that first responders have \"done multiple searches to ascertain the information, but there was nobody in those homes that were hurt significantly. There are injuries.\"\n\nMore searches, he said Tuesday night, are necessary.\n\nThe Red Cross, Fuller added, was working to find shelter for residents who lost their homes, and wireless telephone companies were trying to set up temporary networks to allow families -- and anyone who might need help - to communicate.\n\nBy one count early Wednesday, an estimated 32,000 homes and businesses in Michigan were without power, as utilities, mainly Consumers Energy, which said it had about 24,000 customers without electricity, scrambled to secure and reconnect downed lines.\n\n\"Our Storm Response Teams are working around the clock to restore power as quickly as possible,\" Consumers said, urging people to report serious concerns to 911 and by calling the utility at 800-477-5050, to stay at least 25 feet away from downed power lines and \"keep children and pets away.\"", "source": {"uri": "freep.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Detroit Free Press"}, "authors": [], "concepts":

(AP) -- Severe storms tore through parts of the U.S. again Wednesday, spawning damaging tornadoes, producing massive hail, and killing two people in Tennessee and one person in North Carolina.\n\nA storm that rumbled across northeastern Tennessee brought high winds that knocked down powerlines and trees. Claiborne County Sheriff Bob Brooks said a 22-year-old man was in a car struck by one of the trees.\n\nWednesday afternoon, a tornado emergency -- the weather service's highest alert level -- was issued for an area south of Nashville including the towns of Spring Hill, Chapel Hill and Eagleville.\n\nThe National Weather Service had previously reported a likely tornado on the ground in nearby Columbia, about 45 miles (72 kilometers) south of Nashville. People in Columbia were injured and homes were damaged, according to Lynn Thompson, assistant director of Maury County 911.

One died, another was in serious condition and three had injuries that were not life-threatening.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration issued a temporary ground stop at Nashville International Airport because of the weather, media outlets reported. Northeast of Nashville, a flash flood emergency was issued for Sumner and Robertson counties including the cities of Hendersonville and Gallatin. The National Weather Service said water rescues were ongoing in those areas and described the flooding from heavy thunderstorms as life-threatening.\n\n\"Do not attempt to travel unless you are fleeing an area subject to flooding or under an evacuation order,\" the weather agency alert said.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Nashville on Wednesday evening issued a tornado watch for parts of Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri and Tennessee until 3 a.m. CDT. The weather service continued issuing tornado warnings into the night, mostly in Tennessee, but also in Missouri, Alabama, Georgia and Texas.\n\nIn North Carolina, a state of emergency was declared for Gaston County Wednesday evening following a large storm. First responders were working to clear roads of downed power lines and broken trees and were helping residents, officials said. The New Hope Fire Department responded to a tree down on a car. One person in the car was killed and another was taken to a hospital, officials said.\n\nMore than 135,000 customers had lost power in the state as of Wednesday evening, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nThe National Weather Service confirmed tornadoes touched down Tuesday in western Ohio: five in Warren County and one each in Darke, Mercer and Auglaize counties. The weather service said crews are still surveying areas in other counties to determine if tornadoes struck there, as well. The strong storms also brought hail and heavy rains to the state and knocked out power to thousands of utility customers.\n\nIn Michigan, weather service meteorologist Nathan Jeruzal said the tornadoes there touched down one each in Kalamazoo, Cass and Branch counties -- all in the southwestern part of the state. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\nKalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart and more than a dozen mobile homes were destroyed. About 50 people temporarily were trapped inside the damaged facility because of downed power lines.\n\nMore than a dozen homes were destroyed in a mobile home park in adjacent Pavilion Township and 16 people were injured, said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller.\n\nSamantha Smith clutched a box Wednesday afternoon as she stepped from her mother's partially wrecked home in Pavilion Township, about 137 miles (220 kilometers) west of Detroit. Inside the box were her grandmother's ashes. Being able to recover the most cherished of items offered Smith a rare moment of relief amid the storm's devastation. She said her parents and brother were injured during the storm but survived.\n\n\"I have thanked God probably a billion times since this happened yesterday,\" she said. \"My kids are healthy and good. We just gotta make back up what we lost.\"\n\nTravis Wycoff ventured out Tuesday night after seeing on radar that a tornado had touched down in the Portage area, and he said he helped an elderly couple out of their partially collapsed home and freed a service dog from a home.\n\n\"There were a lot of people running through the streets trying to find people and their pets,\" Wycoff said. \"It was just a lot of chaos.\"\n\nIn southern Indiana, the National Weather Service confirmed a tornado touched down early Wednesday. The Clark County Emergency Management Agency said the storm damaged 24 structures, including homes in a subdivision north of the city of Sellersburg, located about 12 miles (19 kilometers) north of Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nCandice Holmes, a resident of the Lewis & Clark subdivision north of Sellersburg, said she, her husband and son sought shelter in their bathroom when they heard the approaching storm and \"the wind just picked up all at once.\"\n\n\"It was definitely a scary moment. ... And I'm glad we're alive,\" Holmes told WDRB-TV.\n\nTornadoes were also confirmed in Pennsylvania just outside Pittsburgh, in central Arkansas and in northern West Virginia. The West Virginia twister was at least the 11th tornado this year in the state, which sees two tornadoes in an average year.\n\nBaseball-sized hail was reported Wednesday in areas just southwest of St. Louis. Heavy downpours caused flash flooding and at least one water rescue near Sullivan, a town that was struck by a small tornado just two days earlier. Damaging hail also was reported in the Kansas City area.\n\nOn Monday, parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and tornadoes, including a deadly twister that ripped through an Oklahoma town. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nAcross the U.S., the entire week is looking stormy. The Midwest and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, St. Louis, Cincinnati, Nashville and Memphis, Tennessee -- cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nCappelletti and White reported from Detroit.

Busy hub airports in Georgia and North Carolina reported delays. Tornado warnings were issued in the morning for parts of Tennessee and Alabama. The storms continue a streak of torrential rains and tornadoes this week from the Plains to the Midwest and, now, the Southeast. At least four people have died since Monday.\n\nThe weather comes on the heels of a stormy April in which the U.S. had 300 confirmed tornadoes, the second-most on record for the month and the most since 2011.\n\nStorms had already left more than a quarter-million customers without power Thursday in North Carolina, Tennessee, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama and Missouri, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nA storm Wednesday in northeastern Tennessee damaged homes, injured people, toppled power lines and trees, and killed a 22-year-old man in a car in Claiborne County, north of Knoxville, officials said. A second person was killed south of Nashville in Columbia, the Maury County seat, where officials said a tornado had likely touched down and homes were blown off their foundations.\n\nBob Booth had just gotten home to Columbia from Georgia and was sitting down to watch television when he heard a \"crazy racket.\"\n\n\"I get up and look out, and it was all hell breaking loose outside,\" Booth said. \"Then the top half of one of my trees goes down across the road.\"\n\nBooth said he was told it would be a while before his power was restored. One neighbour, he said, lost all trees except one that would have destroyed his house: \"So that guy is blessed.\"\n\nSchools were closed Thursday in several Tennessee counties. Some districts north of Atlanta cancelled in-person classes or delayed start times because of storm damage overnight that included fallen trees on houses and vehicles around Clarkesville. No injuries were reported there.\n\n\"We're just trying to clean up right now and wait for the next round,\" said Lynn Smith, director of the Habersham County Emergency Management Agency.\n\nTorrential rains led to a flash flood emergency and water rescues northeast of Nashville. The Federal Aviation Administration issued a temporary ground stop at Nashville's main airport, and the weather service issued a tornado emergency, its highest alert level, for nearby areas.\n\nIn North Carolina, a state of emergency was declared Wednesday night for Gaston County, west of Charlotte, after a storm that toppled power lines and trees, including one that landed on a car. One person in the car was killed, and another was taken to a hospital, officials said.\n\nThe storms followed heavy rain, strong winds, hail and tornadoes in parts of the central U.S. on Monday, including a twister that ripped through an Oklahoma town and killed one person. On Tuesday, the Midwest took the brunt of the bad weather. Tornadoes touched down in parts of Michigan, Ohio and Indiana, according to the weather service.\n\nMichigan's Kalamazoo area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart, with downed power lines trapping about 50 people.\n\nTornadoes were also confirmed near Pittsburgh, in central Arkansas and in northern West Virginia. The West Virginia twister was at least the 11th tornado this year in the state, which sees two tornadoes in an average year.\n\nBoth the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nCappelletti and White reported from Detroit. Associated Press journalists around the country contributed to this report, including Jeff Amy, Joey Cappelletti, Ed White, Rio Yamat, Heather Hollingsworth, Colleen Slevin, Jim Salter, Kathy McCormack, Sarah Brumfield, Beatrice Dupuy, Alexa St. John, Adrian Sainz, John Raby and Lisa Baumann.\n\nThe Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

(AP) -- A wave of dangerous storms began washing over parts of the South early Thursday, a day after severe weather with damaging tornadoes and large hail killed at least three people in the region.\n\nA heavy line of storms swept into Atlanta near the end of the morning rush hour. Busy hub airports in Atlanta and Charlotte, North Carolina, reported delays Thursday morning. Tornado warnings were issued for parts of Tennessee and Alabama.\n\nThe storms continue a streak of torrential rains and tornadoes this week from the Plains to the Midwest and, now, the Southeast. At least four people have died since Monday. The weather comes on the heels of a stormy April in which the U.S. had 300 confirmed tornadoes, the second-most on record for the month and the most since 2011.\n\nStorms had already left more than a quarter-million customers without power Thursday in North Carolina, Tennessee, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama and Missouri, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nA storm Wednesday in northeastern Tennessee damaged homes, injured people, toppled power lines and trees, and killed a 22-year-old man in a car in Claiborne County, north of Knoxville, officials said. A second person was killed south of Nashville in Columbia, the Maury County seat, where officials said a tornado had likely touched down and homes were blown off their foundations.\n\nBob Booth had just gotten home to Columbia from Georgia and was sitting down to watch television when he heard a \"crazy racket.\"\n\n\"I get up and look out, and it was all hell breaking loose outside,\" Booth said. \"Then the top half of one of my trees goes down across the road.\"\n\nBooth said he was told it would be a while before his power was restored. One neighbor, he said, lost all trees except one that would have destroyed his house: \"So that guy is blessed.\"\n\nSchools were closed Thursday in several Tennessee counties. Some districts north of Atlanta canceled in-person classes or delayed start times because of storm damage overnight that included fallen trees on houses and vehicles around Clarkesville. No injuries were reported there.\n\n\"We're just trying to clean up right now and wait for the next round,\" said Lynn Smith, director of the Habersham County Emergency Management Agency.\n\nTorrential rains led to a flash flood emergency and water rescues northeast of Nashville. The Federal Aviation Administration issued a temporary ground stop at Nashville's main airport, and the weather service issued a tornado emergency, its highest alert level, for nearby areas.\n\nIn North Carolina, a state of emergency was declared Wednesday night for Gaston County, west of Charlotte, after a storm that toppled power lines and trees, including one that landed on a car. One person in the car was killed, and another was taken to a hospital, officials said.\n\nThe storms followed heavy rain, strong winds, hail and tornadoes in parts of the central U.S. on Monday, including a twister that ripped through an Oklahoma town and killed one person. On Tuesday, the Midwest took the brunt of the bad weather. Tornadoes touched down in parts of Michigan, Ohio and Indiana, according to the weather service.\n\nMichigan's Kalamazoo area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart, with downed power lines trapping about 50 people.\n\nTornadoes were also confirmed near Pittsburgh, in central Arkansas and in northern West Virginia. The West Virginia twister was at least the 11th tornado this year in the state, which sees two tornadoes in an average year.\n\nBoth the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nCappelletti and White reported from Detroit. Associated Press journalists around the country contributed to this report, including Jeff Amy, Joey Cappelletti, Ed White, Rio Yamat, Heather Hollingsworth, Colleen Slevin, Jim Salter, Kathy McCormack, Sarah Brumfield, Beatrice Dupuy, Alexa St. John, Adrian Sainz, John Raby and Lisa Baumann.\n\nThe Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

(AP) -- Three tornadoes have been confirmed in Michigan as severe storms barreled through the central U.S. early Wednesday, killing one man in Tennessee when a tree toppled onto a vehicle he was in.\n\nThe storm that rumbled across northeastern Tennessee brought high winds that knocked down powerlines and trees. Claiborne County Sheriff Bob Brooks said a 22-year-old man was in a car struck by one of the trees.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber? Sign in You are logged in Switch accounts\n\nNational Weather Service meteorologist Nathan Jeruzal said the tornadoes in Michigan touched down one each in Kalamazoo, Cass and Branch counties -- all in the southwestern part of the state.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nKalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart and more than a dozen mobile homes were destroyed.\n\nTornadoes were first reported after dark Tuesday in parts of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, while portions of Illinois, Kentucky and Missouri were also under a tornado watch, according to the National Weather Service. The storms came a day after a deadly twister ripped through an Oklahoma town.\n\nSamantha Smith clutched a box Wednesday afternoon as she stepped from her mother's partially wrecked home in Michigan's Pavilion Township, about 137 miles (220 kilometers) west of Detroit. Inside the box were her grandmother's ashes. Being able to recover the most cherished of items offered Smith a rare moment of relief amid the storm's devastation.\n\n\"Finding this box is the best thing that's happened to me these past 24 hours,\" she said. \"The main thing we were all worried about was my grandma's ashes.\"\n\nHer parents and brother were injured during the storm. Her brother suffered a broken pelvis and broken back, but he and other victims all survived, Smith added.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"I have thanked God probably a billion times since this happened yesterday,\" she said. \"My kids are healthy and good. We just gotta make back up what we lost.\"\n\nIn southern Indiana, the National Weather Service confirmed a tornado with a preliminary EF-0 rating and 85 mph (137 kph) winds touched down early Wednesday, damaging homes in a subdivision north of the city of Sellersburg, located about 12 miles (19 kilometers) north of Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nThe Clark County Emergency Management Agency said the storm damaged 24 structures.\n\nCandice Holmes, a resident of the Lewis & Clark subdivision north of Sellersburg, said she, her husband and son sought shelter in their bathroom when they heard the approaching storm and \"the wind just picked up all at once.\"\n\n\"My husband and my son stepped outside, opened the door and they slammed the door and ran back to the bathroom. And they held the bathroom door shut, as it came through,\" Holmes told WDRB-TV. \"It was over as soon as it started, but it was definitely a scary moment. And I'm glad we're alive.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nSurvey teams planned to head out Wednesday to determine whether tornadoes struck locations in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia, according to Jeff Craven, the meteorologist-in-charge in the weather service's Pittsburgh office.\n\nRadar indicated Hancock County, West Virginia, and in Jefferson County, Ohio, were hit by tornadoes, but teams will have to evaluate the damage to determine their rating, Craven said.\n\nHancock County Schools in West Virginia closed schools Wednesday because of \"extensive overnight weather issues\" in the county. News outlets reported damaged buildings and power outages.\n\nA National Weather Service team also was headed to Hot Springs, Arkansas, to survey damage and determine the strength of a tornado that hit early Wednesday morning, forecaster Tabitha Clarke said.\n\nThe tornado damaged some homes, uprooted trees and downed power lines. There were no immediate reports of injuries from the tornado, according to the state Division of Emergency Management.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nIn Portage, Michigan, about 50 people temporarily were trapped inside a damaged FedEx facility because of downed power lines. More than a dozen homes were destroyed in a mobile home park in adjacent Pavilion Township and 16 people were injured, said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller.\n\n\"We found homes in the roadway,\" Fuller said late Tuesday. \"We found homes in neighbors' homes. We found large trees in homes.\"\n\nPower was knocked out to more than 20,000 people.\n\n\"We're looking at homes throughout this community that are totally gone, they've been demolished,\" Fuller said in the light of day at Pavilion Estates mobile home park.\n\nA home where seven people were living \"is totally on its top,\" he said. \"They were able to self-rescue and get somewhere safe and came back today.\"\n\nTravis Wycoff ventured out Tuesday night after seeing on radar that a tornado had touched down in the Portage area. About five minutes later, he came upon the aftermath.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"There were a lot of people running through the streets trying to find people and their pets,\" Wycoff said. \"It was just a lot of chaos.\"\n\nWycoff said he helped an elderly couple out of their partially collapsed home and also freed a service dog from a home whose owner was at work.\n\nMore than 30,000 customers were without power in Michigan early Wednesday, and an additional 10,000 in Ohio, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nAcross the U.S., the entire week is looking stormy. The Midwest and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati -- cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nOn Monday night, a deadly twister in Oklahoma tore through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall. At least one person was killed and another was missing. Dozens of homes were destroyed.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit Barnsdall in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles.\n\nAreas in Oklahoma, including Sulphur and Holdenville, are still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month.\n\n___\n\nMurphy reported from Oklahoma City.

No was was hurt in the partial collapse, the company told USA TODAY in a statement. Nearby, a tornado hit a mobile home community, injuring 16 to 20 people who were hospitalized with non life-threatening injuries.

A vast swath of the central and eastern U.S., from Texas to Georgia and up through New England was at slight risk of experiencing some of the poor weather.\n\nFlood watches were in effect across Kentucky, Tennessee and Missouri through Thursday morning.

(AP) -- At least eight tornadoes have touched down in Ohio and three have been confirmed in Michigan as severe storms barreled through the central U.S. late Tuesday and early Wednesday, killing one man in Tennessee when a tree toppled onto a vehicle he was in.\n\nThe storm that rumbled across northeastern Tennessee brought high winds that knocked down powerlines and trees. Claiborne County Sheriff Bob Brooks said a 22-year-old man was in a car struck by one of the trees.\n\nThe National Weather Service says confirmed tornadoes touched down Tuesday in Ohio, including five in Warren County in the state's southwest region. The confirmations came Wednesday after crews were able to survey the damage caused by the strong storms that contained hail and heavy rains and knocked out power to thousands of utility customers.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Rivian receives $827M state incentive package to expand operations in Normal\n\nWeather service meteorologist in Michigan Nathan Jeruzal said the tornadoes there touched down one each in Kalamazoo, Cass and Branch counties -- all in the southwestern part of the state.\n\nKalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart and more than a dozen mobile homes were destroyed.\n\nTornadoes were first reported after dark Tuesday in parts of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, while portions of Illinois, Kentucky and Missouri were also under a tornado watch, according to the National Weather Service. The storms came a day after a deadly twister ripped through an Oklahoma town.\n\nSamantha Smith clutched a box Wednesday afternoon as she stepped from her mother's partially wrecked home in Michigan's Pavilion Township, about 137 miles (220 kilometers) west of Detroit. Inside the box were her grandmother's ashes. Being able to recover the most cherished of items offered Smith a rare moment of relief amid the storm's devastation.\n\n\"Finding this box is the best thing that's happened to me these past 24 hours,\" she said. \"The main thing we were all worried about was my grandma's ashes.\"\n\nHer parents and brother were injured during the storm. Her brother suffered a broken pelvis and broken back, but he and other victims all survived, Smith added.\n\n\"I have thanked God probably a billion times since this happened yesterday,\" she said. \"My kids are healthy and good. We just gotta make back up what we lost.\"\n\nIn southern Indiana, the National Weather Service confirmed a tornado with a preliminary EF-0 rating and 85 mph (137 kph) winds touched down early Wednesday, damaging homes in a subdivision north of the city of Sellersburg, located about 12 miles (19 kilometers) north of Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nThe Clark County Emergency Management Agency said the storm damaged 24 structures.\n\nCandice Holmes, a resident of the Lewis & Clark subdivision north of Sellersburg, said she, her husband and son sought shelter in their bathroom when they heard the approaching storm and \"the wind just picked up all at once.\"\n\n\"My husband and my son stepped outside, opened the door and they slammed the door and ran back to the bathroom. And they held the bathroom door shut, as it came through,\" Holmes told WDRB-TV. \"It was over as soon as it started, but it was definitely a scary moment. And I'm glad we're alive.\"\n\nIn addition to the five in Warren County, confirmed tornadoes in Ohio were in the western part of the state in Greenville in Darke County, west of Coldwater in Mercer County and west of New Knoxville in Auglaize County. The weather service says crews are still surveying areas of Franklin and Butler counties to determine if tornadoes struck there, as well.\n\nJust outside of Pittsburgh, a weather service team confirmed that a brief tornado with maximum winds of 105 mph (169 kph) overturned a trailer and snapped more than a dozen trees early Wednesday in Findlay Township, Pennsylvania.\n\nBaseball-sized hail was reported Wednesday in areas just southwest of St. Louis, Missouri. Heavy downpours caused flash flooding and at least one water rescue near Sullivan, a town that was struck by a small tornado just two days earlier, destroying a bar and damaging the high school. Damaging hail also was reported in the Kansas City area.\n\nRadar indicated Hancock County, West Virginia, and Jefferson County, Ohio, were hit by tornadoes, but teams will have to evaluate the damage to determine their rating, Craven said.\n\nHancock County Schools in West Virginia closed schools Wednesday because of \"extensive overnight weather issues\" in the county. News outlets reported damaged buildings and power outages.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nA National Weather Service team also was headed to Hot Springs, Arkansas, to survey damage and determine the strength of a tornado that hit early Wednesday morning, forecaster Tabitha Clarke said.\n\nThe tornado damaged some homes, uprooted trees and downed power lines. There were no immediate reports of injuries from the tornado, according to the state Division of Emergency Management.\n\nIn Portage, Michigan, about 50 people temporarily were trapped inside a damaged FedEx facility because of downed power lines. More than a dozen homes were destroyed in a mobile home park in adjacent Pavilion Township and 16 people were injured, said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller.\n\n\"We found homes in the roadway,\" Fuller said late Tuesday. \"We found homes in neighbors' homes. We found large trees in homes.\"\n\nPower was knocked out to more than 20,000 people.\n\n\"We're looking at homes throughout this community that are totally gone, they've been demolished,\" Fuller said in the light of day at Pavilion Estates mobile home park.\n\nA home where seven people were living \"is totally on its top,\" he said. \"They were able to self-rescue and get somewhere safe and came back today.\"\n\nTravis Wycoff ventured out Tuesday night after seeing on radar that a tornado had touched down in the Portage area. About five minutes later, he came upon the aftermath.\n\n\"There were a lot of people running through the streets trying to find people and their pets,\" Wycoff said. \"It was just a lot of chaos.\"\n\nWycoff said he helped an elderly couple out of their partially collapsed home and also freed a service dog from a home whose owner was at work.\n\nMore than 30,000 customers were without power in Michigan early Wednesday, and an additional 10,000 in Ohio, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nAcross the U.S., the entire week is looking stormy. The Midwest and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati -- cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nOn Monday night, a deadly twister in Oklahoma tore through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall. At least one person was killed and another was missing. Dozens of homes were destroyed.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit Barnsdall in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles.\n\nAreas in Oklahoma, including Sulphur and Holdenville, are still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month.\n\nMurphy reported from Oklahoma City.

(AP) -- Forecasters warned a wave of dangerous storms in the U.S. could wash over parts of the South early Thursday, a day after severe weather with damaging tornadoes and large hail killed at least three people in the region.\n\nThe storms continue a streak of torrential rains and tornadoes this week from the Plains to the Midwest and, now, the Southeast. At least four people have died since Monday. The weather comes on the heels of a stormy April in which the U.S. had 300 confirmed tornadoes, the second-most on record for the month and the most since 2011.\n\nThe National Weather Service issued tornado watches Thursday for parts of Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina and Tennessee. An enhanced risk of severe thunderstorms with very large hail was forecast for parts of eastern Texas.\n\nStorms left more than a quarter-million customers without power Thursday in North Carolina, Tennessee, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama and Missouri, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nA storm Wednesday in northeastern Tennessee damaged homes, injured people, toppled power lines and trees, and killed a 22-year-old man in a car in Claiborne County, north of Knoxville, officials said. A second person was killed south of Nashville in Columbia, where the weather service said a tornado had likely touched down.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration issued a temporary ground stop at Nashville's main airport, and the weather service issued a tornado emergency, its highest alert level, for nearby areas.\n\nThunderstorms with torrential rains led to a flash flood emergency and water rescues northeast of Nashville.\n\nIn North Carolina, a state of emergency was declared Wednesday night for Gaston County, west of Charlotte, after a storm that toppled power lines and trees, including one that landed on a car. One person in the car was killed, and another was taken to a hospital, officials said.\n\nThe storms followed heavy rain, strong winds, hail and tornadoes in parts of the central U.S. on Monday, including a twister that ripped through an Oklahoma town and killed one person. On Tuesday, the Midwest took the brunt of the bad weather. Tornadoes touched down in parts of Michigan, Ohio and Indiana, according to the weather service.\n\nMichigan's Kalamazoo area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart, with downed power lines trapping about 50 people.\n\nTornadoes were also confirmed near Pittsburgh, in central Arkansas and in northern West Virginia. The West Virginia twister was at least the 11th tornado this year in the state, which sees two tornadoes in an average year.\n\nCappelletti and White reported from Detroit.

Busy hub airports in Atlanta and Charlotte, North Carolina, reported delays Thursday morning. Tornado warnings were issued for parts of Tennessee and Alabama.\n\nThe storms continue a streak of torrential rains and tornadoes this week from the Plains to the Midwest and, now, the Southeast. At least four people have died since Monday. The weather comes on the heels of a stormy April in which the U.S. had 300 confirmed tornadoes, the second-most on record for the month and the most since 2011.\n\nStorms had already left more than a quarter-million customers without power Thursday in North Carolina, Tennessee, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama and Missouri, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nA storm Wednesday in northeastern Tennessee damaged homes, injured people, toppled power lines and trees, and killed a 22-year-old man in a car in Claiborne County, north of Knoxville, officials said. A second person was killed south of Nashville in Columbia, the Maury County seat, where officials said a tornado had likely touched down and homes were blown off their foundations.\n\nBob Booth had just gotten home to Columbia from Georgia and was sitting down to watch television when he heard a \"crazy racket.\"\n\n\"I get up and look out, and it was all hell breaking loose outside,\" Booth said. \"Then the top half of one of my trees goes down across the road.\"\n\nBooth said he was told it would be a while before his power was restored. One neighbor, he said, lost all trees except one that would have destroyed his house: \"So that guy is blessed.\"\n\nSchools were closed Thursday in several Tennessee counties. Some districts north of Atlanta canceled in-person classes or delayed start times because of storm damage overnight that included fallen trees on houses and vehicles around Clarkesville. No injuries were reported there.\n\n\"We're just trying to clean up right now and wait for the next round,\" said Lynn Smith, director of the Habersham County Emergency Management Agency.\n\nTorrential rains led to a flash flood emergency and water rescues northeast of Nashville. The Federal Aviation Administration issued a temporary ground stop at Nashville's main airport, and the weather service issued a tornado emergency, its highest alert level, for nearby areas.\n\nIn North Carolina, a state of emergency was declared Wednesday night for Gaston County, west of Charlotte, after a storm that toppled power lines and trees, including one that landed on a car. One person in the car was killed, and another was taken to a hospital, officials said.\n\nThe storms followed heavy rain, strong winds, hail and tornadoes in parts of the central U.S. on Monday, including a twister that ripped through an Oklahoma town and killed one person. On Tuesday, the Midwest took the brunt of the bad weather. Tornadoes touched down in parts of Michigan, Ohio and Indiana, according to the weather service.\n\nMichigan's Kalamazoo area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart, with downed power lines trapping about 50 people.\n\nTornadoes were also confirmed near Pittsburgh, in central Arkansas and in northern West Virginia. The West Virginia twister was at least the 11th tornado this year in the state, which sees two tornadoes in an average year.\n\nCappelletti and White reported from Detroit.

(AP) -- Three tornadoes have been confirmed in Michigan as severe storms barreled through the central U.S. early Wednesday, killing one man in Tennessee when a tree toppled onto a vehicle he was in.\n\nThe storm that rumbled across northeastern Tennessee brought high winds that knocked down powerlines and trees. Claiborne County Sheriff Bob Brooks said a 22-year-old man was in a car struck by one of the trees.\n\nNational Weather Service meteorologist Nathan Jeruzal said the tornadoes in Michigan touched down one each in Kalamazoo, Cass and Branch counties -- all in the southwestern part of the state.\n\nKalamazoo County's Portage area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart and more than a dozen mobile homes were destroyed.\n\nPeople are also reading...

The storms came a day after a deadly twister ripped through an Oklahoma town.\n\nSamantha Smith clutched a box Wednesday afternoon as she stepped from her mother's partially wrecked home in Michigan's Pavilion Township, about 137 miles (220 kilometers) west of Detroit. Inside the box were her grandmother's ashes. Being able to recover the most cherished of items offered Smith a rare moment of relief amid the storm's devastation.\n\n\"Finding this box is the best thing that's happened to me these past 24 hours,\" she said. \"The main thing we were all worried about was my grandma's ashes.\"\n\nHer parents and brother were injured during the storm. Her brother suffered a broken pelvis and broken back, but he and other victims all survived, Smith added.\n\n\"I have thanked God probably a billion times since this happened yesterday,\" she said. \"My kids are healthy and good. We just gotta make back up what we lost.\"\n\nIn southern Indiana, the National Weather Service confirmed a tornado with a preliminary EF-0 rating and 85 mph (137 kph) winds touched down early Wednesday, damaging homes in a subdivision north of the city of Sellersburg, located about 12 miles (19 kilometers) north of Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nThe Clark County Emergency Management Agency said the storm damaged 24 structures.\n\nCandice Holmes, a resident of the Lewis & Clark subdivision north of Sellersburg, said she, her husband and son sought shelter in their bathroom when they heard the approaching storm and \"the wind just picked up all at once.\"\n\n\"My husband and my son stepped outside, opened the door and they slammed the door and ran back to the bathroom. And they held the bathroom door shut, as it came through,\" Holmes told WDRB-TV. \"It was over as soon as it started, but it was definitely a scary moment. And I'm glad we're alive.\"\n\nSurvey teams planned to head out Wednesday to determine whether tornadoes struck locations in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia, according to Jeff Craven, the meteorologist-in-charge in the weather service's Pittsburgh office.\n\nRadar indicated Hancock County, West Virginia, and in Jefferson County, Ohio, were hit by tornadoes, but teams will have to evaluate the damage to determine their rating, Craven said.\n\nHancock County Schools in West Virginia closed schools Wednesday because of \"extensive overnight weather issues\" in the county. News outlets reported damaged buildings and power outages.\n\nA National Weather Service team also was headed to Hot Springs, Arkansas, to survey damage and determine the strength of a tornado that hit early Wednesday morning, forecaster Tabitha Clarke said.\n\nThe tornado damaged some homes, uprooted trees and downed power lines. There were no immediate reports of injuries from the tornado, according to the state Division of Emergency Management.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\nIn Portage, Michigan, about 50 people temporarily were trapped inside a damaged FedEx facility because of downed power lines. More than a dozen homes were destroyed in a mobile home park in adjacent Pavilion Township and 16 people were injured, said Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller.\n\n\"We found homes in the roadway,\" Fuller said late Tuesday. \"We found homes in neighbors' homes. We found large trees in homes.\"\n\nPower was knocked out to more than 20,000 people.\n\n\"We're looking at homes throughout this community that are totally gone, they've been demolished,\" Fuller said in the light of day at Pavilion Estates mobile home park.\n\nA home where seven people were living \"is totally on its top,\" he said. \"They were able to self-rescue and get somewhere safe and came back today.\"\n\nTravis Wycoff ventured out Tuesday night after seeing on radar that a tornado had touched down in the Portage area. About five minutes later, he came upon the aftermath.\n\n\"There were a lot of people running through the streets trying to find people and their pets,\" Wycoff said. \"It was just a lot of chaos.\"\n\nWycoff said he helped an elderly couple out of their partially collapsed home and also freed a service dog from a home whose owner was at work.\n\nMore than 30,000 customers were without power in Michigan early Wednesday, and an additional 10,000 in Ohio, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for four counties.\n\nTuesday's storms came a day after parts of the central United States were battered by heavy rain, strong winds, hail and twisters. Both the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nAcross the U.S., the entire week is looking stormy. The Midwest and the South are expected to get the brunt of the bad weather through the rest of the week, including in Indianapolis, Memphis, Nashville, St. Louis and Cincinnati -- cities where more than 21 million people live. It should be clear over the weekend.\n\nOn Monday night, a deadly twister in Oklahoma tore through the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall. At least one person was killed and another was missing. Dozens of homes were destroyed.\n\nIt was the second tornado to hit Barnsdall in five weeks -- a twister on April 1 with maximum wind speeds of 90 to 100 mph (145 to 161 kph) damaged homes and blew down trees and power poles.\n\nAreas in Oklahoma, including Sulphur and Holdenville, are still recovering from a tornado that killed four and left thousands without power late last month.\n\nMurphy reported from Oklahoma City.

People experienced severe weather a day after widespread storms tore through the Midwest and tornadoes swept through Michigan.\n\nOne person was killed after a tree fell on a vehicle in Claiborne County in northeast Tennessee as storms swept through the area around 10 am (local time), according to the county's office of emergency management. According to officials in North Carolina, there was one storm-related death in Gaston County. One person died in Maury County, Tennessee, on Wednesday after a \"large and destructive\" tornado was spotted near Springhill and the storm hit near Columbia, according to The New York Times report.\n\nRita Thompson, a spokeswoman for Maury Regional Health, a hospital in Columbia, confirmed the death. Pat Woodmansee, the assistant director of the county's emergency management agency, said that the storm left a trail of debris and people trapped in damaged homes. Rita Thompson said people were taken to hospital for treatment of injuries, that were not life-threatening and a fourth was in serious condition\n\nAs storms continued to sweep through the Midwest for third day and moved into the Eastern US on Wednesday evening, the National Weather Service issued tornado warnings in cities like Alabama, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky and Tennessee. The Weather Service issued a tornado warning in Williamson County in southern Illinois after a \"confirmed large and extremely dangerous tornado\" was spotted on Wednesday afternoon. On Wednesday evening, over 40,000 customers were without power in Tennessee, The New York Times reported, citing Poweroutage.us.\n\nA tornado was confirmed in Huntsville, Alabama, on Wednesday night. According to the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Centre, about 21 million people were under either an enhanced or moderate risk of severe weather -- the third and fourth levels of intensity, out of five on Wednesday, The New York Times reported. On Wednesday, the National Weather Service office in Nashville in a post on X stated, \"Don't let your guard down!\" It added, \"We're in the 'lull' right now before the main line tonight. Our environment is very unstable so any storm that develops ahead of the line this afternoon could turn strong to severe very fast.\"\n\nMore than 20 million people in Kentucky, Missouri, Oklahoma, Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Indiana and Texas were under a tornado watch on Wednesday night. The most intense storms were expected to hit a corridor in cities of Nashville and Clarksville, Tennessee. Meanwhile, about 17 million people from Texas to North Carolina, including the cities of Memphis, St.Louis and Little Rock, face an enhanced risk of severe weather.\n\nFlash flood warnings were issued for parts of Tennessee and Missouri after heavy rains. According to forecasters, flooding had already been reported in cities like Cole Camp and Lincoln in Missouri and could spread to small creeks, streams, highways and other low-lying areas. Over the past two days, nearly 50 tornadoes were reported from Oklahoma to Ohio, as severe storms wrought damage throughout the Midwest. The storms brought strong winds and caused power outages.\n\nAccording to officials, tornadoes damaged nearly 200 mobile homes and winds were so strong that they lifted some homes away in Kalamazoo, in southern Michigan. The authorities said at least 16 people were injured, The New York Times reported. About 50 workers were rescued from a FedEx depot centre in Kalamazoo County as they were trapped inside after a tornado wrecked the building. The authorities in Oklahoma said a tornado caused widespread destruction on Monday, killing one person in Barnsdall, and damaging up to 40 homes in the small town.

(AP) -- Forecasters warned a wave of dangerous storms in the U.S. could wash over parts of the South early Thursday, a day after severe weather with damaging tornadoes and large hail killed at least three people in the region.\n\nThe storms continue a streak of torrential rains and tornadoes this week from the Plains to the Midwest and, now, the Southeast. At least four people have died since Monday. The weather comes on the heels of a stormy April in which the U.S. had 300 confirmed tornadoes, the second-most on record for the month and the most since 2011.\n\nThe National Weather Service issued tornado watches Thursday for parts of Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina and Tennessee. An enhanced risk of severe thunderstorms with very large hail was forecast for parts of eastern Texas.\n\nStorms left more than a quarter-million customers without power Thursday in North Carolina, Tennessee, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama and Missouri, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nA storm Wednesday in northeastern Tennessee damaged homes, injured people, toppled power lines and trees, and killed a 22-year-old man in a car in Claiborne County, north of Knoxville, officials said. A second person was killed south of Nashville in Columbia, where the weather service said a tornado had likely touched down.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration issued a temporary ground stop at Nashville's main airport, and the weather service issued a tornado emergency, its highest alert level, for nearby areas.\n\nThunderstorms with torrential rains led to a flash flood emergency and water rescues northeast of Nashville.\n\nIn North Carolina, a state of emergency was declared Wednesday night for Gaston County, west of Charlotte, after a storm that toppled power lines and trees, including one that landed on a car. One person in the car was killed, and another was taken to a hospital, officials said.\n\nThe storms followed heavy rain, strong winds, hail and tornadoes in parts of the central U.S. on Monday, including a twister that ripped through an Oklahoma town and killed one person. On Tuesday, the Midwest took the brunt of the bad weather. Tornadoes touched down in parts of Michigan, Ohio and Indiana, according to the weather service.\n\nMichigan's Kalamazoo area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart, with downed power lines trapping about 50 people.\n\nTornadoes were also confirmed near Pittsburgh, in central Arkansas and in northern West Virginia. The West Virginia twister was at least the 11th tornado this year in the state, which sees two tornadoes in an average year.\n\nBoth the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nCappelletti and White reported from Detroit. Associated Press journalists around the country contributed to this report, including Rio Yamat, Heather Hollingsworth, Colleen Slevin, Jim Salter, Kathy McCormack, Sarah Brumfield, Beatrice Dupuy, Alexa St. John, Adrian Sainz, John Raby and Lisa Baumann.\n\nThe Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

(AP) -- A wave of dangerous storms began washing over parts of the South early Thursday, a day after severe weather with damaging tornadoes and large hail killed at least three people in the region.\n\nA heavy line of storms swept into Atlanta near the end of the morning rush hour. Busy hub airports in Atlanta and Charlotte, North Carolina, reported delays Thursday morning. Tornado warnings were issued for parts of Tennessee and Alabama.\n\nThe storms continue a streak of torrential rains and tornadoes this week from the Plains to the Midwest and, now, the Southeast. At least four people have died since Monday. The weather comes on the heels of a stormy April in which the U.S. had 300 confirmed tornadoes, the second-most on record for the month and the most since 2011.\n\nStorms had already left more than a quarter-million customers without power Thursday in North Carolina, Tennessee, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama and Missouri, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nA storm Wednesday in northeastern Tennessee damaged homes, injured people, toppled power lines and trees, and killed a 22-year-old man in a car in Claiborne County, north of Knoxville, officials said. A second person was killed south of Nashville in Columbia, the Maury County seat, where officials said a tornado had likely touched down and homes were blown off their foundations.\n\nBob Booth had just gotten home to Columbia from Georgia and was sitting down to watch television when he heard a \"crazy racket.\"\n\n\"I get up and look out, and it was all hell breaking loose outside,\" Booth said. \"Then the top half of one of my trees goes down across the road.\"\n\nBooth said he was told it would be a while before his power was restored. One neighbor, he said, lost all trees except one that would have destroyed his house: \"So that guy is blessed.\"\n\nSchools were closed Thursday in several Tennessee counties. Some districts north of Atlanta canceled in-person classes or delayed start times because of storm damage overnight that included fallen trees on houses and vehicles around Clarkesville. No injuries were reported there.\n\n\"We're just trying to clean up right now and wait for the next round,\" said Lynn Smith, director of the Habersham County Emergency Management Agency.\n\nTorrential rains led to a flash flood emergency and water rescues northeast of Nashville. The Federal Aviation Administration issued a temporary ground stop at Nashville's main airport, and the weather service issued a tornado emergency, its highest alert level, for nearby areas.\n\nIn North Carolina, a state of emergency was declared Wednesday night for Gaston County, west of Charlotte, after a storm that toppled power lines and trees, including one that landed on a car. One person in the car was killed, and another was taken to a hospital, officials said.\n\nThe storms followed heavy rain, strong winds, hail and tornadoes in parts of the central U.S. on Monday, including a twister that ripped through an Oklahoma town and killed one person. On Tuesday, the Midwest took the brunt of the bad weather. Tornadoes touched down in parts of Michigan, Ohio and Indiana, according to the weather service.\n\nMichigan's Kalamazoo area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart, with downed power lines trapping about 50 people.\n\nTornadoes were also confirmed near Pittsburgh, in central Arkansas and in northern West Virginia. The West Virginia twister was at least the 11th tornado this year in the state, which sees two tornadoes in an average year.\n\nBoth the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nCappelletti and White reported from Detroit. Associated Press journalists around the country contributed to this report, including Jeff Amy, Joey Cappelletti, Ed White, Rio Yamat, Heather Hollingsworth, Colleen Slevin, Jim Salter, Kathy McCormack, Sarah Brumfield, Beatrice Dupuy, Alexa St. John, Adrian Sainz, John Raby and Lisa Baumann.\n\nThe Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

One mobile home was flipped into the road and needed to be moved.\n\nAnother had fallen into different mobile home.\n\nFuller said injuries at the mobile home park likely were lessened because some residents were aware a likely tornado was headed their way. They took action to take cover or leave.\n\nFuller gave an update on the community's emergency response during a press conference late Tuesday.\n\nFive Kalamazoo Metro buses responded to Pavilion Estates to help shuttle residents out of the area, Fuller said. The American Red Cross is helping with temporary shelter.\n\nAt the FedEx building on Portage Road, there were reports of up to 50 people trapped inside the building at one point.

HALL and GEORGE WALKER IV - Associated Press\n\nCOLUMBIA, Tenn. (AP) -- A wave of dangerous storms began washing over parts of the South early Thursday, a day after severe weather with damaging tornadoes and large hail killed at least three people in the region.\n\nA heavy line of storms swept into Atlanta near the end of the morning rush hour. Busy hub airports in Atlanta and Charlotte, North Carolina, reported delays Thursday morning. Tornado warnings were issued for parts of Tennessee and Alabama.\n\nThe storms continue a streak of torrential rains and tornadoes this week from the Plains to the Midwest and, now, the Southeast. At least four people have died since Monday. The weather comes on the heels of a stormy April in which the U.S. had 300 confirmed tornadoes, the second-most on record for the month and the most since 2011.\n\nStorms had already left more than a quarter-million customers without power Thursday in North Carolina, Tennessee, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama and Missouri, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nA storm Wednesday in northeastern Tennessee damaged homes, injured people, toppled power lines and trees, and killed a 22-year-old man in a car in Claiborne County, north of Knoxville, officials said. A second person was killed south of Nashville in Columbia, the Maury County seat, where officials said a tornado had likely touched down and homes were blown off their foundations.\n\nBob Booth had just gotten home to Columbia from Georgia and was sitting down to watch television when he heard a \"crazy racket.\"\n\n\"I get up and look out, and it was all hell breaking loose outside,\" Booth said. \"Then the top half of one of my trees goes down across the road.\"\n\nBooth said he was told it would be a while before his power was restored. One neighbor, he said, lost all trees except one that would have destroyed his house: \"So that guy is blessed.\"\n\nSchools were closed Thursday in several Tennessee counties. Some districts north of Atlanta canceled in-person classes or delayed start times because of storm damage overnight that included fallen trees on houses and vehicles around Clarkesville. No injuries were reported there.\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts\n\n\"We're just trying to clean up right now and wait for the next round,\" said Lynn Smith, director of the Habersham County Emergency Management Agency.\n\nTorrential rains led to a flash flood emergency and water rescues northeast of Nashville. The Federal Aviation Administration issued a temporary ground stop at Nashville's main airport, and the weather service issued a tornado emergency, its highest alert level, for nearby areas.\n\nIn North Carolina, a state of emergency was declared Wednesday night for Gaston County, west of Charlotte, after a storm that toppled power lines and trees, including one that landed on a car. One person in the car was killed, and another was taken to a hospital, officials said.\n\nThe storms followed heavy rain, strong winds, hail and tornadoes in parts of the central U.S. on Monday, including a twister that ripped through an Oklahoma town and killed one person. On Tuesday, the Midwest took the brunt of the bad weather. Tornadoes touched down in parts of Michigan, Ohio and Indiana, according to the weather service.\n\nMichigan's Kalamazoo area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart, with downed power lines trapping about 50 people.\n\nTornadoes were also confirmed near Pittsburgh, in central Arkansas and in northern West Virginia. The West Virginia twister was at least the 11th tornado this year in the state, which sees two tornadoes in an average year.\n\nBoth the Plains and Midwest have been hammered by tornadoes this spring.\n\nCappelletti and White reported from Detroit.

The identities of the two were not immediately available.\n\nOfficials were still assessing damages late into Tuesday evening, but reported no fatalities.\n\nNick Armold, director of public safety for the city of Portage, said emergency personnel would work through Tuesday night to get a full accounting of residents and ensure no one is still trapped inside a home.\n\nMore: Tornadoes reported in west Michigan; multiple buildings in Portage damaged: Live updates\n\nJackie Knerr, a 30-year resident of the mobile home community, had just sat down at her dinner table to eat supper when the tornado hit.\n\n\"It sounded like a lot of debris hitting the house and I thought all the windows on the north side of my house would be damaged,\" Knerr said. \"Fortunately, I only have minor damage.\"\n\nHer neighbor, Larry Allgaier, was down the road at a nearby senior center playing pickleball when the tornado hit. He sheltered in place there.\n\nAllgaier's return home proved difficult as he navigated downed power lines, large trees blocking a main entrance to the community and ruptured natural gas lines.\n\n\"I was hoping for the best, but I had heard that the new FedEx building was hit badly and I knew that was only a mile from the trailer park,\" Allgaier said.\n\nSix doors down, Allgaier's neighbor's home was thrown 30 feet from its foundation and debris impaled a parked car.\n\nAs firefighters worked with utility workers to seal off the natural gas lines, community members began the long process of cleanup.\n\nTerry Zeiler, who lives six miles away, brought in heavy equipment from home and began working to clear roadways around the trailer park. Nobody had to ask him.\n\nSubscribe Now: For all the latest local developments, breaking news and high school sports content.\n\n\"It's just the right thing to do,\" Zeiler said. \"Growing up, we had a sense of community here. Everyone looked out for their neighbors and their community. I'm just doing my part.\"\n\nWhile many residents left the mobile home community to stay overnight with friends and family, others sought out one of two emergency shelters opened by the city of Portage.\n\nArmold, the public safety director, said the city is opening a hotline Wednesday morning for residents affected to ask questions about storm cleanup, utility concerns, etc. The number for the hotline was not available as of Tuesday evening.\n\n\"We're pretty fortunate that, as of right now, we have no reported serious injuries or fatalities,\" Armold said late Tuesday evening.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declared a state of emergency for several counties in Southwest Michigan following the storm. Kalamazoo, St. Joseph, Branch, and Cass counties were included, according to a release from the governor's office.\n\n-- Contact Reporter Corey Murray at cmurray@hillsdale.net or follow him on X, formerly Twitter: @cmurrayHDN.", "source": {"uri": "yahoo.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Yahoo"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavilion_Township,_Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Pavilion Township, Michigan"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tornado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portage_County,_Ohio", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Portage County, Ohio"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Portage County, Ohio"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramedic", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Paramedic"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile,_Alabama", "type": "loc", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Mobile, Alabama"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Mobile, Alabama"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickleball", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Pickleball"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_home", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Mobile home"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_park", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Trailer park"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FedEx", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "FedEx"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_gas", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Natural gas"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gretchen_Whitmer", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Gretchen Whitmer"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Joseph,_Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "St. Joseph, Michigan"}, "location": null}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Michigan", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "West Michigan"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_emergency", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "State of emergency"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_(United_States)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "County (United States)"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefighter", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Firefighter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter", "type": "org", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Twitter"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalamazoo,_Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Kalamazoo, Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kalamazoo, Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cass_County,_Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Cass County, Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Cass County, Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_school_(North_America)", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "High school (North America)"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle_Choices", "label": "dmoz/Society/Lifestyle Choices", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Death", "label": "dmoz/Society/Death", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Health/Mental_Health/Grief,_Loss_and_Bereavement", "label": "dmoz/Health/Mental Health/Grief, Loss and Bereavement", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Business", "label": "news/Business", "wgt": 63}], "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/hk06gCF5CeQJbj4ZA5Ld1A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD05MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/hillsdale-daily-news/b0e74b4e1b75543db2faaec80cecaf05", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548085", "eventUri": "eng-9548085", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.2156862745098039, "wgt": 140, "relevance": 1}

HALL and GEORGE WALKER IV (Associated Press)\n\nCOLUMBIA, Tenn. (AP) -- A wave of dangerous storms began washing over parts of the South early Thursday, a day after severe weather with damaging tornadoes and large hail killed at least three people in the region.\n\nA heavy line of storms swept into Atlanta near the end of the morning rush hour. Busy hub airports in Atlanta and Charlotte, North Carolina, reported delays Thursday morning. Tornado warnings were issued for parts of Tennessee and Alabama.\n\nThe storms continue a streak of torrential rains and tornadoes this week from the Plains to the Midwest and, now, the Southeast. At least four people have died since Monday. The weather comes on the heels of a stormy April in which the U.S. had 300 confirmed tornadoes, the second-most on record for the month and the most since 2011.\n\nStorms had already left more than a quarter-million customers without power Thursday in North Carolina, Tennessee, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama and Missouri, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nA storm Wednesday in northeastern Tennessee damaged homes, injured people, toppled power lines and trees, and killed a 22-year-old man in a car in Claiborne County, north of Knoxville, officials said. A second person was killed south of Nashville in Columbia, the Maury County seat, where officials said a tornado had likely touched down and homes were blown off their foundations.\n\nBob Booth had just gotten home to Columbia from Georgia and was sitting down to watch television when he heard a \"crazy racket.\"\n\n\"I get up and look out, and it was all hell breaking loose outside,\" Booth said. \"Then the top half of one of my trees goes down across the road.\"\n\nBooth said he was told it would be a while before his power was restored. One neighbor, he said, lost all trees except one that would have destroyed his house: \"So that guy is blessed.\"\n\nSchools were closed Thursday in several Tennessee counties. Some districts north of Atlanta canceled in-person classes or delayed start times because of storm damage overnight that included fallen trees on houses and vehicles around Clarkesville. No injuries were reported there.\n\n\"We're just trying to clean up right now and wait for the next round,\" said Lynn Smith, director of the Habersham County Emergency Management Agency.\n\nTorrential rains led to a flash flood emergency and water rescues northeast of Nashville. The Federal Aviation Administration issued a temporary ground stop at Nashville's main airport, and the weather service issued a tornado emergency, its highest alert level, for nearby areas.\n\nIn North Carolina, a state of emergency was declared Wednesday night for Gaston County, west of Charlotte, after a storm that toppled power lines and trees, including one that landed on a car. One person in the car was killed, and another was taken to a hospital, officials said.\n\nThe storms followed heavy rain, strong winds, hail and tornadoes in parts of the central U.S. on Monday, including a twister that ripped through an Oklahoma town and killed one person. On Tuesday, the Midwest took the brunt of the bad weather. Tornadoes touched down in parts of Michigan, Ohio and Indiana, according to the weather service.\n\nMichigan's Kalamazoo area was hard hit as a FedEx facility was ripped apart, with downed power lines trapping about 50 people.\n\nTornadoes were also confirmed near Pittsburgh, in central Arkansas and in northern West Virginia. The West Virginia twister was at least the 11th tornado this year in the state, which sees two tornadoes in an average year.\n\nCappelletti and White reported from Detroit. Associated Press journalists around the country contributed to this report, including Jeff Amy, Joey Cappelletti, Ed White, Rio Yamat, Heather Hollingsworth, Colleen Slevin, Jim Salter, Kathy McCormack, Sarah Brumfield, Beatrice Dupuy, Alexa St. John, Adrian Sainz, John Raby and Lisa Baumann.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Some of the heaviest damage was concentrated around Westnedge Avenue, Centre Avenue and Oakland Drive, according to Portage city officials.\n\nThe FedEx building at 6701 Portage Road sustained a direct hit from one of the reported tornadoes. The roof of the building caved in, leaving the interior exposed. After the storm passed, 50 employees were trapped inside as crews worked to remove dangerous wires so rescue efforts could commence. First responders eventually helped them all out of the building, Tuesday night.\n\nMORE: Trapped workers at FedEx building escape after reported tornado\n\nAnother spot with major damage was Pavilion Estates Mobile Home Park, 6830 East N Ave. in Pavilion Township, just east of Portage. About 17 of the homes were totally demolished and 173 had some degree of damage, according to the Kalamazoo County Sheriff's Office.\n\nSee the immediate aftermath of the storms in the 16 photos, below.\n\nDown the road from the FedEx building, the reported tornado decimated trees along Romence Road Parkway and Lovers Lane. The storm caused a gas main to rupture and downed multiple power lines.\n\nPavilion Estates, a mobile home park at 6830 East N. Ave., sustained significant damage. Multiple homes were destroyed.\n\nResidents evacuated Pavilion Estates and convened at a nearby gas station. They were transported to shelters set up for those displaced by the storm.\n\nFarm buildings near Pavilion Estates also sustained damage.\n\nSeveral homes on Lovers Lane and Romence Road sustained significant damage. Two homes almost leveled by fallen trees were both unoccupied at the time of the storm.\n\nJeff Heath, a resident on Lovers Lane, was in his home when the storm hit. A tree came through his roof, but he and his six cats didn't sustain serious injuries.\n\nHeath's neighbor was trapped in her home following the storms. Several trees had gone through her roof. Neighbors helped her get out of the house.\n\nSeveral cars were trapped on Romence Road Parkway by fallen trees as the storm came through.\n\nMany Portage-based businesses were affected by the storms. Several industrial locations were in the vicinity of the storm, including Stryker and Pfizer.\n\nCentre Avenue in Portage also sustained serious damage, as seen in this photo of a strip mall at Centre Avenue and Oakland Drive.\n\nFirst responders were on scene at Pavilion Estates shortly after impact.

The Kalamazoo County Sheriff's Office confirmed no fatalities from the suspected twin tornadoes that struck the Portage area.\n\nThe tornado resulted in non-severe injuries to up to 16 people at the Pavilion Estates mobile home community. Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller commended the local police and fire departments for their timely response and cooperation during the storm.\n\nAt the FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) building on Portage Road, it was reported that up to 50 people were trapped at one point. However, all individuals were successfully evacuated, and according to a FedEx statement, there were no serious injuries.\n\nFedEx also told Fox News that the company is working on contingency plans to 'lessen any potential impacts on service.'\n\nFuller lauded the inter-agency cooperation as a \"huge success\" in managing the emergency. The American Red Cross is currently providing temporary shelter for those affected.\n\nWhy It Matters: This incident underscores the importance of emergency preparedness and inter-agency cooperation in managing crises.\n\nThe successful evacuation of the FedEx employees, despite the partial building collapse, is a testament to the effectiveness of the emergency response system in place.\n\nThe quick response from local police and fire departments, coupled with the support from the American Red Cross, ensured the safety of those affected by the tornado.\n\nThis incident serves as a reminder of the potential dangers posed by severe weather conditions and the importance of having robust emergency response strategies in place.\n\nThis content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nRead Next: Elon Musk Says Robert De Niro Is 'So Out Of Touch, It's Insane' After Legendary Actor Compares Trump To H\n\nImage: Shutterstock", "source": {"uri": "uk.investing.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Investing.com UK"}, "authors": [], "concepts": [{"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FedEx", "type": "org", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "FedEx"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado", "type": "wiki", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Tornado"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portage,_Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 5, "label": {"eng": "Portage, Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Portage, Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalamazoo_County,_Michigan", "type": "loc", "score": 4, "label": {"eng": "Kalamazoo County, Michigan"}, "location": {"type": "place", "label": {"eng": "Kalamazoo County, Michigan"}, "country": {"type": "country", "label": {"eng": "United States"}}}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_department", "type": "wiki", "score": 3, "label": {"eng": "Fire department"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News", "type": "org", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Fox News"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "Sheriff"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Red_Cross", "type": "wiki", "score": 2, "label": {"eng": "American Red Cross"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_De_Niro", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Robert De Niro"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_weather", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Severe weather"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Elon Musk"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Artificial intelligence"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_management", "type": "wiki", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Emergency management"}}, {"uri": "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump", "type": "person", "score": 1, "label": {"eng": "Donald Trump"}}], "categories": [{"uri": "dmoz/Health/Public_Health_and_Safety/Emergency_Services", "label": "dmoz/Health/Public Health and Safety/Emergency Services", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "label": "dmoz/Society/Issues/Terrorism", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "label": "dmoz/Society/Crime/Theft", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "label": "dmoz/Home/Homeowners", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "dmoz/Home/Home_Improvement/Safety_and_Security", "label": "dmoz/Home/Home Improvement/Safety and Security", "wgt": 100}, {"uri": "news/Technology", "label": "news/Technology", "wgt": 52}], "image": "https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/LYNXMPEB59082_L.jpg", "originalArticle": null, "storyUri": "eng-9548085", "eventUri": "eng-9548085", "location": null, "extractedDates": null, "sentiment": -0.1215686274509804, "wgt": 133, "relevance": 1}

An EF1 tornado touched down by the Dowagiac Municipal Airport and moved northeast for nearly 12 miles. It lifted near the border of Cass and Van Buren counties about 27 minutes later. At its strongest, it had winds estimated at 95 mph. At its widest, it was 950 yards or nearly the length of eight football fields. Trees took the brunt of the damage.\n\nUnion City Tornado\n\nA brief EF1 touched down at 6:07 p.m. southwest of Union City in Branch County. It was on the ground for just one mile and one minute but destroyed a machine shed and reached winds of 95 mph.\n\nSt. Joseph and Branch Counties Tornado\n\nThe survey of a third and larger tornado was expected to continue into Thursday. Preliminary information from the National Weather Service indicates that it touched down in St. Joseph County and traveled into Branch County during the early evening. The agency said it would release the rating and path of the tornado after fully assessing the damage, but some of the damage was said to be consistent with a strong tornado.\n\nPortage Tornado\n\nA strong EF2, which packed winds as high as 135 mph, caused considerable damage in Portage. Meteorologists said it formed at 5:55 p.m. west of US-131 and traveled east-northeast for about 11 miles.

The storms also knocked out power and brought devastation to parts of Alabama and Georgia.\n\nA tornado touched down in Henagar, Ala., late Wednesday, injuring at least two people and trapping dozens of others in their homes about 40 miles east of Huntsville, according to CBS News.\n\nSeveral school districts northeast of Atlanta canceled classes Thursday due to storm damage, including reports of trees falling on houses.\n\nThe severe weather was expected to continue Thursday, with tornado watches in effect throughout vast portions of Alabama and Georgia, as well as parts of South Carolina.\n\nStorm systems have wreaked havoc across the Great Plains, Midwest and South all week. On Monday, a tornado killed one person in the 1,000-person town of Barnsdall, Okla. And on Tuesday, 50 people were temporarily trapped in a collapsed FedEx building in Portage, Mich. after storms rolled through that city.\n\nAt least one tornado has been recorded in the U.S. every day since April 25.", "source": {"uri": "nydailynews.com", "dataType": "news", "title": "Daily News"}, "authors": [{"uri": "joseph_wilkinson@nydailynews.com", "name": "Joseph Wilkinson", "type":

All occupants of that building are alive and accounted for, according to the company.\n\nElsewhere, multiple homes have been damaged in places like Fairhaven, West Virginia; Irondale, Ohio, Charloe, Ohio; and Garland County, Arkansas.\n\nThere is a Flood Warning for the Cincinnati, Ohio, area until 10 a.m. ET on Wednesday where up to 3 inches of rain fell, closing numerous roads in the area as law enforcement reports ongoing flooding.\n\nStorms are expected to continue Wednesday morning even though a Tornado Watch in parts of Arkansas, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi and Illinois is set to expire at 7 a.m. ET.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, a new batch of energy will kick off storms in mid-Missouri and St. Louis and there is a likelihood that Wednesday could be the third day of a multi-day tornado outbreak, the fourth such event in a just the span of a month.\n\nThe energy from this storm will likely create numerous severe thunderstorms over a widespread area throughout the afternoon and evening hours from Texas to the Ozarks to the Ohio River Valley to the Mid-Atlantic.\n\nThere is a moderate risk -- 4 out of 5 on the severe scale -- for an area from just east of Springfield, Missouri to Nashville, Tennessee with strong tornadoes possible there. They are also possible outside of this area with an enhanced risk of 3 out of 5, but this moderate risk is mainly for the increased risk for giant hail and destructive winds.\n\nThe moderate risk includes the city of Mayfield, Kentucky -- the site of the December 2021 deadly tornado with 57 deaths -- the deadliest since Joplin, Missouri in 2011. No other tornado has had as many deaths since 2021.\n\nMajor metros in the path of potentially damaging storms Wednesday include St. Louis, Cincinnati, Louisville, Nashville, Memphis, Springfield in

The ground stops were lifted by around 9:30 a.m.\n\nThe Storm Prediction Center upgraded the risk for much of the area late Tuesday morning. Much of the Chicago area was at a Level 2 risk and a 5% tornado risk, with Northwest Indiana at a Level 3 risk and a 10% tornado risk.\n\nABC7 meteorologist Larry Mowry said storms began flaring to the west and the south of the Chicago area by 12:30 p.m., moving northeast at 50 miles per hour.\n\nBetween 1:30 and 6 p.m. strong storms brought with them a threat of tornadoes. The highest tornado threat was to the southeast of the city, especially in Northwest Indiana.\n\nOn Chicago's Far South Side, the inbound lanes of I-57 at Parnell Avenue were blocked for a time by flooding, the Illinois Department of Transportation said. All lanes were back open by about 5 p.m.\n\nIllinois State Police said three cars were stuck in flooded waters at 99th Street on the same stretch of inbound I-57, but no other issues were reported.\n\nStorm damage reported in suburbs; barn collapses in Harvard, Ill.\n\nA storm tore through Chicago's southwest suburbs, dunking buckets of quarter sized hail over Palos Heights.\n\n\"I got skylights on the house and it was just cracking against the glass there. It was pretty loud,\" said Palos Heights resident Scott Allen.\n\nThe fast-moving storms left damage in their wake, especially from the heavy downpour of large hail. There were also reports of some road flooding in Joliet and in Orland Park, where Cook County officials said some roads were closed.\n\nMost storms lasted less than half an hour, sometimes even less than 10 minutes, as they raced through, but they brought intense downpours of large hail in areas like Palos Heights. The hail ripped down the leaves of newly-bloomed trees, and the strong winds in some cases knocked down branches.\n\nSome trees were uprooted, and backyard equipment like trampolines twisted and overturned, but more serious damage and power outages were not reported.\n\nIn McHenry County, near Harvard, Ill., the storms apparently caused a barn to collapse and knocked over a large tree at the roots. It was not known how many animals, who lived on the lower level of the two-story, century-old barn, were inside when it collapsed, but the way it did created a void on the lower level that allowed nearly all the animals inside to survive. Harvard fire officials said firefighters were able to rescue 24 sheep, 18 goats, one cow, and multiple chickens and ducks.\n\n\"Just debris on top of them. They found spaces within the collapse they were kind of hiding under,\" Harvard Fire Department Chief John Kimmel. \"Straight-line winds is what we're assuming, because there was debris several hundred yards away.\"\n\nFour animals were confirmed to have died in the collapse, and two more are unaccounted for. No human injuries were reported.\n\n\"It started hailing really hard. It got dark and within a minute it was gone,\" said neighbor Mary Stefely.\n\nThere were reports of inch to inch-and-a-half-sized hail in the south suburbs, which is roughly the size of a ping pong ball.\n\nStorm downs large tree in Porter, Indiana\n\nMeanwhile, as the power started to buzz back to life in Porter, Indiana on Tuesday evening, the spotty extent of the most severe damage became clear. The afternoon spring storm there was short and mighty.\n\n\"We're just getting ready to panic to go to the basement and it stopped so fast. But the damage had been done,\" said Porter resident Joanne Tubbs.\n\nIn the silence of the storm's wake, Tubbs cautiously emerged from her home, carefully turning the corner and surveying the lot. A towering tree, easily four stories tall, had collapsed, merely clipping the gutters and a fraction of the roof.\n\n\"When I looked out the window, I just saw this branch and then I come out and I see all this, and it kept going, and I could not believe it. It's scary,\" Tubbs said. \"God was so good. It went right between the house and the garage.\"\n\nThe combination of the rain-saturated ground and high-force winds were enough for the decades-old tangled tree root system to give way, taking a good 6-foot chunk with it and leaving a steep hole behind.\n\nTornadoes leave damage behind in Portage, Michigan\n\nAnd in Michigan, the rain and winds whipped violently as multiple tornadoes hit the Portage area on Tuesday.\n\nA FedEx shipping center sustained heavy damage, with much of the roof torn off, and part of the exterior wall collapsed. Emergency officials said an estimated 50 people were trapped inside.\n\nFedEx later told ABC News that all of their team members are safe and accounted for and no serious injuries were reported.\n\nElsewhere in that area, others were pinned in by downed power lines. Residents were left shaken by the damage, but the mayor of Portage said there were no injuries on Tuesday night.\n\n\"Listen, just, and don't think it won't happen here, but it can happen anywhere to anybody. In our community, they're all older people and they all stayed in their homes,\" one resident said.\n\nWith debris across the region, the Portage Department of Public Safety asked people to stay away.\n\nOne man expressed gratitude in the face of destruction.\n\n\"We're not in the position of these people here. Everything is gone. At least we can go in, take things out, wait for the insurance,\" he said.\n\nMore than 21,000 people in the Portage area lost their power.", "source": {"uri": "rsoe-edis.org", "dataType": "news",

Several residents told the Free Press they did their best to get to safety before coming out to assess the damage.\n\nCody Capp, whose home doesn't have a basement, took refuge in his bathtub.\n\nThe 27-year-old factory worker lives in a Portage neighborhood with fallen trees and power lines. He said he appreciated the swift community response to clear the neighborhood.\n\n\"After the storm was over, everybody came out here and worked together to clear everything,\" Capp said. \"It was really nice to see everybody out and helping each other.\"\n\nOn Wednesday evening, National Weather Service offices confirmed that three tornadoes touched down in Michigan. One was in Portage. A second touched down in Union City, in Branch County and Centerville, in St. Joseph County, said Senior Meteorologist Nathan Marsili.\n\nHe said a third touched down in Barrien and Cass counties.\n\nThere were no deaths or major injuries from the tornadoes, the Kalamazoo County Sheriff's Office said in a news conference Wednesday.\n\nThe severe weather knocked down trees and power lines in neighborhoods, over railroad tracks and at busy intersections, destroying local businesses and damaging homes and neighborhoods. Power outages caused significant traffic delays in Portage, with crews working to repair traffic signals at intersections.\n\nSome residents said power had returned by Wednesday morning, while others were still without power by midafternoon. Detroit Free Press reporters saw crews clearing debris from fallen trees and restoring power to traffic intersections Wednesday afternoon.\n\nMelissa Emmons, 58, lives in Portage with her husband and five Great Danes. Her home and yard had severe damage, with downed trees and power lines in their yard and driveway, and blocking the street in front of their home.\n\n\"We didn't have a whole lot of time to think about it,\" Emmons said. \"I was vacuuming, trying to keep an eye on the TV and then I see that it was confirmed touchdown headed toward I-94 so I freaked out a little bit.\"\n\nEmmons, who grew up abroad while her father served in the U.S. Air Force, said Tuesday's tornadoes were worse than living through earthquakes in Japan when she was young.\n\n\"I said, 'Wow, oh my God.' It looked like a war zone,\" Emmons said.\n\nSadpal Nimana owns a shopping center containing six businesses at the intersection of Centre Avenue and Oakland Drive in Portage. The structure is severely damaged, with the roof caved in over several stores, back walls gone and glass and debris scattered throughout the parking lot. Trees fell around nearby businesses and over a bus stop, the intersection's traffic light is out of power and signage for Nimana's strip and a nearby gas station are destroyed.\n\nThe shopping center will need to be demolished and rebuilt, Nimana said. The damage is a major loss to the community, leaving 35-40 employees out of work and residents without their local shops, he said.\n\n\"It was a livelihood for those businesses, convenience for some,\" Nimana said.\n\nNimana will now have to start over, drawing up architectural plans for a new structure, getting city approval and finding tenants. He also owns an automotive business strip mall nearby, which had less severe damage and will be repaired.\n\nJames Wilson, 74, of Portage, was at his property in South Haven watching news reports on television Tuesday evening and returned home Wednesday afternoon to assess the damage.\n\n\"All my trees are gone. I had a nice woods,\" Wilson said. \"It just devastated all of them and the neighbor's trees fell in my yard, that's what took out my barn, my 24-by-24 steel barn.\"", "source": {"uri": "freep.com",

(AP) -- Dangerous storms crashed over parts of the South on Thursday even as the region cleaned up from earlier severe weather that spawned apparent tornadoes, killed at least three people, and gravely injured a boy who was swept into a storm drain as he played in a flooded street.\n\nA heavy line of storms swept into Atlanta near the end of the morning rush hour. Busy hub airports in Atlanta and Charlotte, North Carolina, reported delays. The National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center cited an \"enhanced risk\" for severe weather from Texas to South Carolina.\n\nThe storms continue a streak of torrential rains and tornadoes this week from the Plains to the Midwest and now, the Southeast. At least four people have died since Monday. The weather comes on the heels of a stormy April in which the U.S. had 300 confirmed tornadoes, the second-most on record for the month and the most since 2011.\n\nNearly a quarter-million homes and businesses still lacked power Thursday in several Southern states after storms the night before, according to PowerOutage.us.\n\nOne in Tennessee damaged homes, injured people, toppled power lines and trees, and killed a 22-year-old man in a car in Claiborne County, north of Knoxville, officials said. A second person was killed south of Nashville in Columbia, where officials said a likely tornado blew homes off their foundations.\n\nBob Booth had just gotten home to Columbia from Georgia and was sitting down to watch television when he heard a \"crazy racket.\"\n\n\"I get up and look out, and it was all hell breaking loose outside,\" Booth said. \"Then the top half of one of my trees goes down across the road.\"\n\nRetired pastor Walter Shell said he and his wife grabbed their two dogs and headed for the basement when his phone alerted him to a tornado.\n\n\"It missed where me and my wife were standing by about 4 inches. It went around,\" he said. \"It pays to pray, I can tell you.\"\n\nTorrential rains led to a flash flood emergency and water rescues northeast of Nashville, and the weather service issued a tornado emergency, its highest alert level, for nearby areas.\n\nA 10-year-old boy was seriously injured in Christiana, southeast of Nashville, when he got caught in a storm drain and swept under streets while playing with other children as adults cleared debris, his father, Rutherford County Schools Superintendent Jimmy Sullivan, posted on social media.\n\nThe boy, Asher, emerged in a drainage ditch and survived after being given CPR, \"but the damage is substantial,\" Sullivan posted on Facebook, asking for prayers. A vigil was planned for Thursday afternoon at the school district office.\n\n\"Asher needs a miracle,\" Sullivan wrote.\n\nSchools were closed Thursday in Rutherford and several other Tennessee counties. In Georgia, some districts north of Atlanta canceled in-person classes or delayed start times because of storm damage overnight that included fallen trees on houses and vehicles around Clarkesville. No injuries were reported there.\n\n\"We're just trying to clean up right now and wait for the next round,\" said Lynn Smith, director of the Habersham County Emergency Management Agency.", "source":

They are also possible outside of this area with an enhanced risk of 3 out of 5, but this moderate risk is mainly for the increased risk for giant hail and destructive winds.\n\nThe moderate risk includes the city of Mayfield, Kentucky -- the site of the December 2021 deadly tornado with 57 deaths -- the deadliest since Joplin, Missouri in 2011. No other tornado has had as many deaths since 2021.\n\nMajor metros in the path of potentially damaging storms today include St. Louis, Cincinnati, Louisville, Nashville, Memphis, Springfield in

They watched as the house was ripped away from its basement. Neither she nor her friends who were hiding in the basement were injured.\n\nHer relative, A.J. Burns, said he, his wife and two children took cover in the bathroom of their finished basement. He said he held the door closed, felling it shaking and debris hitting it like shrapnel. He and his family are OK.\n\nTheir home, however, sustained serious damage, with the upper level mostly destroyed. Their fifth-wheel camper was flipped over and tossed into their garage.\n\nNext door, a couple was in their Dodge Durango as the storm moved through. They said it went quiet, as though the tornado had sucked up the sound. A tree snapped and their prefabricated home was toppled over onto its side. They were not hurt.\n\nOn Wednesday, they used a hole in the roof to go inside and see what they could salvage.\n\nThe National Weather Service issued a tornado emergency for Union City on Tuesday -- the first such alert ever in Michigan.\n\nThe storm left behind more damage in Portage, where another likely tornado ripped through.\n\nNo deaths have been reported as a result of the storm, though some people were injured.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Gov.
